1
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:08,148
(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:10,789
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

3
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,524
Don't act like you know me.

4
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,288
I don't want to see you again!

5
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,018
If anything happens to me,

6
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,809
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

7
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:20,079
He'll rot there for the rest of his life.

8
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:21,754
Mr. Baek Jun Ki?

9
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,414
Baek... Baek Jun Ki?

10
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,419
Logan is alive. Mom's just fine too.

11
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,118
I can't let it end like this.

12
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:30,464
I want to go back!

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,494
Why is this so special that everyone's fighting to keep this?

14
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,964
So that there's no more fighting, we must end this place too.

15
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:40,504
I'll erase all your bad memories, Mom.

16
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:43,274
The two must experience what living in torment is like.

17
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,104
I'm here for the money he borrowed from us.

18
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,012
I'm the chairwoman of Cheong A Group!

19
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,839
Did you know that Cheong A Constructions...

20
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:50,384
filed for bankruptcy?

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,479
Ms. Cheon!

22
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:53,078
Where should I take you?

23
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:55,979
Hera Palace.

24
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,178
Take me to Hera Palace in Samseong-dong.

25
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:01,749
(Episode 12)

26
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:05,719
Eun Byeol.

27
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:07,859
Where is she?

28
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:10,428
Eun Byeol.

29
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:12,898
Eun Byeol.

30
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,239
Eun Byeol.

31
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,909
There you are.

32
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,178
I've been looking everywhere for you.

33
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:25,478
Ms. Cheon.

34
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:26,779
We have no time to lose.

35
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,154
It's my inauguration ceremony today.

36
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:30,383
Our outfits are ready.

37
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,978
Come. We'll be late.

38
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:36,088
Ms. Cheon, let go of me. I'm not Eun Byeol.

39
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:39,389
Why won't you listen to me? Do as I say!

40
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,788
You're my daughter. You must attend the ceremony.

41
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,764
Everything I have will be yours. Come now.

42
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:46,599
Come! Hurry!

43
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,473
Listen to me!

44
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:49,833
- Ms. Cheon, why are you... - Come!

45
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,374
- Come, Eun Byeol. - I'm not Eun Byeol.

46
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,409
Hurry. Come.

47
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,243
Stop it, Seo Jin.

48
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,739
Why are you here?

49
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,514
Are you here to take Eun Byeol away from me?

50
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:04,279
You can't! I'll never let that happen!

51
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,754
What are you doing? She's not your daughter!

52
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:11,159
Yes, she is! You can't take her away!

53
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,163
Eun Byeol, come to your mom.

54
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,633
Ro Na, run, now!

55
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,263
No! Eun Byeol!

56
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,059
- Get it together, Seo Jin! - Eun Byeol!

57
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:23,328
Ro Na, are you okay?

58
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,038
Are you out of your mind? Where are you taking her?

59
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:27,809
She's my daughter!

60
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:29,339
Ro Na!

61
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,879
Mr. Ha, are you okay?

62
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,548
Eun Byeol!

63
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:42,488
We don't have time for this. Come with me now.

64
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:44,159
Why are you so stubborn?

65
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,723
- Eun Byeol! - Ms. Cheon.

66
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:47,189
Come with me.

67
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,959
Eun Byeol!

68
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,538
What happened here?

69
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,809
What a mess.

70
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:42,379
Ro Na! Dr. Ha!

71
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,882
Oh, my. Excuse me!

72
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:47,548
We need help! Quickly!

73
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:52,258
Hello? Some people got badly injured.

74
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:54,059
At the community room in Hera Palace.

75
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:57,399
Please come over right now.

76
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,748
I did it all by myself.

77
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:17,783
I don't have a family.

78
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:18,984
My mom is dead,

79
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:21,418
and it's been a while since I cut ties with my brother.

80
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,519
So just send me to prison.

81
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,819
Seok Kyung.

82
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,228
Why did you call them?

83
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,438
I have nothing to do with them. I don't know them.

84
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,244
I'm Seok Kyung's mom.

85
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:45,114
Mom? She's not my mom.

86
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,153
I'm not your daughter. We're strangers.

87
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,678
Give it a rest.

88
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,849
What is Seok Kyung doing here?

89
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,593
Your daughter helped the fugitive Joo Dan Tae...

90
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,349
flee to Japan.

91
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,564
She even took the boat with him...

92
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,159
and went to Japan. We've confirmed that.

93
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,659
Now, why don't you tell us the truth?

94
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,573
Were you really acting alone?

95
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:11,839
Where did you get the money to help him flee?

96
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,339
I have a lot of money.

97
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:17,579
My real mom left me quite a big inheritance.

98
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,114
This lady and my dad got divorced years ago,

99
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,653
and I lived with my dad.

100
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,649
He kept begging me, so I had to help him.

101
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:27,019
Is it a crime for a daughter to help her dad?

102
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,488
So, where in Japan did you send him?

103
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:32,889
I don't know.

104
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,494
I split after I saw him arrive in Japan.

105
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:36,864
Stop lying.

106
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:40,928
If you won't even believe me, why do you bother asking?

107
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,139
If you want to investigate properly, get rid of these people first.

108
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,409
Otherwise, I won't say a peep.

109
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,513
Do you think this is a game?

110
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,149
So just lock me up!

111
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:57,853
I helped my dad run away.

112
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,924
Why are you bringing in people who have nothing to do with it...

113
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,288
and humiliating me?

114
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,829
It's a mental hospital in Fukuoka.

115
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:11,829
I'm sure he's there.

116
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:15,033
Ask Interpol for cooperation and send Joo Dan Tae's description.

117
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,128
Yes, sir.

118
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,438
We may have more questions for you at a later time.

119
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,709
I understand.

120
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,009
- Get ready to travel. - Yes, sir.

121
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,883
- Get off. - Where are you going now?

122
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,453
Does running away like a child solve everything?

123
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,484
I said I'll take responsibility.

124
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,854
I said I'll go to jail for it. Why is everyone stopping me?

125
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,488
How did you know?

126
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,188
How did you know to go to Busan Port?

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,494
I heard Seok Hoon talk on the phone with you.

128
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,558
Are you saying you followed Mom?

129
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,564
Why did you go to Japan? Have you no fear?

130
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:48,899
I wanted to see it for myself.

131
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,868
I wanted to see Dad's demise.

132
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,474
The mental hospital was nicer than I expected.

133
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,343
I'll never see him again.

134
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:57,538
It was only right that I saw him off.

135
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,849
Don't worry about me. I'm legally his daughter,

136
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,554
so they can't punish me for helping him flee.

137
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:07,389
How could you go somewhere so dangerous alone?

138
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,453
Do you know how worried we were when you disappeared?

139
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,589
Why were you worried about a spoiled brat like me?

140
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,734
You know I'll survive no matter what because I take after Dad.

141
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,304
Must you talk like that?

142
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,829
I can't help it. This is who I am.

143
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:26,969
Have you eaten?

144
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,209
Let's go eat.

145
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,308
You've lost weight.

146
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,319
Just eat.

147
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,754
You need your energy...

148
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,188
to fight with me or hate me.

149
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:47,488
Here.

150
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,759
You want me to eat and get lost, right?

151
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,928
Fine. I'll eat then.

152
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,938
You were my daughter from the start.

153
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:11,319
There wasn't a moment when you and Seok Hoon weren't my kids.

154
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,449
It wasn't your fault that you grew up under Dan Tae,

155
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,349
unaware of anything.

156
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:20,488
No. It was my fault.

157
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,988
Seol A almost died because of me.

158
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,403
I was the one who set the van on fire.

159
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,599
I was the one who locked her in there and ran.

160
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,638
It's my fault that Ro Na's mom died too.

161
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:39,339
Someone like me isn't worthy of being your daughter.

162
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,278
I hate myself so much, it's driving me crazy.

163
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:45,648
How could I insist that I'm your daughter now?

164
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,819
So? Will you run away again?

165
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,158
Will you keep running away without repenting?

166
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,358
You did it.

167
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,204
It may hurt but face it. Don't avoid it.

168
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,069
That way, there will be a way back.

169
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:15,378
My daughter grew up a lot while I was away.

170
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:20,449
Let's go home. I fixed up your room nicely.

171
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:25,618
I was wrong.

172
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,459
I'm sorry, Mom.

173
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,799
I was so wrong.

174
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,768
I've missed you so much.

175
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,278
I missed you so much, I thought I was going to die.

176
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:54,349
(Jenny's mother)

177
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,018
Hello?

178
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,488
Why won't your mom pick up?

179
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:03,528
It's terrible. There was an accident at Hera Palace.

180
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,459
What do you mean,

181
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,429
there was an accident?

182
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,773
- How are the vitals? - They're weak.

183
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,878
We'll begin. Forceps.

184
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,214
The BP is dropping.

185
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:21,809
- It's dangerous. - We'll start right away.

186
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,628
- Hi. - What happened?

187
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,658
My gosh. Dr. Ha was badly injured.

188
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,104
It was that witch Seo Jin's fault.

189
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:44,569
His head is bleeding badly. He's in surgery now.

190
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:46,903
Why was Seo Jin at Hera Palace?

191
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:50,714
My point exactly. I think she has completely snapped.

192
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,714
She was calling Ro Na "Eun Byeol" and said she'd take her.

193
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:56,809
She caused a big scene, which resulted in this mess.

194
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,618
How's Ro Na?

195
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:00,449
Thankfully, she wasn't injured.

196
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:02,789
Where's Seo Jin?

197
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,998
Let go. I have to go see my mom.

198
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,199
She's out of surgery and is in recovery now.

199
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:20,569
The chandelier fell from the ceiling but she lucked out and survived.

200
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:23,368
Your mom is just incredible.

201
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,643
She's putting on an act...

202
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,153
because the company went under and she's cornered, isn't she?

203
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,648
She's faking being crazy.

204
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:31,484
- What? - Even still.

205
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,393
Mistaking Ro Na for her daughter? That was a bit much.

206
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,148
How could she make a mistake like that?

207
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:40,189
Or did something really happen to her brain?

208
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,488
Shut it! What do you know?

209
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,638
Wake up, Seo Jin. Wake up right now.

210
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,768
You can't fool me.

211
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,169
Wake up!

212
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,813
What are you doing?

213
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:01,378
My mom is sick right now.

214
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:03,954
Your mom is putting on an act.

215
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:07,378
She's about to lose everything, so she's pretending to be crazy.

216
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,118
Hey! Ms. Shim!

217
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,089
That's so cold.

218
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:18,403
Drop the act.

219
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,074
Do you think this will let you avoid being investigated?

220
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,569
Being mentally unstable won't work.

221
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:25,803
I said to stop!

222
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:29,108
My mom really is sick. Don't you see she's hurt?

223
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:31,513
I won't let anyone mistreat my mom.

224
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:35,209
I'm her guardian from now on. Get out of here right now!

225
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:37,824
Get rid of this woman.

226
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:41,754
And don't let anyone come into this room. No one!

227
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,248
You need to go.

228
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:44,618
Let go of me!

229
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,358
I'll walk out on my own.

230
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:50,289
Don't think it's over, Seo Jin.

231
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:54,128
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth and destroy you.

232
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:02,508
Mom. Are you okay?

233
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,878
What happened to you?

234
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:08,978
Who are you?

235
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:11,679
Mom.

236
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,618
Do you know me?

237
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:19,919
Where am I?

238
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:23,133
- Mom. - What is this?

239
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,658
Why are you doing this?

240
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:26,234
Mom!

241
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:29,998
Snap out of it, Mom. Stop playing with me.

242
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,104
Mom, stop it.

243
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,408
Mom...

244
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,549
- Who are you people? - Move!

245
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,789
Cheon Seo Jin!

246
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,523
No!

247
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:55,033
- Stop it! - Drop the act.

248
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,933
- No! - Get away!

249
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:59,898
- Those of you outside, get in here! - No! Stop it! Mom!

250
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,099
- Stop doing that to my mom! - Get away.

251
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,474
- Get away! - Drag her out here!

252
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:08,444
- No! Get away! - Hey.

253
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:11,079
- Get back! - Get her!

254
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:19,354
His vitals are dropping.

255
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,023
Up the norpin and get more blood.

256
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,118
Yes, doctor.

257
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,888
Thank goodness you weren't hurt more.

258
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:31,559
How is Mr. Ha doing?

259
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:33,459
He's in surgery.

260
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,299
He'll be okay, right?

261
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:39,374
He has to be okay.

262
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:40,669
Of course.

263
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,809
He'll get through the surgery and wake up.

264
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,209
Don't worry.

265
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,478
He got hurt instead of me.

266
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:51,748
Trying to save me.

267
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:55,648
What should I do?

268
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:05,358
If something were to happen to him, I won't be able to stand it.

269
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:09,429
I can't lose both Mom and him too.

270
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,969
I'd feel too guilty.

271
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:13,543
That won't happen.

272
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,508
Dr. Ha's a strong person.

273
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,638
He'll get through this.

274
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,179
(Intensive Care)

275
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,829
I think she's temporarily confused due to the accident.

276
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,898
They'll run some in-depth tests tomorrow.

277
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:46,039
What about my dad? Is he in bad shape?

278
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:48,069
The surgery's taking longer than expected.

279
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:51,638
He was hurt badly in the head. We'll hear more after the surgery.

280
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,108
It was my fault.

281
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:57,608
Both Mom and Dad, everything.

282
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,679
It was my fault.

283
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,364
How long will you stay here for?

284
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:09,028
Can you do this to someone who just got out of surgery?

285
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,959
Why? Are you hungry?

286
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,604
Come here.

287
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,829
You can join us for some Chinese.

288
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:18,604
What you're doing is called illegal collecting.

289
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,268
If I call the police, they'll take you all in!

290
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,778
Call the police, then.

291
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:27,809
Don't touch the girl.

292
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,813
Why come to us about Chairman Joo's debt?

293
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,778
Why is it us when he has two legitimate kids?

294
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:37,988
Cheon Seo Jin's his wife.

295
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,959
Who told her to be his guarantor?

296
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,799
Where's Joo Dan Tae? Where are you hiding him?

297
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:47,459
You little punk.

298
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,329
No, don't.

299
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:57,238
Unless Joo Dan Tae dies,

300
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,539
Cheon Seo Jin or her daughter...

301
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,249
will have to pay us back until the day they die.

302
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:05,378
Okay?

303
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,489
You can't get away from us.

304
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:15,458
So go and find Joo Dan Tae!

305
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:16,559
Don't!

306
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,928
Move!

307
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,458
Stop it!

308
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,533
Where's Joo Dan Tae?

309
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,499
Where is he, punk?

310
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:26,938
You have a pretty face.

311
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,968
You could be worth a lot.

312
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:32,408
Where do you want to go?

313
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,479
Where is he?

314
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:39,049
- My ear! - Get her off him.

315
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,118
Grab her!

316
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,789
Hey!

317
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,489
Maybe she's not crazy.

318
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,464
Will you all just get out?

319
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,404
Get out! Get out of here!

320
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,704
- Leave! - Where's our money?

321
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:55,934
I'll call the police!

322
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,634
- Get out! - Stop it!

323
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,968
Get out!

324
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,144
Get out! Leave!

325
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,739
Cheon Seo Jin! I'll be back for my money, okay?

326
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:08,309
It's okay, Mom.

327
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,279
Mom!

328
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,489
It's okay. Don't worry.

329
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:30,729
Mr. Baek, it's time for your psychological treatment.

330
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:56,658
Get him!

331
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:23,948
Get off me!

332
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:27,858
Let go of me.

333
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,188
Let go!

Find him. Where did he go?

336
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:35,858
Shim Su Ryeon, Logan Lee. This time I'll kill you for real.

337
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,803
Eat up, even if you don't want to.

338
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,373
Don't you lift a finger for a while.

339
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,668
I'll do everything for you.

340
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,004
Drink some water. Slow down or you'll get sick.

341
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,644
I'm not a patient.

342
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:50,414
How are you not a patient?

343
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:53,244
You fell down a staircase.

344
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:56,148
There's no medicine for shock, and I'm so worried.

345
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:01,853
I got your medicine.

346
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,654
What are you doing here? You're not welcome.

347
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,589
Ro Na's suffering already.

348
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:09,688
Do you hope to be let off by bringing her medicine?

349
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,863
Does that cancel out all you did?

350
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,198
Did I say that?

351
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,329
Neither you nor Ro Na will accept my apology.

352
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:18,873
You hate me and won't forgive me. I know that.

353
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,539
Then why bother coming here?

354
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,839
Did you come to stare at a sick person?

355
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,638
We don't need your apology, so get lost.

356
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:28,849
You evil brat.

357
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:31,309
Do it anyway.

358
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,618
Whether I accept it or not is up to me.

359
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,928
You should apologize. Until I accept it.

360
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,289
Apologize and ask for forgiveness.

361
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:49,299
Look back and think about what you did to my mom and me.

362
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:54,138
Think about what happens next after that.

363
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:09,089
Let's go.

364
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:15,229
Hello? Will you let me out?

365
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,059
You murderer.

366
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,234
How dare you come here so shamelessly?

367
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:25,204
- Joo Seok Kyung! - I don't believe you're not guilty.

368
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,198
You killed my mom.

369
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,408
(Go away, murderer.)

370
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,948
Get rid of a mudfish for me.

371
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:37,954
(Cheong A Group)

372
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:41,349
Do whatever it takes to make Ro Na ruin her exam.

373
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:43,918
Don't worry. Dad will sort it out for you.

374
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,734
- Ms. Kang. - Yes?

375
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,934
Can you take me to the hospital?

376
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:53,763
What for? Do you feel unwell?

377
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,729
I want to visit Dr. Ha.

378
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,168
I'll visit him every day.

379
00:22:58,174 --> 00:23:01,303
What's the point in doing that when he's not awake yet?

380
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:03,009
You're not well yourself.

381
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:06,809
Just in case. He might be able to hear.

382
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:11,479
If I do something, it might help him wake up sooner.

383
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:13,323
Yes. You're right.

384
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:14,749
Okay.

385
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:16,918
Watch your step. Take your time.

386
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,504
- Jenny, let's go. - Okay.

387
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:32,239
- Walk slowly. - Carefully.

388
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:37,039
Let's go.

389
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,118
The brain damage is worse than I thought.

390
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:55,559
It was a dangerous spot, so I couldn't do anything.

391
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,229
Is it possible that he won't wake up?

392
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,658
We must...

393
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,128
wait and see to find out.

394
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:14,108
After what she did to Dr. Ha,

395
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:16,678
Cheon Seo Jin asked for police protection.

396
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,418
The loan sharks were thrown out of the hospital this morning.

397
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:26,224
She's being protected when she should be punished.

398
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,319
It makes no sense.

399
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:31,829
Let's just release the last part of the dashcam footage.

400
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,499
I won't make the same mistake twice.

401
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,234
Cheon Seo Jin will use her weak condition...

402
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,198
to get away with her crime again.

403
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:43,569
I will send her to the fiery pit with my own hands.

404
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,013
We have a problem.

405
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:49,148
Joo Dan Tae escaped from the Japanese mental hospital.

406
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,509
What?

407
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,118
Okay.

408
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:00,658
What a persistent guy.

409
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,533
I gave him one last chance to repent until he dies,

410
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,158
and even that he lets go.

411
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,168
Joo Dan Tae will come back to Korea.

412
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,529
Then you may be put in danger.

413
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:13,898
That's something I must face.

414
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:16,968
If this game can end...

415
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,509
only when one of us dies,

416
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:21,339
I won't hide.

417
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,484
Since he has no money and no passport,

418
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,979
it will be hard for him to return to Korea all by himself.

419
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:28,849
Who do you think he'll call first?

420
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:41,599
Son.

421
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,698
Are you okay?

422
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,968
Where are you?

423
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,069
Do you have any idea how worried we've been?

424
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:51,839
Shim Su Ryeon locked me up in a mental hospital.

425
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,339
I barely escaped.

426
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,309
Mom did?

427
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,678
No way.

428
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:01,579
Are you hurt?

429
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,559
You didn't hear anything from your mom?

430
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:07,559
I heard Logan came back to life.

431
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:10,559
Do you really have no idea what those two scumbags...

432
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:12,128
are planning?

433
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,829
It's been a while since they met.

434
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:20,468
Mom is planning on going back to the US with Logan.

435
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,938
Darn it!

436
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,208
She does this to me, and then she wants to be happy on her own?

437
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:29,878
Seok Hoon, help me out.

438
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,118
I never killed Ro Na's mom.

439
00:26:34,654 --> 00:26:37,789
I saw with my own eyes Cheon Seo Jin pushing the car off the cliff.

440
00:26:38,323 --> 00:26:40,059
I'm innocent.

441
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:44,188
Unless you want to be the son of a murderer, you have to help me out.

442
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,259
I can only make things right if I make it back.

443
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:51,299
Seok Hoon, you have to trust me.

444
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,468
How can I help?

445
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:57,009
Help me get back to Korea.

446
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,239
I must get back to Hera Palace.

447
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,108
Even if I die, I'll die there.

448
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:03,009
In the castle I built with my own hands.

449
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,918
You're the only one I can ask for a favor.

450
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:09,254
I have a friend in Fukuoka.

451
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,194
I'll call him.

452
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,593
Go to Hakata now.

453
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:15,989
I'll prepare the money and fake passport as well.

454
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:19,698
Thank you, Seok Hoon. Really.

455
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:22,868
Come back safe first. Then we can think about what to do next.

456
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,898
I'll find a ship that leaves the earliest.

457
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:29,039
See you tomorrow at dawn at Busan Port.

458
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,408
Seok Hoon. I can...

459
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:35,249
trust you, right?

460
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:37,908
Of course.

461
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,479
I'm your only son.

462
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,888
Okay. Understood.

463
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,668
You were exactly right.

464
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,769
I'm sorry to ask you to do this, Seok Hoon.

465
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,678
I gave up on him a long time ago.

466
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,708
I feel no compassion or remorse.

467
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,708
If I could,

468
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,019
I want to end him with my hands.

469
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,523
You stay here. Let me do the rest.

470
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,319
No. I'm coming.

471
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,928
Dad will find out soon enough,

472
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:27,799
what it's like to be abandoned by your child.

473
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:33,039
As Joo Dan Tae escaped, the coastal security has been strengthened.

474
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,569
Police officers will be surrounding Busan Port.

475
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,839
We can't let the police take Joo Dan Tae.

476
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:40,108
We have to catch him first.

477
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:44,079
We must hurry if we want to make it to Busan Port.

478
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,445
(Ye Ji)

479
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:53,510
Hey!

480
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,861
Search the area. Now!

481
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,316
Joo Dan Tae must have known.

482
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,010
What a rat.

483
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:54,670
Joo Seok Hoon.

484
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,406
I knew I couldn't trust you.

485
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:59,971
You betray me and team up with Shim Su Ryeon?

486
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:41,651
I think he already escaped Busan Port.

487
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:43,520
He got on a fishing boat, that's for sure.

488
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:46,091
I checked the picture of him on that boat.

489
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,966
He must have escaped before the smuggling ship got here.

490
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:52,730
It did cross my mind, but I didn't know he would doubt you too.

491
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,365
Seok Hoon was just a way for him to come back to Korea.

492
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,760
If we just wait, he's probably going to get back at us.

493
00:31:58,806 --> 00:31:59,806
He'll try to use...

494
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,931
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung when he's in danger.

495
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,401
The kids shouldn't get hurt.

496
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,610
He's a master of crime and disguise.

497
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:10,710
If he really tries to hide, there is no way of finding him.

498
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,786
The police also have no idea where he is.

499
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:15,115
He said that he must come back to Hera Palace.

500
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:17,251
That even if he dies, he'd die there.

501
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:23,621
So he really wants to make Hera Palace his grave?

502
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:27,531
Then there's only one thing that we can do.

503
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,061
What is it?

504
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,101
Set a trap.

505
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:33,670
So that he can't hide anywhere on this planet.

506
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,740
So that he'll walk into his own grave.

507
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:39,015
Let the world know...

508
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:42,381
exactly how ugly and vicious this man Joo Dan Tae is.

509
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:47,985
This is breaking news.

510
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:49,286
We are met with shock...

511
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:52,455
as the past crimes of Joo Dan Tae, the CEO who killed Oh Yoon Hee,

512
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,055
continues to be revealed one by one.

513
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,096
Do you remember the gruesome shooting...

514
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:59,764
that killed the genius pianist based out of New York?

515
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:02,566
Would you believe it if we said...

516
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:05,505
that the murder was meticulously planned by a psychopath...

517
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,001
just so he could marry a woman?

518
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:10,305
As the murderer behind a 20-year-old case that almost went cold...

519
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:13,115
has been brought to the surface,

520
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,981
the man is now wanted nationwide.

521
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:18,381
Please take a good look at his face.

522
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:21,780
Joo Dan Tae. His real name is Baek Jun Ki.

523
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:24,755
The Korean-American real estate investor James Lee...

524
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,956
said today that he would reward anyone who reported the runaway...

525
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:30,266
with two million dollars.

526
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:32,735
- What a... - That's the highest amount ever.

527
00:33:32,735 --> 00:33:35,196
Joo Dan Tae allegedly blew up the car of...

528
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,136
- Darn it. - the CEO of Logan Lee Corporation.

529
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:39,735
He is also suspected to have been involved...

530
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:41,175
in the Osaka family murder...

531
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:44,001
that shocked the Korean-Japanese community 27 years ago.

532
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:45,875
Chairman Joo Dan Tae...

533
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,111
Please open the door. I'm from the front desk.

534
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,111
Darn it.

535
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,481
Did you say you needed a toothbrush?

536
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:00,520
(Chairman Joo Turns Out To Be Two-faced Psychopath)

537
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,821
Darn it.

538
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:05,890
It's Joo Dan Tae!

539
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,731
Joo Dan Tae...

540
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:10,636
Hello? Police?

541
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:12,435
Joo Dan Tae just ran away from here.

542
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:13,776
(Busan Lucky Motel)

543
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:16,346
This afternoon, at a motel in Busan,

544
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,375
the police lifted fingerprints of Chairman Joo, who is on the run.

545
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,716
It's become clear that he has smuggled himself back into Korea.

546
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:25,340
- Joo Dan Tae is such a jerk. - The search is still going on.

547
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,260
(I'm hungry. Please help me.)

548
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,105
(One pack of gum for 20 cents)

549
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:51,175
(Help me. My little sister is starving.)

550
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:54,071
- Hi, have you been waiting long? - Not at all.

551
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:55,910
Oh, my.

552
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,650
A pack of gum, sir?

553
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,111
Hey, go away!

554
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,321
My goodness.

555
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:06,355
What an annoying boy.

556
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,396
A pack of gum?

557
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:10,090
I said, go away!

558
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:14,460
I can't believe this.

559
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,001
- Let go! - What are you doing?

560
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:27,175
- Please! - Take him away.

561
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,640
- You little brat. - My gosh.

562
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,415
- Where's the money? - I don't have any.

563
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,850
- Is it here? - No, it isn't.

564
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:40,295
- There it is. - No! Give it back!

565
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:42,191
Why did you lie?

566
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,421
Give it back! It's my money!

567
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:04,045
Have you seen this man? He has a burn on his face.

568
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,381
I don't think so.

569
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:18,220
- Excuse me? - Go away!

570
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:26,700
Calm down! Stay still!

571
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:33,815
Isn't he the man from the news?

572
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,780
Hurry up and catch him!

573
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,321
I can't let it end like this.

574
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,330
I'll survive no matter what.

575
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:59,671
I'm never going back to my begging days.

576
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:10,981
I won't die on the street, never.

577
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,090
The penthouse is mine.

578
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,090
I'm...

579
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:30,860
going back there no matter what.

580
00:37:40,446 --> 00:37:43,011
Please wake up.

581
00:37:43,816 --> 00:37:45,411
If you leave me like this,

582
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:48,181
I'll never forgive you.

583
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:04,161
Dad.

584
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:36,806
(Dongbu Police Station)

585
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:40,035
My goodness. Because I chose the wrong man,

586
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:43,806
I've been bullied by my in-laws all my life,

587
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:47,145
and now I'm going in and out of prison.

588
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:48,740
Look who's talking.

589
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:52,515
I, Lee Kyu Jin, was born to a prestigious family of lawyers...

590
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:56,151
and used to live in luxury at Hera Palace.

591
00:38:56,355 --> 00:38:58,321
And look what happened to me now.

592
00:38:58,485 --> 00:39:01,556
In luxury, my foot. You were just Chairman Joo's minion.

593
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,726
A minion? Hey, how could you say that?

594
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:06,495
What? Deny it if you can!

595
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:08,936
You're not smart like Dr. Ha...

596
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,066
or strong like Mr. Yoo.

597
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,905
You're a mama's boy all the way.

598
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:15,635
I should never have married...

599
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,946
a rough woman like you!

600
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:21,115
My goodness. This is why you should never marry a spoiled brat.

601
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:23,285
I'd rather keep a dog!

602
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:25,411
A dog? A spoiled brat?

603
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,515
- Are you serious? - What?

604
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,880
Look at you two.

605
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,056
You're obviously having a lot of fun in here.

606
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,421
Ma Ri, what brings you here?

607
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,865
Are you here to help us?

608
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:41,130
Why would I?

609
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:43,235
You two got in trouble while on probation.

610
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,135
How could I possibly help you?

611
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:48,200
I brought a message from Min Hyuk.

612
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:52,470
Listen up, you immature parents.

613
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:57,316
(Enlistment Notice)

614
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:01,110
"Dear Mom and Dad. I was never able to decide..."

615
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:03,855
"which of you I hated more..."

616
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:05,580
"because both of you are so bad."

617
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,250
"But right now..."

618
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,090
I hate myself more than anyone else.

619
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:13,031
I want to be reborn.

620
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,166
I want to become a real man.

621
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,860
(Dear Mom and Dad)

622
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:20,176
(Enlistment Notice)

623
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:23,340
Wait a second. Min Hyuk is joining the military?

624
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:26,576
Min Hyuk! No!

625
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:28,946
How are you going to survive in the military?

626
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:31,441
This is too much!

627
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:34,350
By the way, Kyu Jin, Su Ryeon bought your apartment.

628
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:39,155
- What? - Su Ryeon is planning a business.

629
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:42,120
She's buying an apartment on every floor.

630
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:44,495
I heard she paid the market price.

631
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:45,966
I see. Good.

632
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:48,666
Did you put our apartment up for sale behind my back?

633
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,166
To take all the money?

634
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:54,675
You pocketed 500 million dollars. Are you in the position to say that?

635
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:58,206
You punk! You're a thief! I want a divorce!

636
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:02,245
What did you just say? What does that make my mom?

637
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:04,011
I'll tell her everything!

638
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:07,556
- I want a divorce too! - I don't need this ring anymore!

639
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:10,755
Good that their son is joining the military.

640
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:13,226
- Please take care of them. - What did you just say?

641
00:41:13,226 --> 00:41:14,620
- Take it back! - I can't!

642
00:41:15,966 --> 00:41:17,061
Mom, here.

643
00:41:19,495 --> 00:41:21,130
Mom.

644
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,431
Where's my daughter?

645
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:28,301
Who are you?

646
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,870
Bring my daughter to me! Bring her right now!

647
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:35,145
Your daughter is here.

648
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:38,610
I'm Eun Byeol. Don't you remember me?

649
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:41,151
Is my husband here yet?

650
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:46,590
He's a neurosurgeon at Cheong A Medical Center.

651
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:50,321
He's been quite busy lately.

652
00:41:50,596 --> 00:41:54,261
But if he knew I'm unwell, he'd hurry over and look after me.

653
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,436
I'll tell Dad to come over right now.

654
00:41:57,436 --> 00:41:58,801
Who's your dad?

655
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,700
Who's your dad? Who do you think you are?

656
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:05,740
According to the test results, she's in the late stage of Alzheimer's.

657
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:08,311
- Her environment changed suddenly. - You need to eat.

658
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:11,916
The shock from it seems to have caused her condition.

659
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,155
I'll try calling him.

660
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,710
Can I have a look at her chart?

661
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:16,821
Mom, look at me.

662
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:21,525
Her hippocampus has shrunk drastically.

663
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:24,791
Where am I?

664
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,561
Where am I?

665
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:28,365
Where am I?

666
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:31,635
Given her condition, it'll be impossible to interrogate her.

667
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:34,275
- Can I get a doctor's note? - You don't have to eat.

668
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:36,700
- I'll call a nurse. - Sure.

669
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:39,911
Mom, look at me.

670
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:43,645
I booked flights for you.

671
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,911
An acceptance letter arrived from the Juilliard School too.

672
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,710
Forget everything and focus on your studies now.

673
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,051
I leave in two weeks?

674
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:56,261
It's a boarding school, so there isn't much to prepare.

675
00:42:56,666 --> 00:43:00,031
Leave early so you can learn the language and adapt yourself.

676
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:03,031
I'll dispose of your apartment.

677
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:05,561
I want to wait until Mr. Ha wakes up.

678
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:08,936
Once I know he's fine,

679
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,941
I'll do as I say.

680
00:43:12,145 --> 00:43:13,641
It might take...

681
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,811
much longer for Dr. Ha to wake up than we expect.

682
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:21,480
I'll let you know as soon as he does.

683
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:25,380
So don't worry about us and just leave.

684
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:29,761
There's a time for everything, be it singing or studying.

685
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,490
Hye In will pick you up at the airport.

686
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:36,261
Please...

687
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:39,100
look after Mr. Ha.

I just do what you tell me to.

691
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:14,470

694
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:24,216
Why are you buying up so many units?

695

You're paying a premium although prices dropped.

696
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:28,586
Buy up the remaining units...

697
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:30,821
if they show a willingness to sell.

698
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,720
Sell yours to me too.

699
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:36,761
Why don't you get a lot in Cheonsoo District?

700
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,830
Why are you doing this?

701
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:44,206
Why are you buying up units in this wretched Hera Palace?

702
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,301
So many people died in it.

703
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:50,771
I hope it never happens,

704
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,941
but I want to prepare for the worst.

705
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:59,580
Dan Tae was obsessive about Hera Palace.

706
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:05,220
I feel like he'll do something if he thinks it's over for him.

707
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:11,090
Do you actually think that?

708
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:15,860
But then again, he has no regard at all for human life.

709
00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:19,261
Who knows? He may set fire to it today.

710
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,405
But given how no one has heard from him,

711
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:26,541
maybe he died somewhere.

712
00:45:26,775 --> 00:45:29,176
Maybe he starved to death or was struck by lightning.

713
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:30,846
I think something happened.

714
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:33,480
There's a two-million-dollar reward out for him.

715
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:36,151
If he died, we would've found at least his body.

716
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:38,681
That's why...

717
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,521
I plan to draw him into Hera Palace.

718
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,191
How?

719
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,630
I'm...

720
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:54,130
getting engaged to Logan next week.

721
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,600
You are? Really?

722
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,211
That's great.

723
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:08,380
I told Ma Ri about our engagement.

724
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:11,186
Just in case,

725
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,690
I've bought up over 90 percent of the units in Hera Palace.

726
00:46:14,055 --> 00:46:16,561
It should be almost empty by next week.

727
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:20,061
Dan Tae will return to Hera Palace.

728
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,436
If we say we're getting engaged there,

729
00:46:22,436 --> 00:46:24,400
which he values as much as his life,

730
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,670
he'll make that D-day.

731
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:28,830
I'll kill him.

732
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,606
Please stand back where it's safe.

733
00:46:31,606 --> 00:46:34,071
I'm the one he's after.

734
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:36,511
He's coming back to kill me.

735
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:44,981
I promise...

736
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,751
I won't let Dan Tae kill me.

737
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:55,590
How's Seo Jin doing?

738
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:02,231
She's getting worse and worse.

739
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:04,541
She doesn't recognize Eun Byeol.

740
00:47:05,106 --> 00:47:08,670
The tests show early onset dementia.

741
00:47:10,146 --> 00:47:11,745
Early onset dementia?

742
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,940
Yes.

743
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:22,420
This is her chart.

744
00:47:22,995 --> 00:47:25,064
We're monitoring her 24 hours a day.

745
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:26,961
It doesn't look like she's pretending.

746
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:28,961
I don't believe it.

747
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:31,366
The investigation has been stayed.

748
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:33,335
She got a restraining order against the loan sharks.

749
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,100
The timing is just too suspicious.

750
00:47:35,805 --> 00:47:38,771
Well, I think we should keep watching for now.

751
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:41,110
We have a week until the engagement ceremony.

752
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:45,880
I hope Dan Tae does what we assume he will.

753
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:48,511

754
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:21,511
(Bathroom)

755
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:35,366
Hey. Why are you standing there all awkward?

756
00:48:35,366 --> 00:48:36,461
What?

757
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:38,900
What did I do?

758
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:00,251
Darn it.

759
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:19,244
Tell me right away if Joo Dan Tae shows up.

760
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:22,711
The reward is a whopping two million dollars.

761
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,380
Don't try to do anything stupid.

762
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:28,711
Yes, sir.

763
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:33,690
I'm going out for a smoke.

764
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:46,061
Long time no see, Secretary Cho.

765
00:49:46,136 --> 00:49:49,400
Sir. What happened to your face?

766
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:51,501
That's not important.

767
00:49:51,676 --> 00:49:54,771
I'm starving. Do you have any food?

768
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:13,430
Do you like the food?

769
00:50:15,835 --> 00:50:17,660
There are cops everywhere outside.

770
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,301
We can't let them hear you.

771
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,930
Where have you been?

772
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:24,940
There's a national manhunt for you.

773
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,811
You'll betray me too, won't you?

774
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:30,245
There's a two-million-dollar reward on my head.

775
00:50:30,245 --> 00:50:33,085
Even my son stabbed me in the back. Who's to say you won't?

776
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:34,880
Didn't you come here...

777
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,150
because you trusted me?

778
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:40,690
I'm in this together with you.

779
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:43,090
I'll join you till the end.

780
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:45,221
Even if I die.

781
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,001
My parents' place is empty.

782
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:58,241
Stay there for the time being.

783
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:04,616
Did you hear that Ms. Shim and Logan are getting engaged?

784
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,080
What? Engaged?

785
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:10,186
They're having a small ceremony with just close friends next week.

786
00:51:10,186 --> 00:51:12,751
- Where? - I hear it'll be at Hera Palace.

787
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:15,221
At Hera Palace?

788
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:17,696
Those jerks.

789
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:21,330
Why are they getting engaged at my Hera Palace?

790
00:51:21,765 --> 00:51:25,234
They did this to me, but they're happily getting engaged?

791
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:27,136
I can't let that happen.

792
00:51:27,136 --> 00:51:29,630
They're the reason I'm in this mess.

793
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,275
- Secretary Cho. - Yes?

794
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:33,676
Get me some explosives.

795
00:51:33,676 --> 00:51:35,670
Something more powerful than the ones we used on Logan.

796
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:38,481
About ten claymore explosives over 5kg each should work.

797
00:51:38,815 --> 00:51:41,251
Pardon? What do you plan to do?

798
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:44,150
You jerk.

799
00:51:47,456 --> 00:51:48,751
You can do it, right?

800
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:50,120
Yes, sir.

801
00:51:52,726 --> 00:51:55,291
I'll kill them for real this time.

802
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:57,531
No mistakes.

805
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,164
Thanks, Secretary Cho.

806
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,674
Sir.

807
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,545
Is this...

808
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:40,785
really the only option?

809
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,354
It could kill too many people.

810
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,585
If you stop this now...

811
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,958
Shut your mouth.

812
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,994
I'm putting everything on the line.

813
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,395
I'll arrange them...

814
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:56,095
the best engagement party.

817
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,345
Well...

818
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,514
I met Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

819
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,785
He bought an explosive device...

820
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,104
Why did you do something I didn't tell you to?

821
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:10,035
You know I hate traitors more than anything.

822
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,405
After all those beatings, you still didn't get it.

823
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,294
Congratulations on the engagement, Logan. You look great today.

824
00:56:03,299 --> 00:56:04,299
Thank you.

825
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:05,930
The kids are traveling.

826
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,269
It's a farewell party for Ro Na and Min Hyuk.

827
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:12,565
I'm so upset that so few people were invited to this lovely event.

828
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,834
Hera Palace was always full of people.

829
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,875
Now I'm the only Hera Club member left.

830
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,875
You are.

831
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:27,945
Take care of everything for us today.

832
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,784
I will.

833
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,654
The statue of Hera looks even more beautiful today.

834
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:38,894
It's such a waste.

835
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,264
It would've been loved forever if it never got blood on it.

836
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,235
Don't you agree?

837
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,495
I'm ready.

838
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,334
You look amazing.

839
00:58:57,799 --> 00:58:59,435
Of all the brides I ever saw,

840
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:01,534
you're the most beautiful.

841
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:06,144
Thank you.

842
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,745
Let's hurry. Let's not keep the people waiting.

I might just blow Hera Palace up.

856
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:48,364
I set up some bombs here and there.

857
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,035
I miss you, so come quickly.

858
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,050

859

Evacuate all residents. Now!

01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:10,960
What happened?

01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
There are bombs in Hera Palace.

862
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,159
Evacuate the residents first.

863
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,454
- We don't have time! - What? Bombs?

864
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,229
Ring the emergency bell. Quickly.

865
01:03:21,229 --> 01:03:22,765

Please evacuate promptly.

There is a bomb in Hera Palace.

870
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,450
Promptly evacuate the building.

871
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,415
Don't take anything. Just leave. Quickly!

872
01:03:37,649 --> 01:03:40,084
Cover her so she doesn't get hurt.

873
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,555
- Mom! - Get out of here!

874

Why are you here? You were on a trip!

876
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,129

879
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,800
It was Dad, wasn't it? The one who set up the bomb.

880
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,940
Is my mom okay?

881
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,795
She'll help us buy more time.

882
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,269
We need to evacuate everyone.

883
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,940
If not, we all die. Now!

884
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,180

896
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,489
I prepared a last-minute present.

897
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:25,415
I wonder if you'll like it.

898
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,129
If I press this button,

899
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:33,124
it will set off the bombs in the fountain and the penthouse

900
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,970
They're much stronger than the ones I set up in Logan's car last time.

901
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,565
You can look forward to them.

902
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:39,035
Boom.

903
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:42,234
Boom.

904
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,334
You crazy jerk.

905
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:49,220
If you want to die, die alone.

906
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,574
Why should I be the only one to die?

907
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,084
What did I do wrong?

908
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,614
Do you know that it was your dad...

909
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,354
who killed my mom and sister?

910
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:02,399
Your father, who worked for Simoon Construction,

911
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:04,359
took away my house.

912
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:07,499
What's so wrong with taking back what was taken from me?

913
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:10,864
Lot 27 of Cheonsoo District always belonged to my dad.

914
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:14,405
It was your parents who lived on that land without permission.

915
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:18,009
The demolition accident was all Baek Joon Ki's father.

916
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:19,609
My dad knew nothing.

917
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,104
Don't make excuses!

918
01:06:23,979 --> 01:06:26,885
The noble Shim Su Ryeon...

919
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,320
never admits to doing anything wrong even until the end.

920
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,714
Don't move.

921
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,954
How dare you defile my Hera Palace?

922
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,525
Only I can have this place. Only I can destroy it.

923
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,464
If I can't have it, no one can. You understand?

924
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,535
Dying alone felt lonely.

925
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,535
It comforts me to know that it will be with you.

926
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,704
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

927
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,344
That's the perfect outfit for you to wear to the fiery pit.

928
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:06,854
Drop the remote.

929
01:07:07,259 --> 01:07:10,954
You think you can shoot me?

930
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,129
I will press the button the moment you pull the trigger.

931
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:18,734
Then Hera Palace will disappear in the blink of an eye.

932
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:21,704
Come on. Shoot me!

933
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,680
I said, drop the remote!

934
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,244
And I said you'll die if you keep challenging me.

935
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:33,114
Just like your ex-husband.

936
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,114
Just like Min Seol A. Just like Oh Yoon Hee!

937
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,084
Shoot me!

938
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:50,700
This is for all the innocent lives you took away!

939
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,065
You're crazy!

940
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:54,435
How dare you shoot at me, the mighty Joo Dan Tae?

941
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:59,374
Are you still obsessed with that name?

942
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,445
This is you paying...

943
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,145
for all the crimes you've committed.

944
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:55,054
Drop the remote!

945
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:58,655
Shim Su Ryeon, let's go together...

946
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,895
to the fiery pit.

947
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,409
(The Penthouse 3)

948
01:12:57,409 --> 01:12:59,080
Mom, please don't die.

949
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,409
Please survive!

950
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,010
Mommy loves you so much.

951
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,080
You died a death that you deserved.

952
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,480
Cheon Seo Jin is the only one left.

953
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,020
What if he dies because of me?

954
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,949
Live happily, Ro Na.

955
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:10,020
Mom!

956
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,219
I'll save Eun Byeol.

957
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,090
I must push forward.

958
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,855
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.
