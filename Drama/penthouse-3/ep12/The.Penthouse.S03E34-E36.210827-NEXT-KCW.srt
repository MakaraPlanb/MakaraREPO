1
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:10,789
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

2
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,524
Don't act like you know me.

3
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,288
I don't want to see you again!

4
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,018
If anything happens to me,

5
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,809
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:20,079
He'll rot there for
the rest of his life.

7
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:21,754
Mr. Baek Jun Ki?

8
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,414
Baek... Baek Jun Ki?

9
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,419
Logan is alive. Mom's just fine too.

10
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,118
I can't let it end like this.

11
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:30,464
I want to go back!

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,494
Why is this so special that
everyone's fighting to keep this?

13
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,964
So that there's no more fighting,
we must end this place too.

14
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:40,504
I'll erase all your bad memories, Mom.

15
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:43,274
The two must experience what
living in torment is like.

16
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,104
I'm here for the money
he borrowed from us.

17
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,012
I'm the chairwoman of Cheong A Group!

18
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,839
Did you know that Cheong
A Constructions...

19
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:50,384
filed for bankruptcy?

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,479
Ms. Cheon!

21
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:53,078
Where should I take you?

22
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:55,979
Hera Palace.

23
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,178
Take me to Hera Palace
in Samseong-dong.

24
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,734
(Episode 12)

25
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,704
Eun Byeol.

26
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,844
Where is she?

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,414
Eun Byeol.

28
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:12,885
Eun Byeol.

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,215
Eun Byeol.

30
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,884
There you are.

31
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,155
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,465
Ms. Cheon.

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,765
We have no time to lose.

34
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,139
It's my inauguration ceremony today.

35
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,370
Our outfits are ready.

36
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,965
Come. We'll be late.

37
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:36,074
Ms. Cheon, let go of me.
I'm not Eun Byeol.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,374
Why won't you listen to me?
Do as I say!

39
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,775
You're my daughter.
You must attend the ceremony.

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,750
Everything I have will be yours.
Come now.

41
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,584
Come! Hurry!

42
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,459
Listen to me!

43
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,820
- Ms. Cheon, why are you...
- Come!

44
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,360
- Come, Eun Byeol.
- I'm not Eun Byeol.

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,385
Hurry. Come.

46
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,229
Stop it, Seo Jin.

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,724
Why are you here?

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Are you here to take Eun Byeol away
from me?

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,265
You can't!
I'll never let that happen!

50
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,739
What are you doing?
She's not your daughter!

51
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,134
Yes, she is!
You can't take her away!

52
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,149
Eun Byeol, come to your mom.

53
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,619
Ro Na, run, now!

54
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,250
No! Eun Byeol!

55
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,045
- Get it together, Seo Jin!
- Eun Byeol!

56
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:23,315
Ro Na, are you okay?

57
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,024
Are you out of your mind?
Where are you taking her?

58
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:27,785
She's my daughter!

59
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,325
Ro Na!

60
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,864
Mr. Ha, are you okay?

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,535
Eun Byeol!

62
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,474
We don't have time for this.
Come with me now.

63
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,134
Why are you so stubborn?

64
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,709
- Eun Byeol!
- Ms. Cheon.

65
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,175
Come with me.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,944
Eun Byeol!

67
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,524
What happened here?

68
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,784
What a mess.

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,364
Ro Na! Dr. Ha!

70
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,868
Oh, my. Excuse me!

71
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:47,534
We need help! Quickly!

72
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,244
Hello? Some people
got badly injured.

73
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,045
At the community room
in Hera Palace.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,374
Please come over right now.

75
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,735
I did it all by myself.

76
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,769
I don't have a family.

77
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,969
My mom is dead,

78
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:21,404
and it's been a while
since I cut ties with my brother.

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,505
So just send me to prison.

80
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:26,804
Seok Kyung.

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,214
Why did you call them?

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,425
I have nothing to do with them.
I don't know them.

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm Seok Kyung's mom.

84
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,100
Mom? She's not my mom.

85
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,130
I'm not your daughter.
We're strangers.

86
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,665
Give it a rest.

87
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,834
What is Seok Kyung doing here?

88
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:54,570
Your daughter helped
the fugitive Joo Dan Tae...

89
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,334
flee to Japan.

90
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,550
She even took the boat with him...

91
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,145
and went to Japan.
We've confirmed that.

92
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,645
Now, why don't you tell us
the truth?

93
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,559
Were you really acting alone?

94
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,825
Where did you get the money
to help him flee?

95
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,325
I have a lot of money.

96
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:17,555
My real mom left me
quite a big inheritance.

97
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,100
This lady and my dad
got divorced years ago,

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,639
and I lived with my dad.

99
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,635
He kept begging me,
so I had to help him.

100
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:27,005
Is it a crime for a daughter
to help her dad?

101
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:30,474
So, where in Japan did you send him?

102
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:32,875
I don't know.

103
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,480
I split after I saw him
arrive in Japan.

104
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,850
Stop lying.

105
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,914
If you won't even believe me,
why do you bother asking?

106
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,125
If you want to investigate properly,
get rid of these people first.

107
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,395
Otherwise, I won't say a peep.

108
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,499
Do you think this is a game?

109
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:54,125
So just lock me up!

110
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:57,839
I helped my dad run away.

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,910
Why are you bringing in people
who have nothing to do with it...

112
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,265
and humiliating me?

113
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,815
It's a mental hospital in Fukuoka.

114
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,815
I'm sure he's there.

115
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,020
Ask Interpol for cooperation
and send Joo Dan Tae's description.

116
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,115
Yes, sir.

117
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,424
We may have more questions for you
at a later time.

118
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,685
I understand.

119
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,995
- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,869
- Get off.
- Where are you going now?

121
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,439
Does running away like a child
solve everything?

122
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,470
I said I'll take responsibility.

123
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,840
I said I'll go to jail for it.
Why is everyone stopping me?

124
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,474
How did you know?

125
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,174
How did you know
to go to Busan Port?

126
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,480
I heard Seok Hoon
talk on the phone with you.

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,544
Are you saying you followed Mom?

128
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,550
Why did you go to Japan?
Have you no fear?

129
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,885
I wanted to see it for myself.

130
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,854
I wanted to see Dad's demise.

131
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,460
The mental hospital was
nicer than I expected.

132
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,329
I'll never see him again.

133
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,524
It was only right
that I saw him off.

134
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,834
Don't worry about me.
I'm legally his daughter,

135
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,540
so they can't punish me
for helping him flee.

136
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,365
How could you go somewhere
so dangerous alone?

137
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,439
Do you know how worried we were
when you disappeared?

138
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,575
Why were you worried
about a spoiled brat like me?

139
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,720
You know I'll survive no matter what
because I take after Dad.

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,290
Must you talk like that?

141
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,815
I can't help it. This is who I am.

142
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,955
Have you eaten?

143
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,195
Let's go eat.

144
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,294
You've lost weight.

145
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,305
Just eat.

146
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,739
You need your energy...

147
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:46,174
to fight with me or hate me.

148
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,474
Here.

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,745
You want me to eat
and get lost, right?

150
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,914
Fine. I'll eat then.

151
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,924
You were my daughter from the start.

152
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:11,294
There wasn't a moment when you
and Seok Hoon weren't my kids.

153
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,435
It wasn't your fault
that you grew up under Dan Tae,

154
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,334
unaware of anything.

155
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,474
No. It was my fault.

156
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,974
Seol A almost died because of me.

157
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,389
I was the one
who set the van on fire.

158
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,584
I was the one
who locked her in there and ran.

159
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,625
It's my fault
that Ro Na's mom died too.

160
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,325
Someone like me isn't worthy
of being your daughter.

161
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,265
I hate myself so much,
it's driving me crazy.

162
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,635
How could I insist
that I'm your daughter now?

163
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,805
So? Will you run away again?

164
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,145
Will you keep running away
without repenting?

165
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,344
You did it.

166
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,189
It may hurt but face it.
Don't avoid it.

167
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,044
That way, there will be a way back.

168
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,365
My daughter grew up a lot
while I was away.

169
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,435
Let's go home.
I fixed up your room nicely.

170
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,604
I was wrong.

171
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,445
I'm sorry, Mom.

172
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,774
I was so wrong.

173
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,755
I've missed you so much.

174
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,255
I missed you so much,
I thought I was going to die.

175
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,335
(Jenny's mother)

176
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,005
Hello?

177
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,475
Why won't your mom pick up?

178
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,515
It's terrible. There was an accident
at Hera Palace.

179
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,444
What do you mean,

180
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,414
there was an accident?

181
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
- How are the vitals?
- They're weak.

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,855
We'll begin. Forceps.

183
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,199
The BP is dropping.

184
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,794
- It's dangerous.
- We'll start right away.

185
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,615
- Hi.
- What happened?

186
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,645
My gosh. Dr. Ha was badly injured.

187
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,089
It was that witch Seo Jin's fault.

188
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,554
His head is bleeding badly.
He's in surgery now.

189
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,890
Why was Seo Jin at Hera Palace?

190
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,699
My point exactly.
I think she has completely snapped.

191
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,699
She was calling Ro Na "Eun Byeol"
and said she'd take her.

192
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,794
She caused a big scene,
which resulted in this mess.

193
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,605
How's Ro Na?

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,434
Thankfully, she wasn't injured.

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,774
Where's Seo Jin?

196
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,985
Let go. I have to go see my mom.

197
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,184
She's out of surgery
and is in recovery now.

198
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,554
The chandelier fell from the ceiling
but she lucked out and survived.

199
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,355
Your mom is just incredible.

200
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,630
She's putting on an act...

201
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,130
because the company went under
and she's cornered, isn't she?

202
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,635
She's faking being crazy.

203
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,469
- What?
- Even still.

204
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:34,370
Mistaking Ro Na for her daughter?
That was a bit much.

205
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,135
How could she make
a mistake like that?

206
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,174
Or did something really happen
to her brain?

207
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,475
Shut it! What do you know?

208
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,625
Wake up, Seo Jin. Wake up right now.

209
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,755
You can't fool me.

210
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,154
Wake up!

211
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,800
What are you doing?

212
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,365
My mom is sick right now.

213
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,939
Your mom is putting on an act.

214
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,365
She's about to lose everything,
so she's pretending to be crazy.

215
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,105
Hey! Ms. Shim!

216
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,074
That's so cold.

217
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,380
Drop the act.

218
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,050
Do you think this will let you avoid
being investigated?

219
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,554
Being mentally unstable won't work.

220
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,790
I said to stop!

221
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,095
My mom really is sick.
Don't you see she's hurt?

222
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:31,500
I won't let anyone mistreat my mom.

223
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,194
I'm her guardian from now on.
Get out of here right now!

224
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,800
Get rid of this woman.

225
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,740
And don't let anyone
come into this room. No one!

226
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,235
You need to go.

227
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,605
Let go of me!

228
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,345
I'll walk out on my own.

229
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,274
Don't think it's over, Seo Jin.

230
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:54,115
I'll follow you to the ends
of the earth and destroy you.

231
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,495
Mom. Are you okay?

232
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,865
What happened to you?

233
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,965
Who are you?

234
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,664
Mom.

235
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,605
Do you know me?

236
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,904
Where am I?

237
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,120
- Mom.
- What is this?

238
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,645
Why are you doing this?

239
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,219
Mom!

240
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:29,985
Snap out of it, Mom.
Stop playing with me.

241
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,089
Mom, stop it.

242
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,395
Mom...

243
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,534
- Who are you people?
- Move!

244
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,774
Cheon Seo Jin!

245
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,510
No!

246
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,010
- Stop it!
- Drop the act.

247
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,920
- No!
- Get away!

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,885
- Those of you outside, get in here!
- No! Stop it! Mom!

249
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,085
- Stop doing that to my mom!
- Get away.

250
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,459
- Get away!
- Drag her out here!

251
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,429
- No! Get away!
- Hey.

252
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:11,054
- Get back!
- Get her!

253
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:19,339
His vitals are dropping.

254
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,010
Up the norpin and get more blood.

255
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,105
Yes, doctor.

256
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,875
Thank goodness
you weren't hurt more.

257
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:31,544
How is Mr. Ha doing?

258
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,444
He's in surgery.

259
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,284
He'll be okay, right?

260
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,359
He has to be okay.

261
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,654
Of course.

262
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,794
He'll get through the surgery
and wake up.

263
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,194
Don't worry.

264
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,465
He got hurt instead of me.

265
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,735
Trying to save me.

266
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,635
What should I do?

267
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:05,345
If something were to happen to him,
I won't be able to stand it.

268
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,414
I can't lose both Mom and him too.

269
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,954
I'd feel too guilty.

270
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,530
That won't happen.

271
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,495
Dr. Ha's a strong person.

272
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,625
He'll get through this.

273
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,164
(Intensive Care)

274
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:38,814
I think she's temporarily confused
due to the accident.

275
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,885
They'll run
some in-depth tests tomorrow.

276
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,024
What about my dad?
Is he in bad shape?

277
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,054
The surgery's taking longer
than expected.

278
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,625
He was hurt badly in the head.
We'll hear more after the surgery.

279
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,095
It was my fault.

280
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:57,595
Both Mom and Dad, everything.

281
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,664
It was my fault.

282
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,349
How long will you stay here for?

283
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,015
Can you do this to someone
who just got out of surgery?

284
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,944
Why? Are you hungry?

285
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,589
Come here.

286
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,814
You can join us for some Chinese.

287
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,589
What you're doing
is called illegal collecting.

288
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,255
If I call the police,
they'll take you all in!

289
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,765
Call the police, then.

290
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:27,794
Don't touch the girl.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Why come to us
about Chairman Joo's debt?

292
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,064
Why is it us
when he has two legitimate kids?

293
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,975
Cheon Seo Jin's his wife.

294
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,944
Who told her to be his guarantor?

295
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,774
Where's Joo Dan Tae?
Where are you hiding him?

296
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,444
You little punk.

297
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,314
No, don't.

298
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,225
Unless Joo Dan Tae dies,

299
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,524
Cheon Seo Jin or her daughter...

300
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,235
will have to pay us back
until the day they die.

301
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,365
Okay?

302
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,475
You can't get away from us.

303
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,444
So go and find Joo Dan Tae!

304
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,544
Don't!

305
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,914
Move!

306
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,444
Stop it!

307
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,520
Where's Joo Dan Tae?

308
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,485
Where is he, punk?

309
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,924
You have a pretty face.

310
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,954
You could be worth a lot.

311
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,395
Where do you want to go?

312
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:34,465
Where is he?

313
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,034
- My ear!
- Get her off him.

314
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,105
Grab her!

315
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,774
Hey!

316
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,475
Maybe she's not crazy.

317
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,449
Will you all just get out?

318
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,390
Get out! Get out of here!

319
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,689
- Leave!
- Where's our money?

320
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll call the police!

321
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,620
- Get out!
- Stop it!

322
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,954
Get out!

323
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,130
Get out! Leave!

324
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,724
Cheon Seo Jin!
I'll be back for my money, okay?

325
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,295
It's okay, Mom.

326
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,264
Mom!

327
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,474
It's okay. Don't worry.

328
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,714
Mr. Baek, it's time for
your psychological treatment.

329
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,645
Get him!

330
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,934
Get off me!

331
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,845
Let go of me.

332
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,174
Let go!

Find him. Where did he go?

335
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:35,845
Shim Su Ryeon, Logan Lee.
This time I'll kill you for real.

336
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,790
Eat up, even if you don't want to.

337
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,359
Don't you lift a finger for a while.

338
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,654
I'll do everything for you.

339
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,990
Drink some water.
Slow down or you'll get sick.

340
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,629
I'm not a patient.

341
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,399
How are you not a patient?

342
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,230
You fell down a staircase.

343
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,135
There's no medicine for shock,
and I'm so worried.

344
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,839
I got your medicine.

345
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,639
What are you doing here?
You're not welcome.

346
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,575
Ro Na's suffering already.

347
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,674
Do you hope to be let off
by bringing her medicine?

348
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,849
Does that cancel out all you did?

349
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,184
Did I say that?

350
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,315
Neither you nor Ro Na
will accept my apology.

351
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,859
You hate me and won't forgive me.
I know that.

352
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,525
Then why bother coming here?

353
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,825
Did you come
to stare at a sick person?

354
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,625
We don't need your apology,
so get lost.

355
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,825
You evil brat.

356
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,295
Do it anyway.

357
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,605
Whether I accept it or not
is up to me.

358
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,904
You should apologize.
Until I accept it.

359
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,275
Apologize and ask for forgiveness.

360
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,285
Look back and think about
what you did to my mom and me.

361
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,125
Think about
what happens next after that.

362
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,065
Let's go.

363
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,204
Hello? Will you let me out?

364
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,045
You murderer.

365
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,220
How dare you come here
so shamelessly?

366
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,190
- Joo Seok Kyung!
- I don't believe you're not guilty.

367
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,184
You killed my mom.

368
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,395
(Go away, murderer.)

369
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,934
Get rid of a mudfish for me.

370
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,940
(Cheong A Group)

371
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,335
Do whatever it takes
to make Ro Na ruin her exam.

372
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,904
Don't worry.
Dad will sort it out for you.

373
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,720
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes?

374
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,919
Can you take me to the hospital?

375
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,750
What for? Do you feel unwell?

376
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,714
I want to visit Dr. Ha.

377
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,154
I'll visit him every day.

378
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,290
What's the point in doing that
when he's not awake yet?

379
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,994
You're not well yourself.

380
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,795
Just in case.
He might be able to hear.

381
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,464
If I do something,
it might help him wake up sooner.

382
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:13,309
Yes. You're right.

383
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,734
Okay.

384
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:16,904
Watch your step. Take your time.

385
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,490
- Jenny, let's go.
- Okay.

386
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,214
- Walk slowly.
- Carefully.

387
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,025
Let's go.

388
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:52,105
The brain damage
is worse than I thought.

389
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,545
It was a dangerous spot,
so I couldn't do anything.

390
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,214
Is it possible that
he won't wake up?

391
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,645
We must...

392
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,115
wait and see to find out.

393
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,095
After what she did to Dr. Ha,

394
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,664
Cheon Seo Jin
asked for police protection.

395
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,404
The loan sharks were thrown out
of the hospital this morning.

396
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,210
She's being protected
when she should be punished.

397
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,305
It makes no sense.

398
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,815
Let's just release the last part
of the dashcam footage.

399
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,484
I won't make the same mistake twice.

400
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,220
Cheon Seo Jin will use
her weak condition...

401
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,184
to get away with her crime again.

402
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,555
I will send her to the fiery pit
with my own hands.

403
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,000
We have a problem.

404
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,125
Joo Dan Tae escaped from
the Japanese mental hospital.

405
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,494
What?

406
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:57,105
Okay.

407
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,645
What a persistent guy.

408
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,520
I gave him one last chance
to repent until he dies,

409
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,145
and even that he lets go.

410
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,145
Joo Dan Tae will come back to Korea.

411
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,514
Then you may be put in danger.

412
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,885
That's something I must face.

413
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,954
If this game can end...

414
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,494
only when one of us dies,

415
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:21,325
I won't hide.

416
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,470
Since he has no money
and no passport,

417
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,964
it will be hard for him to return
to Korea all by himself.

418
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,835
Who do you think he'll call first?

419
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,585
Son.

420
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,684
Are you okay?

421
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:46,954
Where are you?

422
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,055
Do you have any idea
how worried we've been?

423
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,825
Shim Su Ryeon locked me up
in a mental hospital.

424
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,325
I barely escaped.

425
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,295
Mom did?

426
00:25:58,069 --> 00:25:59,664
No way.

427
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,565
Are you hurt?

428
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:05,535
You didn't hear anything
from your mom?

429
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,545
I heard Logan came back to life.

430
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,545
Do you really have no idea
what those two scumbags...

431
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,115
are planning?

432
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:16,815
It's been a while since they met.

433
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,454
Mom is planning on going back
to the US with Logan.

434
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,924
Darn it!

435
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:26,194
She does this to me, and then
she wants to be happy on her own?

436
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,865
Seok Hoon, help me out.

437
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:34,105
I never killed Ro Na's mom.

438
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,775
I saw with my own eyes Cheon Seo Jin
pushing the car off the cliff.

439
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,045
I'm innocent.

440
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,174
Unless you want to be the son of
a murderer, you have to help me out.

441
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,244
I can only make things right
if I make it back.

442
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,285
Seok Hoon, you have to trust me.

443
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,454
How can I help?

444
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,994
Help me get back to Korea.

445
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,224
I must get back to Hera Palace.

446
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,095
Even if I die, I'll die there.

447
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,994
In the castle, I built with my own hands.

448
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,904
You're the only one
I can ask for a favor.

449
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,240
I have a friend in Fukuoka.

450
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,180
I'll call him.

451
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,579
Go to Hakata now.

452
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,974
I'll prepare the money
and fake passport as well.

453
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,684
Thank you, Seok Hoon. Really.

454
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,855
Come back safe first.
Then we can think about what to do next.

455
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,885
I'll find a ship
that leaves the earliest.

456
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,025
See you tomorrow at dawn
at Busan Port.

457
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,395
Seok Hoon. I can...

458
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,224
trust you, right?

459
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,895
Of course.

460
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,464
I'm your only son.

461
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,875
Okay. Understood.

462
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,645
You were exactly right.

463
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,754
I'm sorry to ask you
to do this, Seok Hoon.

464
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,664
I gave up on him a long time ago.

465
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,694
I feel no compassion or remorse.

466
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:11,694
If I could,

467
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,004
I want to end him with my hands.

468
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:19,510
You stay here. Let me do the rest.

469
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,305
No. I'm coming.

470
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,914
Dad will find out soon enough,

471
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,785
what it's like to be abandoned
by your child.

472
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,025
As Joo Dan Tae escaped, the coastal
security has been strengthened.

473
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,555
Police officers will be
surrounding Busan Port.

474
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,825
We can't let the police
take Joo Dan Tae.

475
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,095
We have to catch him first.

476
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,065
We must hurry if we want to make it
to Busan Port.

477
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:19,634
(Ye Ji)

478
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,565
Hey!

479
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,815
Search the area. Now!

480
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,269
Joo Dan Tae must have known.

481
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:29,964
What a rat.

482
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,624
Joo Seok Hoon.

483
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,369
I knew I couldn't trust you.

484
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,934
You betray me and team up
with Shim Su Ryeon?

485
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,604
I think he already escaped
Busan Port.

486
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:43,475
He got on a fishing boat,
that's for sure.

487
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,045
I checked the picture of him
on that boat.

488
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,920
He must have escaped before
the smuggling ship got here.

489
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,684
It did cross my mind, but I didn't
know he would doubt you too.

490
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,329
Seok Hoon was just a way for him
to come back to Korea.

491
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,725
If we just wait, he's probably
going to get back at us.

492
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,759
He'll try to use...

493
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,894
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung
when he's in danger.

494
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,364
The kids shouldn't get hurt.

495
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,565
He's a master of crime and disguise.

496
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,674
If he really tries to hide,
there is no way of finding him.

497
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,740
The police also have no idea
where he is.

498
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,079
He said that he must come back
to Hera Palace.

499
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,214
That even if he dies,
he'd die there.

500
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,585
So he really wants to make
Hera Palace his grave?

501
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,485
Then there's only one thing
that we can do.

502
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,025
What is it?

503
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,055
Set a trap.

504
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,624
So that he can't hide
anywhere on this planet.

505
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,694
So that he'll walk
into his own grave.

506
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,970
Let the world know...

507
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,335
exactly how ugly and vicious
this man Joo Dan Tae is.

508
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:47,950
This is breaking news.

509
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,250
We are met with shock...

510
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,420
as the past crimes of Joo Dan Tae,
the CEO who killed Oh Yoon Hee,

511
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,018
continues to be revealed one by one.

512
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,049
Do you remember
the gruesome shooting...

513
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:59,719
that killed the genius pianist
based out of New York?

514
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,529
Would you believe it if we said...

515
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:05,460
that the murder was meticulously
planned by a psychopath...

516
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,954
just so he could marry a woman?

517
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:10,269
As the murderer behind a 20-year-old
case that almost went cold...

518
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,069
has been brought to the surface,

519
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,934
the man is now wanted nationwide.

520
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,335
Please take a good look at his face.

521
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,745
Joo Dan Tae.
His real name is Baek Jun Ki.

522
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,720
The Korean-American real estate
investor James Lee...

523
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,920
said today that he would reward
anyone who reported the runaway...

524
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,220
with two million dollars.

525
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,690
- What a...
- That's the highest amount ever.

526
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,160
Joo Dan Tae allegedly blew up
the car of...

527
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,089
- Darn it.
- the CEO of Logan Lee Corporation.

528
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:39,700
He is also suspected
to have been involved...

529
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,130
in the Osaka family murder...

530
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,964
that shocked the Korean-Japanese community
27 years ago.

531
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:45,839
Chairman Joo Dan Tae...

532
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,065
Please open the door.
I'm from the front desk.

533
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,075
Darn it.

534
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,444
Did you say
you needed a toothbrush?

535
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,475
(Chairman Joo Turns Out To Be
Two-faced Psychopath)

536
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:03,785
Darn it.

537
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,854
It's Joo Dan Tae!

538
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,684
Joo Dan Tae...

539
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,599
Hello? Police?

540
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,400
Joo Dan Tae just ran away from here.

541
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,730
(Busan Lucky Motel)

542
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,299
This afternoon, at a motel in Busan,

543
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:19,339
the police lifted fingerprints
of Chairman Joo, who is on the run.

544
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:22,670
It's become clear that he has
smuggled himself back into Korea.

545
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,305
- Joo Dan Tae is such a jerk.
- The search is still going on.

546
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,225
(I'm hungry. Please help me.)

547
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,069
(One pack of gum for 20 cents)

548
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:51,140
(Help me.
My little sister is starving.)

549
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,035
- Hi, have you been waiting long?
- Not at all.

550
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:55,864
Oh, my.

551
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,604
A pack of gum, sir?

552
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,075
Hey, go away!

553
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,275
My goodness.

554
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,319
What an annoying boy.

555
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:08,349
A pack of gum?

556
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:10,044
I said, go away!

557
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,424
I can't believe this.

558
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,964
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

559
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,139
- Please!
- Take him away.

560
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:29,605
- You little brat.
- My gosh.

561
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,380
- Where's the money?
- I don't have any.

562
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,805
- Is it here?
- No, it isn't.

563
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,250
- There it is.
- No! Give it back!

564
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,145
Why did you lie?

565
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,384
Give it back! It's my money!

566
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,010
Have you seen this man?
He has a burn on his face.

567
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,334
I don't think so.

568
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,185
- Excuse me?
- Go away!

569
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,654
Calm down! Stay still!

570
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,769
Isn't he the man from the news?

571
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,734
Hurry up and catch him!

572
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,285
I can't let it end like this.

573
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,285
I'll survive no matter what.

574
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:59,625
I'm never going back
to my begging days.

575
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,935
I won't die on the street, never.

576
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,044
The penthouse is mine.

577
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,055
I'm...

578
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:30,825
going back there no matter what.

579
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,964
Please wake up.

580
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,375
If you leave me like this,

581
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,145
I'll never forgive you.

582
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:04,125
Dad.

583
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,760
(Dongbu Police Station)

584
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,000
My goodness.
Because I chose the wrong man,

585
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,769
I've been bullied
by my in-laws all my life,

586
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:47,099
and now I'm going
in and out of prison.

587
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,705
Look who's talking.

588
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,480
I, Lee Kyu Jin, was born to
a prestigious family of lawyers...

589
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,105
and used to live in luxury
at Hera Palace.

590
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,274
And look what happened to me now.

591
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:01,519
In luxury, my foot.
You were just Chairman Joo's minion.

592
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,690
A minion?
Hey, how could you say that?

593
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,460
What? Deny it if you can!

594
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,889
You're not smart like Dr. Ha...

595
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,030
or strong like Mr. Yoo.

596
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,860
You're a mama's boy all the way.

597
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,599
I should never have married...

598
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,900
a rough woman like you!

599
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,070
My goodness. This is why you
should never marry a spoiled brat.

600
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,239
I'd rather keep a dog!

601
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,375
A dog? A spoiled brat?

602
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,480
- Are you serious?
- What?

603
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,845
Look at you two.

604
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,019
You're obviously having
a lot of fun in here.

605
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,384
Ma Ri, what brings you here?

606
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:39,820
Are you here to help us?

607
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,084
Why would I?

608
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,190
You two got in trouble
while on probation.

609
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,099
How could I possibly help you?

610
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,165
I brought a message from Min Hyuk.

611
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,435
Listen up, you immature parents.

612
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,269
(Enlistment Notice)

613
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:01,075
"Dear Mom and Dad.
I was never able to decide..."

614
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,809
"which of you I hated more..."

615
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,544
"because both of you are so bad."

616
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,214
"But right now..."

617
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,044
I hate myself more than anyone else.

618
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,984
I want to be reborn.

619
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,130
I want to become a real man.

620
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,825
(Dear Mom and Dad)

621
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,130
(Enlistment Notice)

622
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,294
Wait a second.
Min Hyuk is joining the military?

623
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,539
Min Hyuk! No!

624
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,909
How are you going to survive
in the military?

625
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,404
This is too much!

626
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,305
By the way, Kyu Jin,
Su Ryeon bought your apartment.

627
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:39,119
- What?
- Su Ryeon is planning a business.

628
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,084
She's buying an apartment
on every floor.

629
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,460
I heard she paid the market price.

630
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,920
I see. Good.

631
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,630
Did you put our apartment
up for sale behind my back?

632
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,130
To take all the money?

633
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,629
You pocketed 500 million dollars.
Are you in the position to say that?

634
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,170
You punk! You're a thief!
I want a divorce!

635
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,210
What did you just say?
What does that make my mom?

636
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,964
I'll tell her everything!

637
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,510
- I want a divorce too!
- I don't need this ring anymore!

638
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,710
Good that their son is
joining the military.

639
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,179
- Please take care of them.
- What did you just say?

640
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,584
- Take it back!
- I can't!

641
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,015
Mom, here.

642
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,084
Mom.

643
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,395
Where's my daughter?

644
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,265
Who are you?

645
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:32,834
Bring my daughter to me!
Bring her right now!

646
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,110
Your daughter is here.

647
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,575
I'm Eun Byeol.
Don't you remember me?

648
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,105
Is my husband here yet?

649
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,544
He's a neurosurgeon
at Cheong A Medical Center.

650
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:50,285
He's been quite busy lately.

651
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,214
But if he knew I'm unwell,
he'd hurry over and look after me.

652
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,389
I'll tell Dad to come over
right now.

653
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,754
Who's your dad?

654
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,665
Who's your dad?
Who do you think you are?

655
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,694
According to the test results, she's
in the late stage of Alzheimer's.

656
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,265
- Her environment changed suddenly.
- You need to eat.

657
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,880
The shock from it seems to have
caused her condition.

658
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,110
I'll try calling him.

659
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,674
Can I have a look at her chart?

660
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,774
Mom, look at me.

661
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,489
Her hippocampus
has shrunk drastically.

662
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:24,754
Where am I?

663
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,515
Where am I?

664
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,329
Where am I?

665
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:31,599
Given her condition,
it'll be impossible to interrogate her.

666
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,230
- Can I get a doctor's note?
- You don't have to eat.

667
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,665
- I'll call a nurse.
- Sure.

668
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:39,864
Mom, look at me.

669
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:43,610
I booked flights for you.

670
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,875
An acceptance letter arrived
from the Juilliard School too.

671
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,674
Forget everything
and focus on your studies now.

672
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,015
I leave in two weeks?

673
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,214
It's a boarding school,
so there isn't much to prepare.

674
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:59,984
Leave early so you can learn
the language and adapt yourself.

675
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:02,984
I'll dispose of your apartment.

676
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,524
I want to wait
until Mr. Ha wakes up.

677
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Once I know he's fine,

678
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,895
I'll do as I say.

679
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:13,595
It might take...

680
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,774
much longer for Dr. Ha to wake up
than we expect.

681
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,444
I'll let you know
as soon as he does.

682
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,345
So don't worry about us
and just leave.

683
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,714
There's a time for everything,
be it singing or studying.

684
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,455
Hye In will pick you up
at the airport.

685
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,225
Please...

686
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,055
look after Mr. Ha.

I just do what you tell me to.

690

You're paying a premium
although prices dropped.

695
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,550
Buy up the remaining units...

696
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,774
if they show a willingness to sell.

697
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:33,674
Sell yours to me too.

698
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:36,714
Why don't you get a lot
in Cheonsoo District?

699
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,785
Why are you doing this?

700
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:44,159
Why are you buying up units
in this wretched Hera Palace?

701
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,254
So many people died in it.

702
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,725
I hope it never happens,

but I want to prepare for the worst.

704
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:59,535
Dan Tae was obsessive
about Hera Palace.

705
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:05,174
I feel like he'll do something
if he thinks it's over for him.

706
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:11,044
Do you actually think that?

707
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:15,825
But then again, he has no regard
at all for human life.

708
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,225
Who knows?
He may set fire to it today.

709
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,369
But given how
no one has heard from him,

710
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:26,495
maybe he died somewhere.

711
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:29,139
Maybe he starved to death
or was struck by lightning.

712
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,809
I think something happened.

713
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:33,435
There's a two-million-dollar reward
out for him.

714
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:36,105
If he died, we would've found
at least his body.

715
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,645
That's why...

716
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,484
I plan to draw him into Hera Palace.

717
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,154
How?

718
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,584
I'm...

719
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,095
getting engaged to Logan next week.

720
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:57,564
You are? Really?

721
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,165
That's great.

722
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,345
I told Ma Ri about our engagement.

723
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,150
Just in case,

724
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,645
I've bought up over 90 percent
of the units in Hera Palace.

725
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,515
It should be almost empty
by next week.

726
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,015
Dan Tae will return to Hera Palace.

727
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:22,389
If we say
we're getting engaged there,

728
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,355
which he values as much as his life,

729
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,625
he'll make that D-day.

730
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,794
I'll kill him.

731
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,570
Please stand back where it's safe.

732
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,035
I'm the one he's after.

733
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,464
He's coming back to kill me.

734
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,944
I promise...

735
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,714
I won't let Dan Tae kill me.

736
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,555
How's Seo Jin doing?

737
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:02,194
She's getting worse and worse.

738
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:04,495
She doesn't recognize Eun Byeol.

739
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,634
The tests show early onset dementia.

740
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,710
Early onset dementia?

741
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,904
Yes.

742
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:22,384
This is her chart.

743
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:25,018
We're monitoring her 24 hours a day.

744
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,915
It doesn't look like
she's pretending.

745
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,924
I don't believe it.

746
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,329
The investigation has been stayed.

747
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:33,300
She got a restraining order
against the loan sharks.

748
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,064
The timing is just too suspicious.

749
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,734
Well, I think we should keep watching
for now.

750
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,064
We have a week
until the engagement ceremony.

751
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,834
I hope Dan Tae does
what we assume he will.

754
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,329
Hey. Why are you standing there
all awkward?

755
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,424
What?

756
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:38,855
What did I do?

757
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,214
Darn it.

758
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:19,198
Tell me right away
if Joo Dan Tae shows up.

759
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,665
The reward is
a whopping two million dollars.

760
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:26,334
Don't try to do anything stupid.

761
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:28,674
Yes, sir.

762
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,645
I'm going out for a smoke.

763
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,024
Long time no see, Secretary Cho.

764
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:49,364
Sir. What happened to your face?

765
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:51,464
That's not important.

766
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,734
I'm starving. Do you have any food?

767
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,384
Do you like the food?

768
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:17,625
There are cops everywhere outside.

769
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,254
We can't let them hear you.

770
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:22,895
Where have you been?

771
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,895
There's a national manhunt for you.

772
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,765
You'll betray me too, won't you?

773
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,210
There's a two-million-dollar reward
on my head.

774
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,039
Even my son stabbed me in the back.
Who's to say you won't?

775
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,834
Didn't you come here...

776
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,105
because you trusted me?

777
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,645
I'm in this together with you.

778
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,044
I'll join you till the end.

779
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,185
Even if I die.

780
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,964
My parents' place is empty.

781
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,194
Stay there for the time being.

782
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:04,570
Did you hear that Ms. Shim
and Logan are getting engaged?

783
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,035
What? Engaged?

784
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:10,150
They're having a small ceremony
with just close friends next week.

785
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,714
- Where?
- I hear it'll be at Hera Palace.

786
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:15,185
At Hera Palace?

787
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:17,650
Those jerks.

788
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:21,285
Why are they getting engaged
at my Hera Palace?

789
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,198
They did this to me,
but they're happily getting engaged?

790
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,099
I can't let that happen.

791
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:29,595
They're the reason I'm in this mess.

792
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,239
- Secretary Cho.
- Yes?

793
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,639
Get me some explosives.

794
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:35,634
Something more powerful
than the ones we used on Logan.

795
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,435
About ten claymore explosives
over 5kg each should work.

796
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,205
Pardon? What do you plan to do?

797
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,105
You jerk.

798
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,714
You can do it, right?

799
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:50,084
Yes, sir.

800
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,254
I'll kill them for real this time.

801
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:57,484

Sir.

806

Is this...

807
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,754
really the only option?

808
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:44,325
It could kill too many people.

809
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,564
If you stop this now...

810
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,939
Shut your mouth.

811
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,964
I'm putting everything on the line.

812
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,375

You know I hate traitors
more than anything.

After all those beatings,
you still didn't get it.

822
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,265
Congratulations on the engagement, Logan.
You look great today.

823
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:04,269

for Ro Na and Min Hyuk.

826
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,544
I'm so upset that so few people
were invited to this lovely event.

827
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,814

was always full of people.

There are bombs in Hera Palace.

861

Evacuate the residents first.

- We don't have time!
- What? Bombs?

01:03:57,809 --> 01:03:59,250
We need to evacuate everyone.

882
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,920
If not, we all die. Now!

883
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,150
The elderly and children go first.

884
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,245
Quickly!

885
01:04:05,389 --> 01:04:07,889
Those of you who didn't get on
the elevator, use those stairs.

886
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,690
Slow down so no one gets hurt!

887
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,329
Quickly! Come this way!

888
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:12,924
Be careful, everyone.

889
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:00,375
Thank you for coming
to my engagement party, Joo Dan Tae.

890
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,174
You finally showed up.

891
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:09,884
At last,

892
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,314
I can kill you with my own hands.

893
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,855
Do you really think that can happen?

894
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:20,500
Congratulations on your
engagement to Logan.

895
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,469
I prepared a last-minute present.

896
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:25,395
I wonder if you'll like it.

897
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:29,099
If I press this button,

898
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:33,105
it will set off the bombs in
the fountain and the penthouse

899
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,940
They're much stronger than the ones
I set up in Logan's car last time.

900
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,544
You can look forward to them.

901
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,004
Boom.

902
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:42,214
Boom.

903
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,314
You crazy jerk.

904
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,190
If you want to die, die alone.

905
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,555
Why should I be the only one to die?

906
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:54,055
What did I do wrong?

907
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,595
Do you know that it was your dad...

908
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,334
who killed my mom and sister?

909
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:02,369
Your father, who worked for
Simoon Construction,

910
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:04,340
took away my house.

911
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,480
What's so wrong with taking back
what was taken from me?

912
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,845
Lot 27 of Cheonsoo District
always belonged to my dad.

913
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,375
It was your parents who lived on
that land without permission.

914
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,989
The demolition accident was all
Baek Joon Ki's father.

915
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:19,590
My dad knew nothing.

916
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,084
Don't make excuses!

917
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,855
The noble Shim Su Ryeon...

918
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,300
never admits to doing anything wrong
even until the end.

919
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,694
Don't move.

920
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,935
How dare you defile my Hera Palace?

921
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,504
Only I can have this place.
Only I can destroy it.

922
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,435
If I can't have it, no one can.
You understand?

923
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:45,504
Dying alone felt lonely.

924
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:49,515
It comforts me to know that
it will be with you.

925
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,685
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

926
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:56,314
That's the perfect outfit
for you to wear to the fiery pit.

927
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:06,834
Drop the remote.

928
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:10,935
You think you can shoot me?

929
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:14,110
I will press the button
the moment you pull the trigger.

930
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,705
Then Hera Palace will disappear
in the blink of an eye.

931
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,674
Come on. Shoot me!

932
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,659
I said, drop the remote!

933
01:07:28,659 --> 01:07:31,225
And I said you'll die
if you keep challenging me.

934
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,084
Just like your ex-husband.

935
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,095
Just like Min Seol A.
Just like Oh Yoon Hee!

936
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,064
Shoot me!

937
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:50,679
This is for all the innocent lives
you took away!

938
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:52,044
You're crazy!

939
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,415
How dare you shoot at me,
the mighty Joo Dan Tae?

940
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:59,345
Are you still obsessed
with that name?

941
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:35,415
This is you paying...

942
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:39,125
for all the crimes you've committed.

943
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,034
Drop the remote!

944
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,634
Shim Su Ryeon, let's go together...

945
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:00,874
to the fiery pit.

946
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:57,390
(The Penthouse 3)

947
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,050
Mom, please don't die.

948
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,390
Please survive!

949
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:01,989
Mommy loves you so much.

950
01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:04,060
You died a death that you deserved.

951
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,460
Cheon Seo Jin is the only one left.

952
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,000
What if he dies because of me?

953
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,930
Live happily, Ro Na.

954
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,000
Mom!

955
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,199
I'll save Eun Byeol.

956
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,069
I must push forward.

957
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:15,834
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.
