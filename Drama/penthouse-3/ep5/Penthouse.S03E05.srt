00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh... Oh... Oh Yoon Hee...

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,270

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,010
That's nice and sweet.

6
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,379
Drink up.

7
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,419
Are you touched?

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,488
No matter how busy I am,
I can always buy you a drink.

9
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,690
Boss.

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,359
Chairman Joo is suspecting you.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,940
He thinks something's fishy
about the fountain repair work.

12
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,059
What?

13
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,690
So please...

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,270
Just stop here, I beg you.

15
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,669
I can't.

16
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,540
The only proof of my innocence
is there.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,839
I can't let anyone take it.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,909
- Boss!
- I said, I can't!

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,889
How could you...

20
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,059
I don't want you to get hurt.

21
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,169
- Take him to the cottage.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,880
Dad.

23
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,850
Dad, where are you?

24
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,090
Dad!

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,689
My gosh!

26
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,700
You startled me!

27
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,970
You're home.

28
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,070
Mr. Joo isn't home yet.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,899
Have this while you wait for him.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,609
Put this away.

31
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,530
Why am I so sleepy?

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,810
You must be tired.

33
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,380
Lie down in your bed.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,519
What do we do now?

35
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,488
- What's going on?
- Take her away.

36
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,299
Let go! Let go of me!

40
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:35,709
Get her!

41
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,060
Those useless jerks.

42
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:03,010
Oh Yoon Hee.
You must have a death wish.

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,149
Eun Byeol, wake up!

44
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,950
Where am I?

Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol, wake up!

49
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,250
Stop it!

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,829
Yoon Hee, please protect Eun Byeol.

51
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,229
I'll beg your forgiveness
for the rest of my life.

52
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,329
I'll do anything for you.

53
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,769
I'll die if you tell me to,

54
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,240
so please save her.

55
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:08,769
I see police officers.

56
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:11,909
We can find Eun Byeol.

57
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,018
- What happened?
- Have you found Eun Byeol?

58
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,158
Not yet. The CCTV footage
shows the car...

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,130
passing through the Gimpo tollgate.

60
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,828

A navy SUV was seen...

62
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,528
driving up the mountain
toward Kiam Cliffs.

63
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,129
Yes, that's the car.

64
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,869
Well, this is the driver.

65
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,768
We don't have time for this.

66
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,709
I'll find Eun Byeol myself.

67
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,839
Eun Byeol.

68
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,510
Seo Jin! Stop, there!

69
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,449
Request backup at Kiam Cliffs.

70
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,950

Hang in there a little longer,
Eun Byeol.

73

She's still in the car!

Let's see how strong you are.

79
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,620
How annoying.

80
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,360

What is it you wanted to tell me?

92
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,889
You said it was something important.

Of course. My mom went to find her,
so we'll hear from her soon.

I do, but I keep getting
a bad feeling in my stomach.

If something happens to my mom,

139
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,089
I can't go on living.

140

No, don't say that.

141
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,900
Your mom will be back.

142
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,329
She loves you too much
to let anything happen.

143

No one was here when I came.

150
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,280

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,320
I think Yoon Hee fell into the lake.

153
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,430
I heard a loud sound.
I'm sure something happened to her.

154
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,499
Please tell me what you saw
when you got here.

155
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,200
The fog was too dense to see much.

156
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,498
When I got here, I heard a scream.
So I came running...

157
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,169
and Eun Byeol was here alone.

158
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,180
Tell the truth!
Did you really not see Yoon Hee?

159
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,979
I really didn't see anything.

160
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,849
It looks like
two cars fell off the cliff.

161
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,889
Please send a search team.

162
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,689
If Yoon Hee was in the car...

163
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,319
It's late and there's rain
in the forecast...

164
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,758
- Over here! Here!
- It won't be easy.

165
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,258
Once it gets light out...

166
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,099
How can we wait?
A person may die during that time.

167
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,769
Please find Yoon Hee quickly.
Please.

168
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,738
Send in divers...

169
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,599
to search the lake.

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,369
- Yoon Hee!
- Get back!

171
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,339

172
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,409

was looking for...

in here?

178
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,390
Did you find it?

179
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,759
It was in Oh Yoon Hee's pocket.

00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,280
I warned you...

188
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,349
to stay out of it.

189
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,559
This looks like a key to a safe.

190
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,890
A key to a safe?

191
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,739
Is this how Logan's riches
come into my possession?

192
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,478
This is why I can't fire you.

193
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,650
Every once in a while,

194
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,550
you're useful.

195
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,359
Yes... Ten billion dollars.

196
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,289
Yoon Hee.

197
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,828
We can't search right now.
The winds are too strong.

198
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,700
The way down the cliff is
too dangerous.

199
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,176
What if you miss the golden time
by the time you get there?

200
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Are you saying
we should all die looking for her?

201
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,509
Everyone will die if we continue.

202
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,979
The Dive Unit is getting ready,
so please wait.

203
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,339
Let's pull out!

204
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,450
Please...

205
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh... Oh... Oh Yoon Hee...

206
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,289
Why are you so shocked,

207
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,290
murderer Yoo Dong Pil?

208
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,129
Dan Tae.

209
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,900
It was bad enough that you hid
Kim Mi Sook's body in the fountain.

210
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,239
Did you kill and bury
Yoon Hee as well?

211
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,868
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

212
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,910
Who would believe that?

213
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,410
Look at the evidence right now.

214
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,910
Dan Tae, you demon.

215
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,820
You set this up. You rat.

216
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,749
Die, you rat!

217
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,160
You'll kill me too?

218
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,958
Just wait, you serial killer.

219
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,089
You rat.

220
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,329
What is it? What are you recording?

221
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,070
You're not working with this trash,
are you?

222
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,669
Help me. This rat needs to die.

223
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,868
Kill me if you can.

224
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,410
Your daughter will love that.

225
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,838
She'll love it
if her dad becomes famous.

226
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,108
Think about Jenny, will you?

227
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,248
Don't say Jenny's name
with that disgusting mouth.

228
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:29,348
Let go of him, Yoo Dong Pil.

229
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:31,050
I said to let go!

230
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,329
How could you do this to me?

231
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,468
There was a reason they never found
Kim Mi Sook's body...

232
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,440
that was thrown
off of Cheongpyeong Dam.

233
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,440
The body was in this fountain.

234
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,910
Why was that?

235
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,079
Yes... Was it because of this?

236
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,020
- Her cell phone.
- Give me that.

237
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:10,160
She was clutching this
with all her might.

238
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,930
There's something amusing in it.

239
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,370
Evidence that I killed her.

240
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,999
Was that why you faked
this construction? To find this?

241
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,870
To stab me in the back?

242
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:30,580
I trusted you though.

243
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,649
How could you betray me?

244
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,650
Since when? Since six years ago?

245
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,890
You betrayed me first.

246
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:41,590
Why did you harass Jenny?

247
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,859
You promised to protect my family.

248
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,258
I had planned to keep my mouth shut
if you had kept your promise.

249
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,330
Why? Why did you harass Jenny?

250
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,998
You...

251
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,499
and Joo Seok Kyung.

252
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,038
I will make the both of you pay.

253
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,009
Oh, is that why you killed
my poor Seok Kyung too?

254
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,748
What nonsense is that?

255
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,680
Seok Kyung's at the cottage
you fell asleep in last night.

256
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,419
However much you hated her,

257
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,219
that kind of revenge
is just dreadful.

258
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,629
I never saw Seok Kyung today!

259
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,958
The truth doesn't matter.

260
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,330
What matters is proof.

261
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,830
And the proof is irrefutable.

262
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,568
I have proof that...

263
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,900
you were at the cottage
until early morning.

264
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,208
I even created
a lovely story where...

265
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,739
you bought Ha Eun Byeol's tutor
and even murdered Oh Yoon Hee.

266
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,249
Joo Dan Tae, you lunatic.

267
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,380
No, no. You're the lunatic.

268
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:44,649
The world will soon be captivated...

269
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,590
with the story of a psychopath.

270
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,228
"The culprit of the body-less
Cheongpyeong Dam murder..."

271
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:54,359
"from six years ago struck again."

272
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,929
"He killed a neighbor
who'd been harassing his daughter,"

273
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,238
"and left her body in Hera Palace's
fountain as if on display."

274
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,909
"He also kidnapped and detained
the ringleader who had..."

275
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,409
"bullied his daughter at school,"

276
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,978
"and caused her to die
a dreadful death."

277
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,978
That's nonsense.
I didn't kill Oh Yoon Hee.

278
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,080
I didn't kill anyone!

279
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,389
You argued with her
yesterday morning by the fountain.

280
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,989
I bet most of Hera Palace's
residents saw you.

281
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,458
A doting dad found out his daughter
had been bullied at school,

282
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:27,200
and as soon as he was released,
he went after all the bullies.

283
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,269
Soon, the police will arrest you
in front of your daughter.

284
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh. Don't worry about your family.

285
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:37,039
I'll kill them all.

286
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,610
Let's see.

287
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,749
It's Jenny.

288
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,160
Dad, why aren't you coming home?

289
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,690
Are you in trouble again?

290
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,700
Do you know how worried
Mom and I are, waiting up for you?

291
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:09,039
Your poor filial daughter Jenny
will be so disappointed.

292
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,808
She was reunited with her dad
after six years...

293
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,209
and now he has
to rot in prison forever.

294
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,620
I deserve to die
for what I did, sir!

295
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,788
Please let my family live.

296
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,349
I was crazy.

297
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,258
I'll do anything you want, sir.

298
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,889
How can I trust
someone who betrayed me?

299
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,929
Go on.

300
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,830
Call the police
that we have a serial killer.

301
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,069
Ho Young. No, Ho Young. Don't.

302
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,140
My Jenny will really die!

303
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,610
No, sir, please.

304
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,170
Please, give me another chance.

305
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,739
Leave my family alone.

306
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,080
Sir. Chairman Joo.

307
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,850
My life now belongs to you.

308
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,249
Please, for old time's sake...

309
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,120
I am just too softhearted
for my own good.

310
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,489
I'm trusting a man
who betrayed me once already.

311
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,360
But remember this.

312
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
Stab me in the back once more,

313
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,940
and your wife and daughter all die.

314
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,870
Thank you, sir.

315
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,709
I will remember your mercy
for the rest of my life.

316
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:20,539
Thank you.

317
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,779
First things first,
deal with Yoon Hee's body yourself.

318
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,519
I need something to trust you with.

319
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,890
Make sure she's found
as soon as possible.

320
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,390
Let's not leave her
in the cold water for too long.

321
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,338
There are no noticeable injuries.

322
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,109
We'll run a thorough examination
once she wakes up.

323
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:33,780
Thank you.

324
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,790
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

325
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,260
Don't worry anymore.

326
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,430
Mom will protect you.

327
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,869
It's all over now.

328
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,440
It's really all over.

329
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,730
What happened?
Did I fall asleep here?

330
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,309
Dad.

331
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,680
Hey. You're up.

332
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,809
Were you so tired
you couldn't wake when I shook you?

333
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,020
I don't remember.

334
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,118
Did I sleep all through the night?

335
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,819
You fell asleep having a snack.

336
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,118
It's for the best.
You need to release some stress.

337
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,989
Thanks to you,
I watched a movie alone...

338
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,460
and spent a boring night.

339
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,398
Sorry.

340
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,899
It's fine. Let's have breakfast.
I ordered from a hotel.

341
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,429
Everybody else will be freaked out.

342
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,300
I never slept out
without telling anyone.

343
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,039
Did Mom call?

344
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,270
No. Didn't you tell her
you'd be here?

345
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,740
I didn't.

346
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,339
She doesn't know I'm here.

347
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,960
How come neither Mom
nor Seok Hoon called even once?

348
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,260
Are they not even worried?

349
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,930
They must be busy with something.

350
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,329
Or are they grateful
the troublemaker's gone?

351
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,540
I'll take you home after breakfast.

352
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,510
No. I won't go home.

353
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,879
Why should I go back
when they don't care about me?

354
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,879
I'll only be an unwanted guest.

355
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,950
I'll wait and see when they call.

356
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,190
Can I stay here for a while?

357
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,589
Of course. Do whatever you want.

358
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,740
(Police)

359
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,639
- You can't go inside.
- We're family.

360
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:16,338
Mom. What happened?

361
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:17,808
Why are you here?

362
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,709
Ro Na was too worried
to stay at home.

363
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,749
They found Eun Byeol.
So where's my mom?

364
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,019
Did her car fall into the lake?

365
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,049
If they haven't found her yet,
does that mean she's dead?

366
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,859
- She can't swim.
- Why would she be dead?

367
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,959
They're still searching.
They'll find her soon.

368
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,030
I'm scared. I'm scared to death.

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,398
Let's brace ourselves and wait.

370
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:41,099
- It's coming up!
- They found something.

371
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,899
It's a car!

372
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,490
Yoon Hee, please.

373
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,859
Mom!

374
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:09,099
Mom...

375
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:14,299
Why won't your dad pick up?

376
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,999
- They fell off...
- He slept out without calling.

377
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,799
I don't believe this.

378
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,868
- It's being pulled up.
- What is he up to?

379
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,868
Mom, look at that.

380
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:24,838
- Isn't that Ro Na's mom?
- They were both in the car.

381
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,648
Ms. Oh kidnapped a neighbor,

382
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:28,408
Cheong A Arts High School
student Ms. Ha...

383
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:29,618
- A kidnapping?
- And fled...

384
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,348
- A kidnapping?
- They fell...

385
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:32,588
What's that about?

386
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:34,918
- Who is the Ha student?
- Three years ago...

387
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,459
- Is it Ha Eun Byeol?
- Cheong A Arts High School...

388
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,429
Ro Na's mom kidnapped Eun Byeol?

389
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,259
That makes no sense.

390
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,098
Why would she get into trouble
during probation?

391
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:46,368
It's said she committed the crime
out of revenge.

392
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,499
- Honey.
- Dad.

393
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,638
Where were you all night?

394
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:51,099
Did you watch the news?
It's crazy. They say...

395
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:52,540
Why won't you answer?

396
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,470
What's up with your father?

397
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,409
Answer when someone calls.

398
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,118
What's up with your face?
Who did this to you?

399
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,550
Never mind.

400
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,690
Was it that jerk Joo Dan Tae?

401
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,259
Don't call him that from now on.

402
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,730
Should I say scumbag then?

403
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,598
Are you done with the job?
What happened?

404
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,869
Did you succeed?

405
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,799
You said the body was buried
in the fountain.

406
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,440
You said you'd take it out soon.

407
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,839
It's all over.

408
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,010
I'm not going to get revenge.

409
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:32,179
I decided to obey Chairman Joo.

410
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,510
Did he threaten you?

411
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,119
He's the one who beat you up, right?

412
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:38,949
I swear that scumbag...

413
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,220
Just stay the heck out of it!

414
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,888
I'll deal with it.

415
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,730
You don't do anything.

416
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,289
Don't go looking for Chairman Joo.

417
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,529
Don't cause any more trouble...

418
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,668
trying to uncover the truth.

419
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:53,899
Please!

420
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,010
Did you just yell at me?

421
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,409
Dad! Dad, come out!

422
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,520
Ro Na's mom disappeared in the lake.

423
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,119
No one knows where she is.

424
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,359
Are you listening to me? Dad!

425
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,889
Can you...

426
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,240
Dad, we have a problem. Come out!

427
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:30,770
Dad!

428
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,869
You're driving me crazy.

429
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,108
After she was released,

430
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,179
the perpetrator once again used
her perverse maternal love...

431
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,418
to kidnap Cheong A Arts High School
student Ms. Ha,

432
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:46,119
causing great shock.

433
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:50,289
My goodness. That's insane.

434
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,359
It hasn't even been that long since
she was released. How dare she?

435
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,089
Did she just give up on life?

436
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,858
Why would she do that
after starting her business thing?

437
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,098
It's true that Ha Eun Byeol
was never fully punished.

438
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,829
She never apologized to Bae Ro Na.

439
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,939
They were fighting again
at school yesterday.

440
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,439
Ro Na can't forgive, can she?

441
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,979
Serving time at a reformatory
wasn't enough?

442
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,979
What else does she want?

443
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,408
Isn't it time she let it go?

444
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:15,750
She's such a brat.

445
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,749
Even though Ms. Bae was
on the waiting list...

446
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,689
- Ms. Oh's crime caused...
- What?

447
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,289
I'm going to school.

448
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,819
No.

449
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,529
You're both wrong.

450
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,459
Things are unraveling
very strangely now.

451
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,229
Do you know anything?

452
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,230
They still cannot find Ms. Oh.

453
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,568
She's not the kind of woman
who can disappear like that.

454
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,839
Oh Yoon Hee.

455
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,679
Then how should she disappear?

456
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,479
To do that, with all that money?

457
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,908
That makes no sense.

458
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:51,379
It's ten billion dollars!
Ten billion.

459
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:55,089
Someone like that does something
that will put her on the news?

460
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,260
Everyone is paying attention to
Ms. Oh's whereabouts.

461
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,530
Amazing.

462
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:19,510
What is this?

463
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,680
I thought it was ten billion.

464
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:24,819
Where is it?

465
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,589
What?

466
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,559
How are you here?

467
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,159
I'm here.

468
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,169
Kyu Jin always appears
when you least expect it.

469
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,868
Gosh.

470
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:46,210
You were going to take the ten billion
without even telling me?

471
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,638
I had this weird feeling...

472
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,309
as soon as I heard the news
that Oh Yoon Hee had gone missing.

473
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:54,408
Oh Yoon Hee. Did you do it?

474
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,848
What are you talking about?

475
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:58,888
Then why do you have...

476
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,450
the key to Oh Yoon Hee's safe?

477
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,219
That...

478
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,730
Don't underestimate me.
I'm a lawyer, after all.

479
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,999
I'm not interested in the truth.

480
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,259
What I need is money.

481
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,368
Half the money for shutting me up.

482
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,668
Are you crazy? Why would
I split it halfway with you?

483
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,440
Then should I reveal the truth
about the center to the police...

484
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,608
as to how Oh Yoon Hee's key
ended up in your hands?

485
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:26,348
You're such a weasel.

486
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:30,119
Also, is this all there is?

487
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,049
You said ten billion dollars!

488
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,388
Why are you acting out?

489
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:34,790
Where did all the money go?

490
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,819
Anyway, let's split everything...

491
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,589
in here in half. Okay?

492
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,699
With this, I shall buy some
Cheong A Art Center shares first.

493
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,970
I guess I am just
meant to be the Director.

494
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,440
Wow. I never thought Oh Yoon Hee
could ever be helpful to us.

495
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,680
Let's smile, okay?

496
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,889
Ten billion.

497
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,300
That Oh Yoon Hee...

498
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,240
She toys with you.

499
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,240
When did she hide all the money?

500
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,980
Can it be...?

501
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,450
Could she have taken it out then?

502
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,220
Look into everyone Oh Yoon Hee
met with recently.

503
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,989
Her phone records, activities,
and her mail... Search everything.

504
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,260
Yes, sir.

505
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:49,629
Hey.

506
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,270
Here's your tip.

507
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,240
Thank you. Thank you so much.

508
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,440
Thank you, Chairman! Thank You.

509
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:05,649
You did well.

510
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,789
Where is that crazy girl right now?

(The Kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol:
Emergency Press Conference)

512
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,000
My name is Jin Bun Hong.

513
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,469
I am here...

514
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,809
to uncover the truth behind
the kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol...

515
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,049
as reported in the news today.

516
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,348
Who kidnapped Ha Eun Byeol?

517
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:43,119
Is it Oh Yoon Hee?

518
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,990
Yes, it is.

519
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,490
Oh Yoon Hee used her daughter
Bae Ro Na...

520
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,460
to confine Eun Byeol in her house.

521
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,398
As proof, I share with you
security footage from Hera Palace.

522
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:03,759
(The Kidnapping of Ha Eun Byeol:
Emergency Press Conference)

523
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,010
After learning that truth,

524
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:14,049
I barely succeeded in saving
Eun Byeol and running away,

525
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,879
when I was caught by Oh Yoon Hee.

526
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,890
Oh Yoon Hee kept following my car.

527
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,459
She eventually followed me to Gimpo.

528
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:27,660
And then...

529
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,760
she tried to kill
Eun Byeol and me...

530
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,499
by pushing my car off the cliff.

531
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,569
And I risked my life...

532
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:40,140
to get Eun Byeol out of the car...

533
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,209
and help her escape.

534
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,550
Oh Yoon Hee and I got into a fight.

535
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,918
Then she fell off the cliff.

536
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,849
Why was Oh Yoon Hee
trying to kill Ha Eun Byeol?

537
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,189
Oh Yoon Hee...

538
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,390
deliberately put a phone in
Eun Byeol's pocket...

539
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,188
at the SNU vocal performance test,

540
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:03,600
causing her to fail.

541
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,769
I, of course,

and Oh Yoon Hee's daughter...

543
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,269
was also disqualified for cheating.

544
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,338
So Oh Yoon Hee held a grudge.

545
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,439
She constantly threatened
Eun Byeol and me,

546
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,619
saying she'd kill us all.

547
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,689
Then why were you not at the scene?

548
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,019
I was scared.

549
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,459
I felt like it was all my fault...

550
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:35,260
that Eun Byeol ended up like that.

551
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:37,859
So...

552
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,629
I ran.

553
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:45,640
I worked as a housekeeper...

554
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:49,479
at the wealthy Korean-American
Logan Lee's house.

555
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,910
Logan Lee colluded with Oh Yoon Hee,

556
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,950
sending me to be Eun Byeol's tutor.

557
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:02,120
Offering me a great sum of money
I couldn't possibly refuse,

558
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,289
he told me...

559
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,229
to destroy Eun Byeol.

I knew it was the wrong thing to do,

562
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,600
but I drugged Eun Byeol...

563
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,109
to hinder her studying.

564
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,639
Oh Yoon Hee...

565
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,950
told me to stop Eun Byeol
from singing ever again...

566
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,379
but I just couldn't do it.

567
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,249
Because Eun Byeol ended up...

568
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:38,459
being a daughter figure to me.

569
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:58,280
Where's my daughter?

570
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,149
Where did you hide my daughter?

571
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,919
Your daughter?

572
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,289
You're crazier than I thought.

573
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,859
All I did is leave Eun Byeol
with you for a while.

574
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,958
And now you think
she's your own daughter?

575
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,858
If you laid a finger on Eun Byeol,

576
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,329

I'll kill you with my own hands!

577
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,870
I didn't lay a finger on her...

578
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:22,740
and sent her back to her mom.

579
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:23,999
You sent her back?

580
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:26,809
You promised you'd give her to me.

Eun Byeol from Seo Jin.

You might get arrested
for kidnapping.

585

Then you'll never be able
to see Eun Byeol again.

586

Is that okay?

587
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,458

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,979

594
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,680
pin everything on Oh Yoon Hee.

595
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,050

to reveal everything...

603
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,019

00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:33,530
Are you cold?

717
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,930
Seok Hoon, my mom looks like
she's freezing, right?

718
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,240
My beautiful mom,
why are you lying here?

719
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,080
Come home with me, okay?

720
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:57,220
I'll be good from now on.

721
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:58,748
I won't make you worry.

722
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,589
I'll do as you say.

723
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,720
So please wake up right now.

724
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,160
Mom, please.

725
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:12,499
Ro Na, calm down.

726
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:28,950
Yoon Hee.

727
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:33,390
Yoon Hee.

728
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:37,459
It's not true.
It's not true, is it, Yoon Hee?

729
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:41,689
Yoon Hee, you can't leave me
alone like this.

730
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:43,359
Yoon Hee.

731
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,260
Yoon Hee.

732
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,439
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

733
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,539
I'm sorry...

734
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,510
so please get up. Get up, Yoon Hee.

735
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,149
Yoon Hee.

736
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,060
The family requested an autopsy.

737
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,300
Don't worry.

738
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,999
What could they find on a body
that was in the water?

739
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,470
You may go.

740
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:36,450
Dan Tae! It was you, wasn't it?

741
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:38,219
You did it, didn't you?

742
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,850
What did I do? Let go of me!

743
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,918
You told Seo Jin...

744
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:45,458
that I was buying shares
of Cheong A Art Center!

745
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:47,358
Do you think
I have nothing better to do?

746
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,688
I haven't seen her all day!

747
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:51,299
Then how did she intercept...

748
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,930
Yoon Hee's shares
just before I got them?

749
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,939
Seo Jin got Yoon Hee's shares?

750
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,409
You really didn't know?

751
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,978
Hey... If Seo Jin gets those shares,

752
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,950
it'll flip the table completely!

753
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:10,878
With her original 15 percent
and Yoon Hee's 20 percent...

754
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:15,519
Seo Jin will become the director
of Cheong A Art center.

755
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,759
Seo Jin took Yoon Hee's shares.

756
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,969
I wanted that! It was mine!

757
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,228
- How did she know Yoon Hee died?
- I wanted it!

758
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:30,699
It was mine!

759
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,539
Things are getting interesting.

760
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,338
I've put Oh Yoon Hee's shares
in your name...

761
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:40,209
and processed it as a donation.

762
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:42,629
Congratulations on becoming
the center director.

763
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,049
Watch your mouth.

764
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,819
It hasn't been officially announced.

765
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:48,849
Any word from the admissions office
at Seoul University?

766
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,359
Some people are saying Eun Byeol,
the victim, should be saved.

767
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,229
Over 100,000 people signed
the petition as well.

768
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,359
Good work.

769
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,899
Drive the public sentiment
focused on the community.

770
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,870
Are you not going to the funeral?

771
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,280
Why must the victim's mom go
to the perpetrator's funeral?

772
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,280
I'm not that magnanimous.

773
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,300
(The late Oh Yoon Hee)

774
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:33,959
Sang A.

775
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:37,359
Kyu Jin didn't come?

776
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:40,029
Someone who does big things
shouldn't go...

777
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,370
where there's bad energy.

778
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:44,168
He's the only son
of three generations.

779
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,669
He should avoid bad energy
as much as he can.

780
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:48,708
What about Jenny's dad?

781
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:51,378
He didn't know Yoon Hee.

782
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:53,550
He fought with someone
he didn't know?

783
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,719
Everyone says
the two of them went at it...

784
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,279
grabbing each other
by the collar yesterday.

785
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,249
My husband fought with Yoon Hee?

786
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:03,918
But...

787
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:08,359
Given the situation, who will
take over Yoon Hee's business?

788
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:11,628
It's in a good location
and has a lot of customers.

789
00:51:11,629 --> 00:51:12,959
I kind of want it.

790
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:17,099
Are you working on it already?

791
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,568
How could you say that right now?

792
00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:21,369
I know.

793
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,108
Why are you getting so mad?
Is it wrong to even talk?

794
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:26,079
You shouldn't be like that.

795
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,450
Love her or hate her,
she was our neighbor.

796
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:32,249
Don't you feel sorry for Yoon Hee
who died and left her child alone?

797
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,359
Mom. I'm going to stay with Ro Na.

798
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,389
Jenny. Don't go by yourself.

799
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,760
I'll go with you.

800
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:47,370
Gosh. Since when were they so close
to Yoon Hee? Give me a break.

801
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,199
Don't you agree, Min Hyuk?

802
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,600
Even I'm disappointed...

803
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:52,669
in you.

804
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:11,390
- Over here. Hurry!
- This is it.

805
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,159
You're Oh Yoon Hee's daughter,
right?

806
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,529
People are calling your mom
Admissions Murderer.

807
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,029
Your mom killed someone your age...

808
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,429
to get you into
Cheong A Arts High School.

809
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,829
Don't you feel bad
for the girl who died?

810
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,599
Don't you want to say something
to Ha Eun Byeol?

811
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,898
Say a word.

812
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:25,838
What are you doing?
This is a funeral!

813
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,068
- She lost her mom.
- Shim Su Ryeon?

814
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:30,009
Aren't you
Min Seol A's biological mother?

815
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,708
If you hadn't gone easy
on Oh Yoon Hee,

816
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:34,049
there never would've been
a second victim.

817
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,050
What do you say to that?

818
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,679
How was Oh Yoon Hee released?

819
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,978
Was there an improper dealing?

820
00:52:37,979 --> 00:52:40,390
Please refrain from statements
that slander the deceased.

821
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,220
What is being reported by the media
is far from the truth.

822
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,490
Oh Yoon Hee is not
the type of person you think.

823
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:51,359
Seok Hoon. Take Ro Na out of here.

824
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,568
- Shim Su Ryeon...
- How do you feel?

825
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:55,470
Please, comment.

826
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,069
- Ro Na!
- Ro Na.

827
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,809
Hey, you! What's going on?

828
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,579
Who are you people?

829
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,708
Get away from her.

830
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:11,120
You jerks. How dare you?

831
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,620
Mom!

832
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:15,720
Ro Na!

833
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:22,289
Get out!

834
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,519
You seem to be in a good mood.

835
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,489
Is it because that woman
Oh Yoon Hee died?

836
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,459
Are you still here?

837
00:53:57,129 --> 00:54:00,629
Did you not like the luxury hotel
that I booked for you?

838
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,269
I told you.

839
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,870
I won't step foot outside of here...

840
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:10,069
until you give me 50 percent
of Cheong A Group's shares.

841
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:13,479
There isn't much time.
You have until this weekend.

842
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,248
If your true identity is revealed,

843
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:17,050
forget the business
in Cheonsoo District.

844
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,819
You won't be able to live
in this country.

845
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:22,148
Is that okay with you?

846
00:54:22,149 --> 00:54:24,760
You need to be reasonable
if you want to negotiate.

847
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:28,160
Should I prove in court
who the real Joo Dan Tae is?

848
00:54:29,189 --> 00:54:31,858
All the bank accounts and property
that you obtained in my name...

849
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,600
will become mine.

850
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,069
You'll return to being
the murderer Baek Jun Ki.

851
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,910
If you don't like that,
you can live as a ghost.

852
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,979
It's not so bad.

853
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:49,050
Hide, hide well

854
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:51,680
I can see your hair

855
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:04,129
Hey, Mr. Yoo. Where are you?

856
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,010
What?

857
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,780
Why are you so shocked?

858
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:24,479
Didn't you say you'd do everything
I order you to from now on?

859
00:55:25,379 --> 00:55:28,050
Did you change your mind already?

860
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,589
No, Mr. Chairman.

861
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:32,859
I'll do it.

862
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,490
I'm relying on you.

863
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:40,129
I can't wait to see
how you get rid of that jerk Jun Ki.

864
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,140
(Parking Lot, Procession)

865
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:55,878
Don't go anywhere.
Don't talk to anyone.

866
00:55:55,879 --> 00:55:57,119
I'll go to you now.

867
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,479
What is it?

868
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,890
I'll tell you in person.

869
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,850
It's very important.

870
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,089
Call Seok Kyung and tell her
to come home right now.

871
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,380
And tell her not to answer the phone
if Dan Tae calls.

872
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,330
What could it have been?
What was so important?

873
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:18,200
Why did she ask for Seok Kyung?

874
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,839
What were you keeping from me,
Yoon Hee?

875
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,720
The phone is turned off.

876
00:56:36,919 --> 00:56:38,459
How's Ro Na?

877
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:42,560
She hasn't slept at all
and won't eat anything.

878
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,560
Stay with her and take care of her.

879
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,129
Don't leave her alone.

880
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,069
Did you try calling Seok Kyung?

881
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:52,640
No.

882
00:56:54,439 --> 00:56:56,268
Her phone's been off the whole day.

883
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:57,879
And she hasn't come home.

884
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,339
She's trying to make us worry.

885
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,349
She decided to act out.

886
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,850
She must know if she saw the news,

887
00:57:04,149 --> 00:57:05,450
and she hasn't been by.

888
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:12,560
Don't worry, Mom.

889
00:57:20,629 --> 00:57:21,629
(The late Oh Yoon Hee)

890
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:52,999
Ro Na.

891
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,470
I'm sorry.

892
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,879
I thought...

893
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:09,450
I'd never show up
in front of you again.

894
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:12,649
How dare you...

895
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,419
show your face here?

896
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:19,390
What gives you the right
to visit my mom?

897
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,089
Do you think...

898
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,729
that little of Mom and me?

899
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,359
Ro Na.

900
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:28,530
What you did to me,

901
00:58:29,069 --> 00:58:30,470
I can put up with.

902
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,970
You bribed my piano accompanist,

903
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:37,510
and you faked Eun Byeol's evidence
and I can accept all that.

904
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:40,979
You did it for your daughter's sake.

905
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,180
But...

906
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,680
you shouldn't have
treated my mom like that.

907
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,720
My mom cared so much for you!

908
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:53,390
I know that...

909
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,990
nothing I say...

910
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,600
can make you forgive me.

911
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,240
But I wanted to ask for it.

912
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,370
From you...

913
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:10,709
and from your mom.

914
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:13,780
Can you...

915
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,220
give me one more chance?

916
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:21,519
A chance?

917
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,819
For what?

918
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,859
If my mom never forgave you,

919
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,300
you have no chance with me either.

920
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:34,728
The fact that someone like you
were my dad for even a while...

921
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:36,700
gives me the creeps!

922
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,838
Don't come here again...

923
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,568
and don't act like you know me.

924
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:43,410
I don't want to see you again!

925
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:47,609
Get out.

926
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,080
Get out of here!

927
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,919
Get out!

928
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,419
Get out of here now!

929
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:58,459
Get out! Leave.

930
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,560
Get out of here.

931
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,830
Get out! Leave!

932
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,839
Leave!

933
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:33,820
Mom.

934
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,960
I'm here.

935
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,199
I'm home.

936
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,969
Ro Na's here.

937
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:50,010
Where are you? Where did you go?

938
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:54,039
Mom! Mom, where are you?

939
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,679
Where did you go?

940
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:01,349
Mom.

941
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,849
Where are you?

942
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,519
Hi!

943
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:45,530
You're back.

944
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:48,929
What happened to you?

945
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,698
I couldn't reach you.

946
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,169
Where were you for days?

947
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,839
You were too busy...

948
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,469
staying up at someone's funeral
to care if your daughter was alive.

949
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,069
Why are you making a fuss now?

950
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,539
Will you care about me
only when I'm dead too?

951
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:03,949
Is that all you can say?

952
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,550
You should go and look after Ro Na.

953
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,150
She's an orphan now.

954
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:13,049
She's a lot like Min Seol A
in many ways.

955
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,289
Are you crazy?

956
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,059
Why are you acting like this?

957
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,788
Is this how you truly feel?

958
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:20,929
Why don't you
try to be honest for once?

959
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,030
Ro Na's mom is dead.

960
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,369
Aren't you
secretly pleased about it?

961
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:30,139
That woman was punished
for killing your daughter.

962
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:34,840
Please stop pretending to be good
and show how you really feel.

963
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:38,948
I won't care anymore...

964
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:41,780
how you live your life
or what you do with your dad.

965
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,789
You're no longer my daughter.

966
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:49,159
Now you're showing your true colors.

967
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,329
It's not like you treated me
like a daughter!

968
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,130
Ma'am. Ma'am!

969
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,469
Pack Seok Kyung's things
and send her away.

970
01:02:58,829 --> 01:03:00,869
And don't let her in again.

971
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,638
Change all the passcodes
and clear out her room.

972
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:05,968
Hye In will move into her room.

973
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:07,139
Hye In?

974
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:09,678
Oh, is that it?

975
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:12,549
You're throwing me out
to bring home your real kids?

976
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,550
Let go of me!

977
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,649
Now you're being honest.

978
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,649
You're even worse than Dad.

979
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,018
Dad didn't abandon me at least.

980
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:21,989
Fine! Sure!

981
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:24,189
If that's what you want,
I'll disappear!

982
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,289
Okay?

983
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:29,159
Move.

984
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:38,340
Don't even dream of coming back
unless you'll apologize to Mom.

985
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:41,340
Seeing the way you live...

986
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:43,710
makes me sick.

987
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:45,780
I don't need Mom anyway.

988
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:49,179
I won't see her again. I won't!

989
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,380
("Paradise Lost")

990
01:04:20,349 --> 01:04:22,019
I bought it for you.

991
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:23,820
Read it when you can't sleep.

992
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,820
Thank you.

993
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:31,659
("Paradise Lost")

994
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,340
Ms. Shim, you have a visitor.

995
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,650
("Paradise Lost")

996
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:01,119
Do you drink purple tea?

997
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,820
Yes.

998
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,260
The tea is actually purple.

999
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,269
It's a mysterious color,
just like you.

1000
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:19,610
Are you making progress
with getting your name back?

1001
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,440
To put pressure on Joo Dan Tae,

1002
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:26,849
you must recover
your legal identity first.

1003
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:30,289
That's why Logan brought you here.

1004
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,260
Will you meet with my lawyer
when you're free?

1005
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:36,989
I was locked up for a while,

1006
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,530
and everything is scary and new.

1007
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:41,300
Okay, I'll join you.

1008
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:44,299
It's what Logan wanted to do.

1009
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,900
Of course, I must help.

1010
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,170
If...

1011
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:53,409
my parents hadn't died,

1012
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,809
and I was still living
as Joo Dan Tae...

1013
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,780
You and I...

1014
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,980
Would our fates have also changed?

1015
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,219
Never mind. Forget what I just said.

1016
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:15,329
Are you okay? Did you burn yourself?

1017
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,670
I'm fine. I'm going to go
wash my hands.

1018
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,280
Where did she put it?

1019
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:36,949
Ten billion dollars.

1020
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:40,419
What about the ten billion dollars
that you cashed up from real estate?

1021
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,558
Is all that money for her too?
That money...

1022
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:46,658
That money was meant for
Seol A to begin with.

1023
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:49,129
I've never thought of it as mine.

1024
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,429
What is this woman to you?

1025
01:06:51,699 --> 01:06:54,199
I like her.

1026
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:57,639
I want to spend my
newly-given life on her.

1027
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:00,579
My heart. And all my money.

1028
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,690
Darn it.

1029
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,570
("Paradise Lost")

1030
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,570
(Seoul Bank, 10 Billion Dollars)

1031
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:37,390
(Seoul Bank, 10 Billion Dollars)

1032
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:44,389
What are you doing here?

1033
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,559
I couldn't find the bathroom.

1034
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,730
I was touring the house.

1035
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,699
("Paradise Lost")

1036
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:59,099
The guest bathroom
is on the other side.

1037
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,940
Sorry.

1038
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,600
(Caller ID blocked)

1039
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,180
It's been a while, Ha Yoon Chul.

1040
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,750
What do you want?

1041
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:46,909
How can a person do such a thing?

1042
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:50,890
Didn't you promise you'd do anything
if I got you out of prison?

1043
01:08:50,989 --> 01:08:52,988
Are you sure Joo Dan Tae
thinks you're his man?

1044
01:08:52,989 --> 01:08:54,459
How many times have I told you?

1045
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,259
I'm lying down like a dog
and licking his feet.

1046
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,389
Is that good enough?

1047
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,960
You have to make sure Joo Dan Tae
gives you his absolute trust.

1048
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:03,560
That's your first mission.

1049
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,669
Now start your second mission.

1050
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,369
Who on earth are you?

1051
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,199
Why are you doing this to me?

1052
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:13,609
You have to earn your money.

1053
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:15,409
No such thing as a free lunch.

1054
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,420
Tell me what I need to do.

1055
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:26,689
But if it's related to Joo Dan Tae,
I won't do it anymore.

1056
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:29,260
This one will be worth it.

1057
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,528
I'll send you the address,
so leave now.

1058
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:34,199
Where do you want me to be
at this hour? It's past midnight.

1059
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:37,199
Go out the back door
to make sure no one follows you.

1060
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,899
I'll give you an hour.

1061
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,899
Hello. Hello?

1062
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,140
This scumbag!

1063
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:16,630
Hurray!

1064
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,528
Hurray!

1065
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:20,738
Oh, no!

1066
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:22,599
What a wonderful day!

1067
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,969
- What news!
- This is great.

1068
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:29,809
My son, you made it!
I love you so much!

1069
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,479
I'm so proud of you!

1070
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:37,179
This definitely will
ruin Chairman Joo's day.

1071
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,658
Who else from Hera Palace
got into Seoul University of Music,

1072
01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:43,489
other than our son?

1073
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:48,260
Exactly. This is
the best comeback ever!

1074
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,429
How can the person who ranked lowest
be the only one to get into SNU?

1075
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:55,139
What's the point of always
being top of class?

1076
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,109
You still can't beat the lucky one.

1077
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,909
I'm not the only one who got in.

1078
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:05,408
No way. There's someone else?

1079
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:08,849
Eun Byeol also got saved
and got into SNU.

1080
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,519
Didn't you hear?

1081
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,988
What?

1082
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:13,919
Has there ever been a case...

1083
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,090
where they re-selected
a disqualified candidate?

1084
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,960
Wasn't there a national petition?

1085
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:21,359
Maybe Ms. Cheon used her network.

1086
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,130
Let me go.

1087
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,198
There's no way to beat them.

1088
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,038
Including the Director of
Cheong A Art Center.

1089
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,538
Including Eun Byeol.

1090
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:32,869
What's happening?
Is fate on their side?

1091
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:39,880
I'm honestly more scared of
Ms. Cheon than Chairman Joo.

1092
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:41,419
Look at Oh Yoon Hee's death.

1093
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,849
She ended up making the one
person who was bothering her...

1094
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:47,220
just disappear like that. No?

1095
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:48,960
You're right.

1096
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:52,929
She's not an ordinary woman.

1097
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,229
I got chills.

Please!

1104
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:17,679
What happened?
Where's Jin Bun Hong?

1105
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,949
It was all Joo Dan Tae.

1106
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,249
- Are you alright?
- Get Eun Byeol out first!

1107

Get her out!

1110
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,960
I'll move when you get her out,
so do it now!

1111

1122
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,680
Say hello to my wife, Oh Yoon Hee.

Congratulations on
getting engaged, Seo Jin.

1124
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,079
Get on your knees and apologize...

1125
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:59,710
for slashing my throat.

1127

Admit that you lost to me
already 25 years ago.

1128

Get on your knees!

1129

I'm sorry.

Our ill-fated relationship
ends here.

1135

Goodbye.
