00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:49,916
PREVIOUSLY ON PENTHOUSE...

2
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,980
You're Vice Minister Yoon Kyung Eun
from the Ministry of Education, yes?

3
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,750
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me, ma'am.

4
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:00,750
Why did you ask to see me?

5
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,389
You're highly reputed to be
an educator with good character,

6
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:07,319
so I wanted to meet you.

7
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,200
I would like to become
a light for your future.

8
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:14,630
A light?

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,529
Who on earth are you?

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,870
Hello, Vice Minister Yoon.

11
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,009
I'm Jessica, the baby madam.

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,850
Baby madam?

13
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,950
Don't stare at me like that.
You're embarrassing me.

14
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,160
I may not look it, but I am
very interested in education.

15
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,219
I'm your fan.

16
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,358
It feels kind of cold.
How about we drink?

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,229
Here. Drink with us. Bottoms up.

18
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,699
I don't drink with people
I do not know.

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,970
Then... Have some fruit.
Here you go.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,338
I can get it myself.

21
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,639
Why are you so on guard?

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,879
Please make yourself comfortable.
Be comfortable.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,750
I am very comfortable right now.

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,318
I would not have come had I known
this was why you invited me.

25
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,448
I'm leaving.

26
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,490
Goodness. Wait.

27
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,549
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

28
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,089
Hush. What did you say? What?

29
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,030
I didn't invite you here
to waste your time.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,360
There's something you need to see.

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,640
Here. Ma'am.

32
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,470
This is nice.

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,110
They're VIP customers
in the next room over.

34
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,520
- Gosh.
- Minister Kang?

35
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,160
Gosh. Goodness.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,429
What great weather.

37
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,030
Are you telling me...

38
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,668
to take this bribe from you?

39
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:58,829
Minister.

40
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,400
What do you mean?
There's no bribe in this room.

41
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,109
We can't see or hear anything.

42
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,549
How did you read my mind so well?

43
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,919
I'm so moved!

44
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,630
You're so cool.

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,759
Please do what you can...

46
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,500
to get Gangnam's prestigious schools
to move to Cheonsoo District.

47
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,599
Prestigious high schools are
absolutely necessary...

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,839
in the model
submitted by Cheong A Constructions.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,668
Please make your decision.

50
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,978
You won't be a minister forever.

51
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,779
You have honor already.
It's time to become rich now.

52
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,910
- Yes!
- Me too.

53
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,579
Friends.

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,289
I don't know if this is right.

55
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,489
They're so beautiful.

56
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,699
Second lady. Come here.

57
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,399
Whatever!

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,629
Kindness shall never be forgotten!

59
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,510
- Kindness shall never be forgotten!
- Kindness shall never be forgotten!

60
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,108
Why don't you sing something, sir?

61
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,239
Are you ready to party?

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,279
Party with me all night long

63
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,620
Shout it out loud

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,219
Cheong A Constructions...

65
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,189
is lobbying Minister Kang...

66
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,060
to move the prestigious schools...

67
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,759
from Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District.

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,369
I knew he'd get in trouble
one of these days.

69
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,599
He was always obsessed with money.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,698
If the top high schools
in our nation...

71
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,810
are moved to Cheonsoo District,

72
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,780
young parents will storm
to buy houses there.

73
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,880
And the house prices
will shoot through the roof.

74
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,409
Because an education complex...

75
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,880
bigger than the one in Daechi-dong
will be created.

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,388
Education...

77
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,120
will be used in their ploy
to make money on real estate.

78
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,359
Why are you showing this to me?

79
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,729
We know you don't get along
with Minister Kang.

80
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,729
Everyone knows you're enemies.

81
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,400
We want the same thing.

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,140
Their demise.

83
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,410
It'll be enough
to get rid of Minister Kang.

84
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,010
I don't know what you're up to,

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,749
but making a deal with me like this
is also lobbying.

86
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,350
I am aware of that.

87
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:33,020
You don't have to get
your hands dirty.

88
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,760
I'll do everything myself.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,929
All you have to do is clean it up.

90
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,929
Clean it up?

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,399
Make sure...

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,530
the schools in School District Eight
can't be moved to Cheonsoo District.

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,538
Our children's education...

94
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,739
should not be used
for the sake of property value.

95
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,140
You've lived as an educator
your whole life.

96
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,179
Isn't your pride at stake?

97
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,090
Who are you?

98
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,960
Who?

99
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:14,960
Do whatever it takes to save Logan.

100
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,899
He doesn't need to function
as a human being.

101
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,530
Just keep him breathing.
That's why...

102
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,069
I got you out of prison.

103
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,910
I'm not a burn specialist.
He's hopeless!

104
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,410
I don't know when he'll die.

105
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,808
He needs more drugs.

106
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:30,569
He must be moved
to a large hospital quickly.

107
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,509
Let's talk in person.

108
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,580
Talk to the nurse.

109
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,220
What is that?

110
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,628
I said no outside drugs.

111
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,330
You said to save him at all costs.

112
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,358
I'm just doing my best
as a doctor...

113
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,700
to treat my patient, that is all.

114
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,499
Do you think
you're a reputable doctor?

115
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,499
Don't try to play doctor.

116
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,939
Just keep him alive.

117
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,340
Even a doctor who lost his license
can do that much, right?

118
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,820
How much do you know about me?

119
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,720
You're watching from there,
aren't you?

120
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,288
Who are you?

121
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,188
What's your relationship with Logan?

122
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,489
None of your business.
Shut it and do as I say.

123
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:18,830
If you're really worried about him,
use the drugs that are there.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,029
It'll relieve the excruciating pain.

125
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,928
Why are you trying to save him?

126
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,470
I said it's none of your business.

127
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:28,140
No one else can find out
that Logan is alive.

128
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,739
If it gets out...

129
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,580
your daughter's life
will be in danger.

130
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,780
What?

131
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
Remember this.

132
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,048
No matter what you do,
you're in the palm of my hand.

133
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,320
So don't try to do anything stupid.

134
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,089
I got you out of prison,

135
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,590
so you should lick
the soles of my feet.

136
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,030
Am I wrong?

137
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,189
Are you...

138
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,770
Are you Dan Tae?

139
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,770
Finish treating him.

140
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,970
You can go
once the nurse relieves you.

141
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,178
Who are you?
Show your face, you low life!

142
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,378
Are you Dan Tae? Show your face!

143
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:11,580
Hey, you!

144
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,629
I said to think about your daughter.

145
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm even prepared...

146
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,070
to lick the soles of your feet.

147
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,369
Yes. Think that it's Dan Tae.

148
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,510
That's what I want.

149
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,619
- That was great.
- I know.

150
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,420
Losers come in all shapes and sizes.

151
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,229
He's busy making offerings
to the people in power.

152
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,729
And he's busy
extorting subcontractors.

153
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,528
It's because scum like that
are in power...

154
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,800
that people like Yoon Hee died
wrongful deaths.

155
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,869
I'll gouge out everything
that is rotten.

156
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,139
Every single one.

157
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,210
Thank you.
It's an honor to work with you.

158
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:53,779
Thank you

159
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,278
How about a picture
to commemorate the occasion?

160
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,289
Sounds good.

161
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,220
Okay. Get in.

162
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,460
- That came out nice.
- It did.

163
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,129
- I'll let you talk.
- Sure.

164
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,330
So what are your plans...

How dare you create
fake photos of me?

Fake? Did you just say they're fake?

I will. I'll sign it.

178
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,119
We won't tell Cheong A Constructions

181
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,700
(Bae Chae Shik)

182
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,739
My liver is dying from drinking
every single night...

183
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,339
to wine and dine all those people.

184
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,009
It's almost over.

185
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,179
With the best schools,

186
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,950
the best architecture
and landscaping, it's game over.

187
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,618
Did you manage to get
Dohae Construction's business plan?

188
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:37,648
Their main pledge is about
creating an eco-friendly city.

189
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,719
Education versus the environment.

190
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,459
It'll be a tough fight.

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
It's not fun
if our opponent is too easy.

192
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,128
But a new construction company
managed to jump into...

193
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,158
this huge business
without any capital.

194
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,670
It's too weird.

195
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,070
Do you know who Dohae's lobbyist is?

196
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,269
Nothing much is known about her.

197
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,639
She's incredibly pretty.

198
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,108
And there's this woman
who follows her like a bodyguard...

199
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,950
and her name is... Yes, Jessica.

200
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,810
She's in her 30s, I think.

201
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,579
She mixes drinks
fantastically well...

202
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,849
and can make flowers
and cranes out of fruit.

203
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,690
She's so charismatic
that most men cower around her.

204
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:15,889
"Jessica?"

205
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,158
(Bathhouse)

206
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,988
What are you doing? Let go.

207
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,700
Let go!

208
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,100
What's your deal
with Dohae Construction?

209
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,629
Jessica.

210
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
When we first met,

211
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,899
you lied
and said that was your name.

212
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,138
What are you up to?

213
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,768
Don't you mind what I do.

214
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,369
We're one sign away
from being divorced.

215
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,378
Chairman Joo won't touch us
as long as we don't betray him.

216
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,849
Why are you acting out?

217
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,748
- Think of Jenny.
- You moron.

218
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,449
Are you living as Dan Tae's dog
for Jenny's sake?

219
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,189
I'm not a moron like you,

220
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,519
so I'm not scared of Dan Tae at all.

221
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,989
Do you want Jenny
to be their pet dog too?

222
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,359
How did the fiery fist of Jincheon
end up like this?

223
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,769
Ma Ri. You're Jenny's mom. Please.

224
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,070
Whenever I think of how you threw
poor Yoon Hee in the lake,

225
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,139
I feel chilled to the bone.

226
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,579
If you're going to defend Dan Tae,
don't show your face again.

227
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,138
And don't show up near Jenny.

228
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,580
She and I are in agreement on this.

229
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,609
- No, honey.
- Let go of me!

230
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,119
Kang Ma Ri. Ms. Jincheon!

231
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,359
(Bathhouse)

232
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:29,899
(My sister)

233
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,509
It's me.

234
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,409
Why? What's up?

235
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:45,909
Are you busy?

236
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,749
Just tell me why you called.

237
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm leaving today
to study abroad. In Italy.

238
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,960
You're going abroad?

239
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,658
You're telling me now?

240
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,989
Did you get Mom's permission?

241
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,729
No. You tell her for me.

242
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,529
What is wrong with you?

243
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,839
You decided something that important
without talking to Mom?

244
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,710
You should've at least
talked to me first.

245
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,439
Are we even family?

246
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,279
Can you do this to Mom?

247
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,080
Why are you so angry?

248
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,710
I'm telling you now.

249
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,978
Mom said she doesn't consider
me her child.

250
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,220
Do you believe that?

251
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,359
You're stupid.
Mom's always waiting for your call.

252
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:28,889
Can you come...

253
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,159
to the airport?

254
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,300
I haven't seen you in so long.

255
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,999
And I won't be seeing you
for a while.

256
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:41,899
Forget it.

257
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,539
Why do you need me
when you'll do whatever you want?

258
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,378
Don't call me
whether you live or die.

259
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,710
I can pretend I don't have a sister.

260
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,710
Bye.

261
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,050
Seok Hoon.

262
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,759
What?

263
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:03,619
Today?

264
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,090
She never mentioned that.

265
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,600
What time is her flight?

266
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,070
I didn't ask.
She'll call when she arrives.

267
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,498
Don't worry.

268
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:13,869
Which school in Italy is it?

269
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,869
Did your dad send her?

270
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,450
She wanted to study abroad.

271
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,080
She'll settle in just fine.

272
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,779
It's best for her
to be apart from Dad.

273
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:33,119
I didn't think
she'd leave so abruptly.

274
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,790
Has something been bothering you?

275
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,190
I've been busy with work.

276
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,269
It's about Ro Na's mom, isn't it?

277
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,540
If you're looking into her death,
I'll help.

278
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,439
It's fine. I can manage.

279
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,809
I'm in university now.
I'm not a child.

280
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,540
Ro Na is struggling,
and I want to help her.

281
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,950
Seok Hoon.

282
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,080
I know you think dearly of Ro Na,

283
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,889
but I think it's best
you end it now.

284
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,060
What do you mean by that?

285
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,029
Ro Na's mom's death...

286
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,200
has something to do with your dad.

287
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,639
What?

288
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,379
Is that true?

289
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,950
It's not, right? Is it?

290
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,509
Ro Na will find out one day,

291
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,290
and it'll hurt
both you and her a lot.

292
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,018
The man who tried to hurt her...

293
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,989
drove her mom to her death.

294
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,060
How could she forgive that?

295
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,529
- It's not your fault, but...
- Stop.

296
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:54,899
Stop it.

297
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,970
I get it, so stop it.

298
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,479
It is my fault.

299
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,978
Like Dad said, if he's a demon,
I'm the demon's son.

300
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,549
If he's a snake, I'm a snake's son.

301
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,519
A demon and snake's son,
that's what I am...

302
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,820
and I fell for Ro Na.

303
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't even deserve to.

304
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,199
I'm the son of a scumbag.

305
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,499
Where are you going, Seok Hoon?

306
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,769
(Dr. Ha Yoon Chul)

307
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,040
It's Ha Yoon Chul.

308
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:39,450
I have something urgent to say.

309
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:41,249
Can we meet?

310
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,018
I'm really sorry.

311
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,430
The traffic is terrible
and I'll be ten minutes late.

312
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,499
Sure, that's fine.
I just arrived anyway.

313
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,560
Take your time.

314
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,580
(Number Withheld)

315
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,109
(Number Withheld)

316
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:16,249
What are you doing?

317
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,149
Why do you have Eun Byeol's photo?

318
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:20,959
I thought
what your weakness would be.

319
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,159
Nothing beats a child.

320
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,889
What darn nonsense...

321
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,629
If you touch a single hair
on Eun Byeol's head,

322
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,800
I will kill you.

323
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,000
I swear I will kill you.
Do you get that?

324
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,040
That's all up to you.

325
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,039
If you tell Shim Su Ryeon anything,

326
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,138
Mom!

327
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:43,280
That will be the last time
you see your daughter.

328
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,850
Unless you want a tragic ending,
leave right now.

329
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,678
You scumbag.

330
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,520
I don't give a second warning.
Think carefully.

331
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,510
The phone is turned off.
Please leave...

332
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,119
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,530
Why? Am I somewhere I can't be?

334
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,560
I need you to empty the building.

335
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm going to flatten everything.

336
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,230
Says who?

337
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,209
The penthouse
and Cheonsoo District lot 27.

338
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:46,310
Did you forget they're in my name?

339
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,040
I was too lenient, wasn't I?

340
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,879
I can't delay any longer.

341
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:52,550
It's your final notice.

342
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,178
Of all the plots of land,

343
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,350
why are you so fixated on this one?

344
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,350
I wonder.

345
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,590
Why don't you ask your dead father?

346
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,599
What happened to Seok Kyung?

347
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,029
Why suddenly send her abroad?

348
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,669
She wanted to go.

349
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,500
She wanted to run away to a place
her mom could never find her.

350
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,310
So I made her wish come true...

351
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,939
since I'm a sweet dad.

352
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm busy and have to dash. Bye.

(The Barber of Seville)

356
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,079
What are you doing?

357
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,650
I heard you failed
the Cheong A audition.

358
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:06,219
Every application you submit
gets rejected...

359
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,920
and yet you still want to go on?

360
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,019
Just go abroad, like my mother said.

361
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,029
Seok Kyung also went off to Italy,
didn't she?

362
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,660
I don't want to run away.

363
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,929
People already say
I'm the talentless daughter...

364
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,130
of a serial killer.

365
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,598
Where would I even run to?

366
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,430
Why would you read those comments?
They'll only make you angry.

367
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,068
Make those people who attack you
without knowing the full context...

368
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,440
reveal their identities
before coming at you.

369
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm reading them on purpose,
so that I don't forget.

370
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,279
It's so that I remember...

371
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,450
what happened to my mom.

372
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,819
I can't watch this.
Leave this and come with me.

373
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,519
Where are we going?

374
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,159
Drink and forget about it.

375
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,289
Tteokbokki and fried chicken
are your favorite foods.

376
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,258
- Enjoy.
- It looks delicious.

377
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,298
Honestly, isn't the whole Cheong A
resident musician thing fake?

378
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,338
It's a show to support Eun Byeol.

379
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,068
I heard the Vienna Philharmonic
concert in Korea...

380
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:58,910
is also taking place
at Cheong A Arts Center.

381
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,709
Ms. Cheon...

382
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,338
is absolutely set on
supporting Eun Byeol all the way.

383
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,150
That makes me so mad.

384
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,818
Min Hyuk. Are you going to live
as Ha Eun Byeol's servant?

385
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,319
Don't you have any pride?

386
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,719
Everyone at your school
should boycott the audition.

387
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,660
Make everything go to waste.

388
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,089
What are you doing at school?

389
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,829
I have good news.

390
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,199
You know the Vienna Philharmonic
concert is next week, right?

391
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,999
The conductor, Clark Lee,

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,269
is doing a press conference
at Cheong A Arts Center.

393
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,538
I'll do whatever it takes
to arrange a meeting.

394
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:33,670
You just prepare to audition
for Clark.

395
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,109
Audition? Me?

396
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
How?

397
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,650
He knows me
from when I was studying abroad.

398
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,919
If you're acknowledged by Clark,

399
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,048
you'll get called by
world-renowned conductors.

400
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:45,919
Then you can perform
on international stages...

401
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,450
with the Vienna Philharmonic.

402
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,858
You can become a prima donna...

403
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:51,459
at famous opera houses
in Italy and Austria.

404
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,730
I'll be a prima donna
for Clark's performance?

405
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,029
No matter what anyone says,
your skills are top-notch.

406
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,470
You won all music competitions
in Korea.

407
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,299
Korea is too small a stage for you.

408
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,710
Although I stayed in this country,

409
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:09,179
I will support you endlessly...

410
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,339
so that you can perform
on the international stage.

411
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,109
Do you think I can do it?

412
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,919
No one but you can do it.

413
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,190
Mom, can you hear my heart beat?

414
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,619
What should I sing for the audition?

415
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,818
You'll teach me, right?

416
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,119
Of course.

417
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,490
We need to bring our your best
by next week, whatever it takes.

418
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,329
It's going to be different from
any other audition you've done.

419
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,268
To conquer the world stage,
just singing well isn't enough.

420
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:36,538
You have to act
with perfect emotions,

421
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,740
using your hands, feet, face,
and your entire body.

422
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,480
You understand me, don't you?

423
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,279
You have to be better than me.
That's the only way...

424
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,650
I can get compensated
for the life I've lived.

425
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,660
I'll never let go
of this opportunity you've given me.

426
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,529
I love you, mom.

427
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,029
No wonder you're my daughter.

428
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:08,099
I knew you would be able to get out
of this fiery pit on your own.

429
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm so glad I trusted you.

430
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,180
Goodness. Is this for Eun Byeol?

431
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,686
It seems like your relationship
with your daughter is going well,

432
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,819
seeing how you're taking
such good care of her.

433
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,949
You're not trying to eat
with Eun Byeol, are you?

434
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,119
No way.

435
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,160
I have a weaker stomach
than you think.

436
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,919
I think Cheong A Constructions...

437
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,130
will soon win the rights
for Cheonsoo District.

438
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:38,160
So I think I might need...

439
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,059
some more money from
the Cheong A Group fund.

440
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,700
Again?

441
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:45,608
I heard Dohae Construction
is not an easy rival.

442
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,409
That tiny company can't compete
with Cheong A Constructions.

443
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,239
Still, no more.

444
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,008
I only trust the money I have,

445
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,910
not what has already left my hands.

446
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,579
You, even less so.

447
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,089
Eun Byeol. Come have breakfast.

448
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,589
Expanding the company...

449
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,558
It's your wish...

450
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,229
to expand the company
and split with me...

451
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,789
as soon as possible.

452
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:09,399
If we make a successful bid,

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,600
it'll be easy to raise stock prices
by double or triple.

454
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,699
I bet my life on Cheonsoo District.

455
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,499
It's a great chance to sell
the company at the highest price.

456
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,069
And what if it fails?

457
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,509
That's never going to happen.

458
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,608
I need about 50 million dollars
to start bribing...

459
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,308
the Cheonsoo District
association's officers today.

460
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:28,880
They are the ones who will fight
for us on the front line.

461
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,619
Trust me. This is the last time.

462
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,519
Fine.

463
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,759
But under one condition.

464
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,659
Give me ten percent of
Cheong A Group's stocks.

465
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,160
Then I'll consider it.

466
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,700
Ten percent?

467
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,139
Are you a thief?
Do you think that makes any sense?

468
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,940
You don't have to do it.
I don't want it either.

469
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,140
No other condition will work.
Come back when you change your mind.

470
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,439
Eun Byeol, come have breakfast.

471
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,849
That crazy...

472
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:04,079
Fine. Ten percent.

473
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,048
Here at Cheong A Constructions,

474
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,719
we are planning on procuring
a billion dollars...

475
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
to use for promotion fees.

476
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,389
Not only will we move
the prestigious schools...

477
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,599
in Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District,

478
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,900
we are also planning to build
Cheonsoo Express,

479
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,639
making the trip from Jongno
to Cheonsoo a mere 20 minutes,

480
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,140
and from Apgujeong to Cheonsoo
no more than ten.

481
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,368
- How amazing.
- Good idea.

482
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,440
The rate would be 100,000 dollars
per 3.3m².

483
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,979
But for the members
of our association,

484
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,079
it will be 50,000 dollars per 3.3m².

485
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,419
Don't worry about the taxes.

486
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,419
I, former assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin,

487
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,220
will help you minimize your taxes.

488
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,900
But...

489
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,169
is it true that you will guarantee
200 percent in compensation...

490
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,345
if you fail to meet
any of your promises?

491
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,410
You don't even trust your husband,
do you?

492
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,709
We'll create a nice document...

493
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,078
and even get it notarized.

494
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,450
You can sue us
if we don't carry out our promises.

495
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,920
That shows just how confident we are
in all of our promises.

496
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,420
Please turn to the last page
of our business plan.

497
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,259
(Cashier's check)

498
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,269
We trust you to convince
the members well.

499
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,298
A new city that combines the best of
Apgujeong and Daechi-dong...

500
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,509
will soon be yours.

501
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,969
- Thank you.
- Welcome, Clark.

502
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,569
How long has it been?

503
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:41,639
I'm so excited to see you again.

504
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,009
So am I.

505
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,650
You've become even more beautiful.

506
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,980
Congratulations on becoming
the director.

507
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,890
Thank you for choosing our art hall
as your press conference location.

508
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,489
The reporters are waiting. Shall we?

509
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,490
Certainly.

510
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,319
Take good care of him.

511
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,899
- Where's Eun Byeol?
- Rehearsing in the waiting room.

512
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,099
Bring her backstage as soon as
the press conference ends.

513
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,640
And make sure
the reporters don't notice.

514
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,499
(Press Conference for Vienna
Philharmonic's Concert in Korea)

515
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,399
The biggest gift for me...

516
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,828
is the news that Ms. Cheon,
Director of the Arts Center,

517
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:43,069
will be returning to the stage.

518
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,170
My heart flutters...

519
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,880
at the excitement of meeting
talented new vocalists...

520
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:53,579
right on this stage.

521
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,150
It is a great honor...

522
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,989
that the Vienna Philharmonic concert
led by Conductor Clark Lee...

523
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,196
is the first performance we'll host
at Cheong A Arts Center.

524
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,759
Please help us spread the word
so that the concert is a success.

525
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:18,799
I believe we can wrap up
the interview about now.

526
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,909
Reporters, please enjoy
the snacks provided for you...

527
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,410
in the waiting room
next to the stage.

528
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,578
Thank you.

529
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:27,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

530
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:29,719
Shall we go someplace else
and have some tea?

531
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Okay.

532
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,820
(Press Conference for Vienna
Philharmonic's Concert in Korea)

533
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,789
Who is that?
Who's singing without permission?

534
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,589
Excuse me, Clark?

535
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,740
Bae Ro Na.

536
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,680
I didn't realize
there were people here.

537
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,490
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,119
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,489
Someone who's as talented as you...

540
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,359
shouldn't be here preparing food.

541
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,000
I feel like I've just discovered
an amazing gem.

542
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,430
Is she a resident musician here?

543
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,799
No.

544
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,700
I didn't even have a chance
to audition.

545
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:01,670
My application was rejected.

546
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:05,439
Someone who can sing
a high F perfectly...

547
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,210
didn't even get a chance
to audition?

548
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,720
No way.
There must be something wrong.

549
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,390
You mustn't miss out
on a gem like this.

550
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,019
If you trust my ears,

551
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,259
please give her one more chance.

552
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,190
You will do so, won't you?

553
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
What is your name?

554
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,599
My name is Bae Ro Na.

555
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,068
She's the daughter of
the Admissions Murderer!

556
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,939
- I need to get an interview.
- That's her, right?

557
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,639
Ms. Bae,
may I get an interview with you?

558
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,169
You have been acknowledged
by the world-renowned Clark Lee.

559
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,410
How do you feel?

560
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,910
Are you giving me
a chance to audition,

561
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,349
Director Cheon?

562
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,019
I would like a clear answer.

563
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,220
Since it's Clark's request,

564
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,759
I guess I have no choice.

565
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,399
I'm truly grateful to Director Cheon
for giving me...

566
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,899
a fair chance without having
any prejudice against me.

567
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,298
I will prepare well...

568
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:07,710
to ensure that I repay
your kindness.

569
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,739
How will you prepare
for the audition?

570
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,109
- What are your plans?
- Could you tell us?

571
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,890
Bae Ro Na.

572
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,789
You!

573
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,558
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

574
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,930
You waited behind the stage
on purpose.

575
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,899
You did it to steal
Eun Byeol's opportunity.

576
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,500
How did you know?

577
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:13,769
Is that what your dead mother
taught you?

578
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:16,439
How could you act
exactly like your mother?

579
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,008
You don't have any right
to say that to me.

580
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,048
Thanks to my mother
acting as your shadow singer,

581
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:23,318
you were able to finish
your 20th anniversary concert well.

582
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:26,919
The song my mom sang that day
was also "Una Voce Poco Fa."

583
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,018
Do you remember?

584
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:30,190
Perfect pitch and high F.

585
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,229
You received high praise
saying it exceeded your talents...

586
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,089
at the peak of your career.

587
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:38,200
Are you crazy?

588
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,298
How could you be so brazen
and say that?

589
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:44,369
There's no way to beat you
unless I am brazen.

590
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,740
But I guess the skies
are on my side.

591
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:50,880
I even got a chance to be praised
by a world-renowned conductor.

592
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,210
This is all thanks to you.

593
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,480
Shut your mouth.

594
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm not a kid anymore.

595
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,960
So don't be so confident anymore.

596
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,460
The truth will eventually
reveal itself.

597
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:14,730
Bae Ro Na...

598
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:15,869
Bae Ro Na!

599
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:18,769
What an audacious child.

600
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:21,869
I won't let this go.

601
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
Eun Byeol.

602
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,089
You don't need to be disappointed.

603
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,459
I'll set up another meeting
with Clark.

604
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,089
Why would I be disappointed?

605
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,988
Ro Na can't beat me anyway.

606
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:43,828
How can a high school graduate beat
a Seoul University of Music student?

607
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm going to go at my own pace.

608
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,969
I'll show them how good I am
during the auditions.

609
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,039
You're truly incredible, Eun Byeol.

610
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,369
I was worried that
you'd be disappointed.

611
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,839
I'm going to see Clark off.

612
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,179
Don't worry about me.

613
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,030
Ms. Jin. It's me.
Can we meet tonight?

614
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,908
Thank you for inviting me to Korea.

615
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:30,440
It's my honor.

616
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,579
Do you like your hotel?

617
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
Yes.

618
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,448
If anything is uncomfortable,
or if you need anything,

619
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:38,018
feel free to tell me any time.

620
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:39,119
Okay.

621
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:48,259
Oh, right.
Did you visit Cheong A Arts Center?

622
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,630
The size and facilities
were amazing.

623
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,170
I'm excited to perform there.

624
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,039
Oh, and I met
a talented vocalist there.

625
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,768
Her voice was beautiful,

626
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,469
and she had
an incredibly wide vocal range.

627
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,679
I think I know who she is.

628
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,250
Is that so?

629
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,819
She was so impressive...

630
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,550
that I recommended her
for the Cheong A auditions.

631
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:18,460
To be honest,
I have a favor to ask on her behalf.

632
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,559
That is why I asked
to meet you today.

633
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,630
Yes, I'm on my way up.

634
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,099
Okay. I'll see you at the community.

635
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,840
I guess you're here
to meet Eun Byeol.

636
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,510
You avoided me despite
all my attempts to call you,

637
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,079
and yet I meet you here.

638
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,679
I have nothing to say
to a kid like you.

639
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,019
You know why my mom died, don't you?

640
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,689
Are you hiding it
for Eun Byeol's sake?

641
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,089
Or are you trying to cover up
your own crimes?

642
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,159
Can you move?
As you can see, I'm very busy.

643
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,799
Don't run away like a coward
and tell me!

644
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,198
What on earth happened that night?

645
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,828
What are you doing?
Do you know how priceless this is?

646
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,030
My gosh!

647
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,709
Hey. I'm warning you.

648
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,948
Don't try to get in the way
of Eun Byeol.

649
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:16,179
Eun Byeol is as pure as snow.

650
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,549
The likes of you can't dare
to step on or dirty her.

651
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,789
I'm going to put my life on the line
to protect her. Got it?

652
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,839
Why did you get me so little?

653
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,909
Well... It's hard to get
this medicine these days.

654
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,440
I can't make it to the auditions
with this much.

655
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,150
If I don't take my medicine,
I get severe headaches,

656
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:53,190
feel nauseated, and feel like
the ground is sinking beneath me.

657
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:55,650
Get me more.

658
00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:57,919
This is a prescribed drug,
so I can't get...

659
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,429
So are you saying
you can't get me anymore?

660
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,828
Are you saying
you're going to abandon me too?

661
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:06,268
You're the only one
I can ask about this.

662
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:09,199
Okay. I understand.
I'll try my best to get some more.

663
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:12,739
Don't worry about anything else
and focus on your audition.

664
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,280
Bae Ro Na is auditioning too.

665
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,250
Are you worried about her?

666
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,948
How should I help you?

667
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:23,479
You don't need to help.

668
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,119
I'm going to beat her anyway.

669
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,889
I came out during my lesson.

670
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,920
I need to go back,
or my mom will get suspicious.

671
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,320
Wait, Eun Byeol.

672
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,729
I want to live with you again.

673
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,598
Without you, I can't sleep,

674
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,300
I can't eat,
and life just isn't fun anymore.

675
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,138
You can't live with that woman,
Ms. Cheon.

676
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:47,038
That woman doesn't love you.

677
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,710
She will continue to harass you
and make your life miserable.

678
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,578
The only person in this world...

679
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:54,280
who loves you unconditionally is me.

680
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,280
You know that.

681
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,029
Eun Byeol! What's wrong, Eun Byeol?

682
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,900
Are you okay? Eun Byeol!

683
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,269
Eun Byeol.
Do you think you can walk?

684
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:15,509
Did you overwork yourself
preparing for the audition?

685
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,139
Ms. Jin. When did you get here?

686
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,178
Do you know
how long I waited for you?

687
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:25,440
What took you so long?

688
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,979
Did you bring the drug?

689
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,250
I just gave it to you. There.

690
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,820
When did I get it?

691
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:41,190
Please be on time, will you?

692
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,760
I couldn't study at all today
because of you.

693
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,730
What will you do
if I can't get into college?

694
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,329
You're so annoying.

695
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:51,539
Eun Byeol!

696
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,009
Eun Byeol, talk to me.

697
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,440
What's wrong with you? Eun Byeol!

698
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,019
She's a total mess.
Why hasn't Dan Tae called?

699
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:11,960
(Jin Bun Hong)

700
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,889
What's her problem?

701
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,888
The person you have reached...

702
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,929
You're screening my calls,
is that it?

703
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,199
You shouldn't do this to me.

704
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,099
You want to get rid of me already?

705
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,079
I'm sorry, sir.

706
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,598
What do you think you're doing?

707
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,769
Why are you back here?
I said to stay low.

708
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,129
So why did you screen my call?

709
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,139
Would you pick up if you were me?
You act like a total psycho.

710
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:03,010
Whatever. I need money.

711
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,210
I gave you money not long ago.
Did you spend it all already?

712
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,650
Like you gave me so much.

713
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,189
Should I tell Su Ryeon...

714
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,288
that you killed Yoon Hee?

715
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:17,018
Or should I go
and tell the cops everything?

716
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,989
How many times must I tell you?
I didn't kill her.

717
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,888
Should I make sure
you can't even eat with that mouth?

718
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:22,988
Who cares whether or not
you killed her?

719
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:25,530
I just have to make Su Ryeon
believe you did.

720
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,169
I'll send the money with Mr. Cho.

721
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,339
Don't do anything rash. Stay low.

722
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,170
Do as I say. Please.

723
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:35,908
Don't touch me.

724
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:38,409
Jerks like you make me sick.

725
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,249
I'll never see you as a man
even if it kills me,

726
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,079
so if you're interested in me,
wake up and smell the coffee.

727
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,840
It was you...

728
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,010
after all.

729
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,530
Why did you do it?

730
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,269
Why did you do it? Why?

731
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,869
How can I ever face Ro Na again?

732
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,340
I need to die, don't I?

733
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:49,210
Must I remove
all of my cursed blood...

734
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,920
to atone for my sins
for being born your son?

735
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,179
Put that down...

736
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,150
before I break your arm.

737
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,320
Who are you?

738
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:11,030
James.

739
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,530
She's Logan's grandmother.

740
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,238
It's nice to meet you.

741
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:22,710
I apologize for my rudeness.
I didn't know you were coming.

742
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,179
What happened?

743
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,510
Have you still not found Logan?

744
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,679
It has been over six months already.

745
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,849
Have you been deceiving us?

746
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,190
The police said...

747
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,730
the bones they found in the car
were from an animal, not a person.

748
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:42,590
Logan is alive.

749
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,029
You know better than I do
that he wouldn't die that easily.

750
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,099
Then why can't you find him?

751
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,340
Have you grown weary already?

752
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,780
I even risked my life...

753
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:04,420
and moved into Joo Dan Tae's home
to keep my promise to Logan.

754
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,119
I'm fine stopping here.

755
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,389
I can just kill Dan Tae...

756
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,360
and leave, that's all.

757
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,630
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

758
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:17,960
I understand.

759
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,729
I'm having Joo Dan Tae's people
followed closely,

760
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,269
so we'll find something soon.

761
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:23,969
Please be patient.

762
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,809
We can't do anything rash.
He may retaliate.

763
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:31,840
You are the only person...

764
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:33,949
our family can trust.

765
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,118
Mr. Hong. Bring it.

766
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:39,250
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

767
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:43,388
Use it to pay for everything.

768
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,419
If we can find Logan,

769
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,860
we don't mind spending
our entire fortune.

770
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:59,400
Logan must be alive.

771
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,710
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,280
Let's go.

773
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,940
That's enough.

774
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:39,309
Thank you.

775
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,219
Oh my gosh.

776
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,619
What are you doing?
What if someone sees you?

777
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,260
Who cares?

778
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,460
People will only find out
that we have a secret relationship.

779
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,130
That's not so bad.

780
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,829
Behave. Do you want to die?

781
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,099
Hello.

782
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:15,779
Stop being stupid.
Tell me why you're here.

783
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,750
Logan's family came to see me.

784
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,579
What did they say?

785
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,719
They said if I find Logan,

786
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:24,159
they're willing to give me
their entire fortune.

787
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:26,190
I thought about it,

788
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:29,929
and I got the short end of the deal.

789
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,029
You hide behind me
and don't do anything.

790
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,400
You want to just sit there and take
tens of billions of dollars?

791
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:41,269
I'm the one doing everything I can
to save Logan.

792
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:43,678
Logan's body's value
changes drastically...

793
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,110
based on whether or not he's alive.

794
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,509
I know you want me to take
the bullets for you.

795
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,019
If things go south,

796
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,118
I'll be the only one being punished.

797
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,019
So pray hard that Logan survives.

798
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,388
Once I get the money from James,

799
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:00,789
I'll give you exactly half.

800
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,658
If it's 10 billion, you get 5.
If it's 20 billion, you get 10.

801
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:04,800
Okay?

802
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,599
Get lost.

803
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,070
How dare you threaten me?

804
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,650
You're an amusing woman, Seo Jin.

805
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,598
Why are you working so hard
to look good?

806
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,868
You're blindingly beautiful already.

807
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,039
Gosh.

808
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:49,738
I'm going golfing
with Minister Kang's wife.

809
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:53,009
Do you know how busy I've been,
being a supportive wife?

810
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,780
What is this though?

811
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,480
A gift for the wives.

812
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,448
It's made from red ginseng,
which is good for the skin.

813
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:04,789
Don't you think it's perfect
for those fancy wives?

814
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:07,629
That's good. Perfect.

815
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,090
They're deciding
on the construction today.

816
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:11,630
We need to try hard.

817
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,799
Our son got into Seoul University.

818
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,670
Our business is doing well.

819
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,670
And you're so pretty.

820
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,009
How could everything go so well
this year?

821
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,308
I'm getting nervous
because we're so lucky.

822
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:26,139
Don't be nervous.

823
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:28,049
Just enjoy yourself.

824
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,679
Our family's motto is
"alternate joy and grief."

825
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:33,519
How do I look? Does my face shine?

826
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,549
Just so I can be your ideal wife,

827
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,288
I bought new clothes, new handbags,

828
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:40,058
and even a new car!

829
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,359
Well done. You did so well.

830
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,428
You are so magnanimous.

831
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:49,198
But you can't swap out
your husband, okay?

832
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:51,699
I'm not like Ms. Cheon.

833
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,448
What brings you here?

834
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:05,849
In the VIP room of my establishment,

835
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,150
someone set up some hidden cameras.

836
00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:12,119
I don't want to
be involved in such matters,

837
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:13,989
so I came right over.

838
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,569
It was inside a decoration,

839
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,868
and I didn't notice it.

840
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,070
Please take a look.

841
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,479
Come on! Dance!

842
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,510
This is Kang Sin Mo,
the Minister of Education.

843
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,019
Come on!

844
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:38,750
This just came in.

845
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,518
Minister of Education Kang Sin Mo...

846
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:42,448
is suspected of accepting
a large bribe...

847
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:44,959
in return for promising
to move prestigious schools...

848
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,529
from Gangnam's School District Eight
to Cheonsoo District,

849
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,429
and prosecutors are looking into it.

850
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,259
The Ministries of Land
and Education...

851
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,129
will launch a joint inspection
on the overheating...

852
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,299
of investments
in Cheonsoo District caused by...

853
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,169
- the rumored school moves.
- Kyu Jin is here.

854
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,098
Cheonsoo District's
redevelopment plan...

855
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,609
- What's wrong?
- Will be reevaluated.

856
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,509
Is it a celebrity scandal?

857
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,509
Minister Kang's recent incident...

858
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,308
gathered the public's interest,

859
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:10,009
and the redevelopment project
is also a big event,

860
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,879
- Minister Kang.
- So to ensure it goes smoothly,

861
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,888
- What's going on?
- They will investigate thoroughly.

862
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:16,019
Who was it?

863
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,389
Who tattled?

864
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:19,518
I'll kill any traitor!

865
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:20,789
It wasn't me.

866
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:23,260
It obviously wasn't me.

867
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,058
Chairman Joo. What's going on?

868
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,230
Can we not host
any of the prestigious schools?

869
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
(Education Organizations
Demand Minister Kang's Apology)

870
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,969
The construction company
was just announced.

871
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:36,639
Who got the deal?

872
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,109
It's obviously Cheong A, right?

873
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:39,210
The thing is...

874
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Dohae Construction got it.

875
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:52,789
What's this?

876
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,690
Did the subcontractors hear already?

877
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:56,788
They'll want us to cough up
what they gave us!

878
00:52:56,789 --> 00:52:58,329
What should I do?

879
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,759
It's the bank manager.

880
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,468
We have to pay back
the first chunk of the loan today.

881
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,599
The loan sharks
seem to have found out too.

882
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,738
What happened? What's going on?

883
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:11,178
How did this happen?

884
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,138
Why won't you answer your phones?

885
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:14,279
What happened?

886
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,808
We trusted you...

887
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:17,348
and gave you illegal loans!

888
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:18,919
I'm about to lose my job now!

889
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,149
Forget everything else.

890
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,788
Pay me back first,

891
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:23,759
before I level this building!

892
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,389
Before they go bankrupt,

893
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,759
take anything with any value at all!

894
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,129
What can we take? The cups.

895
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,629
- Let go.
- This is mine.

896
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,360
Let's take that.

897
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,829
Take what you can!

898
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:40,340
What's that?

899
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:42,909
Let go of me!

900
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,909
Let go!

901
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,449
I'm taking what I owe!

902
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,460
Didn't you say you were sure
you'd get the deal?

903
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,059
You took a fortune
from Cheong A Group.

904
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:03,629
No harm came to you.

905
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,730
I gave you my shares.
Isn't that enough?

906
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,030
What about
our plummeting stock prices?

907
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,268
We lost 500 million dollars today.

908
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:11,869
What'll you do about that?

909
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,768
Did the great
Cheong A Construction...

910
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:16,909
lose out to Dohae Construction?

911
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,380
They were a small company
unable to take a project this big.

912
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,820
So what if they are?
They got the deal.

913
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,190
I can clean this up.

914
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:30,919
I'll meet with their representative.

915
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,889
I'll do whatever it takes
to take back the deal.

916
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:34,730
If I can't do that,

917
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:37,599
I'll buy Dohae Construction.

918
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,860
With what money?

919
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,869
You can't touch a single cent!

920
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,110
Why don't you just hand over
all your shares and get lost?

921
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:50,010
Then I might help you somehow.

922
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,630

Chairman Joo.

924
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:20,639
Didn't we really just
lose everything?

925
00:55:21,769 --> 00:55:24,808
I put so much into this project!

926
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:26,809
Didn't you take
more than you put in?

927
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,179
Are you insane?
You're the spy, aren't you?

928
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,518
Come over here.

929
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:34,719
It's not the time for that!

930
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,789
It's not over yet.

931
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:40,459
Dohae Construction
must pay 100 million dollars...

932
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,829
within the week
to secure the contract.

933
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:45,130
We just have to make them give up.

934
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:46,960
If we can't,

935
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,469
our money is gone forever.

936
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:51,070
That can never happen.

937
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,039
Not after all I did to get here.

938
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:55,709
Arrange a meeting with Dohae's CEO.

939
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,679
Drag him by the collar if you must.

940
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,509
I'll get the money together.

941
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,178
Where will you go to do that?

942
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:05,219
Even the loan sharks
won't talk to you.

943
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,820
There's someone.

944
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:10,619
Just one person.

945
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,788
(Haeyeon Group)

946
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:20,230
I didn't think
you'd ask to see me first.

947
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:23,428
I came to ask for some cash.

948
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:24,670
I'm in...

949
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:28,869
- a tight spot.
- I heard about that.

950
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:32,280
Dohae Construction
won the Cheonsoo contract.

951
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,510
You got beat by a tiny company.

952
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,590
With your help, I can get back up.

953
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:44,360
I'll pay whatever interest you want.

954
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,300
How much do you need?

955
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:55,429

959
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:20,320
I'll send it over within an hour.

960
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,230
I don't need any interest.

961
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:26,000
But I do require collateral.

962
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,899
This is the problem
with listed companies.

963
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,940
I can't spend
even a dollar on my own.

964
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,210
I don't mind.

966
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:40,139
Well,

967
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,550
I'll take your penthouse, then.

968
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,618
It's just a formality,

969
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:47,888
so don't worry.

970
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:50,889
There won't be a problem
if you pay me back.

971
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
It's a deal.

I have a meeting and must leave.

973
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:04,738
Ask my secretary for some tea
and have that before you go.

974
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:06,099
No, it's fine.

975
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:08,940
I should get going too.

976
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:11,309
Thanks for your help.

977
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,098
He must be in a bind...

978
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:35,929
if he thought of taking my money.

979
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,070
Oh, right. Is it not my money?

980
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,710
I'll send you what he asked for.

00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,379
Thank you, Chairman Song.

00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,349
That's right.

The lobbyist of Dohae Construction
you've been desperate to find.

992
00:59:34,929 --> 00:59:37,260
- That's me.
- What?

993
00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:39,198
Let me hear what you have to say.

994
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,769
What are you doing?

995
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:43,699
What have you been doing
behind my back?

996
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,968
Are you the one who
did that to Minister Kang?

997
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:49,909
You... What is your relation
with Dohae Construction?

998
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:54,579
Wasn't Dohae's construction rights
what you wanted?

999
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,780
It'd barely be enough if you went
on your knees and begged.

1000
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,178
Let alone your current attitude.

1001
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,788
I know you've poured in
an astronomical amount of money...

1002

to Cheonsoo District.

1003
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:07,929
You're okay with blowing that up?

1004
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,629
Do you want to die?

1005
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,929
Are you begging me
to kill you or what?

1006
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,569
Give me the construction rights.

1007
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,769
I won't. Why would I?

1008
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:21,308
I will watch you fail.

1009
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:24,379
Give up. You don't even have Logan.

1010
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,610
Do you think you can beat me?

1011

01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:08,730
Who are you?

1062
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:12,300
Show yourself!

1063
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:32,150
Are you trying to kill me?

1064
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:35,249
Why? Are you scared?

1065
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,419
I'll give you one last chance...

1066
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,020
to repent
before you go to the fiery pit.

1067
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,460
Stop it!

1068
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,829
Confess that you killed Yoon Hee.

1069
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,260
Admit you killed Logan!

1070
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,369
You crazy witch!

1071
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,550
My goodness...

1072
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:18,800
Even until the very end,
you have no conscience.

1073
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,099
You are not worth living.

1074
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:25,469
I'll stop you from doing
anything more from now on.

1075
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
Shim Su Ryeon. You crazy...

1076
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,909
Stop it!

1077
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,920
- Hurry up!
- Seok Hoon!

1078
01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:04,879
What have you been doing...

1079
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,539
that made mom act like that?

1080
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,949
I didn't do anything.

1081
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,078
Your mom is just blaming me...

1082
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,049
because Oh Yoon Hee and Logan died.

1083
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,889
I did nothing wrong.

1084
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:21,289
Anyway,

1085
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,388
I thought you just hated me.

1086
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:27,400
But you can't deny your own blood,
can you?

1087
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,299
That's why you came
to save me, right?

1088
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,699
I didn't save you
because I like you.

1089
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,840
I just couldn't let mom kill you.

1090
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:40,009
You can be more honest.

1091
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:43,348
By nature, you and your mother
don't suit one another,

1092
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:44,848
because you're my son.

1093
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:47,449
How could you possibly get along
with Shim Su Ryeon?

1094
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,189
That woman hates you
just as much as she hates me.

1095
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,589
Every time she sees you,
she'll be reminded of me.

1096
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,889
Do you think she could love you
as a son?

1097
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:01,030
Look.

1098
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:05,139
Stop deceiving yourself.

1099
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:07,169
Admit that I'm your father.

1100
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:11,039
Then I can give you anything.

1101
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,709
Promise me one thing.

1102
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,649
Promise you will never hurt mom.

1103
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:20,719
Then...

1104
01:08:21,219 --> 01:08:23,789
I won't push you any longer.

1105
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:26,159
I'll live the life...

1106
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,429
you want me to.

1107
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,199
Fine.

1108
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:34,929
I promise you.

1109
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:36,929
Come work for me.

1110
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:39,500
Take time off that measly school
of yours.

1111
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:05,099
These are drugs that Ms. Kim had.

1112
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:07,819
It seemed like she was going
to give them to Eun Byeol.

1113
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,600
Can you help me find out
what drugs they are?

1114
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:13,939
I will.

1115
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:18,479
I'll be auditioning for Cheong A.

1116
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,680
Really? Congratulations.

1117
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,680
You can endure it, right?

1118
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,420
I want to be acknowledged for
my talents no matter what.

1119
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:30,788
If I want to restore my mom's honor,

1120
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:33,090
that's the only thing I can do.

1121
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Seok Hoon.

1122
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,369
Haven't you gone to school yet?

1123
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,639
I'm taking time off from school.

1124
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,538
I thought I'd get busy
once I started working.

1125
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:52,779
You're taking time off? Why?

1126
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,510
Seok Hoon.

1127
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:58,079
Did something happen to Seok Hoon?

1128
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,679
What kind of job is he starting?

1129
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,520
He wants to work for
his dad's company.

1130
01:10:02,789 --> 01:10:04,219
He wants to learn the business.

1131
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,590
What? Seok Hoon said that?

1132
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:10,359
Seok Hoon.

1133
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,630
Stop right there.

1134
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,460
Don't come near me.

1135
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,899
Come to your senses.

1136
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,770
Why are you doing this too?

1137
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:20,840
You should stay by your mom's side.

1138
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,579
I've finally come to my senses.

1139
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,840
I was being childish all this time.

1140
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:29,578
I was mistaken into thinking...

1141
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:32,220
I could do something for you
and my mom.

1142
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:38,159
But it turns out I'm not
all that different from my dad.

1143
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,659
My life is more important to me
than anyone else's.

1144
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:44,789
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden?

1145
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,170
We would never work anyway.

1146
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:50,299
My dad tried to kill you,

1147
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,899
so what could we do?

1148
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:56,239
Let's break up.

1149
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,609
I can't do this anymore.

1150
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:03,949
Are you being serious?

1151
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,050
Yes, I'm being serious.

1152
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,988
I'm not going to acknowledge you
from now on,

1153
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:13,658
and I'm not going to help you
if something happens.

1154
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:15,630
Let's go back
to when we didn't know each other.

1155
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:19,529
I don't care if you resent me
or hate me.

1156
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,399
I think that would be best
for both of us.

1157
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,600
Okay.

1158
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:30,470
Let's do that...

1159
01:11:31,109 --> 01:11:32,479
if that's what you want.

1160
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,409
But Seok Hoon.

1161
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:39,880
It's not your fault.

1162
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,350
We couldn't choose
who our parents are.

1163
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,590
So...

1164
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:51,390
you can put down
any burdens you have.

1165
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,300
I'm sorry.

1166
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Ro Na.

1167
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:03,069
I'm really sorry.

1168
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
Hello?

1169
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:48,850
Yes. I'm her daughter.

1170
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:55,988
We're Oh Yoon Hee's family.

1171
01:12:55,989 --> 01:12:57,328
We received a call and came.

1172
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:59,228
You can speak with that detective
over there.

1173
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:00,430
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1174
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:05,970
This belongs
to Ms. Oh Yoon Hee, right?

1175
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:08,269
Yes. That's my mom's watch.

1176
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,538
Where did you find it?

1177
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:13,209
This man found it while working on
the construction at the cliff.

1178
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,979
Thank you.

1179
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:21,479
This is the watch that my mom
was wearing in her last moments,

1180
01:13:22,789 --> 01:13:24,449
but now it's broken.

1181
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,930
Can you fix it?

1182
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,829
It must be fixed.

1183
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:36,800
The data might've been damaged
upon impact,

1184
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,400
but I'll try my best to restore it.

1185
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,909
The watch was able to record sounds.

1186
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,779
It was restored well.

1187
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:56,750
Somebody help me!

1188
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,760
Su Ryeon.

1189
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,630
Su Ryeon, do you hear me?

1190
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,630
You must listen to this.

1191
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,439
Su Ryeon, your daughter is alive.

1192
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,670
Your biological daughter is alive.

1193
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:18,339
Seok Kyung is
your biological daughter.

1194
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,949
Seok Kyung is Seol A's twin sister.

1195
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:25,649
I'm so sorry.

1196
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,520
- Take care of my daughter...
- Seok Kyung...

1197
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:31,220
- My dear Ro Na...
- Seok Kyung is my daughter?

1198
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,109
Who are you?

1199
01:14:55,979 --> 01:14:57,608
Isn't this Italy?

1200
01:14:57,609 --> 01:14:59,850
What is she talking about? Italy?

1201
01:15:00,649 --> 01:15:03,189
- She said she's in Italy.
- What are you doing here?

1202
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:05,319
Who brought me here?

1203
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,890
Bring the person in charge.

1204
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:09,189
How dare you people...

1205
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:11,089
Did you kidnap me or something?

1206
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,799
Do you know who my dad is?

1207
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,199
Don't you know how to show respect?

1208
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,770
How dare you talk to me like that?

1209

(Clean body, Clean spirit)

01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,550

If any of you lay a hand on me,

1212
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,720
I'm going to kill all of you.

Don't come anywhere near me!

01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,029
Don't come near me!

1216
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:27,140
You have to wake up.

1217
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:31,039
I'm going to save you
no matter what.

1218
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:46,489
Logan. Do you hear me?

1219
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,528
If you can hear me, move your hand.

1220
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:52,060
I'm Ha Yoon Chul. You can trust me.

1221

1222
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,920
Can you bring Su Ryeon here?

(The Penthouse 3)

1224
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,728
We'll start the auditions...

1225
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:07,099
for the resident musicians
for Cheong A Arts Center.

1226
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,438
You want to reveal the truth
behind Ro Na's mom's death?

1227
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:09,908
You have to remember it!

1228
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:12,078
If I have the blood of the demon,
I should become a demon too.

1229
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:14,009
Good job, Logan.

1230
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,578
- You remember me, right?
- Is Joo Dan Tae done for now?

1231
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:17,648
What did you do to Seok Kyung?

1232
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:19,419
Your biological daughter?
I'm going to kill her.

1233
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,089
I'll make sure you won't lay
a hand on Seok Kyung ever again.
