(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,648
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,649
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

4
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,589
We will now start auditioning...

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,089
for the Cheong A Arts Center resident musician.

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:17,589
Bae Ro Na's talent was top-notch.

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,460
You were the one who invited Clark, Shim Su Ryeon?

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,960
This place is for orphans. Just like you.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,870
I did everything you asked, so why?

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,170
Seok Kyung and Seol A are twins?

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,300
Do you not care if you never see your biological child ever again?

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,839
Don't look for me anymore. I won't let Dad catch me.

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,739
Shim Su Ryeon. Why not leave her to me this time?

14
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,440
What does it say on that trash can next to Logan?

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,349
- Penthouse? - Ordering Baek Jun Ki...

16
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:41,080
to blow up Logan's car and keeping him locked up like this.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,715
I didn't know you were such a scary woman.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,785
(Episode 9)

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,804
Hi, Son.

20
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,575
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:17,515
I thought you should know.

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,054
Your mom did something horrible.

23
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,425
She had...

24
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,494
locked up Logan in the penthouse.

25
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,830
Isn't Logan dead?

26
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,694
He's barely breathing.

27
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:38,905
In the penthouse's helper room.

28
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,875
Didn't you think something was off?

29
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,114
Not at all. Why would Mom do such a thing?

30
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,575
She has a good reason.

31
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,519
Logan took Min Seol A's bone marrow...

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,914
and abandoned her.

33
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,155
Logan was nothing more...

34
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,625
than the target of revenge for Seol A.

35
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,560
Anyway, I plan to move back into the penthouse soon...

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,265
since this was originally my home anyway.

37
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,464
I should get the bedroom redone.

38
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,265
I'm going to hop in the shower.

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,244
Please pick up, Mom.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,015
The person you have reached...

41
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,015
(Living Gositel)

42
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,455
James knows I'm here.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,024
Give me a minute.

44
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,094
That was brave of you.

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,295
You conspired with Su Ryeon to kill Logan?

46
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,695
Did she lure you with money?

47
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:47,475
Or did you hope to become her new lover?

48
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,445
You were the one who dragged me in there.

49
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,814
Why did you get me out of prison?

50
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,320
Was this your plan all along?

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,045
How could a mom use her daughter to threaten me?

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,515
- And you call yourself a mom? - What about you?

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,385
Did you stab me in the back for Eun Byeol's sake?

54
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,124
Because of you,

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,325
she lived with that monster.

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,899
You betrayed me and split us up,

57
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,429
so you must pay the price.

58
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:13,665
That is...

59
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,594
poetic justice.

60
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,934
You killed Yoon Hee, didn't you?

61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,844
Yoon Hee?

62
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,485
Didn't you kill her?

63
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,485
Because you betrayed her and dumped her.

64
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,684
Carry that guilt with you for the rest of your life.

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,955
If you survive, that is.

66
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,825
Seo Jin. I will never forgive you.

67
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:45,825
Seo Jin. I'll get you for this!

68
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:47,834
Seo Jin!

69
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,670
Seo Jin!

70
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,665
(Living Gositel)

71
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,434
Let him go.

72
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,450
Please, sir. Do get in the car.

73
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,645
I'll explain everything on the way.

74
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,184
You're really something, Cheon Seo Jin.

75
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,524
You really tricked James.

76
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,955
Is it now time to celebrate?

77
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,794
No wonder...

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,395
we make such great partners.

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,964
That's right.

80
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,104
There's one thing I want to know.

81
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,875
Why do you want to get at Shim Su Ryeon so badly?

82
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,615
The almighty Cheon Seo Jin.

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,084
She was the one woman who really made me care.

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,815
Shim Su Ryeon.

85
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,325
Will there ever be a day better than this?

86
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,825
I panicked when I heard that Logan was alive,

87
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,030
but thanks to that, we got rid of Su Ryeon,

88
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,135
Logan Lee, Jun Ki, and Yoon Chul all in one fell swoop.

89
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,875
We got rid of everyone who was a nuisance.

90
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,774
I'm going to drink until I get drunk.

91
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,984
You're sure...

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,185
Logan won't wake up, right?

93
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,555
I personally injected him with the poison.

94
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,695
His heart stopped. He won't last a day.

95
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,995
He was going to die anyway.

96
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,125
That's right.

97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,340
What did you do with Jun Ki?

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,739
I told a certain someone that he desperately missed...

99
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,234
where he used to be.

100
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,710
Do you mean the mental hospital in Japan?

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,935
Yes.

102
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,044
But then again,

103
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,315
that's a better fit for him.

104
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,790
It was a great move...

105
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,555
to tie Su Ryeon and Logan together.

106
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,424
You really are impressive.

107
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,895
So you were the one behind Jun Ki coming here.

108
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,540
You found out that I planned to kill Logan...

109
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,639
and got him out and locked him up...

110
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,805
and made a deal with Logan's family?

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,015
You are psychotic.

112
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,844
You'll end up killing me if I don't kill you first.

113
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:19,945
I need to stay on my toes.

114
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,784
Was the view from the penthouse this nice?

115
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,794
Su Ryeon...

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,325
enjoyed a lot of pretty things,

117
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,765
so she should have no regrets in this life.

118
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,404
You're next, Dan Tae.

119
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,305
Enjoy this as much as you can.

120
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,305
I'll take everything you have very soon.

121
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,164
Logan.

122
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,695
Su Ryeon.

123
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,265
I've missed you.

124
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,495
Is it really you?

125
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,224
Yes.

126
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,474
What happened?

127
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,875
Why didn't you tell me if you were alive?

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,745
How can I die and leave you?

129
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,215
I'll explain everything.

130
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,454
I'm sorry it took me so long to come.

131
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,524
You're alive, so it's fine.

132
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,495
I prayed so earnestly...

133
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,965
that you'd be alive in any shape or form.

134
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,605
Dr. Ha. What are you doing here?

135
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,034
He helped me...

136
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,404
meet you.

137
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,385
You did well so far, Logan.

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,684
In just 24 hours,

139
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,255
you will feel very comfortable.

140
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,954
Maybe I imagined it.

141
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,130
So why did you waste your precious life...

142
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,395
by falling in love with someone like Su Ryeon?

143
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:54,294
What a waste of your money and youth.

144
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,235
But don't be too upset.

145
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,865
I'll send Su Ryeon to you very soon.

146
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,605
What happened? Who did this?

147
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,444
This causes heart failure.

148
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,784
Let me give you an antidote. Hang on.

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,794
Stay with me, Logan.

150
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,400
It was Seo Jin.

151
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,735
What?

152
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,774
The person who locked me in here...

153
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,774
was Seo Jin.

154
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,814
Seo Jin?

155
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,475
Alex.

156
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,885
Please call Alex.

157
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,524
Logan.

158
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,524
Wake up, Logan.

159
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,895
Darn it.

160
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,625
Wake up, Logan.

161
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,694
You can't die.

162
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,574
Hey. What is going on, man? Where's Logan?

163
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,235
The situation is bad.

164
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,674
I gave him an antidote immediately,

165
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,620
but he was poisoned.

166
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,345
What? Poisoned? Who?

167
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,814
Cheon Seo Jin, that crazy lady?

168
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,115
Oh, no. I'm going to kill this woman.

169
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,885
I won't let this happen.

170
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,900
Calm down. You won't find out anything this way.

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,495
I'm not waiting any longer.

172
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,324
What if Logan dies?

173
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,125
You're going to be held responsible?

174
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,835
Darn it.

175
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,135
Think why Logan told me to tell just you.

176
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:21,044
If you get carried away, you'll ruin all of Logan's plans.

177
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,975
He cheated death many times to get this far.

178
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,515
Please. Let Logan do what he wants.

179
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,284
Darn it.

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,495
Darn it.

181
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,095
Cheon Seo Jin will do something tomorrow.

182
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,564
I think she'll move Logan somewhere.

183
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,904
I don't know where that is.

184
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,044
Right now, all I can do is wish he gets through it.

185
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,314
Cheon Seo Jin. And Joo Dan Tae.

186
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,715
I'll kill them all.

187
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:01,089
I'll use all my family's money,

188
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,089
down to the last penny if I have to,

189
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,189
to make sure they're both dead.

190
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:06,924
I swear!

191
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,659
Bring that this way.

192
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,755
Okay.

193
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,085
What's that?

194
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,154
What's going on?

195
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,824
Is that furniture?

196
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,054
Did you get a new couch? Which one?

197
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,495
It must be a new model.

198
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,204
I'm so jealous.

199
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,650
My gosh. How can something look so luxurious?

200
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,449
I just changed the couch.

201
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:07,020
It's luxury at its peak.

202
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,314
It totally upgrades the whole house.

203
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,954
The interior looks so different.

204
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,424
Smile a bit, Su Ryeon.

205
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,454
Ms. Cheon, he was just brought in.

206
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,294
He seems to be unconscious.

207
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,965
Good job.

208
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,140
At exactly 7pm, bring Su Ryeon to the helper room.

209
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,605
You must be on time. Make no mistakes.

210
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,774
I'll compensate you handsomely.

211
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,814
Ma'am, you need to come over.

212
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,885
There's a weird smell coming from behind the hall.

213
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,145
There is?

214
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:29,146
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS E25 'The Penthouse 3'</font>

- Who are you? - Shim Su Ryeon.

216
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,020
You revenge your daughter's death...

217
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,015
by doing this to our Logan?

218
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,954
Logan?

219
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,454
Logan? What are you talking about?

220
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,625
I didn't know you were such a scary woman.

221
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,225
Poor Logan.

222
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,365
Tricked by the woman he loves.

223
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,265
Logan!

224
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,375
His heart stopped.

225
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,005
Take him to the hospital!

226
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,250
And bring her too!

227
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,544
Come on in!

228
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,790
Let me see Logan.

229
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,620
Please let me see Logan!

230
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,054
Logan! Let me see him!

231
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,524
Let me see him!

232
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,585
Logan!

233
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,910
- Logan. - Turn the ambulance around.

234
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,164
What's going on?

235
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,150
Call Alex for me.

236
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,005
Don't tell the rest of the family.

237
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,645
Tell Alex to do as I asked.

238
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,115
Do not touch a hair on Su Ryeon's body.

239
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,725
Hey. Thanks for making it, little bro.

240
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,984
But do we really have to keep this a secret?

241
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,355
For now. You know what our parents are like.

242
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,325
If they know it was Dan Tae and Seo Jin,

243
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:08,835
would they let them live?

244
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,869
My plan will become a mess.

245
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,440
All right. But we should still tell Grandma, though,

246
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,105
because, you know, she's pretty upset.

247
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,545
Leave it to me.

248
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:20,974
All right.

249
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,280
And don't worry about this place,

250
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,790
because I got this place on lock-down, all right?

251
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,454
Nobody can get in here besides me and my people, all right?

252
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,125
Thanks, bro.

253
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,484
Yes.

254
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,535
Let go.

255
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,605
You're being fooled.

256
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,775
Please take me to Logan.

257
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,119
I need to see how he's doing with my own eyes.

258
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,214
I beg you.

259
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,444
You must've been in so much pain.

260
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,714
How could they do this to someone?

261
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,424
I'm fine.

262
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:08,724
I'm alive.

263
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,154
Seeing you...

264
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,095
made it worthwhile.

265
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,335
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

266
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,904
I can never forgive them.

267
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,404
There is no more mercy.

268
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,045
They went after the wrong person.

269
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,375
I will make them regret it.

270
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,315
I never imagined that the person who confined me...

271
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,585
was Cheon Seo Jin.

272
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,815
Even less that she'd rope in Dr. Ha.

273
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,555
In return for springing me from prison,

274
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,595
she made me work for Dan Tae.

275
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:43,424
Then she told me to treat Logan.

276
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,424
To keep him barely alive.

277
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,595
To hide her identity,

278
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,908
she even used Eun Byeol to blackmail me.

279
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:54,004
How could a human being do such a thing?

280
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,914
For now, let's pretend I'm dead.

281
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,375
Do as you planned.

282
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,145
What will you do?

283
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,115
I have to find Seok Kyung first.

284
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,055
Seok Kyung is...

285
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,194
my real daughter.

286
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,664
Seok Kyung?

287
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,635
Dan Tae killed Yoon Hee because she tried to reveal that.

288
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,605
I'm not positive,

289
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,704
but I think Seo Jin's involved too.

290
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,674
It's all my fault.

291
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,214
I asked Yoon Hee to find your daughter.

292
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,145
Because of me,

293
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,345
she's dead.

294
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,918
So that her death isn't in vain,

295
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,885
we must reveal the truth.

296
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,825
In my own way, I will get revenge that will devastate them.

297
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,924
Count me in.

298
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,424
Let me help.

299
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,635
Mr. Lee.

300
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,105
Seok Hoon.

301
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,145
Mom. Are you all right?

302
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,815
Is everything okay?

303
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,285
What on earth is going on?

304
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:49,984
What happened to Mom?

305
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,754
I wonder.

306
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,164
Considering what she did to Logan,

307
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,194
his family won't let her off lightly.

308
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,869
She went way too far.

309
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:09,805
All because of a dead girl.

310
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,105
This penthouse...

311
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,980
is in our name, yours and mine.

312
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,250
Now only true family members are left.

313
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,045
You promised never to hurt Mom.

314
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,385
Don't forget that.

315
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,494
Don't you worry. I didn't touch your mom.

316
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,224
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

317
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,065
Logan's family took her.

318
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,004
Be careful so your dad doesn't suspect you.

319
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,365
He'll trust you because you're his only blood.

320
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,434
Do not make the first move.

321
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,674
Be careful until we find Seok Kyung.

322
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,845
So...

323
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,775
Shall we get to work?

324
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,414
Did Seok Kyung call you?

325
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,085
I still can't seem to reach her.

326
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,724
I assume she's busy getting used to her life abroad.

327
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,424
I'm sure she's doing fine.

328
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,194
You really are my son, with that tender heart of yours.

329
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,065
Don't worry about trivial things.

330
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,865
Just enjoy what you will soon have.

331
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,335
You're the only one I trust, Dad.

332
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,335
Yes. Where's Seok Kyung?

333
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,944
You still haven't found her?

334
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,514
I'm sure she'll come crawling back since she's out of money.

335
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,014
Come down now.

336
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,960
What are you doing?

337
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,295
What about you?

338
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,065
You think you can kill your father with something like this?

339
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,940
- Come with me. - Let me go.

340
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,309
- Come with me! - Let go!

341
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,805
Who are you to intervene in my life?

342
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,974
Let go!

343
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,775
Seok Kyung.

344
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,154
Take her to the hospital first. She seems like she's hurt.

345
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,559
I didn't bring her in because I like her.

346
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,484
I just didn't want her to get hurt at Hera Palace.

347
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,194
Thank you.

348
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,224
Where are you hurt? How much?

349
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,295
You look horrible.

350
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,164
Let's go to the hospital.

351
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,369
It's nothing.

352
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,639
It is something.

353
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,805
None of my bones are broken, and I'm not bleeding!

354
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,680
Why are you making me worry?

355
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,250
Do you know how worried Mom and I were?

356
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,984
Why didn't you call?

357
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,220
Where have you been?

358
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,389
You should have come looking for me if something had happened.

359
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,355
Why are you worrying about me now?

360
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:16,254
You wouldn't have cared if I died.

361
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,169
Don't say that.

362
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,835
I'm not even your birth sister.

363
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,964
You...

364
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,535
How did you...

365
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,504
Dad told me.

366
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,845
That's why he did this to me.

367
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,674
Because I'm not his daughter.

368
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,645
It's why he sabotaged my relationship with Mom.

369
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,348
It's why he used me to take over the penthouse.

370
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,990
It's why he took all the money under my name.

371
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,684
That was why.

372
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,295
Because I'm Mom's daughter.

373
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,295
Shim Su Ryeon's daughter.

374
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,464
Because I'm Min Seol A's twin.

375
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,895
So what?

376
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,909
That doesn't mean anything.

377
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,835
How is it nothing?

378
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,674
It means you and I are strangers.

379
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,550
We walk different paths.

380
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,775
That changes nothing.

381
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,385
You're my sister till death. I'll protect you no matter what.

382
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,654
Dad will never hurt you.

383
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,454
I won't let him. So listen to me!

384
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,355
I know you're working for him.

385
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,895
Are you planning on inheriting it all yourself?

386
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,494
Is that why you kicked Mom out...

387
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,839
and are staying by Dad's side?

388
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,440
I know you don't mean that.

389
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,404
You know me better than that.

390
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,335
Does saying that make you feel better? Are you stupid?

391
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,875
Let go!

392
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:44,944
Let go!

393
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:48,785
I said let go! Please!

394
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,694
It was me.

395
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,264
It's okay. I know it was hard.

396
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,315
Who owns...

397
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,379
Dohae Construction again?

398
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:21,315
It was bought by Logan's company.

399
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,484
Shim Su Ryeon is sure you're the man behind it.

400
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,154
Which is why we helped her.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,595
As promised,

402
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,835
I will give you the development rights...

403
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,464
for Cheonsoo District.

404
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,149
Then can I assume that from today...

405
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,914
Dohae Construction will no longer be involved with Cheonsoo District?

406
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,914
Of course.

407
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,085
That was clean.

408
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,855
I'm sorry about Logan.

409
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:03,095
I really wished he would survive and let the truth be known.

410
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,724
Still...

411
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,994
I'm relieved...

412
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,135
he was able to die in the care of his family.

413
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,664
My family...

414
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,234
is planning on returning to the States now.

415
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,504
How are you going to deal with...

416
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,479
Shim Su Ryeon and Ha Yoon Chul?

417
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,744
My family will deal with that.

418
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,285
Alex,

419
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,315
Logan's brother, will be taking care of it.

420
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,984
The punishment won't be light.

421
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,194
Sorry for misunderstanding you all this time.

422
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,734
You two will be rewarded soon.

423
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,605
How did everything work out so smoothly like this?

424
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:15,244
Chairman Joo, you continue to astound me.

425
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,350
When Cheong A Constructions is chosen to lead the Cheonsoo project,

426
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,690
Cheong A group's stock price, which has been falling,

427
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,889
shall also rise again.

428
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,929
I will try my best...

429
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,229
to make it hit the highest price in the country.

430
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:30,195
Some say it's already been decided as a land transaction permit area.

431
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,374
Okay, then.

432
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,974
Thank you for all your work so far.

433
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,315
Doesn't money smell great?

434
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,294
What about Yoon Chul? Don't you have anything?

435
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,070
That's right. Did something happen to Dr. Ha?

436
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,430
I can't seem to reach him.

437
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,035
I think by now...

438
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:09,140
he's become fish food in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

439
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,170
Fish food?

440
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,435
It was Shim Su Ryeon...

441
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,235
who blew up Logan's car.

442
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:17,845
It seems she had locked him up in the penthouse and tortured him.

443
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,675
Logan was the last target...

444
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,384
for her daughter's revenge.

445
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,560
And Ha Yoon Chul helped her.

446
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,714
- What? - Wait.

447
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:29,530
That doesn't make any sense.

448
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,429
Forget Shim Su Ryeon for a second.

449
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,724
Why would Ha Yoon Chul do that?

450
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,230
What did Logan ever do to him?

451
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,964
I'm sure it was for money.

452
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,834
Shim Su Ryeon offered him a great deal of money.

453
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,399
How bold of her to do that...

454
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,905
to an American who is part of a conglomerate.

455
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,039
How sad.

456
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,708
Although we did end up with more money thanks to that.

457
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,075
I heard you both worked very hard.

458
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,618
I hope you can keep it up until the construction ends.

459
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,214
And this is an extra gift from Cheong A Group.

460
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,024
This couple sure is generous.

461
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,265
They really know how to play.

462
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,505
Cheers. Here.

463
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,505
Stay here for a while.

464
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:26,874
It'll keep you out of Dad's radar.

465
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,284
How's the wound?

466
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,855
I told you I'm fine.

467
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:40,059
Go now. I want to rest.

468
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,895
Let's meet Mom in the evening. I'll call her.

469
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,564
- I don't want to. - Why?

470
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:49,434
You want her to keep worrying?

471
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,709
We looked all over the retreat center that day because of you.

472
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:52,980
Mom's in a dark place right now.

473
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,334
After Ro Na's mom died,

474
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:56,850
she's been fighting Dad day and night.

475
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,505
Is this about her again?

476
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,744
Stop talking about Ro Na's mom. I'm sick of hearing it.

477
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:03,749
It's not like I killed her.

478
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:06,489
You didn't, but you played a part.

479
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,790
She found out you were Mom's daughter...

480
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,494
and was chased by Dad. That's how she passed away.

481
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,859
What?

482
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,295
You of all people...

483
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,864
shouldn't talk that way about her death.

484
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,235
She was even falsely accused of kidnapping Eun Byeol.

485
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,374
Because of Ms. Jin's lie.

486
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,005
Ms. Jin?

487
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,274
How about that tteokbokki?

488
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,145
What are you doing here?

489
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,385
Let go of me. I'm busy.

490
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,885
Ha Eun Byeol.

491
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,654
Are you looking for her?

492
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,154
Do you know where my Eun Byeol is?

493
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,395
I told Ms. Jin that...

494
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,165
Eun Byeol was at Ro Na's place.

495
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,795
What?

496
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,534
I also kept you and Ro Na at that tteokbokki place for her.

497
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,005
If only I hadn't told her, none of this would've happened.

498
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,915
Did Ro Na's mom die because of me?

499
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,814
Did you really do that?

500
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,018
Tell me exactly what happened.

501
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,485
You tell me.

502
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,559
Is Mom in danger?

503
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,325
What did Dad do to her?

504
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,164
Why isn't Su Ryeon picking up?

505
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,104
She handed over Dohae Construction's development rights so suddenly too.

506
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,034
Gosh, you startled me.

507
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,805
What are you doing? I'm busy.

508
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:38,819
Hey!

509
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:40,179
Let go.

510
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:42,249
I have nothing to say to you.

511
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:43,989
Unless Joo Dan Tae threatens to kill me,

512
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,854
I'll never make a deal with you.

513
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:47,654
What's all this?

514
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,294
Let's flee.

515
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,294
What?

516
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:57,900
I already booked flights.

517
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,594
I also found a school for Jenny.

518
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,470
With this money, we can support Jenny abroad.

519
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,079
We'll make a fresh new start...

520
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,534
where no one can find us.

521
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,075
Don't tell me this money is from Joo Dan Tae.

522
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,179
Did he give away money to celebrate his new rights?

523
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:16,720
Cheonsoo District was going to be developed by Cheong A anyway.

524
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,714
That way, we can sell our land at a higher price too.

525
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:23,125
Cut ties with Shim Su Ryeon. We're leaving this place.

526
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:25,755
(Korea Air, Passport)

527
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:29,629
Are you even human?

528
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:31,999
After destroying a family, what are you saying now?

529
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:34,170
"We'll make a fresh new start?"

530
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,639
I still can't face Ro Na.

531
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,239
I feel too guilty.

532
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,205
I only care about my own child.

533
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,850
We'll pay Ro Na, okay?

534
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,145
A person died!

535
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,875
To Ro Na, Yoon Hee meant the world.

536
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,044
With her whole world gone, what meaning does money have?

537
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,815
- Ma Ri. - Su Ryeon is missing.

538
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,955
You know where she is, don't you?

539
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:00,794
Joo Dan Tae, that jerk, might have kidnapped and blackmailed her.

540
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,999
Otherwise, why would Dohae Construction give up so easily?

541
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,765
What does that matter when we can keep the money?

542
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,005
No way.

543
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,674
Have you been working with Joo Dan Tae for money all this time?

544
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:19,214
You're a jerk!

545
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,650
You can never flee.

546
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,319
Pay for what you did to Yoon Hee first.

547
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:30,885
Confess everything Joo Dan Tae has ever done.

548
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,600
If anything happens to Su Ryeon,

549
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,094
I'll put you behind bars with my own two hands.

550
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:41,964
You're becoming just like Joo Dan Tae.

551
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,305
Get it together!

552
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,220
The person you have reached is unavailable.

553
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,544
Why isn't Ms. Shim here yet?

554
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,315
Her phone is turned off too.

555
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,489
- Goodness. - This is bad.

556
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:02,825
Well...

557
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:06,924
I'm not sure if I should tell you this,

558
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,594
but Ms. Shim is...

559
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,534
being suspected of murder, kidnapping,

560
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,199
and holding a person captive, and is on the run.

561
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,865
- What? - My gosh.

562
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:20,840
In addition to the shameful fact that she used to work as a hostess,

563
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,780
if this gets out to the press,

564
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,449
Cheong A Foundation's reputation will be irreparably harmed.

565
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,850
There's no point in waiting any longer.

566
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,484
Let's take a vote already.

567
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:36,685
If you think Director Shim Su Ryeon should be dismissed,

568
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:38,284
raise your hand.

569
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,970
All right. By unanimous consent,

570
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,464
Director Shim Su Ryeon is dismissed.

571
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:51,540
Let's elect the new director immediately.

572
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,610
Our former director, Ms. Cheon, is with us anyway.

573
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,509
- That sounds good. - Great.

574
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:57,705
Me?

575
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:04,745
If you give me a second chance,

576
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:07,555
I'll devote my body and soul to Cheong A Foundation.

577
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,800
Put this office back...

578
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,904
to its original state before my inauguration ceremony.

579
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,065
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:26,639
Welcome back, Ms. Cheon.

581
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,505
We should work together...

582
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:32,044
- to grow Cheong A Foundation. - I know.

583
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,480
(Cheon Myung Soo, Sixth director)

584
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,115
Father, I'm back...

585
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:38,814
at Cheong A Foundation that you left for me.

586
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,404
It's not me.

587
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,914
I swear!

588
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,544
This was all set up by Cheon Seo Jin.

589
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,314
I just did as she said.

590
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,855
I was fooled!

591
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,294
Are you confessing?

592
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:32,774
- Logan. - What?

593
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,804
Are you surprised?

594
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,875
Because I'm alive?

595
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,314
How could you...

596
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:46,654
betray my trust like this?

597
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:55,194
I was trying to help you.

598
00:37:57,229 --> 00:38:01,895
Killing Joo Dan Tae was never your plan.

599
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,034
You weren't the least bit interested in your parents' revenge.

600
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:08,534
Did you only pretend to want to kill him...

601
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:12,010
to approach me?

602
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,875
Why? Were you after my money?

603
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,650
Is that why you teamed up with Cheon Seo Jin?

604
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,745
No.

605
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,954
I was grateful to you for getting me out of the loony bin. I mean it.

606
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:26,225
But Cheon Seo Jin's offer...

607
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,755
was hard to resist.

608
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,824
Did she pay off your gambling debts?

609
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,995
She promised half the profits.

610
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,465
If everything worked out,

611
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,434
I thought it could make up for all the injustice in my life.

612
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,335
You and Joo Dan Tae...

613
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:45,145
didn't just share a name.

614
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,845
Both of you are...

615
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,515
scumbags.

616
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,414
So I'm thinking of sending you back there.

617
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:57,424
Yes, there. That place.

618
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,595
Do you understand?

619
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:08,635
You'll rot there for the rest of your life.

620
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,770
You're crazy. You're out of your mind.

621
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,939
I'm sorry, Logan.

622
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:15,034
Take him away!

623
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,005
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,975
I'm sorry, Logan.

625
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,475
No.

626
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:25,245
Logan! I don't want to go back there.

627
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,914
Logan!

628
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,215
Don't lock me up again!

629
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,784
No!

Where is she now? Bring her to me right now.

633
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,715
No. I'll come to you.

634
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,020
She's not ready to see you yet.

635
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,150
She's very confused. Give her some time.

636
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,054
How can she not be ready to see her own mom?

637
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,189
Tell Seok Kyung this.

638
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:06,699
I'm waiting for her like I always have.

639
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,059
She can come to me anytime.

640
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,800
By the way, Seok Kyung told me something important today.

641
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,495
On the day Ms. Oh died,

642
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,465
Seok Kyung met Ms. Jin.

643
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,965
It's certain that Ms. Jin kidnapped Eun Byeol.

644
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:19,934
Seok Hoon?

645
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,304
I'll call you back.

646
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,885
Finally.

647
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:36,424
Finally, this place became mine.

648
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,524
I'm going to tear down this shop...

649
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,599
and build a Cheonsoo District landmark here.

650
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,229
Why does it have to be here?

651
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:46,434
This is...

652
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,135
where I used to live.

653
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,365
Your paternal grandmother...

654
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:53,875
lived here.

655
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,204
My paternal grandmother?

656
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,109
Wasn't this my maternal grandfather's land?

657
00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:59,304
No.

658
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:02,914
It's where my family and I lived.

659
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,454
At 27 Cheonsoo District.

660
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,184
And...

661
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:11,524
this is where my mother...

662
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,024
is buried.

663
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,664

00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,304

667
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:27,804
Make lots of money and succeed.

668
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:32,505
Build a big house for all to see,

669
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,814
and you must live...

670
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,784
as a rich man.

671
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:41,490
No. Please, no Mom.

672
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,154
Don't die.

Everything began here,

677
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,054
and it's time for me to complete it.

678
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,530
First, I plan to erect...

679
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,824
a Zeus Tower in memory of my mother.

680
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,300
It will be lit 24 hours a day...

681
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,335
and visible from anywhere.

682
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,995
It'll be the tallest building in the world.

683
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:31,265
And all of this...

684
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:34,074
is yours, Seok Hoon.

685
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,174
Picture it.

686
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:40,044
How amazing is this?

687
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,054
Aren't you thankful you were born as my son?

688
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,265
We must find Jin Bun Hong first.

689
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,765
She holds the key to the truth of that night.

690
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,709
Do you know where she lives?

691
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:11,245
No, I don't. But I know how to find her.

692
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,804
Leave it to me.

693
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,074
I have a question.

694
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,784
Why did you help Logan?

695
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,615
Because of Yoon Hee.

696
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,024
Because I felt like...

697
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,794
that was what Yoon Hee would've done.

698
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,174
The person you have reached...

699
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,944
The person you have reached...

700
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,385
Eun Byeol, pick up.

701
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,524
Eun Byeol, where are you?

702
00:43:57,189 --> 00:43:59,829
Eun Byeol, why can't I reach you?

703
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:01,000
Is something okay?

704
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,698
I'm at Hera Palace. Make some time for me.

707
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:21,274
Eun Byeol, I heard you failed the Cheong A Arts Center audition.

708
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,885
An SNU grad lost to a high school grad?

709
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,189
I heard Ro Na was amazing.

710
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,385
Did you see the posts by the kids who were at the audition?

711
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,329
Want to see a video of her audition?

712
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:31,424
Yes.

When did you all get here?

728
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,980
What do you mean? We've been studying for finals.

729
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,849
What? I was?

730
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:32,785
Wow. Look at you weaseling out of this.

731
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,184
- You're a great actress. - You guys...

732
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:44,424
Eun Byeol! Are you okay?

733
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:47,264
Ms. Jin.

734
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,835
Drink up.

735
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:56,345
Why are you so pale?

736
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,474
Have you been eating?

737
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:02,520
This just won't do. Let's go to my place.

738
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,345
I'll make you all of your favorite foods.

739
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:09,355
Ms. Jin. Can you get me some more of that drug?

740
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,585
The drug?

741
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,325
Well... It's not that easy.

742
00:46:14,629 --> 00:46:16,525
Please. For me.

743
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,694
No one cares about me as much as you do.

744
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:22,664
I feel like my head will explode without it.

745
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:25,305
Please get it for me.

746
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,204
Okay, I will.

747
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:32,050
There's nothing I won't do for you.

748
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,815
Don't worry. I'll get it for you.

749
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,785
They stopped the clinical test because that drug was too dangerous.

750
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,684
People showed signs of early dementia.

751
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,825
It's too dangerous.

752
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,395
Do you know that?

753
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:26,795
Why do you care? I said it doesn't matter.

754
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:30,434
Get me as much as you can next time, got it?

755
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,674
You knew that, but you gave that garbage to my daughter anyway?

756
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,275
What? Dr. Ha?

757
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:42,045
Eun Byeol wanted it.

758
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,585
She asked for it first.

759
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,345
Don't lie to me.

760
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,355
Do you think I believe you?

761
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,460
You ruined my daughter.

762
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,154
Her parents ruined her.

763
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,494
She's miserable if she's with the two of you.

764
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,595
I'll protect her. I won't lose her!

765
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:22,389
Hey. What are you doing here?

766
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:23,625
Shouldn't you be making dinner?

767
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,625
I don't want to go home because I don't want to see Kyu Jin,

768
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:31,399
but I have absolutely nowhere else to go.

769
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:33,395
My life has been in vain.

770
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,069
I had to serve my in-laws...

771
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:37,510
and support my husband all my life, so I don't know how to have fun.

772
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,135
And I don't know how to do anything.

773
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,275
Why did I live like this?

774
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:43,545
Listen to this woman.

775
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,075
I want to make him pay big time,

776
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,744
but I have no clue what I should do.

777
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:52,914
Get up.

778
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:56,754
- What? - I'll teach you, so come with me.

779
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,055
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

780
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,125
This woman...

781
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:06,264
Does she know what time it is?

782
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:10,240
Her child and the family were all she ever knew.

783
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,868
But now, she's always out...

784
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,904
and doesn't keep house at all.

785
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,105
What is wrong with her?

786
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,014
Honey! Where are you?

787
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,714
What?

788
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,154
Hey! Where are you?

789
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,525
I'll come to you right now...

790
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:44,664
Do you think that jerk will care just because I do this?

791
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:47,904
See? Your phone is blowing up.

792
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,944
Goodness. He is going crazy.

793
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,914
Stay here for two hours, okay?

794
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,164
What is this?

795
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:12,595
Soju.

796
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:15,500
You need to smell like alcohol...

797
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,635
to make Kyu Jin mad.

798
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,879
Yes. Ma Ri!

799
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:21,879
Gosh.

800
00:50:21,879 --> 00:50:24,545
I've already looked up to you...

801
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:27,014
May I love you?

802
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,514
My gosh! Ma Ri!

803
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,924
Who are you people? Why did you bring me here?

804
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,095
Do you want to die? Untie me!

805
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,734
What deal did you make with Joo Dan Tae?

806
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,504
Did he promise to give you Eun Byeol...

807
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,379
if you do as he says?

808
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:55,440
What deal would I make with Joo Dan Tae?

809
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,545
Why would I do business with that fool?

810
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,414
Eun Byeol is my daughter anyway.

811
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,680
Do you think you can take her from me?

812
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,484
I'm the one who loves Eun Byeol more than you two.

813
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,885
You never visited her since you were released from prison.

814
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:11,325
All you cared about was getting revenge.

815
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,694
- You crazy... - That day,

816
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,869
you abducted Eun Byeol,

817
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:20,065
and Yoon Hee died trying to go after you.

818
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,599
Tell me everything you know.

819
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,309
- What happened that night? - I don't know.

820
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,934
- Tell me! - I don't know anything!

821
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,004
I had nothing to do with Oh Yoon Hee's death.

822
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,275
Long time no see.

823
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:34,014
Ms. Jin Bun Hong.

824
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,214
Logan?

825
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,785
You're alive?

826
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,285
I am.

827
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:48,224
Thanks to these two here.

828
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,494
Who did this to you?

829
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,934
Joo Dan Tae.

830
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:58,105
He set a bomb to get rid of me.

831
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,504
You sided with someone like that,

832
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:02,980
talked to the press,

833
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,149
turned Oh Yoon Hee into a criminal,

834
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:08,545
and even tarnished my reputation.

835
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:10,645
How could you...

836
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,954
betray me of all people?

837
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,754
How could you?

838
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,484
Didn't you come to Korea to help me?

839
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,154
I really had no idea...

840
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,065
that Joo Dan Tae would do something that dreadful.

841
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:28,835
The only thing I wanted was Eun Byeol.

842
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,805
I know.

843
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,504
It's because of Michelle, your dead daughter.

844
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,974
But guess what?

845
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,944
Michelle didn't die because of you.

846
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,645
That night, the person who left her outdoors...

847
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,159
was your drunk husband.

848
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:50,254
No.

849
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,724
She died because of me.

850
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,754
I ran away.

851
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,694
Because I was scared of my husband.

852
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:59,424
I left the poor thing behind.

853
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,434
Her hands...

854
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,934
Her face was so cold.

855
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,845
If I'd gotten to her sooner, I could've saved her.

856
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,444
I won't leave her alone ever again.

857
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,990
No. Eun Byeol can't be alone either.

858
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,145
I must go to her!

859
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,159
Pull yourself together, you lunatic!

860
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,760
Eun Byeol isn't your daughter!

861
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,059
No! She is my daughter!

862
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:26,559
She sleeps in my arms,

863
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,899
she smiles brightly at me,

864
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:31,395
and she tells me everything.

865
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,234
She likes the food I cook,

866
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:38,369
and she waits and waits for me.

867
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:39,909
You are out of your mind.

868
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:42,605
I won't let you near Eun Byeol again!

869
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,145
Logan!

870
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:47,319
Logan! Please help me.

871
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:50,250
Let me see Eun Byeol.

872
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,720
She means more than my life.

873
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,460
Please help me, Logan!

874
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,555
That...

875
00:53:55,919 --> 00:53:58,684
depends on what you do.

876
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,194
Tell me everything that happened that day.

877
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,464
Tell her, Ms. Jin.

878
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,605
That day...

879
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,345
Oh Yoon Hee drove after me.

880
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,318
So I called Joo Dan Tae.

881
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,744
I found Eun Byeol.

882
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:26,914
I'm being followed by Oh Yoon Hee.

883
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,285
Help me.

884
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,724
Oh Yoon Hee is there?

885
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,795
Then I should, of course, help you.

886
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,424
I'll send you an address. Lure her there.

887
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,540
I met him in an isolated spot.

888
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,339
He suddenly tied me up and took me somewhere.

889
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:49,210
- I don't know what happened next. - Let me go!

890
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,605
Don't lie!

891
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,079
Your car was found where Yoon Hee died.

892
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:54,875
I really don't know!

893
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,190
I was locked up somewhere.

894
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,944
He let me go under the condition that I talk to the media.

895
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,559
That's all.

896
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:03,315
I can't believe this woman.

897
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:07,224
That day, when the car was pulled from the water,

898
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,664
the dashboard camera was already gone.

899
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,494
Ms. Jin. Look into my eyes as you answer.

900
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,295
That dashboard camera.

901
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,035
Do you really not know where it went?

902
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,139
I don't know where it is. You can ask the police.

903
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:23,645
Jin Bun Hong!

904
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:28,914
Tell me honestly.

905
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,885
I'm giving you one last chance.

906
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,654
The police don't know either.

907
00:55:41,899 --> 00:55:44,399
To hide the fact that I'd kidnapped Eun Byeol,

908
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,895
I hired someone to get the dashboard camera,

909
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,569
but I haven't seen the footage either.

910
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:51,365
It's company property, and I couldn't get into the system.

911
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,135
Then tell me...

912
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:57,345
where that dashboard camera is now.

913
00:56:10,759 --> 00:56:12,500
It has been six months.

914
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,400
Do you think the video's still there?

915
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,300
If it's the last video before the accident,

916
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,640
it'll be there.

917
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,794
Because there's no new footage to be taped over it.

918
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:22,834

920
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:28,204
Eun Byeol!

921
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,449
Get it out!

922
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,875
I'll jump aside once it's out, so get it out!

923
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,215
Free your hand first.

924
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,520
Eun Byeol, wake up.

925
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,954
No, Eun Byeol...

926
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:42,585
No!

927
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:50,464
Let go.

928
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:20,995
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

929
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,370
She killed Yoon Hee.

930
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,664
She's crazy.

931
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,595
She's crazy.

932
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,164
Why would she... Why?

933
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,605
She killed Yoon Hee...

934
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,004
and wanted me gone too.

935
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:38,875
To take everything.

936
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,715
Do you think Dan Tae and Seo Jin are working together?

937
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:44,814
No.

938
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,655
Dan Tae will think he killed Yoon Hee.

939
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,224
But that doesn't cancel out his crimes.

940
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,325
To put pressure on Yoo Dong Pil,

941
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,099
he used Yoon Hee's corpse.

942
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,095
He killed her twice.

943
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,409
Did Eun Byeol see all this?

944
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,864
Is that why she asked Jin Bun Hong for the pills?

945
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:05,435
Cheon Seo Jin...

946
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,375
She got Eun Byeol in this mess.

947
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:10,875
I will not forgive her.

948
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,615
Never.

949
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,245
They will see...

950
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:18,484
what torture is like.

951
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,835
Mr. Yoo, are you all right?

952
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:36,734
Don't mind me.

953
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,478
You know that Jenny's now Cheong A Arts Center's...

954
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:45,074
Artist in Residence, right?

955
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,090
It would've been nice if you'd attended the party.

956
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,314
Why are you...

957
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:53,889
always interfering and meddling?

958
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:56,384
Jenny did really well that day.

959
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,125
Look. You wanted to see, didn't you?

960
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
She was dazzling at the audition.

961
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,639
(Official Video)

962
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:11,164
Jenny always said she's like her dad.

963
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,675
That's why she's loyal and softhearted.

964
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,020
A daughter takes after her dad.

965
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,974
Would she take after a passing dog?

966
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,715
Jenny likes you a lot.

967
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,490
She always looks at her photo with you before bed.

968
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,294
She misses you.

969
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,155
I don't know what's going on,

970
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,564
but if you speak earnestly to her and Ms. Kang,

971
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,395
won't they understand?

972
00:59:40,669 --> 00:59:43,504
Tell me whatever you need. I'll help.

973
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:50,104
You shouldn't drink too much either.

974
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,595
You jerk.

975
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,194
Yoo Dong Pil.

976
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,294
You are the biggest scumbag.

977
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,095
I don't deserve it,

978
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:43,025
but I'm going to be your father for once.

979
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:44,794
Just this once.

980
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,585
Kang Ma Ri.

981
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:45,195
What should I do first?

982
01:01:45,529 --> 01:01:47,124
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

983
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,224
Then I'll gladly be punished.

Sure.

988

One, two, three.

989

No rabbit looks like that.

990
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,494
Isn't it adorable?

991
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,474
It's cute.

992
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:51,085
Where have you been?

993
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,395
It's too early to be walking around.

994
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,000
If Joo Dan Tae finds you...

995
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,664
Can I ask you for a favor?

996
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:00,864
I saved this money...

997
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,434
for Ro Na.

998
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:05,275
Please hand it to her for me.

999
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:12,015
Why don't you do it yourself? Even though you're late.

1000
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:14,244
You can still be her father.

1001
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,455
I heard from Yoon Hee.

1002
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,859
I don't deserve to be a dad.

1003
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,624
Ro Na wouldn't want that either.

1004
01:03:24,129 --> 01:03:25,294
However,

1005
01:03:25,899 --> 01:03:28,470
I will spend the rest of my life trying to destroy...

1006
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,195
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin for Yoon Hee.

1007
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:32,065
I'll do whatever it takes.

1008
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,065
I will avenge Yoon Hee's death with my own hands.

1009
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:40,234
At least Yoon Hee won't be lonely.

1010
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:46,015
You and I both want to pay her back for what we owe her.

1011
01:03:48,819 --> 01:03:52,015
If anything happens to me,

1012
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,914
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

1013
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:58,395
Stay by her side till the end.

Where are you?

1020
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,399
I'll come.

1021
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:34,525
- We should meet... - I have something to tell you.

Director Cheon Myung Soo...

1023
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,894
didn't die of a heart attack.

1024

Someone killed him.

1025
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,805
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

1026
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,149
What are you saying all of a sudden?

1027
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:53,815
I saw her in the video.

1028
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:55,690
Eun Byeol had it.

1029
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,384
Eun Byeol is the witness.

1030
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,455
I hope you succeed in whatever it is you're trying to do.

What are you doing?

1035
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,955
Can't you see I'm eating?

1036
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,595
I'm starving. I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

1037
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:45,134
What are you talking about?

1038
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:48,264
You just ate. You ate a whole bowl of curry.

1039
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:53,104
I did? When?

1040
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,274
Eun Byeol!

1041
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,715
Get Eun Byeol out first!

1042
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,055
Quickly!

1043
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,889
My leg!

1044
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:12,460
I'll jump aside once it's out, so get it out!

1049

Don't touch me!

1050
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,404
What's wrong with you? What are you saying?

1051
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,315
What did I just say?

1052
01:06:33,379 --> 01:06:34,744
You don't remember?

1053
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:40,085
My head's been hurting lately.

1054
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,825
Right, it's your inauguration today.

1055
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:45,455
Be pretty.

1056
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:47,555
I should go get ready as well.

1057
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,734
Eun Byeol, why this again?

1058
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,604
I thought you'd forgotten it all.

1059
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,075
It's all because of the stress from that audition.

1060
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:06,744
Because of Bae Ro Na.

1061
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,815
It's going to be fine, right?

1062
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,815
Yes.

01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:22,624
But you've brought me back to life.

1073
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:26,195
I will think of the rest of my life as something extra...

1074
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:29,364
and sacrifice myself for education.

1075
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,299
From now on, Cheong A Foundation will be even better than before...

1076
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:36,565
and grow into the best private foundation...

1077

Why did you want to come here?

1083
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,500
We have nothing to do with the Cheong A Foundation anymore.

1084
