1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,648
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

2
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,649
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

3
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,589
We will now start auditioning...

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,089
for the Cheong A Arts
Center resident musician.

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:17,589
Bae Ro Na's talent was top-notch.

6
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,460
You were the one who invited
Clark, Shim Su Ryeon?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,960
This place is for
orphans. Just like you.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,870
I did everything you asked, so why?

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,170
Seok Kyung and Seol A are twins?

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,300
Do you not care if you never see
your biological child ever again?

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,839
Don't look for me anymore.
I won't let Dad catch me.

12
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,739
Shim Su Ryeon. Why not
leave her to me this time?

13
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,440
What does it say on that
trash can next to Logan?

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,349
- Penthouse?
- Ordering Baek Jun Ki...

15
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:41,080
to blow up Logan's car and
keeping him locked up like this.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,715
I didn't know you were
such a scary woman.

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,685
(Episode 9)

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,804
Hi, Son.

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,574
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,515
I thought you should know.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,054
Your mom did something horrible.

22
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,424
She had...

23
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,494
locked up Logan in the penthouse.

24
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,840
Isn't Logan dead?

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,704
He's barely breathing.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,905
In the penthouse's helper room.

27
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,874
Didn't you think something was off?

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,115
Not at all.
Why would Mom do such a thing?

29
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,585
She has a good reason.

30
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,530
Logan took
Min Seol A's bone marrow...

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,925
and abandoned her.

32
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,154
Logan was nothing more...

33
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,625
than the target of revenge
for Seol A.

34
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,569
Anyway, I plan to move back
into the penthouse soon...

35
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,264
since this was originally
my home anyway.

36
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,464
I should get the bedroom redone.

37
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,274
I'm going to hop in the shower.

38
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,244
Please pick up, Mom.

39
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,014
The person you have reached...

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,024
(Living Gositel)

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,455
James knows I'm here.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,024
Give me a minute.

43
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,095
That was brave of you.

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,304
You conspired with Su Ryeon
to kill Logan?

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,705
Did she lure you with money?

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,475
Or did you hope
to become her new lover?

47
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,445
You were the one
who dragged me in there.

48
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,815
Why did you get me out of prison?

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,319
Was this your plan all along?

50
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,055
How could a mom
use her daughter to threaten me?

51
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,525
- And you call yourself a mom?
- What about you?

52
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,384
Did you stab me in the back
for Eun Byeol's sake?

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,125
Because of you,

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,324
she lived with that monster.

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,900
You betrayed me and split us up,

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,440
so you must pay the price.

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,664
That is...

58
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,604
poetic justice.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,945
You killed Yoon Hee, didn't you?

60
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,845
Yoon Hee?

61
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,484
Didn't you kill her?

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,484
Because you betrayed her
and dumped her.

63
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,685
Carry that guilt with you
for the rest of your life.

64
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,954
If you survive, that is.

65
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,824
Seo Jin. I will never forgive you.

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,834
Seo Jin. I'll get you for this!

67
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,834
Seo Jin!

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,669
Seo Jin!

69
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,674
(Living Gositel)

70
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,445
Let him go.

71
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,449
Please, sir. Do get in the car.

72
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,644
I'll explain everything on the way.

73
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,185
You're really something,
Cheon Seo Jin.

74
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,525
You really tricked James.

75
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,965
Is it now time to celebrate?

76
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,794
No wonder...

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,405
we make such great partners.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,975
That's right.

79
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,104
There's one thing I want to know.

80
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,875
Why do you want to get at
Shim Su Ryeon so badly?

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,614
The almighty Cheon Seo Jin.

82
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:39,084
She was the one woman
who really made me care.

83
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,824
Shim Su Ryeon.

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,324
Will there ever be a day
better than this?

85
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,834
I panicked when I heard
that Logan was alive,

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,039
but thanks to that,
we got rid of Su Ryeon,

87
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,134
Logan Lee, Jun Ki, and Yoon Chul
all in one fell swoop.

88
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,875
We got rid of everyone
who was a nuisance.

89
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,774
I'm going to drink
until I get drunk.

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,985
You're sure...

91
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,185
Logan won't wake up, right?

92
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,555
I personally injected him
with the poison.

93
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,695
His heart stopped.
He won't last a day.

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,995
He was going to die anyway.

95
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,134
That's right.

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,340
What did you do with Jun Ki?

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,739
I told a certain someone
that he desperately missed...

98
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,235
where he used to be.

99
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,710
Do you mean
the mental hospital in Japan?

100
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,945
Yes.

101
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,045
But then again,

102
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,315
that's a better fit for him.

103
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,789
It was a great move...

104
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,555
to tie Su Ryeon and Logan together.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,425
You really are impressive.

106
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,904
So you were the one
behind Jun Ki coming here.

107
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,549
You found out
that I planned to kill Logan...

108
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,650
and got him out and locked him up...

109
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,815
and made a deal with Logan's family?

110
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,014
You are psychotic.

111
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,855
You'll end up killing me
if I don't kill you first.

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,954
I need to stay on my toes.

113
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,795
Was the view from the penthouse
this nice?

114
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,795
Su Ryeon...

115
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,334
enjoyed a lot of pretty things,

116
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,764
so she should have no regrets
in this life.

117
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,404
You're next, Dan Tae.

118
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,305
Enjoy this as much as you can.

119
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,315
I'll take everything you have
very soon.

120
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,165
Logan.

121
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,704
Su Ryeon.

122
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,264
I've missed you.

123
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,495
Is it really you?

124
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,224
Yes.

125
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,474
What happened?

126
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,884
Why didn't you tell me
if you were alive?

127
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,755
How can I die and leave you?

128
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,224
I'll explain everything.

129
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,454
I'm sorry it took me so long
to come.

130
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,524
You're alive, so it's fine.

131
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,495
I prayed so earnestly...

132
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,964
that you'd be alive
in any shape or form.

133
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,605
Dr. Ha. What are you doing here?

134
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,045
He helped me...

135
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,415
meet you.

136
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,384
You did well so far, Logan.

137
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,695
In just 24 hours,

138
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,265
you will feel very comfortable.

139
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,954
Maybe I imagined it.

140
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,129
So why did you waste
your precious life...

141
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,395
by falling in love
with someone like Su Ryeon?

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,305
What a waste
of your money and youth.

143
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,234
But don't be too upset.

144
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,874
I'll send Su Ryeon to you very soon.

145
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,604
What happened? Who did this?

146
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,445
This causes heart failure.

147
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,785
Let me give you an antidote.
Hang on.

148
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,795
Stay with me, Logan.

149
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,409
It was Seo Jin.

150
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,734
What?

151
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,775
The person who locked me in here...

152
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,775
was Seo Jin.

153
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,815
Seo Jin?

154
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,484
Alex.

155
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,885
Please call Alex.

156
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,525
Logan.

157
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,525
Wake up, Logan.

158
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:27,895
Darn it.

159
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,624
Wake up, Logan.

160
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,695
You can't die.

161
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,574
Hey. What is going on, man?
Where's Logan?

162
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,244
The situation is bad.

163
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,675
I gave him an antidote immediately,

164
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,619
but he was poisoned.

165
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,354
What? Poisoned? Who?

166
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,815
Cheon Seo Jin, that crazy lady?

167
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,124
Oh, no. I'm going to kill
this woman.

168
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,895
I won't let this happen.

169
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,899
Calm down. You won't
find out anything this way.

170
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,494
I'm not waiting any longer.

171
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,334
What if Logan dies?

172
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,135
You're going to be held responsible?

173
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,834
Darn it.

174
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,145
Think why Logan
told me to tell just you.

175
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,045
If you get carried away,
you'll ruin all of Logan's plans.

176
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,984
He cheated death many times
to get this far.

177
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,525
Please. Let Logan do what he wants.

178
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,295
Darn it.

179
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,494
Darn it.

180
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,104
Cheon Seo Jin
will do something tomorrow.

181
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,574
I think she'll move Logan somewhere.

182
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,905
I don't know where that is.

183
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,045
Right now, all I can do
is wish he gets through it.

184
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,315
Cheon Seo Jin. And Joo Dan Tae.

185
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,714
I'll kill them all.

186
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,090
I'll use all my family's money,

187
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,090
down to the last penny
if I have to,

188
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,200
to make sure they're both dead.

189
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,925
I swear!

190
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,658
Bring that this way.

191
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,754
Okay.

192
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,084
What's that?

193
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,155
What's going on?

194
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,824
Is that furniture?

195
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,065
Did you get a new couch? Which one?

196
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,504
It must be a new model.

197
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,204
I'm so jealous.

198
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:02,649
My gosh. How can something
look so luxurious?

199
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,460
I just changed the couch.

200
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,019
It's luxury at its peak.

201
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,324
It totally upgrades the whole house.

202
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,954
The interior looks so different.

203
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,425
Smile a bit, Su Ryeon.

204
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,464
Ms. Cheon, he was just brought in.

205
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,295
He seems to be unconscious.

206
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,964
Good job.

207
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,149
At exactly 7 p.m., bring Su Ryeon
to the helper room.

208
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,604
You must be on time.
Make no mistakes.

209
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,775
I'll compensate you handsomely.

210
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,815
Ma'am, you need to come over.

211
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,885
There's a weird smell coming from
behind the hall.

212
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,155
There is?

213
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:29,146
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] SBS E25 'The Penthouse 3'</font>

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,974
- Who are you?
- Shim Su Ryeon.

215
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,019
You revenge your daughter's death...

216
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,015
by doing this to our Logan?

217
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,954
Logan?

218
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:52,454
Logan? What are you talking about?

219
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,624
I didn't know
you were such a scary woman.

220
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,234
Poor Logan.

221
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,364
Tricked by the woman he loves.

222
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,275
Logan!

223
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,374
His heart stopped.

224
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,015
Take him to the hospital!

225
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,249
And bring her too!

226
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,545
Come on in!

227
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,790
Let me see Logan.

228
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,629
Please let me see Logan!

229
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,055
Logan! Let me see him!

230
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,525
Let me see him!

231
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,594
Logan!

232
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,909
- Logan.
- Turn the ambulance around.

233
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,175
What's going on?

234
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,149
Call Alex for me.

235
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,015
Don't tell the rest of the family.

236
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,645
Tell Alex to do as I asked.

237
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,114
Do not touch a hair
on Su Ryeon's body.

238
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,724
Hey. Thanks for making it,
little bro.

239
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,994
But do we really have
to keep this a secret?

240
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,364
For now. You know
what our parents are like.

241
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,334
If they know
it was Dan Tae and Seo Jin,

242
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,834
would they let them live?

243
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,869
My plan will become a mess.

244
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,440
All right. But we should
still tell Grandma, though,

245
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,104
because, you know,
she's pretty upset.

246
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,545
Leave it to me.

247
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:20,974
All right.

248
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,290
And don't worry about this place,

249
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,790
because I got this place
on lock-down, all right?

250
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,454
Nobody can get in here
besides me and my people, all right?

251
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,124
Thanks, bro.

252
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,494
Yes.

253
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,544
Let go.

254
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,605
You're being fooled.

255
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,774
Please take me to Logan.

256
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,119
I need to see how he's doing
with my own eyes.

257
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,214
I beg you.

258
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,454
You must've been in so much pain.

259
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,724
How could they do this to someone?

260
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,425
I'm fine.

261
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:08,724
I'm alive.

262
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,165
Seeing you...

263
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,095
made it worthwhile.

264
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:16,335
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

265
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,905
I can never forgive them.

266
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,405
There is no more mercy.

267
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,044
They went after the wrong person.

268
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,375
I will make them regret it.

269
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:31,314
I never imagined
that the person who confined me...

270
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,585
was Cheon Seo Jin.

271
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,825
Even less that she'd rope in Dr. Ha.

272
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,554
In return for springing me
from prison,

273
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,595
she made me work for Dan Tae.

274
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,425
Then she told me to treat Logan.

275
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,435
To keep him barely alive.

276
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,605
To hide her identity,

277
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,908
she even used Eun Byeol
to blackmail me.

278
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:54,004
How could a human being
do such a thing?

279
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,915
For now, let's pretend I'm dead.

280
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,385
Do as you planned.

281
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,155
What will you do?

282
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,125
I have to find Seok Kyung first.

283
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,054
Seok Kyung is...

284
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,195
my real daughter.

285
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,665
Seok Kyung?

286
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,635
Dan Tae killed Yoon Hee
because she tried to reveal that.

287
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,605
I'm not positive,

288
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,704
but I think Seo Jin's involved too.

289
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:30,675
It's all my fault.

290
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,214
I asked Yoon Hee
to find your daughter.

291
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,145
Because of me,

292
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,355
she's dead.

293
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,928
So that her death isn't in vain,

294
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,895
we must reveal the truth.

295
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:49,825
In my own way, I will get revenge
that will devastate them.

296
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,935
Count me in.

297
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,435
Let me help.

298
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,645
Mr. Lee.

299
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,115
Seok Hoon.

300
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,145
Mom. Are you all right?

301
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,814
Is everything okay?

302
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,284
What on earth is going on?

303
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:49,984
What happened to Mom?

304
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,764
I wonder.

305
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,165
Considering what she did to Logan,

306
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,204
his family
won't let her off lightly.

307
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,879
She went way too far.

308
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,804
All because of a dead girl.

309
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,115
This penthouse...

310
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,990
is in our name, yours and mine.

311
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,260
Now only true family members are left.

312
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,054
You promised never to hurt Mom.

313
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,385
Don't forget that.

314
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:28,494
Don't you worry.
I didn't touch your mom.

315
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,224
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

316
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,064
Logan's family took her.

317
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,004
Be careful so your dad
doesn't suspect you.

318
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,375
He'll trust you
because you're his only blood.

319
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,445
Do not make the first move.

320
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,675
Be careful until we find Seok Kyung.

321
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,845
So...

322
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:50,784
Shall we get to work?

323
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,425
Did Seok Kyung call you?

324
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:00,095
I still can't seem to reach her.

325
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,724
I assume she's busy getting
used to her life abroad.

326
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,425
I'm sure she's doing fine.

327
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:09,204
You really are my son,
with that tender heart of yours.

328
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,075
Don't worry about trivial things.

329
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,875
Just enjoy what you will soon have.

330
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,345
You're the only one I trust, Dad.

331
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,345
Yes. Where's Seok Kyung?

332
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,945
You still haven't found her?

333
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,514
I'm sure she'll come crawling back
since she's out of money.

334
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,014
Come down now.

335
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,969
What are you doing?

336
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,294
What about you?

337
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:16,064
You think you can kill your father
with something like this?

338
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,939
- Come with me.
- Let me go.

339
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,310
- Come with me!
- Let go!

340
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,804
Who are you to intervene in my life?

341
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,974
Let go!

342
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,774
Seok Kyung.

343
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,155
Take her to the hospital first.
She seems like she's hurt.

344
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,560
I didn't bring her in
because I like her.

345
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,494
I just didn't want her to get hurt
at Hera Palace.

346
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,195
Thank you.

347
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,234
Where are you hurt? How much?

348
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,304
You look horrible.

349
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,165
Let's go to the hospital.

350
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,379
It's nothing.

351
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:55,649
It is something.

352
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,804
None of my bones are broken,
and I'm not bleeding!

353
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,689
Why are you making me worry?

354
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,250
Do you know how worried
Mom and I were?

355
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,984
Why didn't you call?

356
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,230
Where have you been?

357
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,389
You should have come looking for me
if something had happened.

358
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,355
Why are you worrying about me now?

359
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:16,264
You wouldn't have cared if I died.

360
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,169
Don't say that.

361
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,835
I'm not even your birth sister.

362
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,964
You...

363
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:26,534
How did you...

364
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,504
Dad told me.

365
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,845
That's why he did this to me.

366
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,675
Because I'm not his daughter.

367
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,645
It's why he sabotaged
my relationship with Mom.

368
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,358
It's why he used me to take over
the penthouse.

369
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,990
It's why he took all the money
under my name.

370
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,685
That was why.

371
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,294
Because I'm Mom's daughter.

372
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,294
Shim Su Ryeon's daughter.

373
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,464
Because I'm Min Seol A's twin.

374
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,905
So what?

375
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,909
That doesn't mean anything.

376
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,835
How is it nothing?

377
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,675
It means you and I are strangers.

378
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,550
We walk different paths.

379
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,784
That changes nothing.

380
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,385
You're my sister till death.
I'll protect you no matter what.

381
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,655
Dad will never hurt you.

382
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,454
I won't let him. So listen to me!

383
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,365
I know you're working for him.

384
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,895
Are you planning on
inheriting it all yourself?

385
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,504
Is that why you kicked Mom out...

386
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,840
and are staying by Dad's side?

387
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,439
I know you don't mean that.

388
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,405
You know me better than that.

389
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,345
Does saying that make you feel better?
Are you stupid?

390
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,885
Let go!

391
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,945
Let go!

392
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,784
I said let go! Please!

393
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,704
It was me.

394
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:04,264
It's okay. I know it was hard.

395
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,314
Who owns...

396
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:18,389
Dohae Construction again?

397
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:21,314
It was bought by Logan's company.

398
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,494
Shim Su Ryeon is sure you're the man
behind it.

399
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,155
Which is why we helped her.

400
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,605
As promised,

401
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,835
I will give you
the development rights...

402
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,474
for Cheonsoo District.

403
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,149
Then can I assume that from today...

404
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,915
Dohae Construction will no longer
be involved with Cheonsoo District?

405
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,915
Of course.

406
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,085
That was clean.

407
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,855
I'm sorry about Logan.

408
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:03,095
I really wished he would survive
and let the truth be known.

409
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,724
Still...

410
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:09,004
I'm relieved...

411
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,135
he was able to die
in the care of his family.

412
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,675
My family...

413
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,244
is planning on returning
to the States now.

414
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,514
How are you going to deal with...

415
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,489
Shim Su Ryeon and Ha Yoon Chul?

416
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,754
My family will deal with that.

417
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,284
Alex,

418
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,325
Logan's brother,
will be taking care of it.

419
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,994
The punishment won't be light.

420
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,204
Sorry for misunderstanding you
all this time.

421
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,734
You two will be rewarded soon.

422
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,595
How did everything work out
so smoothly like this?

423
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,234
Chairman Joo, you continue
to astound me.

424
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:18,340
When Cheong A Constructions is
chosen to lead the Cheonsoo project,

425
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,679
Cheong A group's stock price,
which has been falling,

426
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:21,879
shall also rise again.

427
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,909
I will try my best...

428
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:26,219
to make it hit the highest price
in the country.

429
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:30,185
Some say it's already been decided
as a land transaction permit area.

430
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,355
Okay, then.

431
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,964
Thank you for all your work so far.

432
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,304
Doesn't money smell great?

433
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:59,274
What about Yoon Chul?
Don't you have anything?

434
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,050
That's right.
Did something happen to Dr. Ha?

435
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,419
I can't seem to reach him.

436
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,014
I think by now...

437
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,129
he's become fish food
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

438
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:10,159
Fish food?

439
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,425
It was Shim Su Ryeon...

440
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:14,224
who blew up Logan's car.

441
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,825
It seems she had locked him up
in the penthouse and tortured him.

442
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,665
Logan was the last target...

443
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,365
for her daughter's revenge.

444
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,540
And Ha Yoon Chul helped her.

445
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,704
- What?
- Wait.

446
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,510
That doesn't make any sense.

447
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,409
Forget Shim Su Ryeon for a second.

448
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,714
Why would Ha Yoon Chul do that?

449
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,219
What did Logan ever do to him?

450
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,945
I'm sure it was for money.

451
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,814
Shim Su Ryeon offered him
a great deal of money.

452
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,389
How bold of her to do that...

453
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:43,885
to an American
who is part of a conglomerate.

454
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,030
How sad.

455
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,698
Although we did end up with
more money thanks to that.

456
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:51,064
I heard you both worked very hard.

457
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,608
I hope you can keep it up
until the construction ends.

458
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:00,204
And this is an extra gift
from Cheong A Group.

459
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,014
This couple sure is generous.

460
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:12,254
They really know how to play.

461
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,484
Cheers. Here.

462
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,494
Stay here for a while.

463
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,865
It'll keep you out of Dad's radar.

464
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:31,264
How's the wound?

465
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:33,835
I told you I'm fine.

466
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,050
Go now. I want to rest.

467
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,885
Let's meet Mom in the evening.
I'll call her.

468
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,554
- I don't want to.
- Why?

469
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,425
You want her to keep worrying?

470
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,689
We looked all over the retreat center
that day because of you.

471
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,959
Mom's in a dark place right now.

472
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,325
After Ro Na's mom died,

473
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,830
she's been fighting Dad
day and night.

474
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,494
Is this about her again?

475
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,635
Stop talking about Ro Na's mom.
I'm sick of hearing it.

476
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:03,639
It's not like I killed her.

477
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:06,379
You didn't, but you played a part.

478
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:09,679
She found out
you were Mom's daughter...

479
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,375
and was chased by Dad.
That's how she passed away.

480
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,749
What?

481
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,185
You of all people...

482
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,754
shouldn't talk that way
about her death.

483
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,125
She was even falsely accused of
kidnapping Eun Byeol.

484
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,254
Because of Ms. Jin's lie.

485
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,895
Ms. Jin?

486
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,165
How about that tteokbokki?

487
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,034
What are you doing here?

488
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,264
Let go of me. I'm busy.

489
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,774
Ha Eun Byeol.

490
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,534
Are you looking for her?

491
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,044
Do you know where my Eun Byeol is?

492
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:49,284
I told Ms. Jin that...

493
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,054
Eun Byeol was at Ro Na's place.

494
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,685
What?

495
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,425
I also kept you and Ro Na
at that tteokbokki place for her.

496
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,895
If only I hadn't told her,
none of this would've happened.

497
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,804
Did Ro Na's mom die because of me?

498
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,704
Did you really do that?

499
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,908
Tell me exactly what happened.

500
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:16,375
You tell me.

501
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,449
Is Mom in danger?

502
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,214
What did Dad do to her?

503
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,054
Why isn't Su Ryeon picking up?

504
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,984
She handed over Dohae Construction's
development rights so suddenly too.

505
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,925
Gosh, you startled me.

506
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,695
What are you doing? I'm busy.

507
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:38,699
Hey!

508
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,070
Let go.

509
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,139
I have nothing to say to you.

510
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,869
Unless Joo Dan Tae
threatens to kill me,

511
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:45,734
I'll never make a deal with you.

512
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:47,534
What's all this?

513
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,175
Let's flee.

514
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,175
What?

515
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,719
I already booked flights.

516
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,484
I also found a school for Jenny.

517
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,359
With this money,
we can support Jenny abroad.

518
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,959
We'll make a fresh new start...

519
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,425
where no one can find us.

520
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:10,964
Don't tell me this money is
from Joo Dan Tae.

521
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,070
Did he give away money
to celebrate his new rights?

522
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,609
Cheonsoo District was going to be
developed by Cheong A anyway.

523
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,605
That way, we can sell our land
at a higher price too.

524
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,004
Cut ties with Shim Su Ryeon.
We're leaving this place.

525
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,645
(Korea Air, Passport)

526
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,520
Are you even human?

527
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,889
After destroying a family,
what are you saying now?

528
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,060
"We'll make a fresh new start?"

529
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,530
I still can't face Ro Na.

530
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,129
I feel too guilty.

531
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:41,095
I only care about my own child.

532
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,730
We'll pay Ro Na, okay?

533
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,024
A person died!

534
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:48,764
To Ro Na, Yoon Hee meant the world.

535
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:51,935
With her whole world gone,
what meaning does money have?

536
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,704
- Ma Ri.
- Su Ryeon is missing.

537
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,845
You know where she is, don't you?

538
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,675
Joo Dan Tae, that jerk, might have
kidnapped and blackmailed her.

539
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:04,889
Otherwise, why would Dohae Construction
give up so easily?

540
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:08,655
What does that matter
when we can just keep the money?

541
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,885
No way.

542
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,564
Have you been working with
Joo Dan Tae for money all this time?

543
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,095
You're a jerk!

544
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,540
You can never flee.

545
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,209
Pay for what you did
to Yoon Hee first.

546
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:30,774
Confess everything
Joo Dan Tae has ever done.

547
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,480
If anything happens to Su Ryeon,

548
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,984
I'll put you behind bars
with my own two hands.

549
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:41,855
You're becoming just like
Joo Dan Tae.

550
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,185
Get it together!

551
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,100
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

552
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,434
Why isn't Ms. Shim here yet?

553
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,205
Her phone is turned off too.

554
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:01,380
- Goodness.
- This is bad.

555
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,705
Well...

556
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,814
I'm not sure
if I should tell you this,

557
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,484
but Ms. Shim is...

558
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,414
being suspected of
murder, kidnapping,

559
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,089
and holding a person captive,
and is on the run.

560
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,754
- What?
- My gosh.

561
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,730
In addition to the shameful fact
that she used to work as a hostess,

562
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,670
if this gets out to the press,

563
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,339
Cheong A Foundation's reputation
will be irreparably harmed.

564
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,739
There's no point in
waiting any longer.

565
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:32,374
Let's take a vote already.

566
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,575
If you think Director Shim Su Ryeon
should be dismissed,

567
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,175
raise your hand.

568
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,850
All right. By unanimous consent,

569
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,354
Director Shim Su Ryeon is dismissed.

570
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,429
Let's elect the new director
immediately.

571
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,500
Our former director, Ms. Cheon,
is with us anyway.

572
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,400
- That sounds good.
- Great.

573
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,595
Me?

574
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,635
If you give me a second chance,

575
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,434
I'll devote my body and soul
to Cheong A Foundation.

576
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,690
Put this office back...

577
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,785
to its original state
before my inauguration ceremony.

578
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,955
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,529
Welcome back, Ms. Cheon.

580
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:29,394
We should work together...

581
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,925
- to grow Cheong A Foundation.
- I know.

582
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,369
(Cheon Myung Soo, Sixth director)

583
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,004
Father, I'm back...

584
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,705
at Cheong A Foundation
that you left for me.

585
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,294
It's not me.

586
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,794
I swear!

587
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,434
This was all set up
by Cheon Seo Jin.

588
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,205
I just did as she said.

589
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:15,745
I was fooled!

590
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,184
Are you confessing?

591
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,655
- Logan.
- What?

592
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,695
Are you surprised?

593
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,765
Because I'm alive?

594
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,205
How could you...

595
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,535
betray my trust like this?

596
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,075
I was trying to help you.

597
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,785
Killing Joo Dan Tae
was never your plan.

598
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,925
You weren't the least bit interested
in your parents' revenge.

599
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,425
Did you only pretend
to want to kill him...

600
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,900
to approach me?

601
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,765
Why? Were you after my money?

602
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:17,540
Is that why you teamed up
with Cheon Seo Jin?

603
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,635
No.

604
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:22,845
I was grateful to you for getting me
out of the loony bin. I mean it.

605
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,115
But Cheon Seo Jin's offer...

606
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,644
was hard to resist.

607
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,714
Did she pay off your gambling debts?

608
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:33,885
She promised half the profits.

609
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,354
If everything worked out,

610
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,325
I thought it could make up
for all the injustice in my life.

611
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,225
You and Joo Dan Tae...

612
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,024
didn't just share a name.

613
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,734
Both of you are...

614
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,405
scumbags.

615
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,305
So I'm thinking of sending
you back there.

616
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,305
Yes, there. That place.

617
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,475
Do you understand?

618
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,515
You'll rot there
for the rest of your life.

619
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,659
You're crazy.
You're out of your mind.

620
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:13,830
I'm sorry, Logan.

621
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,925
Take him away!

622
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,894
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,865
I'm sorry, Logan.

624
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,365
No.

625
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,135
Logan!
I don't want to go back there.

626
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,805
Logan!

627
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:29,104
Don't lock me up again!

628
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,675
No!

631
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,365
Where is she now?
Bring her to me right now.

632
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,595
No. I'll come to you.

633
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,909
She's not ready to see you yet.

634
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:59,040
She's very confused.
Give her some time.

635
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,934
How can she not be ready
to see her own mom?

636
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,080
Tell Seok Kyung this.

637
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,580
I'm waiting for her
like I always have.

638
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,949
She can come to me anytime.

639
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:10,690
By the way, Seok Kyung told me
something important today.

640
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,385
On the day Ms. Oh died,

641
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,354
Seok Kyung met Ms. Jin.

642
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,854
It's certain that
Ms. Jin kidnapped Eun Byeol.

643
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,825
Seok Hoon?

644
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,195
I'll call you back.

645
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,765
Finally.

646
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,305
Finally, this place became mine.

647
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,414
I'm going to tear down this shop...

648
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,489
and build
a Cheonsoo District landmark here.

649
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:45,119
Why does it have to be here?

650
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,314
This is...

651
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:49,015
where I used to live.

652
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,254
Your paternal grandmother...

653
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,754
lived here.

654
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,095
My paternal grandmother?

655
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:58,000
Wasn't this
my maternal grandfather's land?

656
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,195
No.

657
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:02,805
It's where my family and I lived.

658
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,334
At 27 Cheonsoo District.

659
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,075
And...

660
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,405
this is where my mother...

661
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,914
is buried.

662
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,544

665
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,184

666
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,695
Make lots of money and succeed.

667
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,394
Build a big house for all to see,

668
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,695
and you must live...

669
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,664
as a rich man.

670
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:41,380
No. Please, no Mom.

671
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,044
Don't die.

00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:56,925
Breathe.

675
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,535
Everything began here,

676
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:14,934
and it's time for me to complete it.

677
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,409
First, I plan to erect...

678
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:21,714
a Zeus Tower in memory of my mother.

679
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:24,190
It will be lit 24 hours a day...

680
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,214
and visible from anywhere.

681
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,885
It'll be the tallest building
in the world.

682
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,155
And all of this...

683
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,955
is yours, Seok Hoon.

684
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,064
Picture it.

685
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,934
How amazing is this?

686
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,934
Aren't you thankful
you were born as my son?

687
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:01,155
We must find Jin Bun Hong first.

688
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,655
She holds the key
to the truth of that night.

689
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:07,600
Do you know where she lives?

690
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,124
No, I don't.
But I know how to find her.

691
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,695
Leave it to me.

692
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,964
I have a question.

693
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:18,664
Why did you help Logan?

694
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,504
Because of Yoon Hee.

695
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,914
Because I felt like...

696
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:30,684
that was what
Yoon Hee would've done.

697
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,064
The person you have reached...

698
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:49,834
The person you have reached...

699
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:53,274
Eun Byeol, pick up.

700
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,405
Eun Byeol, where are you?

701
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,719
Eun Byeol, why can't I reach you?

702
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:00,880
Is something okay?

703
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,588
I'm at Hera Palace.
Make some time for me.

(Eun Byeol)

706
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,164
Eun Byeol, I heard you failed
the Cheong A Arts Center audition.

707
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,765
An SNU grad lost
to a high school grad?

708
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,080
I heard Ro Na was amazing.

709
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,274
Did you see the posts by the kids
who were at the audition?

710
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:30,210
Want to see a video of her audition?

711
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,305
Yes.

Isn't she incredible?

00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:46,659

00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,535
No! Please wake up, Eun Byeol!

719
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,179
We'll die, Eun Byeol!

720
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:05,905
Eun Byeol! Please!

721
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,314
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

722
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,259
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

723
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:16,015
What's wrong? What is it?

724
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,254
Look at me.

725
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,155
Are you okay?

726
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,925
When did you all get here?

727
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,869
What do you mean?
We've been studying for finals.

728
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:29,739
What? I was?

729
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:32,664
Wow. Look at you weaseling out of this.

730
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,075
- You're a great actress.
- You guys...

731
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,314
Eun Byeol! Are you okay?

732
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,155
Ms. Jin.

733
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,725
Drink up.

734
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,225
Why are you so pale?

735
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,365
Have you been eating?

736
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,400
This just won't do.
Let's go to my place.

737
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,234
I'll make you
all of your favorite foods.

738
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:09,234
Ms. Jin. Can you get me
some more of that drug?

739
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:10,475
The drug?

740
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:14,214
Well... It's not that easy.

741
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,414
Please. For me.

742
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:19,584
No one cares about me
as much as you do.

743
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:22,555
I feel like my head will explode
without it.

744
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,184
Please get it for me.

745
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,095
Okay, I will.

746
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:31,929
There's nothing I won't do for you.

747
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,695
Don't worry. I'll get it for you.

748
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:16,675
They stopped the clinical test
because that drug was too dangerous.

749
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,575
People showed signs of early dementia.

750
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,714
It's too dangerous.

751
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:21,274
Do you know that?

752
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:26,684
Why do you care?
I said it doesn't matter.

753
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:30,325
Get me as much as you can next time,
got it?

754
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:35,555
You knew that, but you gave
that garbage to my daughter anyway?

755
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,164
What? Dr. Ha?

756
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:41,934
Eun Byeol wanted it.

757
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:44,464
She asked for it first.

758
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,234
Don't lie to me.

759
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:48,234
Do you think I believe you?

760
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:50,350
You ruined my daughter.

761
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,044
Her parents ruined her.

762
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,374
She's miserable
if she's with the two of you.

763
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:57,484
I'll protect her. I won't lose her!

764
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:22,279
Hey. What are you doing here?

765
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:23,504
Shouldn't you be making dinner?

766
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,515
I don't want to go home
because I don't want to see Kyu Jin,

767
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:31,290
but I have absolutely nowhere else
to go.

768
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,285
My life has been in vain.

769
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:34,960
I had to serve my in-laws...

770
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,389
and support my husband all my life,
so I don't know how to have fun.

771
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,024
And I don't know how to do anything.

772
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,155
Why did I live like this?

773
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,425
Listen to this woman.

774
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:46,964
I want to make him pay big time,

775
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,635
but I have no clue what I should do.

776
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,805
Get up.

777
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,644
- What?
- I'll teach you, so come with me.

778
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,945
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

779
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,015
This woman...

780
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,144
Does she know what time it is?

781
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,130
Her child and the family
were all she ever knew.

782
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,758
But now, she's always out...

783
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,794
and doesn't keep house at all.

784
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:15,995
What is wrong with her?

785
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:20,894
Honey! Where are you?

786
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,604
What?

787
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:28,035
Hey! Where are you?

788
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,405
I'll come to you right now...

789
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,555
Do you think that jerk will care
just because I do this?

790
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:47,794
See? Your phone is blowing up.

791
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,825
Goodness. He is going crazy.

792
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,805
Stay here for two hours, okay?

793
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,044
What is this?

794
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,484
Soju.

795
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,389
You need to smell like alcohol...

796
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:17,524
to make Kyu Jin mad.

797
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:20,759
Yes. Ma Ri!

798
00:50:20,759 --> 00:50:21,759
Gosh.

799
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:24,425
I've already looked up to you...

800
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,894
May I love you?

801
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,394
My gosh! Ma Ri!

802
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,814
Who are you people?
Why did you bring me here?

803
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,984
Do you want to die? Untie me!

804
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,615
What deal did you make
with Joo Dan Tae?

805
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:51,385
Did he promise
to give you Eun Byeol...

806
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:53,259
if you do as he says?

807
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,330
What deal would I make
with Joo Dan Tae?

808
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,425
Why would I do business
with that fool?

809
00:50:57,569 --> 00:51:00,294
Eun Byeol is my daughter anyway.

810
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,569
Do you think
you can take her from me?

811
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:05,365
I'm the one who loves Eun Byeol
more than you two.

812
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,774
You never visited her
since you were released from prison.

813
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,205
All you cared about
was getting revenge.

814
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:15,575
- You crazy...
- That day,

815
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,750
you abducted Eun Byeol,

816
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,955
and Yoon Hee died
trying to go after you.

817
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:22,489
Tell me everything you know.

818
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,190
- What happened that night?
- I don't know.

819
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,825
- Tell me!
- I don't know anything!

820
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,894
I had nothing to do
with Oh Yoon Hee's death.

821
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:32,164
Long time no see.

822
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:33,894
Ms. Jin Bun Hong.

823
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:40,104
Logan?

824
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,675
You're alive?

825
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,175
I am.

826
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,115
Thanks to these two here.

827
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,385
Who did this to you?

828
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:54,814
Joo Dan Tae.

829
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:57,984
He set a bomb to get rid of me.

830
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:01,394
You sided with someone like that,

831
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:02,860
talked to the press,

832
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,029
turned Oh Yoon Hee into a criminal,

833
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:08,434
and even tarnished my reputation.

834
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,535
How could you...

835
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,834
betray me of all people?

836
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:16,644
How could you?

837
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,374
Didn't you come to Korea to help me?

838
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,044
I really had no idea...

839
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,945
that Joo Dan Tae would do something
that dreadful.

840
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,714
The only thing I wanted
was Eun Byeol.

841
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:30,684
I know.

842
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,394
It's because of Michelle,
your dead daughter.

843
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,865
But guess what?

844
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,834
Michelle didn't die because of you.

845
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,535
That night, the person
who left her outdoors...

846
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:49,040
was your drunk husband.

847
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,144
No.

848
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,604
She died because of me.

849
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,644
I ran away.

850
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,575
Because I was scared of my husband.

851
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,314
I left the poor thing behind.

852
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:03,325
Her hands...

853
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:06,825
Her face was so cold.

854
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,725
If I'd gotten to her sooner,
I could've saved her.

855
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,334
I won't leave her alone ever again.

856
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,869
No. Eun Byeol can't be alone either.

857
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,035
I must go to her!

858
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,040
Pull yourself together, you lunatic!

859
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,639
Eun Byeol isn't your daughter!

860
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,949
No! She is my daughter!

861
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:26,449
She sleeps in my arms,

862
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:28,779
she smiles brightly at me,

863
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:31,285
and she tells me everything.

864
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,115
She likes the food I cook,

865
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,259
and she waits and waits for me.

866
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,790
You are out of your mind.

867
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,495
I won't let you
near Eun Byeol again!

868
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,024
Logan!

869
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:47,199
Logan! Please help me.

870
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,139
Let me see Eun Byeol.

871
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,610
She means more than my life.

872
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,339
Please help me, Logan!

873
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:55,434
That...

874
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,575
depends on what you do.

875
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,075
Tell me everything that happened
that day.

876
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:08,354
Tell her, Ms. Jin.

877
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:12,484
That day...

878
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,225
Oh Yoon Hee drove after me.

879
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,198
So I called Joo Dan Tae.

880
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,635
I found Eun Byeol.

881
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,805
I'm being followed by Oh Yoon Hee.

882
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:28,175
Help me.

883
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,604
Oh Yoon Hee is there?

884
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,675
Then I should, of course, help you.

885
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,314
I'll send you an address.
Lure her there.

886
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,429
I met him in an isolated spot.

887
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,230
He suddenly tied me up
and took me somewhere.

888
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,100
- I don't know what happened next.
- Let me go!

889
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,495
Don't lie!

890
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,969
Your car was found
where Yoon Hee died.

891
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:54,765
I really don't know!

892
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:57,069
I was locked up somewhere.

893
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:59,834
He let me go under the condition
that I talk to the media.

894
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,440
That's all.

895
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,205
I can't believe this woman.

896
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:07,115
That day, when the car was pulled
from the water,

897
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,544
the dashboard camera
was already gone.

898
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,385
Ms. Jin. Look into my eyes
as you answer.

899
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,184
That dashboard camera.

900
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,925
Do you really not know
where it went?

901
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:22,029
I don't know where it is.
You can ask the police.

902
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:23,524
Jin Bun Hong!

903
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,794
Tell me honestly.

904
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,774
I'm giving you one last chance.

905
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,544
The police don't know either.

906
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:44,290
To hide the fact that
I'd kidnapped Eun Byeol,

907
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,785
I hired someone to get
the dashboard camera,

908
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:48,460
but I haven't seen
the footage either.

909
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,254
It's company property,
and I couldn't get into the system.

910
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,024
Then tell me...

911
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,225
where that dashboard camera is now.

912
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:12,479
It has been six months.

913
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:14,379
Do you think
the video's still there?

914
00:56:14,379 --> 00:56:16,280
If it's the last video
before the accident,

915
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,620
it'll be there.

916
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,784
Because there's no new footage
to be taped over it.

917
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,815

918
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,025
(Record List)

919
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,195
Eun Byeol!

920
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,430
Get it out!

921
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,864
I'll jump aside once it's out,
so get it out!

922
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,195
Free your hand first.

923
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,499
Eun Byeol, wake up.

924
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:38,934
No, Eun Byeol...

925
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,574
No!

926
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:50,445
Let go.

927
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,974
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

928
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:23,350
She killed Yoon Hee.

929
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,645
She's crazy.

930
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:26,585
She's crazy.

931
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,155
Why would she... Why?

932
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,594
She killed Yoon Hee...

933
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,994
and wanted me gone too.

934
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,864
To take everything.

935
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,695
Do you think Dan Tae
and Seo Jin are working together?

936
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:44,804
No.

937
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:48,634
Dan Tae will think
he killed Yoon Hee.

938
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:52,204
But that doesn't cancel out
his crimes.

939
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:54,315
To put pressure on Yoo Dong Pil,

940
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:57,089
he used Yoon Hee's corpse.

941
00:57:57,089 --> 00:57:59,085
He killed her twice.

942
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:01,390
Did Eun Byeol see all this?

943
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,855
Is that why she asked Jin Bun Hong
for the pills?

944
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,425
Cheon Seo Jin...

945
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,355
She got Eun Byeol in this mess.

946
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,864
I will not forgive her.

947
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,594
Never.

948
00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:15,235
They will see...

949
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:18,465
what torture is like.

950
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,815
Mr. Yoo, are you all right?

951
00:58:35,419 --> 00:58:36,715
Don't mind me.

952
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:43,458
You know that Jenny's
now Cheong A Arts Center's...

953
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,065
Artist in Residence, right?

954
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:49,069
It would've been nice
if you'd attended the party.

955
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:50,295
Why are you...

956
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,879
always interfering and meddling?

957
00:58:53,879 --> 00:58:56,375
Jenny did really well that day.

958
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,114
Look. You wanted to see, didn't you?

959
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:04,990
She was dazzling at the audition.

960
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,620
(Official Video)

961
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,155
Jenny always said
she's like her dad.

962
00:59:13,189 --> 00:59:16,655
That's why she's loyal
and softhearted.

963
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,999
A daughter takes after her dad.

964
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,965
Would she take after a passing dog?

965
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,704
Jenny likes you a lot.

966
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:29,479
She always looks at her photo
with you before bed.

967
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,275
She misses you.

968
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,145
I don't know what's going on,

969
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:37,545
but if you speak earnestly
to her and Ms. Kang,

970
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:39,384
won't they understand?

971
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,485
Tell me whatever you need.
I'll help.

972
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:50,094
You shouldn't drink too much either.

973
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:05,574
You jerk.

974
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:09,175
Yoo Dong Pil.

975
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,284
You are the biggest scumbag.

976
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,074
I don't deserve it,

977
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:43,014
but I'm going to be
your father for once.

978
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,784
Just this once.

979
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,574
Kang Ma Ri.

980
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,175
What should I do first?

981
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,105
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

982
01:01:47,649 --> 01:01:49,215
Then I'll gladly be punished.

986
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:12,235
Sure.

987
01:02:13,539 --> 01:02:15,735
One, two, three.

988
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:24,184
No rabbit looks like that.

989
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:26,485
Isn't it adorable?

990
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,454
It's cute.

991
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,074
Where have you been?

992
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,375
It's too early to be walking around.

993
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,979
If Joo Dan Tae finds you...

994
01:02:55,979 --> 01:02:57,645
Can I ask you for a favor?

995
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,855
I saved this money...

996
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,414
for Ro Na.

997
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:05,255
Please hand it to her for me.

998
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:11,994
Why don't you do it yourself?
Even though you're late.

999
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,235
You can still be her father.

1000
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,434
I heard from Yoon Hee.

1001
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,838
I don't deserve to be a dad.

1002
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,605
Ro Na wouldn't want that either.

1003
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:25,275
However,

1004
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:28,450
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to destroy...

1005
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,175
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin
for Yoon Hee.

1006
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,045
I'll do whatever it takes.

1007
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,054
I will avenge Yoon Hee's death
with my own hands.

1008
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:40,224
At least Yoon Hee won't be lonely.

1009
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:45,994
You and I both want to pay her back
for what we owe her.

1010
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,005
If anything happens to me,

1011
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,905
promise you'll take care of Ro Na.

1012
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,375
Stay by her side till the end.

1017
01:04:27,939 --> 01:04:29,405
It's you, isn't it?

1018
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,350
Where are you?

1019
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,379
I'll come.

1020
01:04:32,379 --> 01:04:34,514
- We should meet...
- I have something to tell you.

1021

Director Cheon Myung Soo...

1022
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,884
didn't die of a heart attack.

1023
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,485
Someone killed him.

1024
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,784
It was Cheon Seo Jin.

1025
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,129
What are you saying all of a sudden?

1026
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:53,795
I saw her in the video.

1027
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,669
Eun Byeol had it.

1028
01:04:55,669 --> 01:04:57,364
Eun Byeol is the witness.

1029
01:05:00,669 --> 01:05:04,445
I hope you succeed in
whatever it is you're trying to do.

1030

1033

What are you doing?

1034
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,945
Can't you see I'm eating?

1035
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,574
I'm starving. I haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

1036
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,114
What are you talking about?

1037
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,255
You just ate.
You ate a whole bowl of curry.

1038
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,085
I did? When?

1039
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,264
Eun Byeol!

1040
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,695
Get Eun Byeol out first!

1041
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,034
Quickly!

1042
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:09,879
My leg!

1043
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:12,450
I'll jump aside once it's out,
so get it out!

Eun Byeol!

1048
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,514
Don't touch me!

1049
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:28,395
What's wrong with you?
What are you saying?

1050
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,295
What did I just say?

1051
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,735
You don't remember?

1052
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,065
My head's been hurting lately.

1053
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:43,804
Right, it's your inauguration today.

1054
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:45,445
Be pretty.

1055
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,545
I should go get ready as well.

1056
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,715
Eun Byeol, why this again?

1057
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:58,585
I thought you'd forgotten it all.

1058
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,065
It's all because of the stress
from that audition.

1059
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:06,724
Because of Bae Ro Na.

1060
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:10,795
It's going to be fine, right?

1061
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:12,804
Yes.

1062
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:15,474
Everything will be fine soon.

1063
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:17,875
My Eun Byeol...

1064
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,045
is meant to lead

Thank you.

Today, I was born again.

1069
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,195
When I stepped down
as the director of Cheong A Foundation,

1070
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,235
I thought I died.

1071
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:22,605
But you've brought me back to life.

1072
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,175
I will think of the rest of my life
as something extra...

1073
01:08:26,249 --> 01:08:29,344
and sacrifice myself for education.

1074
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:33,289
From now on, Cheong A Foundation
