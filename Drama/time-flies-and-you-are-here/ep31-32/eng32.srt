20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Life is like a dream. Nothing
can be compared to being carefree.)

21
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,239
Zhao Xiaoqian,

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,919
are you coveting the throne?

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,919
Your Highness, do you
believe such an accusation?

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,720
Such insolence.

25
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:55,800
Such atrocity.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,879
If he is spared,

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,279
it will only invite greater troubles.

28
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,440
Your Highness, I beg you
to issue the order.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,160
I beg Your Highness
to execute this traitor.

30
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,199
Your Highness,

31
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,680
you mustn't hesitate.

32
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,919
Look at the state.

33
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:09,960
Your Highness mustn't allow it

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,039
to fall into the hands of a traitor
who colluded with the enemy.

35
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,160
Chancellor Xu.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,600
Your Highness.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,440
I beg Your Highness
to execute this traitor.

38
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,199
I beg Your Highness
to execute this traitor.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,720
- Please execute this traitor.
- Brother.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,520
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

41
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,000
It will be fine.

42
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,000
Please issue the order, Your Highness.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,440
Arrest this traitor immediately.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

45
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,080
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,240
The Crown Prince cannot fall.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,320
I've raised the Crown Prince
for many years.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,119
He might not be my biological son,

49
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,440
but

50
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,960
didn't I raise him

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,199
like my own?

52
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,600
Back then,

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,039
I lost my own child.

54
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,639
Today,

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,679
if Zhao Xiaoqian ascends to the throne,

56
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,440
Xiaoze will not be spared.

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,839
I have come this far.

58
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,000
Please do not blame me
for being ruthless.

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,600
Chancellor Xu, you,

60
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:24,759
and the Crown Prince

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,279
colluded for personal gains

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,759
and you colluded to commit malfeasance.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,119
Did you really think that

64
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,759
I had no idea what you did

65
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:36,919
or I was unperturbed?

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,199
Is that so?

67
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,720
I just considered the fact that

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
you two are my wife and my son,

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
and the other one is
the pillar of the imperial court.

70
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,399
I wanted to secure your dignity.

71
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,320
What's the matter?

72
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,479
I can tolerate it all.

73
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,119
Can't you be a little more patient?

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,199
Zhao Xiaoqian is coveting after
the position of the Crown Prince.

75
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,199
I'm left with no choice.

76
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,039
Qiongniang.

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,639
You and I are joined in matrimony.

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
Did you think that

79
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,479
I would abandon you?

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,720
You're the Empress,

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,440
the mother of the nation.

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,359
You could've sustained your position
for the rest of your life,

83
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,480
earned a great reputation,

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,279
and been praised by
the generations to come.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
Isn't that great?

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,760
Why did you get yourself involved

87
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,119
in the crimes of treason and corruption?

88
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,279
Yes.

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
I may be the Empress,

90
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,880
the mother of the nation,

91
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,119
but do you have any idea

92
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,559
how much suffering and anguish

93
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,559
come with that glory?

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
I lost my own child back then.

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,279
Zhao Xiaoqian

96
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,079
was the cause of my miscarriage,

97
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,160
and yet you forced me
to treat him as my own son.

98
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,000
I came to this point

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
all because of you.

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,959
You may loathe me or
condemn me all you want.

101
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll accept it all.

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,200
The Crown Prince

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,959
is my only hope.

104
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,359
Back then,
he wasn't the one responsible

105
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,799
for the loss of your child.

106
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,200
You're lying to me again!

107
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,760
Back then,
the imperial physician claimed

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,839
that your pregnancy

109
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,320
was unstable since the beginning.

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,040
The child passed away
before parturition.

111
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,359
You refused to believe it.

112
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,519
You harmed Xiaojie because of this.

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,440
Right now,

114
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,839
you're here to harm me.

115
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Qiongniang.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,519
I've always treated you
with care and tolerance.

117
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,279
Did you know that

118
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,799
I've never intended to
renounce the Crown Prince?

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
No matter how impressive
Zhao Xiaoqian is,

120
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,399
he's not of my own flesh!

121
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,399
General,

122
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,359
the harem is a forbidden ground!

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,279
Get out of the way!

124
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:20,839
Do not move!

125
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:28,839
Hurry up!

126
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,720
Arrest this traitor immediately

127
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,839
and execute him on the spot!

128
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,239
Chancellor Xu, are you issuing

129
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,399
an edict on His Majesty's behalf?

130
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,239
Your Highness.

131
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,959
I have an appeal to make.

132
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I request for the impeachment
of the Grand Chancellor, Xu Huan.

133
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,519
He embezzled the military funds,

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,239
colluded with others for personal gains.

135
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,519
and accused faithful officers.
He's a pest of the country!

136
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,399
All counts of allegations

137
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,399
are listed in the appeal.

138
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,399
The relevant evidences

139
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,040
are accounted for in the appeal as well.

140
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,359
Chancellor Xu, if you do not believe me,

141
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,359
should I recite the following counts
to the entire court

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,679
of your exploitation and corruption
in Jingdong and Jingxi Roads,

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,119
how you accused and
framed the fellow officials,

144
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,079
and also,

145
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,119
how you embezzled
the military funds of Baichuankou?

146
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,399
You traitor!

147
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,040
What a load of nonsense!

148
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,279
Whether they are utter nonsense,

149
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,480
you may not believe my claims,

150
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,119
but you should believe
your old associate,

151
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,279
Li Guangwen.

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,079
Don't you think so?

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,399
Li Guangwen, your sinful servant,
is here to greet Your Highness.

154
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,399
Long live the Crown Prince.

155
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,519
You...

156
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,480
I tried to rush over,

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,559
but I couldn't catch up.

158
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,000
I fought the war alongside you
for years.

159
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,399
Put the blame on me.

160
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,400
In the past, you entered
the Prince's Mansion

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
and the imperial palace with me.

162
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,840
We've been married for decades.

163
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,280
We've been through thick and thin.

164
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:54,400
At our old age,

165
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,359
you're forcing me to abdicate my throne.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
Did I allow you to adopt Xiaoze

167
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,559
and make him the Crown Prince

168
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,320
only to

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,080
bring such woe upon myself?

170
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,719
Tell me.

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
Why did I crown you Empress?

172
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,280
Why did I make Xiaoze Crown Prince?

173
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,039
I did all those to grant
you honour and authority,

174
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,479
and for you to share my burdens
and govern the harem.

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,919
For the past bond and our affection,

176
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,359
I cosseted you.

177
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't believe I've allowed you
to come to this point.

178
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,799
It seems like

179
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,559
everything I did for you was a mistake.

180
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,000
Your Majesty.

181
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
For me to come this far,

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
it's all your fault.

183
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
It's all your fault.

184
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,799
It's all your fault!

185
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:15,200
How dare you point a dagger at me?

186
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,119
Come on.

187
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,440
Go ahead and stab me.

188
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Stab me.

189
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:25,960
Stab me

190
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,239
and you'll be able to obtain
everything you wanted!

191
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,000
Stab me!

192
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm fine!

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,320
Guards!

194
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,359
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,919
Watch over her.

196
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,440
Help me get changed.

197
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,479
I'm attending the court meeting.

198
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,039
Such disrespect before the Crown Prince.

199
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,840
You accused the grand chancellor
of the nation,

200
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,479
and connived with a criminal openly.

201
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,640
You've committed treason and heresy.

202
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,119
Zhao Xiaoqian.

203
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,799
For each claim you made,
your execution

204
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,719
is a show of mercy.

205
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,599
Drag Li Guangwen away.

206
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,119
Do not move an inch!

207
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,000
Commandery Prince,
if you refuse to abide,

208
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,479
I'm afraid this scholar

209
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,039
will be executed first.

210
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,000
Three years ago,

211
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,799
we went to Baichuankou

212
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,479
and joined the army under General Xu Zi.

213
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,479
Back then, I told you that

214
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,200
I, Zhong Ziyan, am willing
to die for your sake.

215
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,840
Listen up, Zhao Xiaoqian!

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,320
It's the same today!

217
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,479
The War of Baichuankou

218
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,559
lasted for three years.

219
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,000
We were almost killed for many times.

220
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Numerous brothers

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,359
were starved to death

222
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,799
on the battlefield due to
the lack of provisions.

223
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Li Guangwen.

224
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,200
I'm going to ask you again.

225
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,640
Do you

226
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,880
concede or not?

227
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,119
Back then, you said that

228
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:11,960
you'll have justice served

229
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
for the brothers
who died at Baichuankou.

230
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,599
Hanchen,

231
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,440
today is the day.

232
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,760
Do not stop!

233
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:22,919
Send him away!

234
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,359
Hold on!

235
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,440
Commandery Prince,

236
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,559
you want to challenge me?

237
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,520
You have a long way to go.

238
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,919
However, I'm afraid

239
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,080
you ran out of time.

240
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,479
Guards,

241
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,799
behead this traitor at once!

242
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,640
Hanchen!

243
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,440
Hanchen!

244
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,559
Ziyan!

245
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,239
Ziyan.

246
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,320
You'll be fine.

247
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,039
You'll be fine.

248
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,440
You're going to be all right.

249
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,039
Don't worry.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,679
Your Highness, you asked me

251
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,880
why I am so obsessed about

252
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,320
undertaking the imperial examinations?

253
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,919
Stop talking. Do not say a word.

254
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,280
Send for the imperial physician!

255
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,960
Send for the imperial physician!

256
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,679
Send for the imperial physician!

257
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,280
Send for the imperial physician!

258
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,559
Send for the imperial physician!

259
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,119
It's because injustice
exists everywhere.

260
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,159
I'm

261
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
going to reclaim justice.

262
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,960
Today...

263
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,159
If I died here today,

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,799
I would be

265
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,239
considered a martyr,

266
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,039
isn't that right?

267
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,719
Hanchen.

268
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:28,679
Stop talking.

269
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,159
You're going to be fine.

270
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,799
I'm taking you to the Spring Exam.

271
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,559
I'm going to attend
your Qionglin Banquet.

272
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,000
It's going to be all right.

273
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,799
Everything will be all right.

274
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,719
I'm not going.

275
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm going to join our fellow brothers.

276
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,960
I recall

277
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,080
how cold the winter was
back at Baichuankou.

278
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,679
You told me

279
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,919
to put on two layers of Armour.

280
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,359
The state must be prioritized.

281
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,919
Baichuankou must be prioritized.

282
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,760
Zhong Ziyan...

283
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:23,799
Ziyan.

284
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,359
Ziyan.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,039
Ziyan!

286
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,239
Stop standing around.
Hurry up and execute the traitor.

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,479
You...

288
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,679
Why are all of you

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
arresting me instead?

290
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,520
Archer of fifth camp, Qiu Da'er,

291
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,359
was enlisted for eight years.

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,359
He was shot to death by arrows
in the fight at Gu City.

293
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,719
Deputy General Wang Zhi,
canon fighter of third camp,

294
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,880
was enlisted for three years.

295
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,520
He died of illness.

296
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,599
Ruan Xiaoyi,
military officer of eighth camp,

297
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,640
was enlisted for a year.

298
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,479
He died when guarding the city.

299
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
Qin Wei, foot solider of fourth camp,

300
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,359
was enlisted for 20 years.

301
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,119
In the fight at Cliff Liang,
he resisted the enemy.

302
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,760
He was killed after being
encircled by the army.

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,159
Huang Liu, scout of second camp,

304
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,400
safeguarded the escort
of the last batch of provisions,

305
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,359
and he was shot dead by a fire arrow
in his chest.

306
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,760
Military strategist of third camp,
Zhong Ziyan,

307
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,719
was killed in the palace

308
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,680
for eliminating
the evil grand chancellor.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,359
Do these names

310
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,560
ring a bell to you, Chancellor Xu?

311
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,719
Because of your greed

312
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,800
for military funds and provisions,

313
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,479
all of them died in vain at Baichuankou!

314
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,760
When you fall asleep at night,

315
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,680
do they haunt you in your dream?

316
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,400
For the 10,000 lives lost,

317
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,239
today,

318
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,479
your debt will be paid!

319
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,319
I urge Your Highness

320
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,680
to investigate Xu Huan!

321
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,839
His Majesty has arrived!

322
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,560
Long live the Emperor!

323
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,319
Do I still exist as the Emperor?

324
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,560
Before the court,

325
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,160
things are getting out of hand.

326
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,319
You may all rise.

327
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

328
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,400
Li Guangwen, your sinful servant,
the previous secretariat,

329
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,680
is here to greet Your Majesty.

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,319
Long live the Emperor.

331
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:30,800
Your Majesty,

332
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,359
I offer my life to
impeach Chancellor Xu.

333
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
This confession has

334
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,680
recorded the evidences
of Chancellor Xu's

335
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,040
attempts to control the court

336
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,079
and embezzle the state fund
over the years.

337
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,520
Chancellor Xu is corrupted.

338
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,760
He colluded with others
for personal gains.

339
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,479
He embezzled the military funds

340
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
and seized the state's possessions.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,599
He's guilty of accusing the innocent.

342
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,160
Such allegations add up
to a total of 146 crimes.

343
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,040
I seek Your Majesty to
attend to this matter.

344
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,319
Slander!

345
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,280
Accusation!

346
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,680
Your Majesty.

347
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,500
(Appeal)

348
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,020
(Appeal)

349
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Xu Huan

350
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,680
has served the court as
an official for over thirty years.

351
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,000
As the grand chancellor,

352
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,319
what have you been doing over the years?

353
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,319
Did you really take me for a fool?

354
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,160
With respect to your position
as an official of the court,

355
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
I chose to be lenient.

356
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,520
As a result, you committed such
vile and unforgivable crimes.

357
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,520
Even only one of these claims

358
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,680
is enough to annihilate
your entire clan!

359
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,319
Your Majesty.

360
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,680
I...

361
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,359
I confess to my crimes,

362
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,119
Your Majesty.

363
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,560
I deserve death.

364
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,880
I beg for Your Majesty's mercy

365
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,520
for the sake of my past contribution.

366
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,599
Arrest him.

367
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Seal his property for investigation.

368
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
As for the associates involved,

369
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,760
none will be spared.

370
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,040
Grand Secretariat Qin,

371
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,119
you shall be in charge.

372
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,319
Your Majesty.

374
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,119
Take him away.

375
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,160
Your Majesty.

376
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,520
Your Majesty.

377
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

378
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,160
Arrest the criminals,

379
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,920
executed those who deserve death,

380
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,560
and do

381
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,280
everything that should be done.

382
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,520
My heart aches, my Empress.

383
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm aggrieved because
my family twisted the truth

384
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,839
and lost moral sense.

385
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,560
My family colluded with others
to bring me harm.

386
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,599
Should I place you under investigation

387
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,280
or let you go?

388
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,760
It's all my fault.

389
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,400
I was blinded by lust and greed.

390
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,079
I went astray.

391
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,160
However, Xiaoze is innocent.

392
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
He's still young.

393
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,640
He had no idea what's going on.

394
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
He was being used by me.

395
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm willing to bear the consequences

396
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,280
for all the crimes.

397
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,040
Your Highness.

398
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,959
Your Highness.

399
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,239
I'm not your biological mother.

400
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,640
I adopted you in the first place.

401
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,079
Today,

402
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,199
there's no need to put up
an act of benevolence.

403
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,719
I'm accountable for my own actions.

404
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,280
I'll not implicate anyone.

405
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Mother!

406
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,280
Shut up!

407
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm not your mother!

408
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,800
Qiongniang,

409
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,119
we're husband and wife.

410
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,439
I'll not harm you.

411
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,239
You shall leave the imperial palace
for cultivation at the temple

412
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,800
and reflect sincerely
on your wrongdoings.

413
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,199
In this life,

414
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,079
we shall never meet again.

415
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,119
I

416
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,479
thank Your Majesty for your grace.

417
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,760
Mother.

418
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:44,760
Mother.

419
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,239
Mother.

420
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,479
Get up.

421
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,040
I dare not.

422
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
Get up.

423
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,680
Let me ask you.

424
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,199
During the day at Zichen Palace,

425
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,119
why didn't you issue the order

426
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,160
to execute Zhao Xiaoqian?

427
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,599
He's my elder brother.

428
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:42,479
You knew that the Empress would
be executed for her crimes.

429
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,439
Why did you address her

430
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,000
as your mother?

431
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,239
Her Highness is my mother!

432
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,119
My son.

433
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,439
Remember the decision you made today.

434
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,680
This

435
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,479
is known as benevolence.

436
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,560
Although you're weak,

437
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,160
I still value

438
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,760
the kindness and benevolence
in your heart.

439
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,479
You must work harder

440
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,000
in order to

441
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,280
govern the people

442
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,160
with kindness and benevolence
in the future.

443
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,100
(Shenwu Gate)

444
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
You won.

445
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,000
You've finally avenged your brother.

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
Are you satisfied?

447
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,280
Did you think that I returned

448
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,640
to avenge my brother?

449
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,439
Isn't that so?

450
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,800
Everything I did today

451
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,959
was for the Crown Prince's sake.

452
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,199
I did this to make sure I'm assisting
a wise successor of the throne.

453
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,359
Even my brother

454
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,839
wouldn't want me

455
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,040
to return for revenge.

456
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,400
I returned

457
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,040
so that the people I love

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,000
may live in peace and prosperity.

459
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,920
Brother Hanchen,

460
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,800
do you see me as your rival

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,199
as everyone else are saying?

462
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Do you seek to replace me

463
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,239
by killing me?

464
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,880
You're my little brother.

465
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,160
Under no circumstances

466
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,640
would I ever harm you.

467
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,760
How should I treat you then?

468
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,359
That's your decision to make.

469
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,479
You may view me as your subject,

470
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,119
your elder brother,

471
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,839
or an enemy.

472
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,479
Regardless what you think of me,

473
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,640
make sure it's the right decision.

474
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,760
What's the right decision?

475
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,239
One made without
the influence of others.

476
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,160
Discern right from wrong for yourself.

477
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,079
Protect the righteous.

478
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,800
Punish the unruly and the evil.

479
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,000
That's the right decision.

480
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,239
I bid you farewell, Your Highness!

481
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,479
Long live the Crown Prince!

482
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,000
You may rise.

483
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,400
You may rise.

484
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,479
Thank you, Your Majesty.

485
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I've completed the task
Your Majesty entrusted to me.

486
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,359
Chancellor Xu will be executed.

487
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,160
The Ministry of Justice
has begun the investigation.

488
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,079
The associates involved
in the imperial court

489
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,439
were all arrested.

490
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,959
Property of the remaining members will
be confiscated for investigation.

491
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,439
You've finally achieved

492
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,640
what you wanted.

493
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,239
This isn't just what I wanted.

494
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,199
It's also what Your Majesty wanted.

495
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,880
A clean imperial court

496
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
where the corrupted are eliminated.

497
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,079
The people of the nation

498
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,839
will eulogize Your Majesty's brilliance

499
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,680
and thank Your Majesty
for the immense grace.

500
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,400
Spare the flattery.

501
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,920
Do you know that, by doing this,

502
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,079
we have lost the grand chancellor.

503
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,079
More than half of the officials
are involved.

504
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,839
The imperial court is finally clean,

505
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,400
but the talents within the court
have withered as well.

506
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,640
Your Majesty may launch the imperial
examinations to recruit talents.

507
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,160
With a clean imperial court,

508
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,839
talents will not go undiscovered.

509
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,119
What about you?

510
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,439
What do you seek?

511
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,199
I'd like to guard the borders
at Baichuankou.

512
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,239
Don't you want the position of
the Crown Prince?

513
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
A future without Chancellor Xu

514
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,000
implies the imperial court is safe
from the corrupted.

515
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:36,680
I have faith that one day,

516
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,119
Xiaoze will be able to
govern the nation on his own.

517
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,000
You're flattering

518
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,640
the Crown Prince as well.

519
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,800
Look at you.

521
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,880
I've never seen you concede,

522
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,760
brat.

523
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,800
You should stay.

524
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,959
Help me look after Xiaoze.

525
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,280
I'm not meant to be an official.

526
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
I'm used to brawls and fights.

527
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,640
I wouldn't be comfortable
if I stayed anyway.

528
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,479
I'll head to Baichuankou

529
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,839
to defend the borders for you and Xiaoze

530
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,359
and secure peace for you.

531
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,640
However, before I leave,
I have two favors to ask.

532
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,119
I seek Your Majesty's approval.

533
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,599
Speak.

534
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,680
I'd like to request for
a title granted to

535
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,520
military strategist of third camp,
Zhong Ziyan.

536
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,400
I request for a title
to be given to his mother.

537
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,160
Granted.

538
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,199
What's the other request?

539
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,400
I have a concubine named Xie Xiaoman.

540
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
She's from Yuyangli Village,
Wujiang Prefecture.

541
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,880
Her family is upright and kind.

542
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,880
After all that I've done,

543
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,199
I hope Your Majesty will no longer
betroth anyone else to me.

544
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,319
I request for an imperial edict

545
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,640
to make Xie Xiaoman
Commandery Princess Consort,

546
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,680
and allow her to return
to Baichuankou with me

547
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,760
for the rest of our lives.

548
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,439
I'll be eternally grateful
for your grace.

549
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,160
Your concubine, Xie Xiaoman?

550
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:25,920
Yes.

551
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,719
All right.

552
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,560
Granted.

553
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

554
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,160
My son.

555
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,640
Have you

556
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,000
blamed me, your father, for all these?

557
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,079
I'm a subject

558
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,959
of yours.

559
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,839
I'm Your Majesty's servant.

560
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,119
I'll always be
the Crown Prince's servant as well.

561
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,959
If that's the case,

562
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,599
from now on,

563
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,959
you'll no longer

564
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,479
call me father.

565
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,000
I, your servant,

566
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,560
shall excuse myself.

567
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,040
All shall heed.

568
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,399
My nephew,

569
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
Commandery Prince of Julu,

570
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,280
Grand Commandant,
Imperial Grand Governor, Zhao Xiaoqian,

571
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,639
is kind and just.

572
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,520
He's proficient in both literature
and martial arts.

573
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,719
His filial piety and respect

574
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,639
reach the heaven.

575
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,360
His undivided loyalty for the nation

576
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,120
exceeds the sun and the moon.

577
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,199
Besides being the Commander
of the imperial court,

578
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,639
he shall be promoted as Grand Commandant
of all four borders of Guanxi.

579
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,399
He shall be dispatched to the borders.

580
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,600
He shall depart tomorrow.

581
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,399
By exception, the degree holder
of Jinshi, Zhong Ziyan,

582
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,120
showed great respect

583
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,840
and great loyalty.

584
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,719
His loyalty has touched the nation.

585
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,879
He shall be promoted as
Prefect of Administration.

586
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,840
He shall be buried as
a noble official of the court.

587
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,399
Daughter of Xie Family
of Wujiang Prefecture

588
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,719
shall be promoted as Duchess of Wuguo,

589
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,520
and granted the title,
Commandery Princess Consort of Julu.

590
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,840
The end.

591
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,080
Hanchen.

592
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,919
What are you doing here?

593
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,239
Are you missing Brother Xiaojie?

594
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm missing you.

595
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,760
There is plenty of time
for you to miss me.

596
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,560
Don't be impatient.

597
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,399
Do you regret

598
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,120
becoming my learning partner?

599
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,679
I'd never regret it.

600
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,600
Why?

601
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,959
Because you're Zhao Xiaoqian

602
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,199
and I'm Zhong Ziyan.

603
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,040
I, Zhong Ziyan, am willing
to die for your sake.

604
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,560
You should hurry home.

605
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,239
Xiaoman is waiting for you.

606
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,959
In time to come,

607
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,719
I'll not be able to walk with you.

608
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:27,959
Till here.

609
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:52,760
My husband.

610
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,639
Let's go home.

611
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,260
(The grave of Prefect of Administration
of Song, Zhong Ziyan)

612
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,679
Xingzhou,

613
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,760
we're leaving the capital.

614
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,679
Will you blame us?

615
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,439
Don't worry.

616
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,159
Xingzhou isn't a petty person.

617
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,760
Goodbye,

618
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:20,879
Xingzhou.

619
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,360
Goodbye.

620
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,439
Goodbye.

621
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,719
Let's go.

622
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,220
(Qingtai Gate)
(One year later, Wujiang Prefecture)

623
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,399
Watch out.

624
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,560
I said that you're not allowed out here.

625
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,239
You're not allowed out here.

626
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,239
What are you talking about?

627
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,199
You insisted on coming outside.

628
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,399
What should we do

629
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,159
if you tire my eldest son out?

630
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,919
How annoying.

631
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:11,760
Watch your step.

632
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,000
Father. Mother.

633
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,760
Is there

634
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,080
anything that I could help?

635
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:17,120
Oh mine.

636
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,959
Forget it.

637
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,159
Take care of my grandchild.

638
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,239
That would be the greatest help.

639
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,239
That's right, Minggu.

640
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,719
We don't need your help.

641
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,879
Get some rest.

642
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:27,080
Watch her well.

643
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,239
Yes.

644
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,199
I asked her to stay in the room,

645
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:30,959
but she wouldn't listen.

646
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,199
She insisted on coming here to work.

647
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,080
Whose fault is it?

648
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,360
Whose fault is it?

649
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,719
It's all your fault.

650
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,159
I can barely straighten my back

651
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,239
or bend forward.

652
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,199
It's all your fault.

653
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,239
How is it my fault?

654
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,239
It's all

655
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,919
because of that brat inside of you.

656
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,719
Isn't that right?

657
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,520
I'll get him to apologize
after he's delivered.

658
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,919
Yan Boyang, what are you talking about?

659
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,760
Okay, my fault.

660
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,760
I need to nourish my body.

661
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,040
Where's Hanchen?

662
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,959
Is he absent today?

663
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,239
He sprained his waist
from excessive training

664
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,600
a few days ago.

665
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,760
He's recuperating in the barrack.

666
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,040
You're running late.

667
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,239
General Xu is going to reprimand you.

668
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,120
Of course.

669
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:49,879
A few days ago, General Xu said,

670
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,520
as the commander,

671
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,360
all I do is stay with you.

672
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,239
You should hurry up then.

673
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,760
I asked Shi Deng'er to
apply leave for me.

674
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,600
I've trained them consecutively for
seven to eight days.

675
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,040
Even a machine

676
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,120
needs to get some rest with his wife.

677
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,639
Sleep with me for a while.

678
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,399
I don't want to sleep with you.

679
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,959
Who's going to sleep with me
if you're not going to?

680
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:14,760
Go ahead and run.

681
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,879
Listen to me.

682
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:18,040
Do not even think of leaving
without sleeping with me.

683
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,439
Stop running.

684
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,040
Come here.

685
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,520
Stop running.

686
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,360
What's going on with your lady?

687
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,639
Whenever His Highness sees her,

688
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,159
he always is captivated.

689
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,120
What's going on with
your Commandery Prince?

690
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,679
Whenever he sees my lady,

691
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,719
he wouldn't be able to walk.

692
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,120
Commandery Princess Consort
sure is lucky.

693
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:47,679
In the next life,

694
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,919
if I was able to meet a man
like His Highness,

695
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,760
I'll marry him at all cost.

696
00:43:59,239 --> 00:43:59,760
Get over here!

697
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,639
Stand here.

698
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,580
