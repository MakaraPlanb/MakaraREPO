This...

94
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,600
This is ridiculous.

95
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,640
Hurry up.

96
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,119

Hanchen's residence is spacious.

101
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,600
I ran back and forth dozens of times.

102
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,640
My legs

103
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,359
are exhausted.

Boyang.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,040
It's time for you to work out.

106
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,279
Your stamina is poor.

107
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,600
That won't do in the future.

108
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,760
Xingzhou.

109
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,200
You've gotten pretty cheeky.

110
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,480
I guess it confirms the saying that
goes, one who lies down with dogs

111
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,679
will get up with fleas.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
Are you calling Hanchen a dog?

113
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:00,880
That's true.

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,239
On Hanchen's wedding night,

115
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:04,959
he drank three whole jugs of wine.

116
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,040
He'd go wild.

117
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,839
I was referring to you.

118
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Me?

119
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,040
All right.

120
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,320
Fine.

121
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,119
It doesn't matter.

122
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,679
As long as the three
of us remain together.

123
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,760
everything will be fine.

124
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:18,799

Sirs.

126
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,399
Please keep it down.

127
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,640
It's getting late.

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
We shouldn't interrupt
His Highness' wedding night.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,919
All right.

130
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,320
Let's drink up somewhere else.

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's go.

132
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,060
(Sleeping Room)

133
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,320
Zhao Xiaoqian.

134
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,039
If you do not come right now,

135
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,840
you will never come near me for good.

136
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,760
You...

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,159
What's wrong?

138
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Are you not going to

139
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
sleep with me?

140
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm exhausted.

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,599
Let's just go to bed.

142
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,599
How would you like to sleep?

143
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,479
Like this?

144
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,960
Keep this in mind.

145
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,280
Since you're married to me,

146
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,719
you have nothing to fear.

147
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,799
Do you understand?

148
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,799
Zhao Xiaoqian.

149
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,039
I have something on.

150
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,559
Go to bed first.

151
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,599
Keep this in mind.

152
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,400
Now that you're married to me,

153
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,479
you may do whatever you want.

154
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,159
Mr. Liangji.

155
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,760
What's wrong with His Highness?

156
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,400
It's his wedding night.

157
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,760
He came out to take a cold bath.

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,239
Congratulations, Lord Zhao,

159
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,400
for your promotion
as the Imperial Grand Governor.

160
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,599
In the future,

161
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,559
you're going to attain great success.

162
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,359
Thank you, Chancellor Xu.

163
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,799
As the Imperial Grand Governor,

164
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm afraid I'm going
to need your guidance

165
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,840
for the connections
and ways around the capital.

166
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,640
For the sake of a common lady,

167
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,359
you forgo the marriage with Shen Family.

168
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,679
For what?

169
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,080
If I'm not wrong,

170
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,960
perhaps you weren't after
the throne in the first place.

171
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,599
The 200,000 piculs
of provisions at Baichuankou.

172
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,719
Li Guangwen's bank.

173
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:02,799
The accounts of Jingdong
and Jingxi Roads.

174
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,679
My intentions

175
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
lie in these three cases.

176
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Aren't you afraid of uncovering
the things you aren't supposed to?

177
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
Regardless who is involved,

178
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,479
I'll investigate no matter what.

179
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,159
What I seek is

180
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,119
for you to head to hell

181
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,080
and pay respects to
the 10,000 late brothers of mine.

182
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,960
All right.

183
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,960
How impressive,
Commandery Prince of Julu.

184
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,320
You managed to deceive me.

185
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,400
You're quite the man, Zhao Xiaoqian.

186
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,159
I said this many times.

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,599
Do not only cram.

188
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,119
Tell me.

189
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,359
What should you do
if a flood breaks out?

190
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,039
I...

191
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,599
In my opinion,

192
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
in order to curb a flood,

193
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,679
civilians should be moved

194
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,159
far from the waters.

195
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,359
Once the people are away from the flood,

196
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,280
and have settled down,

197
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,880
they'd be grateful towards
Your Majesty's grace.

198
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,599
Move the civilians

199
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
away from the waters?

200
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,080
This is a huge task.

201
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,960
Do you know

202
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,760
how much it is going to cost?

203
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,520
By then,
we wouldn't know how much money

204
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,760
would disappear again.

205
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,159
Your Majesty,

206
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
why did you bring

207
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,440
this up suddenly?

208
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,000
Regarding the case of Baichuankou

209
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,159
and Jingdong and Jingxi Roads,

210
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,599
do you think I know nothing?

211
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,919
Pardon my ignorance.

212
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,080
I don't know

213
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,400
what Your Majesty meant.

214
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,719
You

215
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,719
may mess with me.

216
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,119
He is the Crown Prince.

217
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,679
Are you going to allow him

218
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,799
to mess with the entire nation
in the future?

219
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,760
Your Majesty.

220
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:34,599
Your Majesty.

221
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,919
The Crown Prince and I

222
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,479
have never betrayed you.

223
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,559
Please prove our innocence.

224
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm not in the mood to blame you.

225
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:43,919
Get up.

226
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,039
Crown Prince,

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Hanchen joined the army in his teens.

228
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,760
He suffered hardships

229
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,520
for three years,

230
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,839
and eventually he attained
the victory at Baichuankou.

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,839
The war was quelled.
Peace was returned to the people.

232
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,160
He won the praises
and hearts of the people.

233
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
Look at you.

234
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,160
All you do is remain
taken care of at the palace.

235
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
You've not experienced

236
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,199
any adversity.

237
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
You're given the best tutors
and guidance.

238
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,760
If you continue on with your ignorance,

239
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,359
you should give up your position

240
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,839
as the Crown Prince.

241
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,000
Your Majesty.

242
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,319
All you care about is Zhao Xiaoqian.

243
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,040
You insolent brat!

244
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,479
Your Majesty.

245
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,839
Is this the great son you raised?

246
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,839
I failed to teach him well.

247
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,719
I'm willing to be punished
on Xiaoze's behalf.

248
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,560
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

249
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,920
Xiaoze is still young.

250
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,400
He's young?

251
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,119
He may be young, but he got nerves.

252
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,719
At this young age, he has learned to
create factions for personal gain.

253
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,280
He allowed the corrupted
to eat the nation up.

254
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,000
If he's any older,

255
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,640
my nation

256
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,560
would be destroyed by him!

257
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,040
He's your biological son.

258
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,880
Zhao Xiaoqian has achieved
meritorious deeds,

259
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,800
but what else did he achieve?

260
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,400
In the past, he and Zhao Xiaojie

261
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,199
constantly caused troubles at the palace.

262
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
In terms of obedience,

263
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,640
he cannot be compared
to the Crown Prince.

264
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,400
Enough!

265
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Your Majesty.

266
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,079
Your Majesty.

267
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Your Majesty.

268
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:33,920
Your Majesty.

269
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,160
Your Majesty.

270
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,040
Do not think that

271
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,959
I had no idea how Xiaojie died.

272
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,560
Do not touch me.

273
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,439
Summon the imperial physician.

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,640
Your Majesty.

275
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
Are you all right?

276
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,719
Your Majesty.

277
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,199
Your Majesty.

278
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,680
Father.

279
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:17,920
Your Majesty.

280
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,920
Father.

281
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,160
Father!

282
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,719
Your Majesty.

283
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,439
Do not move!

284
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:33,920
Your Majesty.

285
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,560
Your Highness.

286
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,520
Your Highness.

287
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:41,880
Inform Chancellor Xu.

288
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:43,959
Something happened.

289
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,439
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,959
His Majesty

291
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,560
fell unconscious?

292
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,520
Yes.

293
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,199
According to the imperial physicians,

294
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,199
His Majesty may not wake up soon.

295
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,319
His Majesty is currently
recuperating at the Kunning Palace.

296
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,839
Her Highness is worried that
the state affairs would be disrupted,

297
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,599
so she sent me over

298
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,359
to deliver the message.

299
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,359
What else did Her Highness say?

300
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:30,640
Her Highness said,

301
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,119
His Majesty brought up

302
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,839
Commandery Prince of Julu.

303
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:39,160
If the Crown Prince does not buck up,

304
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,680
his position as the Crown Prince

305
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,160
will be lost to others.

306
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,359
Her Highness is greatly
concerned about the Crown Prince.

307
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,359
She sought for you to
figure something out.

308
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,839
Eliminate Zhao Xiaoqian,

309
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
and the Crown Prince's
position will be secured.

310
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,359
The thorn must be removed.
Disloyal subjects must be executed.

311
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,199
I'm not sure if Her Highness

312
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,719
is bold enough to do so.

313
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:19,839
Chancellor,

314
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,000
please be careful with what you say.

315
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,319
Chancellor.

316
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,719
His Majesty is still alive and well.

317
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,319
If we execute His Majesty's officials,

318
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,719
we might be in trouble in the future.

319
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:29,839
Do you know

320
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,479
what aggravated His Majesty?

321
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,280
Commandery Prince of Julu

322
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,319
is now the Imperial Grand Governor.

323
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,359
What intention is he harboring?

324
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,359
Isn't he coveting the throne?

325
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,199
The throne?

326
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,079
If he's after the throne,

327
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,160
there's no need

328
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
for me to take his life.

329
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,520
Commandery Prince of Julu

330
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,839
is using the authority of
the Imperial Grand Governor

331
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,439
to investigate the accounts of

332
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,800
the Jingdong and Jingxi Roads
and the provisions of Baichuankou.

333
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,040
He's aware of
the Crown Prince's involvement.

334
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
In the past, when the Crown Prince
stirred up trouble,

335
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
His Majesty would play ignorant

336
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,719
and let it slide.

337
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,319
However, right now,

338
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,119
what happens if someone

339
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,719
forces His Majesty to face the problem?

340
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:14,920
Well...

341
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,839
If His Majesty regains consciousness

342
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
and decides to investigate the matter,

343
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,079
how do we save ourselves?

344
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,160
That's why we have
to rely on Her Highness

345
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,560
to resolve the matters of the palace.

346
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
The Emperor will abdicate.

347
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,439
The Crown Prince
ascends the throne.

348
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,119
You and I

349
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,199
shall emerge as the Imperial Regents.

350
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,140
(Studio of Artlessness)

351
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:03,959
What's the matter?

352
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
I brought you chicken soup.

353
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,359
My husband,

354
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
let's play a game.

355
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,199
I have a lot of documents to go through.

356
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,560
Stop playing around.

357
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,079
You shall play the scholar

358
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,719
while I play the fox spirit.

359
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,640
Let's play a love story between
a man and a fox spirit.

360
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:43,959
You perverted scholar.

361
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,199
How dare you?

362
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,520
In the middle of the night,

363
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,800
you intruded the chamber of a woman.

364
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm going to punish you.

365
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,000
Wick taught me all these.

366
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,160
Get back to work.

367
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,040
I'll get going then.

368
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,540
(Studio of Artlessness)

369
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,640
Hanchen.

370
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,959
We've found Li Guangwen.

371
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,359
Li Su has invited him over personally.

372
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,199
He'll arrive at the capital
in two days.

373
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,319
However, Xu Huan is
monitoring him closely.

374
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,719
He's a criminal as well.

375
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,199
He can only sneak into the capital.

376
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,719
All right.

377
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,479
With the evidences against Jingdong
and Jingxi Roads and Baichuankou,

378
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,359
the presence of Li Guangwen

379
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
would greatly benefit us.

380
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:51,760
Don't worry.

381
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
I will receive him personally.

382
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,640
Along with the testimony
of Li Guangwen,

383
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,599
even if His Majesty
refuses to touch Xu Huan,

384
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,119
with the presence of
the evidences and the witness,

385
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,719
there's nothing His Majesty can do.

386
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,800
What's on your face?

387
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,920
How embarrassing.

388
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
How embarrassing.

389
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,479
Something's wrong, Lady Xie.

390
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,640
What do you mean?

391
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,439
According to Shi Deng'er,

392
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,199
the officials love this the most.

393
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Which official is he referring to?

394
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Officials from the brothels.

395
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,640
Look at what you've done.

396
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,119
We have been delivering chicken soup

397
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,680
to His Highness for half a month.

398
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,079
What are we doing exactly?

399
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,359
His Highness must be
attending to something major.

400
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,079
He's treating me this way

401
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,640
because he doesn't want to implicate me.

402
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,160
I'm married to him as his wife.

403
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
I can't allow him to
treat me like a child.

404
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,520
Lady Xie.

405
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,060
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

406
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,400
Zhao Xiaoqian.

407
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,680
Take a bite.

408
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,920
I woke up early in the morning
to make you breakfast.

409
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,479
You wouldn't even take a bite.

410
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,319
I can't maintain my status here

411
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,359
at the mansion.

412
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,560
I didn't marry you

413
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,880
to make you my chef.

414
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm not a chef.

415
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm only cooking for my husband alone.

416
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Aren't you the fox spirit?

417
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:35,920
What did you make?

418
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,760
Human meatballs?

419
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:39,959
How annoying.

420
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,359
All right. I'll take a bite.

421
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Your Highness.

422
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
Mr. Shen is here

423
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,359
for an urgent matter.

424
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,319
It's delicious.

425
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,599
Mr. Liangji.

426
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,760
What's going on?

427
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,760
Nothing.

428
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,800
Have a seat.

429
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,839
Does anyone know

430
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,640
you're here?

431
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,040
No.

432
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,640
Hanchen.

433
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,359
Something happened in the palace.

434
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,160
His Majesty fainted at
the imperial palace yesterday.

435
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,280
This morning,

436
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,839
the eunuch released the Empress' edict.

437
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:44,280
The Crown Prince is appointed
regent with the aid of Chancellor Xu.

438
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,680
The court meeting today was cancelled.

439
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,239
All the four city gates

440
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,599
are locked down under
Chancellor Xu's orders.

441
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,199
In a few days,

442
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,520
the edict of the Crown Prince's
governance will be released.

443
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,680
His Majesty fell unconscious?

444
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:00,959
When did this happen?

445
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,079
Last evening.

446
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,040
Wang Xian came over last night

447
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,239
and informed Chancellor Xu.

448
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,599
Are they already aware

449
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,040
about your investigation?

450
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,479
Yes.

451
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,160
What's wrong?

452
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Internally, they intend to
force the abdication of throne.

453
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,000
Externally, they shall get rid of
the officials disloyal to them.

454
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,079
Abdication of throne?
Execute disloyal officials?

455
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,319
They can't possibly do that.

456
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,040
In three days,

457
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,640
with the excuse of eliminating
the disloyal officials, Chancellor Xu

458
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,599
dispatched the royal army

459
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,160
to be placed at Donghua Date
and Xihua Gate.

460
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Gongchen Gate at the north

461
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,119
and Xuande Gate at the south

462
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,239
are heavily guarded as well.

463
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,160
Once you enter the palace,

464
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,079
you shall be trapped.

465
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,640
His Majesty fell unconscious
all of a sudden.

466
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,839
My father is willing to lend us a hand

467
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,680
under the condition of
protecting himself.

468
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,239
Currently, the most difficult matter is

469
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
Xu Huan has gained control
of the inner court.

470
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,119
Our men

471
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,760
will not be able to enter immediately.

472
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
The only solution to this problem

473
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,599
is to disguise ourselves
as the royal army

474
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,719
on the day of the execution.

475
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,079
Enter the palace from
the furthest entrance, Wende Gate.

476
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,839
However, it will take
at least 15 minutes

477
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,719
to get to Zichen Palace.

478
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,880
What do you plan to do?

479
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,079
I'll destroy everything that comes at me

480
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,800
to attain victory in danger.

481
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,920
Where is Li Guangwen right now?

482
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,239
He will arrive
at the capital tomorrow.

483
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Where's His Majesty?

484
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,920
He's being confined in
the Kunning Palace by Empress Cao.

485
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,599
This is quite the hassle.

486
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Kunning Palace is in the harem.

487
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,079
Regular people are not allowed to enter.

488
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,640
If we fight against
Xu Huan at the main court,

489
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,319
prioritizing you and
then the Emperor's safety,

490
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,040
it will take at least an hour.

491
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,479
Head to Kunning Palace first.

492
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,839
What if you're in danger?

493
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,920
I'll be fine.

494
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,760
Support within the palace

495
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,000
would arrange an audience with
the Emperor with Li Guangwen.

496
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,640
With the presence
of the witness and evidences,

497
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,319
no matter how tyrannous
Xu Huan may be,

498
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,040
he'd still remain cautious.

499
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:48,880
Remember.

500
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,160
If you're in trouble,

501
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,079
our men would tie a yellow scarf
on their left arm.

502
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,760
Soldiers without the scarf

503
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,040
are Chancellor Xu's men.

504
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,640
Respond swiftly.

505
00:29:59,079 --> 00:29:59,880
It's a battle of life and death.

506
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,239
Are you ready?

507
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,280
I fought alongside
with you for three years.

508
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,880
You're still long-winded.

509
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,760
I'll see you off.

510
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,359
Xingzhou.

511
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm taking Xiaoman back to Xie Family.

512
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,239
Head outside the city

513
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,599
and rendezvous with
Li Guangwen tomorrow.

514
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,079
After that,

515
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,719
leave with Su Family and Xie Family.

516
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,959
I've prepared a house for you
outside of the city.

517
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,280
If I do not return after three days,

518
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,839
do no wait for me.

519
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,359
Return to Wujiang Prefecture
immediately.

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,640
Hanchen.

521
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,359
I'm not going anywhere.

522
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,239
This is a military order.

523
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,920
Do you remember what I said to you?

524
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,000
To repay your appreciation for talents,

525
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,239
I'll wave my sword
and fight to death for my country.

526
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,160
Zhong Ziyan

527
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,520
is willing to die for you, general.

528
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,439
Xingzhou.

529
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,479
After receiving Li Guangwen,

530
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,479
I'll enter the palace with Shen Yan.

531
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,359
If you're reluctant,

532
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,760
I have no choice but to
go against your orders.

533
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,599
Zhao Xiaoqian.

534
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,160
Father.

535
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,760
Why are we asked to leave?

536
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,280
I don't want to go.

537
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,880
I'm afraid.

538
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:50,800
Don't worry.

539
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
We're all here.

540
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,520
Your mother and I are here.

541
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't be afraid.

542
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,199
That's right.

543
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,000
Your Highness,

544
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,560
why are you asking us

545
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,959
to leave the city out of the blue?

546
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,079
We did nothing wrong.

547
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,520
Hanchen.

548
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
Share your problems with us.

549
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,479
Do not make us worry.

550
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,359
Members of royalty are
always involved in strife.

551
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,920
We come from a small place.

552
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,520
We do not have relatives around here.

553
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,400
What do we do if something goes wrong?

554
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,040
That's enough.

555
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,439
Have a seat.

556
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,119
Mother.

557
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,239
Have a seat.

558
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,180
(Title deeds)

559
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,520
I've resolved the matter
with Su Tingshan.

560
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,599
Su Chang Ji of Wujiang Prefecture

561
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,160
has returned to its rightful owner.

562
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,359
Mother.

563
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,280
After leaving the city tomorrow,

564
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,599
if I do not show up in three days,

565
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,959
head back to Wujiang Prefecture.

566
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,359
As for the rest,

567
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,439
Bureaucrat Yan will keep you safe.

568
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,000
Hanchen.

569
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,439
Tell me your troubles.

570
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,640
I may not be able to fight in a war,

571
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,959
but I'll be able to stay by your side

572
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,959
through life and death.

573
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,560
Forget it. You're not
capable of fighting battles.

574
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,839
You hold the most important role.

575
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,000
Take care of my family.

576
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

577
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,239
Come with me.

578
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,760
Can you

579
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,319
tell me what you're going through?

580
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,359
Are you mad at me

581
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,959
for keeping it from you?

582
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,599
Although we won the battle
at Baichuankou,

583
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,199
we suffered from heavy casualties,

584
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
and you know that.

585
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,280
The true reason behind this

586
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,079
was the lack of

587
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,199
provisions.

588
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,199
Back at the capital,

589
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,119
Grand Secretariat Qin

590
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,599
has been looking into
this matter for me.

591
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,000
Chancellor Xu is the perpetrator.

592
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,479
He's corrupted to the core.

593
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,119
Not only him,

594
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
even the Crown Prince was involved.

595
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,119
I came back

596
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,119
to overthrow Chancellor Xu

597
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,280
and avenge the brothers
who died at Baichuankou.

598
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,520
Is this the reason why
you're doing all these?

599
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,239
You're afraid that I'd get hurt,

600
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so you're pushing me away.

601
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
What do you take me as

603
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,360
after marrying me?

604
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:26,760
My wife.

605
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,560
You must know,

606
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,360
based on the current situation,

607
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,399
the battle tomorrow will be fierce.

608
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,120
I may not be able to return alive.

609
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,399
I know you're a man of righteousness.

610
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,159
As your wife,

611
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm not leaving tomorrow.

612
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,959
No.

613
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,639
I do not care.

614
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,000
You must leave.

615
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:53,959
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,679
I'm not going anywhere.

617
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,719
You're not going anywhere
tonight either.

618
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,439
At this moment,

619
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:01,840
you shouldn't be thinking
about other things.

620
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,199
I know you want me to
be able to remarry

621
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,360
as a virgin,

622
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,919
but I do not care.

623
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,919
If I were to remarry,

624
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,040
I would reincarnate as
a wooden fish in my next life.

625
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,120
Xiaoman.

626
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,679
Zhao Xiaoqian.

627
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
I'm spending the night
back at the city.

628
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,120
No matter what happens tomorrow,

629
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,520
if I don't return

630
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
at dawn,

631
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:35,879
return to Wujiang Prefecture.

632
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,639
Zhao Xiaoqian.

633
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,000
You're not a man if you do not return!

634
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,679
I'll be gentle.

635
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,479
Lord Li,

636
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,439
once we arrive at the city,

637
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:16,840
I'll place you somewhere safe.

638
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:17,840
I understand.

639
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,280
(Li Guangwen, Li Su's father)
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

640
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,040
Since the Commandery Prince
wants me to testify,

641
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,199
I...

642
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,199
I'll definitely do my best.

643
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,560
Hold it right there!

644
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:29,719
Halt!

645
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,040
Lord Li.

646
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,399
At the junction up ahead,

647
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:35,800
you should get off.

648
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,199
I'll distract them with the carriage.

649
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,239
Remember.

650
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,239
Be very careful.

651
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,800
Look at the time.

652
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Why hasn't His Majesty arrived yet?

653
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,479
The Crown Prince is here.

654
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,159
The imperial edict shall be announced.

655
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,520
I'm gravely ill

656
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,919
and recuperating in the palace.

657
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,639
During this period of time,
the Crown Prince shall act as regent

658
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,760
with the aid of Grand Chancellor Xu.

659
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

660
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,360
Your Highness,

661
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,800
what's the illness His Majesty
is suffering from?

662
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,280
We're all deeply concerned.

663
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,600
Long live the Crown Prince.

664
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:29,040
Long live the Crown Prince.

665
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,879
Long live the Crown Prince.

666
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,520
You may all rise.

667
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

668
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,679
Chancellor Xu,

669
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,040
what do you mean by this?

670
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't be impatient,
Grand Secretariat Qin.

671
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,600
If you'd like to meet His Majesty,

672
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,040
let's talk after dealing with
Commandery Prince of Julu.

673
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,040
You...

674
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Commandery Prince of Julu is here.

675
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,800
In the War of Baichuankou,

676
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,399
I received new information
about the case.

677
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,520
The Commander of Xiongjie Army,
Zhao Xiaoqian,

678
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,080
do you confess your crimes?

679
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,479
Chancellor, that's a severe accusation.

680
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,719
This is quite an exaggeration

681
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,600
just to give a mere commander

682
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,959
like me some trouble.

683
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,639
As a commander,

684
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,800
you colluded with the enemy

685
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
and killed over 10,000 of our soldiers.

686
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,560
Commandery Prince,

687
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,919
do you think who is exaggerating,

688
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,280
you or me?

689
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,560
Your Highness,

690
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,000
I have an appeal.

691
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,560
Go ahead, Chancellor Xu.

692
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,159
Zhao Xiaoqian colluded with the enemy,

693
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,600
disrupted the imperial court,

694
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
and harbored vile intentions.

695
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
He intended to seize
the position of the Crown Prince.

696
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,439
I

697
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,919
deployed soldiers to protect
the Crown Prince overnight.

698
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,560
However, this is only
a temporary measure.

699
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,159
In order to secure peace
within the palace,

700
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,639
this traitor, Zhao Xiaoqian,

701
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,080
cannot be spared.

702
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,280
I beg for Your Highness
to execute this traitor.

703
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,800
Please execute this traitor,
Your Highness!

704
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,399
Chancellor Xu, you...

705
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:45,439
Please execute this traitor,
Your Highness!

706
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,080
Please execute this traitor,
Your Highness!

707
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,159
Please execute this traitor,
Your Highness!

708
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,679
I'm no longer vigorous.

709
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,600
By respects to the forefathers,

710
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,719
by honour to the deities,

711
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,719
peace ruled the state.

712
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,719
I've governed the state for years.

713
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
The Empress is greatly concerned.

714
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,080
I fell ill due to
the overwhelming state affairs.

715
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,280
The Crown Prince, Xiaoze,

716
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,080
is brilliant and intelligent.

717
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,000
His proficiency in
matters of the state

718
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,000
is known to all.

719
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,439
I can leave the state to him

720
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,280
to place the people and
the ministers of court at ease.

721
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,260
(Edict)

722
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,280
You're forcing me to
abdicate the throne.

723
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,479
My Empress,

724
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,439
you surely

725
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,280
gave me a great gift.

726
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,399
Your Majesty, you're not feeling well.

727
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,439
State affairs are never ending.

728
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:34,520
In order to protect the nation,

729
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,800
I made the decision on
Your Majesty's behalf

730
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,399
to abdicate the throne
to the Crown Prince.

731
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,560
I beg for Your Majesty's approval.

732
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,840
What if

733
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,439
I refuse?

734
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,199
Your Majesty, if you refuse,

735
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,840
I

736
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,159
will give you a hand.
