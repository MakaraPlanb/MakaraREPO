<i>Time Flies and You Are Here</i>

<i>Episode 25</i>

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
<i>Life is like a dream and
another autumn has passed</i>

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,040
My Lord.

23
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,559
The agreement

24
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,760
was indeed written by Su Feiyun himself.

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,800
See for yourselves.

26
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>Agreement of property distribution</i>

27
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,480
This is impossible.

28
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,279
This is impossible.

29
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,400
Su Huazhong,

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,919
do you concur that this was
your father's penmanship?

31
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:17,679
Yes.

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,199
Yes.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,559
Lord Yan.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
This matter is strange.

35
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,479
If the agreement was real,

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,720
why didn't Su Tingshan

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
submit the document along
with the appeal beforehand,

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,559
but presenting it

39
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,559
when things aren't looking up for him?

40
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,399
Something is wrong

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
with it.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,039
Your Highness, you're neither
the defendant

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,639
nor a witness.

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,880
Your presence in the court
is an exception.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,440
However, you disturbed the court order.

46
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:57,119
I have no choice but to
cast you out of the court.

47
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:57,960
Guards.

48
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:58,759
Yes.

49
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:00,880
But...

50
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,080
Escort His Highness out of the court.

51
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,479
Your Highness,

52
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,000
this way, please.

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,279
Lord Yan,

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,080
what do you mean by this?

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,320
Escort His Highness back to his mansion.

56
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,720
Do not touch me!

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,399
Move it.

58
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:11,960
Yan Nengfu,

59
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,119
what do you think you're doing?

60
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's go.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Do you know who I am?

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,759
Hanchen,

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,919
you're injured.

64
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,240
Let's go.

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,440
- Yan Nengfu!
- Do not overexert yourself!

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
You're foolish!

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,440
Be careful!

68
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,839
- Be careful!
- You're foolish!

69
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:22,720
Hanchen, be careful.

70
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,839
Wait.

71
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:24,360
You can't do this.

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,880
Be careful!

73
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,479
- Hanchen!
- Be careful!

74
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,639
What do we do?

75
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
What do we do?

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,039
Lord Yan,

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,639
my mother delivered a message.

78
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,279
The document Su Tingshan presented

79
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,639
does not consist of a seal or signature.

80
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,839
It was just a draft.

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,119
It's not an authentic agreement
of property distribution.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,759
It cannot be considered
an official document.

83
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,679
It was the wastepaper
in my father's study

85
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,039
stolen by this thief, Su Tingshan.

86
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,600
These are my mother's words.

87
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,479
The attendant may testify.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,399
Yes, I can testify.

89
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,880
You may send the guards
to the Residence of the Su Family

90
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,919
to ask Old Madam Su directly.

91
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, Lord Yan.

92
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,360
The plaintiff, Su Tingshan,
submitted the forged evidence.

93
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,399
It's a blatant scheme.

94
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
The conclusion of this case
is very clear.

95
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,160
Why aren't you making the judgment?

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,760
That's right!

97
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,399
How absurd!

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
You have no rights to speak here!

99
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,040
Old Madam Su.

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,380
<i>My daughter and granddaughter shall
inherit my stores and possession</i>

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Momo.

102
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,320
Are Huazhong

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,519
and Minggu's winter clothes

104
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,519
ready?

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,119
Old Madam Su,

106
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,799
don't worry.

107
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,959
They are all ready.

108
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,839
Old Madam Su.

109
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,119
Old Madam Su.

110
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,959
Old Madam Su!

111
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,839
Old Madam Su!

112
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,760
Old Madam Su!

113
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,959
Old Madam Su!

114
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,279
Old Madam Su!

115
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,279
Old Madam Su!

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,760
Madam Su!

117
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:27,959
Madam Su!

118
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Madam Su!

119
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,799
Madam Su.

120
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,799
Old Madam Su...

121
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,940
Old Madam Su passed away.

122
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,839
What?

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,679
- Dear.
- What?

124
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,679
What happened to Old Madam Su?

125
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,040
Mother!

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,679
What happened to Old Madam Su?

127
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,239
Mother!

128
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,640
Yan Nengfu!

129
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,160
Why are you doing this?

130
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,959
Ground him in the mansion!

131
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,839
How dare you bend the truth.

132
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,480
Mother!

133
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,720
Let me go!

134
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,640
Yan Nengfu!

135
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,959
Let's go.

136
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,519
Mr. Yan.

137
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:51,959
Yan Nengfu!

138
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,760
What happened to Old Madam Su?

139
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,920
Dear.

140
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Declare the verdict.

141
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
In regards to the dispute over

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,440
the ownership of Su Chang Ji
in Wujiang Prefecture,

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,359
the court has inspected
all the evidence presented.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,799
All the seven stores
in Wujiang Prefecture

145
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,559
will be returned to Su Tingshan.

146
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
Su Huazhong and her families

147
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,720
have ten days to cede
the properties over to Su Tingshan.

148
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,600
They are to submit the tribute received
from the last three years.

149
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,559
If further troubles are caused,

150
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,279
stricter punishments will be enforced.

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
The case is closed.

152
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,079
Court is adjourned.

153
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,959
Lord.

154
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
Such brilliance, Lord Yan.

155
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,679
Lord, that's unfair!

156
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,359
Lord, such injustice!

157
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,320
Lord!

158
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,799
Sister-in-law.

159
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,679
Lord!

160
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,679
That's unjust!

161
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,119
Sister-in-law.

162
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,040
- Lord!
- We're wronged!

163
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Sister-in-law.

164
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,839
Su Tingshan,

165
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,600
you thief!

166
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,880
You're despicable!

167
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,040
The law is fair and just.

168
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,959
Even the relative of royalty

169
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
submits before the law,

170
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,079
not to mention commoners like us.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Get out of my way!

172
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,119
Su Tingshan.

173
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:08,720
Calm down.

174
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
The relative of royalty?

175
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Mother.

176
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:11,799
Sister-in-law.

177
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,079
Sister-in-law.

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,040
Sister-in-law, calm down.

179
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,679
Xiaoman!

180
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,119
Xiaoman!

181
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,399
Amitabha.

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,799
May Buddha bless

183
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,000
the peace of Prince Pu's Mansion.

184
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
May the household be blessed

185
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,920
with wealth and power.

186
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,640
Princess Consort Pu.

187
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,320
We shall be feared by all.

188
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,119
I need to see you.

189
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,440
Send her in.

190
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,840
Do you know

191
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,679
it's a sin to lie before Buddha.

192
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,239
So?

193
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,919
Regarding the case of Su Family,

194
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,400
did you bribe the magistrate?

195
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,119
There's no need for me to

196
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
bribe a mere local officer.

197
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm asking if you were the perpetrator.

198
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,119
Yes.

199
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,320
You vile wench!

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,159
Let go of me!

201
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,039
In regards to the case of Su Family,

202
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,520
I barely put efforts.

203
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,280
All I did was to give it a little push.

204
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
You clearly had a defect

205
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
that others can use against.

206
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,280
Just like Zhong Ziyan.

207
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,599
Xingzhou's incident was
caused by you, too?

208
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,919
What are you trying to do?

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,440
More than that.

210
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,080
Brother?

211
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,880
What did you do to my brother?

212
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,080
Nothing has happened yet.

213
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
He's currently imprisoned

214
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,840
and being fed with prison meals.

215
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,119
If you insist to

216
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,320
marry Hanchen,

217
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,119
I can't promise

218
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,440
his safety.

219
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,119
You're aware of

220
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:22,960
how huge the capital is.

221
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,599
Terrible things happen at any time.

222
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,119
Besides, many more people

223
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,919
will experience these bad things.

224
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:32,559
This is all because of you, Xie Xiaoman.

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,119
You're the catastrophe

226
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,440
to the people around you.

227
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,799
What do you want from me?

228
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,679
Let her go.

229
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,119
I'll give you one last chance.

230
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,640
Leave him. What do you say?

231
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,119
What a relative of royalty.

232
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
What a benevolent woman.

233
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,359
How disgusting!

234
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
Stop putting up an act

235
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,239
by being a vegetarian and praying!

236
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,359
The deities you're praying to

237
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,719
are looking over you!

238
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,119
You'll receive divine retribution!

239
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,119
Deities exist.

240
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,840
When you're thrown
into the pits of hell

241
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,440
and suffer the torments of hell,

242
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,799
know that you deserve it all!

243
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,239
Your Highness.

244
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,039
Lady Xie.

245
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,599
You're home.

246
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,479
I wasn't able to pick you up
from the court just now.

247
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,239
His Highness...

248
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,239
Tell Zhao Xiaoqian

249
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,359
to meet me by Xushui River
at this hour tomorrow.

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
I need to talk to him.

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,840
Your Highness!

252
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,679
Your Highness!

253
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,760
Your Highness!

254
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:09,880
Lady Xie...

255
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,119
What's the matter?

256
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:11,799
Lady Xie...

257
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,840
Spit it out!

258
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,840
Su Family lost the court case.

259
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,640
Lady Xie returned

260
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,880
and went to meet
Her Highness at the chamber.

261
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,840
After that...

262
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,719
After that, she left.

263
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,239
She left a message,

264
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,799
asking you to meet her

265
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,359
by Xushui River tomorrow.

266
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,919
I'm not sure what's going on.

267
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,119
Your Highness.

268
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,960
Your Highness.

269
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,840
Her Highness

270
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,599
refuses to see anyone at the moment.

271
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,119
Get out of my way.

272
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,119
Your Highness!

273
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,679
Your Highness!

274
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,960
What did you say to Xie Xiaoman?

275
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,239
I only asked about
the case of Su Family.

276
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,440
You were the perpetrator, weren't you?

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
An honest and upright
official like Yan Nengfu

278
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,119
was tainted by you.

279
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,479
Why did you do such a thing?

280
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,359
Why are you forcing
Xie Xiaoman out of here?

281
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
Are you doing this to force me
back to the capital?

282
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,599
I'm doing this for your own good.

283
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,119
I want you to lead a good life.

284
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
Have you ever thought about it?

285
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,919
For the past year,

286
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,640
nothing good happened to you.

287
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,440
You were demoted as the Duke
all of a sudden

288
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,239
and grounded within Wujiang Prefecture.

289
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,640
What's next?

290
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,159
Your life could be in danger.

291
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,760
How did you know

292
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,919
what's important to me

293
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,960
and what's not?

294
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,280
You took away everything

295
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,559
that matters to me.

296
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
If I've decided not to live,

297
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,200
don't even think of
surviving on your own either.

298
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,000
You want

299
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,119
me dead?

300
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,159
You can't

301
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,919
possibly go against the palace.

302
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,359
Don't you know

303
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,799
how your brother died?

304
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,719
How did my brother die?

305
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,960
What happened in the palace?

306
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,200
Make yourself clear!

307
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,679
Amitabha.

308
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
Amitabha.

309
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,159
Why?

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,719
Why?

311
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Grandmother!

312
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,520
Grandmother!

313
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,679
Grandmother!

314
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,719
Stop it, child.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,520
Open up!

316
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,080
Boyang!

317
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,039
Let me out!

318
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,919
Stop it.

319
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,559
Open up!

320
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,200
Boyang.

321
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
Stop it, Boyang.

322
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,320
- Father!
- Boyang,

323
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
don't blame your father.

324
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,039
Your father didn't have a choice.

325
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,960
Let me out of here!

326
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,960
- Open up!
- Listen to me.

327
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,719
Open up!

328
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't blame your father.

329
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,359
Why?

330
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,559
We're just a chess piece to others.

331
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,679
Don't blame your father, all right?

332
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,400
Boyang.

333
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:16,799
Boyang.

334
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,080
Boyang.

335
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,599
Why?

336
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,220
<i>Da'e Noodles</i>

337
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,520
Xiaoman.

338
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,919
What happened to the case of Su Family?

339
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,840
Why did everyone say...

340
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
If I could watch the snow with you,

341
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,919
it'd be great.

342
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:47,880
Xiaoman.

343
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,159
What are you saying?

344
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,119
What's going on?

345
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,400
Did my mother

346
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,799
say something to you yesterday?

347
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,239
Did you know that

348
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,840
they all said

349
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,760
it's not going to snow here
in Wujiang Prefecture this year.

350
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,719
The snow in Wujiang Prefecture
is a rare sight.

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,040
I was just thinking.

352
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
If I could watch the snow with you

353
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,760
by the warm fire

354
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
while drinking warm wine,

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
how great it'd be?

356
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,839
Xiaoman.

357
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,160
Zhao Xiaoqian.

358
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,439
Your mother wants me to leave you.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I agreed.

360
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,640
We shouldn't get married.

361
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,239
Let's stop meeting
each other, all right?

362
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:50,599
No.

363
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,319
I can't agree to this.

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
What happened?

365
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,920
What did

366
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,199
my mother say to you yesterday?

367
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:01,959
Don't worry.

368
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,079
With me here,

369
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,959
everything will be...

370
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,040
Hanchen.

371
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,479
But, we lost the court case.

372
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,959
But, Old Madam Su passed away.

373
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,319
But, my brother

374
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,439
is about to be imprisoned.

375
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,239
Do you understand?

376
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,040
Our marriage

377
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,959
isn't just about us.

378
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
It will implicate others as well.

379
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,359
Previously,

380
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,599
I really wanted to marry you.

381
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,560
I used to think

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,560
the problems between us

383
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,920
were due to the fact

384
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,599
we weren't a true couple.

385
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
However, I've come to realize now.

386
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,239
It's not

387
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,880
because we aren't truly married,

388
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,920
it's because

389
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,239
we can never

390
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,520
be together.

391
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,119
Hanchen.

392
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,239
I'm sorry.

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
I disagree!

395
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,400
I said I disagree!

396
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,040
I'll resolve everything,

397
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,560
except for this!

398
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,359
I disagree!

399

You can't agree to this either.

<i>A day later</i>
<i>Bailu Academy</i>

401
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:46,560
Bailu Academy has been educating
students for a few decades.

402
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
We have been
honest and honourable.

403
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,319
We instilled knowledge and
morality into the students of Wujiang.

404
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,640
Our contribution may not be huge,

405
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,400
but our efforts are honourable.

406
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,560
All of you educated under my care

407
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,599
and taught the ways
of the righteousness.

408
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,920
Our consciences are clear before
the heaven and the people.

409
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,160
However, I'm incompetent.

410
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,640
I failed to protect the academy
for all of you.

411
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,479
Bailu Academy

412
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,839
is shutting down.

413
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,839
Fellow teachers,

414
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,560
why are you all so disheartened?

415
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
We worked very hard.

416
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,400
We can now take a break.

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,839
We may quit as teachers

418
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,839
and live like wandering intellectuals.

419
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,800
Cheer up.

420
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,599
Cheer up.

421
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,599
Principal.

422
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
It's due to the change of circumstances.

423
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
Nobody is to blame.

424
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
Do not blame yourself.

425
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,520
That's right.

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,239
With reunion, comes separation.

427
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,400
Everything comes and goes.

428
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,800
If we're able to reunite
in the days to come,

429
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
I, Gao,

430
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,359
will serve as a teacher
at your new academy.

431
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,599
Thank you for the favour.

432
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,760
Fellow teachers,
after leaving the academy,

433
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,359
do not forget to uphold education

434
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,239
and answer the questions
and wonders of people.

435
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,000
Teach, nurture,

436
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,560
and develop civilization.

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Of course.

438
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,040
My cousin brother

439
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,640
coaches the kids in the capital cuju.

440
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,760
I'll head to him

441
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,040
and nurture

442
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,800
young talents of archery and riding.

443
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,319
I, Gao,

444
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,680
shall return to my hometown.

445
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,800
I'll teach the illiterate
and cheeky kids

446
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,040
to write and read.

447
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,239
Teacher Liu.

448
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
What are your plans?

449
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,359
I will head to the capital

450
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,520
to establish an academy for ladies.

451
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,599
I intend to pass down the knowledge
and etiquette to ladies of the world.

452
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,119
That's commendable.

453
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,640
Teacher Liu has always been far-sighted.

454
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,680
You always contribute to the ladies.

455
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,479
You deserve our admiration.

456
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:20,920
What about Congwen?

457
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,239
What are your plans?

458
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,359
I just returned from the capital.

459
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,400
I have been around.

460
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm planning to travel down
south to further my studies.

461
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,160
All good things come to an end.

462
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I shall replace tea with wine
as a toast to all of you.

463
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,079
Principal.

464
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,599
The official documents
are not released yet.

465
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,760
The students still have
one more test to go.

466
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,719
I wonder if we could postpone
the closing of the academy.

467
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:07,599
At this point,

468
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm afraid the magistrate
will not allow this.

469
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,400
Your Highness,

470
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,199
I found the person that
you were looking for.

471
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,359
He's currently in the barrack
of General Xu at Tengzhou.

472
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:37,319
But, General Xu is leaving soon.

473
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
You're looking for Fuweng?

474
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,439
Why?

475
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,479
A few days ago,

476
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,280
I learned that there was a conspiracy

477
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,119
about my brother's death
from my mother.

478
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,680
Could the death of
Duke of Yongguo be related to...

479
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,119
Yes.

480
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,160
The Empress.

481
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,479
I've resided in Wujiang Prefecture
for many years.

482
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,839
I stay away from the matters
of the imperial palace,

483
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,359
but they refuse to let me go.

484
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,160
Everything that has happened

485
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
wasn't coincidental.

486
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,119
What do you plan to do?

487
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,599
I'm meeting Fuweng.

488
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,119
I shall investigate the true cause
to my brother's death.

489
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Perhaps, I may be able to resolve

490
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
the dilemma of Xiaoman.

491
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,640
By the way,

492
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,319
are you aware that Bailu Academy

493
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,280
is shutting down?

494
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,319
Grand Secretariat Qin and
Chancellor Xu are in dispute.

495
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,119
Chancellor Xu

496
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,880
made Li Guangwen the scapegoat.

497
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,199
The one who has been
funding Bailu Academy

498
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
in secret was Li Guangwen.

499
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,479
After investigation,

500
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,599
Bailu Academy will be shut down.

501
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,239
Master,

502
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,000
let's go home.

503
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:17,839
Master.

504
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,000
You've been standing out here
the whole night.

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,439
Look...

506
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,079
Master.

507
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,860
<i>Funeral</i>

508
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,040

shall heed my last words
for the generations to come.

510
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,880
Do not allow your ambitions
to be swayed by poverty.

511
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,239
Do not allow anger to
disturb you.

512
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,239
The revival of the household

513
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,040
shall be within reach.

514
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,599
Mother!

515
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,199

What's the problem?

519
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,800
The verdict was altered.

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,439
In Tongzhou and Wujiang Prefecture,

521
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,760
Su Family's businesses,

522
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,400

This is too much!

529
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,359
I'm going to confront him right now!

530

- Minggu.
- Minggu.

531
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,479
Luckily I still own
a couple of stores in the capital.

532
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,079
Don't we even have the rights
to seek justice?

533
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,479
I refuse to believe this!

534
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,599
- I refuse to believe this!
- Hold it right there!

But, mother,

542
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,680
- We...
- Stop it.

543
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,119
Our family is safe and sound.

544
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,160
It's better than anything else.

545
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,160
From today onwards,

546
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,239
focus on the funeral and rites.

547
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640

How are you recently?

551
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,439
I'm leaving for a few days.

552

553
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,079
please take care of yourself.

554
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,280
It's getting colder. Put on more layers.

555
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,800
The academy is in trouble.

556
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:06,839
In a few days,

557
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,520
the magistrate might approach you.

558

When I'm not around,

559
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,839
don't oppose them directly.

Don't worry.

561
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,880
I'll resolve everything

The painful farewell at Nanpu.

565
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,959
The autumn wind blows,
amplifying the sorrow of separation.

566
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,079
Once you say goodbye,

567
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,640
do not turn back anymore.

568
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,560
This is the last poem of the day.

569
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
It's also my last class

570
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,560
for all of you.

571
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
What does teacher mean?

572
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
The academy is in a predicament

573
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,040
and it's shutting down.

574
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,520
From now on,

575
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,919
I'll no longer be your teacher.

576
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,520
Why is it shutting down?

577
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,919
What's the matter?

578
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,919
You may have heard the rumors.

579
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,919
Due to certain issues, the academy

580
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,000
was implicated.

581
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,320
The magistrate has orders

582
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,600
to confiscate and
shut Bailu Academy down.

583
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,239
The academy is forbidden
from teaching anymore.

584
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
How could this be?

585
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,800
Do not turn back.

586
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,600
Separation and union

587
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,560
are parts of the journey.

588
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
Although you're ladies,

589
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,600
you're literate and knowledgeable.

590
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,600
I hope you will all
keep up the good work

591
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,120
and seek improvement diligently

592
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,040
to obtain a bright future of your own.

593
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,600
However,

594
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,639
you said,

595
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
before Chinese New Year's Eve,

596
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,080
there will be an examination
for Jingnv Pavilion.

597
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,679
I spent the whole year preparing

598
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,199
in order to score good grades
and make my mother proud.

599
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,479
How could the academy
shut down just like that?

600
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,080
I do not believe this.
I will not allow this!

601
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,120
That's right.

602
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,439
We have yet to take our exams.

603
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,159
Yes.

604
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,800
We haven't taken our exams.

605
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,639
Teacher Liu.

606
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,639
Let us take the exams.

607
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,560
Please make a request.

608
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,639
It will work.

609
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,159
That's right.

610
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,760
Please do your best.

611
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,919
It should work.

612
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,360
One winter passed,

613
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,879
and everything changed.

614
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,520
Grandmother...

615
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,600
Grandmother passed away as well.

616
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:38,719
Did you know?

617
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,879
I never liked taking exams.

618
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,239
However,
it's different this time.

619
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,560
I really want to score well

620
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,239
and show grandmother

621
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,479
so she could be at ease.

622
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I can't believe

623
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,639
we are no longer allowed
to undertake the examinations.

624
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:57,760
Minggu.

625
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,439
Minggu.

626
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,879
Minggu.

627
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
I need to talk to you.

628
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,159
Do not call me Minggu.

629
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,639
I have nothing to say to you.

630
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,239
At this point,

631
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,719
everything you say is meaningless.

632
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,000
I know it's too late to explain myself,

633
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,120
but can you stop ignoring me?

634
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:18,760
Tell me.

635
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,080
What can I do to atone for it?

636
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,239
- I...
- Atone?

637
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,159
What are you going to do?

638
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:27,399
Can you resurrect my grandmother?

639
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:28,760
Can you?

640
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,159
I...

641
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:31,879
Help!

642
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,399
The authority is
shutting the academy down!

643
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,639

644
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,760

What are you doing?

647
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,520
Move out of the way!

648
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,120
<i>Bailu Academy</i>
What are you doing?

649
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,679
You can't close the academy down.

650
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,159

Hurry and get out of the way.

653
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,919
The academy is closed down.

654
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,719
Pack up and leave!

You have no rights!

The academy

665
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,159
is currently under the magistrate
of Wujiang Prefecture.

666
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:55,760
No.

667

Classes have yet to end.

668
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,639
The principal hasn't said a word.

669
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,879
You're not allowed
to shut the academy down.

670
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,919

Listen to me.

674
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,760
The academy is under the authority.

675
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,040
Are you expecting us to believe that?

00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,639

That's right!

You can't close the academy
without the document!

679
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,399
Present the document!

680
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,439
How absurd!

681
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,639
Is this

682
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,959
that education you received?

683
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,639
I'm telling you.

00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,000
How dare you disobey?

685
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,879
I'll arrest you all!

686
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,560

Come on! I dare you!

692
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,879

00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,120
Mr. Yan,

698
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,479
you're overstepping your bounds.

699
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,919
I have more to show.

700
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,000
Give it another try.

701
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,439
You're all rebelling.

702
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,679
Arrest them all!

703
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:38,560
Arrest them all!

704
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,239
All right!

705
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,159
Arrest me first.

706
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,760
I was about to check with my father.

707
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,120
Why are you shutting
the academy down before

708
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
the official document is here?

709
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,159

- Where is the document?

710
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,479

716
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,239
Fine.

00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,479
Are you planning to

00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,239
cut ties with Yan Boyang completely?

738
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,760
I know it isn't Yan Boyang's fault.

739
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,560
However, under such circumstances,

740
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
I cannot allow my mother

741
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,919
to handle Su Chang Ji alone.

742
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,199

Since the beginning, Su Chang Ji

started off with minor businesses

755
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,639

the current reputable textile store.

757
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Our reputation was
widespread through the state.

758
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,760
We were once at the pinnacle of glory.

759
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,639
Everything was built and accumulated
from scratch with the effort

760
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,520
of my parents.

761
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,239
However, I, Su Huazhong failed
to protect the family business.

762
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,760
I fell into a trap

763
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,760
of the malicious thugs.

764
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,439
Here are my savings.

765
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,159
Distribute them among yourselves

766
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,639
and go on your way.

767
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:00,639
Madam Su.

768
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's been many years.

769
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,520
You took great care of us.

770
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,399
You don't owe us anything.

771
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,199
It's the other way round.

772
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,479
Madam Su.

773
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,439
What do you plan to do next?

774
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,239
If you're venturing into a new business,

775
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,520
we're not leaving.

776
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
We will strive alongside you.

777
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,760
That's right.

778
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,199
Right now,

779
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,360
there are many matters to attend to.

780
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
As for the rest,

781
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,080
I haven't figured out yet.

782
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,639
We still possess
two new stores in the capital.

783
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,679
Mother,

784
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,919
let's start over in the capital.

785
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,439
Minggu,

786
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,360
do not interrupt when
the adults are talking.

787
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,199
Mother,

788
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm not a child anymore.

789
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,360
Everyone calls me
the successor of the business.

790
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,239
Today,

791
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm going to perform my duty
as the successor.

792
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,040
Mother, you know
the textile industry best.

793
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,239
You could tell
the quality of any textile

794
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,239
by one touch.

795
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
With this skill,

796
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:04,560
you don't have to worry

797
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,439
about reopening
Su Chang Ji in the capital.

798
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,760
Father is meticulous with the accounts.

799
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,159
He may help with the account.

800
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,479
I'll learn the operation of a store

801
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,360
and help manage the business.

802
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,639
I believe that

803
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,239
the capital is a huge place,

804
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,239
there will be a spot for us.
