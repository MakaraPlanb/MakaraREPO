<i>Episode 27</i>

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
We're to be loyal
to the Emperor and the Imperial Court

22
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,599
Hurry up.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,519
Paste it properly.

24
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,120
That's right.

25
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,279
His Highness is back.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,879
Your Highness.

27
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,319
Your Highness.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
What happened again?

29
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,039
Your Highness,

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,639
today is the Chinese New Year's Eve.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,600
We have no idea where
His Highness went

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
and he has yet returned.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,399
I'm afraid...

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,919
At this point,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,440
if he's still so obstinate,

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,039
he'll end up with nothing.

37
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,839
Your Highness, haven't you taken enough

38
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,039
from me?

39
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,919
Princess Consort Pu who
has a noble status

40
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,080
enjoys glory and riches,

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
and is admired by the people.

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
However, perhaps no one knows

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,800
all of this was exchanged

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
with others' lives.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Your Highness,

46
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,800
today's the Chinese New Year's Eve.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Her Highness

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
has been waiting for you
for the reunion dinner.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,679
Scram.

50
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,520
It isn't your place to speak.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Leave.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,639
Leave, all of you.

53
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,039
Without my order,

54
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,240
no one is allowed to enter.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,520
It's the Chinese New Year

56
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,440
and you lost your temper
in my room for no reason.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
That's the manner
in Duke of Wuguo's Mansion?

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
No reason?

59
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,479
Mother, you even have the guts

60
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,960
to say I lost my temper for no reason.

61
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,919
You must've done too many bad things.

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,199
As a result, you lost
a sense of judgment.

63
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,919
What nonsense are you talking about?

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,759
Am I wrong?

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,199
Look carefully

66
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,759
at the grandeur of this mansion

67
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,479
as well as your clothing and jewelry.

68
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,639
Just name one

69
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,320
that wasn't exchanged with
my brother's life?

70
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,880
Sacrificing your own son's life

71
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,399
to retain your own honour,

72
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
our family

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,199
indeed has a tender mother
and filial sons.

74
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,119
We're upright in conduct.

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,960
It's really enviable.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Outrageous!

77
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,839
What are you saying?

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't know what you are talking about.

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
I've found Fuweng

80
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,119
and found out
the truth of my brother's death.

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,279
Do you think I don't know anything?

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
Do you think that I'm still a child?

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,799
I know

84
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
you've always felt resentful

85
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,239
towards your father and me

86
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,440
for sending you to the imperial palace.

87
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,640
Do you think I wanted that?

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,079
Do you think I wasn't feeling sad?

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,959
I remember you won't let go of me

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
and pleaded with me while crying.

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,320
I was heartbroken, too.

92
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,000
I pleaded with His Majesty

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,839
and the Empress,

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,559
but all was in vain.

95
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,079
What else can I do?

96
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,279
That's the imperial palace

97
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,320
and the Emperor of a nation.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,079
Can I go against them

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
or fight with them?

100
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,359
I

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,359
could only resign to fate.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,239
What's to blame is,

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
as mother and son, you and I

104
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,600
are destined to be separated.

105
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
Yes.

106
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,559
We aren't destined to be mother and son.

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
So, having killed one of your sons,

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,760
are you going to kill the other now?

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,399
I'm still your mother no matter what.

110
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,119
I told you to return to the capital

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,679
in order to save your life.

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,640
I've decided to go to the battlefront

113
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,279
and go to Baichuankou with General Xu.

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
What?

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,679
Zhao Xiaoqian,

116
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,679
I gave birth to you and raised you

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
so you could leave my side again?

118
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,839
Why?

119
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,480
Why are you risking

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,399
the future of the entire
Prince Pu's Mansion?

121
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,799
When my brother was killed back then,

122
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,399
you were also this cold-blooded.

123
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,160
You always put your own benefits first.

124
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,679
You've never thought about my feelings.

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,480
Do you know what
returning to the capital

126
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
means to me?

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,760
Hanchen.

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,839
Making myself the opponent's prey!

129
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,320
Do you know

130
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,040
what going to the battlefront means?

131
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,959
I don't care!

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
At least I'll survive

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,359
and stop being manipulated by others.

134
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,839
It's my final chance.

135
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,399
I've already decided.

136
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,119
Even if I die,

137
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,399
it'll be at Baichuankou.

138
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:12,720
Your Highness,

139
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,839
you're finally back.

140
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,079
How long have you been

141
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,760
my mother's spy in this mansion?

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,720
Your Highness,

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,679
I've followed you for so long.

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,320
You...

145
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,679
You've wronged me.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Sell her off to the southern region!

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,839
Your Highness.

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,559
Your Highness.

149
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
Don't ever let me see you again.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,640
Princess Consort.

151
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,839
Your Highness, save me!

152
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,440
Zhu Momo!

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Zhu Momo, save me!

was telling us to have a baby.

Old Madam didn't say that.

we'll depart.

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,559
Sure.

190
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,919
Everyone says the new year
is a challenge.

191
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,559
But the way I see it,

192
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,919
what's even more challenging

193
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,039
are the weals and woes
in the coming year.

194
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,599
Woes or not,

195
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,960
we've gone through it all.

196
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,280
No matter what,

197
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,200
our family is well.

198
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,840
No matter how tricky it is,

199
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,280
it's good that all of us are around.

200
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,119
That's right.

201
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,320
Whatever challenge there was,

202
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,479
we've gone through each of them.

203
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,359
It's the Chinese New Year.

204
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,359
Let's not talk about the sad past.

205
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,200
From now on,

206
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,039
we'll surely become better and better.

207
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,119
Our family

208
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
will gain harmony

209
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,640
and prosper in all endeavours.

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,239
We'll prosper.

211
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,080
- That's right.
- We'll prosper.

212
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,119
If the family lives in harmony,
all affairs will prosper.

213
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
If the family lives in harmony,
all affairs will prosper.

214
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,239
That's right.

215
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,479
Rise joint by joint
like "chicken flowers".

216
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,799
It's rise joint by joint
like sesame flowers.

217
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,119
You only know how to eat chicken.

218
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,479
Come on. Come on.

219
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,239
Lady.

220
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,119
Come on.

221
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,000
- Come on.
- Bottoms up.

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,559
Lady Xie,

223
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,200
the concierge outside passed this,

224
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
saying it's for you.

225
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,300
To Xiaoman

226
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,440
Who left the letter?

227
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,359
I don't know,

228
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,799
but I recognize this pot of soil.

229
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,119
It's the pot His Highness
used to pray for a child

230
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,479
on the Lotus Garden's platform.

231
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,140
Residence of the Su Family

232
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,119
I'm back.

233
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,239
Xiaoman.

234
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,000
It has been a while.

235
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,559
It has been a while.

236
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,700
Residence of the Su Family

237
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,760
I came this time

238
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,640
to bid you farewell.

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,760
That's all you came here to tell me?

240
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,320
Yes.

241
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,559
I'm afraid this time,

242
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm really going to the battlefield.

243
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,200
Serving the nation

244
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,799
is quite good.

245
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,080
What about you?

246
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,359
Me?

247
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm going to the capital

248
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,119
after the Chinese New Year.

249
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,320
My aunt opened up a new shop there.

250
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,599
Teacher Liu is also setting up
an academy there.

251
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,359
I'm going to teach there.

252
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm going to be a teacher.

253
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,679
Great.

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,400
That's what I like about you.

Your Highness needed a learning partner

In the future, when you draft

Seize every opportunity.

325
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,599
you'll always be

326
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,000
the most talented scholar to her.

327
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,479
She hopes that

328
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,520
you'll continue to write books.

375
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,319
I need to enrol.

376
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,560
Minggu,

377
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,119
we'll be at the same place again.

378
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,079
It's great.

379
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,199
The journey there is not easy

380
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,119
and we'll be miles away from home.

381
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,319
Have you really thought it over

382
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,479
to go with us?

383
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,400
Of course.

384
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,079
I'm a grown-up now.

385
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,280
Since you're going,

386
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,160
you need to score well in
the imperial examination

387
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,319
and bring glory to the family.

388
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,079
If you're still fooling around

389
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,040
when you're there,

390
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,520
I won't talk to you.

391
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,079
Rest assured.

392
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll definitely

393
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,599
become more mature bit by bit.

394
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,839
I'll be responsible

395
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,719
for my choice and future.

396
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,319
There's no seat for you
on our horse carriage.

397
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
Don't worry, Lady Su.

398
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,719
Our carriage is going
to be here anytime.

399
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,239
In order to see you,

400
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,640
he even outran the carriage.

401
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,359
Oh, right.

402
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,920
If you feel drowsy or
sleepy on the way,

403
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,359
just tell me.

404
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,719
I'll pick fruits for you.

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,040
All right.

406
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,199
It's going to turn dark soon
if you keep talking.

407
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,479
Let's go.

408
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,560
Get on the carriage.

409
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,119
Be careful.

410
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,860
Capital

411
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,760
Congratulations.

412
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,319
Wishing you lots of prosperity.

413
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
Congratulations.

414
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,160
Congratulations.

415
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,359
- Great!
- Congratulations.

416
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,560
Su Chang Ji

417
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,719
Congratulations.

418
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,000
Come on in. Come on in.

419
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,479
Come on in. Come on in.

421
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,359
Thank you. Thank you.

422
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,040
Thank you.

423
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,319
Welcome. Welcome.

424
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,400
Keep up the good work, Young Madam Su.

425
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,359
Keep up the good work, Teacher Xie.

426
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:17,959
Come on in. Come on in.

427
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,599
Come on. Come on.

428
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,599
Thank you.

429
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,620
Imperial Academy

430
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,680
Lushan mountains often fool our eyes,

431
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,359
rolling range one minute,
towering crest the next.

432
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,400
The true portrait is always hidden

433
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,280
as we can only know someone from within.

434
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,180
Baichuankou

435
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,479
Both Baibao Village

436
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:38,880
and Taozhou

437
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,239
Baibao Village
have been regained.

438
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,239
General Xu also just sent
over a military update

439
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,239
Linzhou City
that they took over Linzhou City.

440
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,560
The bandits have all surrendered
over their weapons.

441
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
General is wise.

442
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,599
Now,

443
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,000
as long as we guard Baichuankou well,

444
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,079
perhaps in early spring next year,

445
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,839
we'll be able to return
victoriously to the capital.

446
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,199
We shouldn't underestimate our enemy?

447
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,079
Where's the scout sent out
a few days ago?

448
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
The scout isn't back yet.

449
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,599
Report!

450
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,000
General Zhao,

451
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,959
the scout from the front line
reported back.

452
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,800
Our enemy is approaching our army

453
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
since Baichuankou
currently lacks defense.

454
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,920
Moreover, our army is short of provisions.

455
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:14,719
I'm afraid

456
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,560
we won't be able to hold on for long.

457
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,719
What?

458
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,560
What should we do?

459
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:23,920
Yao Camp

460
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,239
Yao Camp
is where our enemy stores provisions.

461
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,119
We can only obtain provisions

462
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,359
if we take over this place.

463
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,079
Send the order.

464
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,280
From today onwards,

465
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:34,920
every day when we cook,

466
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,719
use double the amount of firewood.

467
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,719
Also, double the flags

468
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,280
at each station.

469
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,520
Why?

470
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,319
Let the enemy assume our army
has a great number of soldiers

471
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,199
so they dare not act rashly.

472
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,359
Why bother?

473
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,280
The way I see it,

474
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,239
we should bring our remaining brothers

475
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,719
to rush out

476
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,160
and kill them all!

477
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,359
Most of our enemy's soldiers
are on horseback

478
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,839
whereas we have more foot soldiers.

479
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,000
We mustn't leave our camp
to fight with them.

480
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,959
Hang the truce sign high
in each camp every day.

481
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,160
If there's anyone

482
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,719
who answers the enemy's challenge
and goes on to fight,

483
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,359
whether it's a win or otherwise,

484
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,680
he'll be executed.

485
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:10,880
Yes.

486
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,760
Mr. Shen,

487
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,760
don't you want to kill the enemy?

488
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,000
You and I will bring
200 soldiers tonight

489
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,680
to rob the enemy's channel
to provisions.

490
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:20,760
How's that?

491
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,959
Yes!

492
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,920
Set off a homing pigeon
to inform General Xu.

493
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,319
At 11 p.m. five days later,

494
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
our army will leave to rob
the enemy's camp.

495
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,839
When that happens, if General Xu
doesn't rush back to our aid,

496
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,079
we'll fight till death,

497
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,920
and Baichuankou will also
fall into the enemy's hands.

498
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,719
Yes.

499
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,880
Report, General Zhao!

500
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,400
This is bad!

501
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,719
The enemy will break in soon.

502
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Listen here, everyone.

503
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,560
Today, even if we fight
to the last soldier standing,

504
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,920
we must guard Baichuankou until we die!

505
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes!

506
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:07,760
Hanchen.

507
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,479
Charge!

508
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,000
Charge!

509
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,479
Kill!

510
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,239
I'll resolve everything,

511
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,000
except for this!

512
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,040
I disagree!

513
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,880
You can't agree to this either.

514
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,800
There's only one
Zhao Xiaoqian in this world.

515
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,560
He cherishes you like his own life.

516
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,980
Residence of the Su Family

517
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,319
Keep going

518
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,760
further and further.

519
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,479
Press forward with indomitable will.

520
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,599
Best of luck.

521
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,839
Kill!

522
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,380
Three years later

523
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,660
Capital

524
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,800
Continuing from last chapter.

525
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,280
In the battle at Baichuankou,

526
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,640
millions were killed and

527
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,160
so much blood was shed
as to float the shield.

528
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,239
10,000 deceased soldiers from our army

529
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,639
wandered everywhere

530
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,199
and wailed at night

531
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,800
as ghosts

532
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
since there weren't burial or rituals.

533
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,639
However, there's this army camp
they dare not get near to.

534
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:19,879
This camp...

535
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,520
Now,

536
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,560
rumors spread in the capital,

537
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,600
saying that General Zhao is evil.

538
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,280
A general's victory is built upon
thousands of sacrificed lives.

539
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,520
Our General Zhao

540
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,719
would sacrifice anyone

541
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,040
for military merits.

542
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,080
I agree.

543
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Crows caw is heard everywhere.

544
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,600
The soldier opened
the camp curtain carefully.

545
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,159
Their General Zhao

546
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,399
showed his true form on
the night of full moon.

547
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,399
He has the face of a buffalo,
with wings sprouting from his back,

548
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,919
He has three heads and
three pairs of arms.

549
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,239
He's made of steel,

550
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,399
as if the Living King Yama.

551
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,760
Bravo! Bravo!

552
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,339
Grand Chancellor, Xu Huan
We won the battle at Baichuankou

553
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,680
by a narrow margin.

554
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,760
As people say, when
the Living King Yama is determined,

555
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:14,639
how can the ants in the den escape?

556
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,600
Waiting for the triumphant
return of the edict in peace

557
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,360
to finally take off the battle robes.

558
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,879
Do the people in the capital

559
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,600
call Hanchen the Living King Yama?

560
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,679
Well...

561
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,439
I'm not the one who said so.

562
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,040
I...

563
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,959
I'm just reporting what I was told,
Your Majesty.

564
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,840
You may leave.

565
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:42,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

566
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,340
There must be a bad year
Guarding the Four Barbarians

567
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,080
What does it mean by
"there must be a bad year"

568
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,919
or "guarding the Four Barbarians"?

569
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:21,239
A bad year follows the war.

570
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,520
It originates from Tao Te Ching.

571
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,040
It means after vigorously
revitalizing the army,

572
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
there will be...

573
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,959
There will be a bad year.

574
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,959
What about
"guarding the Four Barbarians"?

575
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,719
You're the Crown Prince.

576
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,560
What are you afraid of?

577
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,360
"Zuo Zhuan,
23rd year of Duke of Zhao's reign"

578
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,520
The Emperors in the past
looked after the Four Barbarians.

579
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,879
It means the Emperor must

580
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,239
make all the regions to surrender
with his benevolence,

581
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,399
so there won't be a war.

582
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,879
Who taught you to write this way?

583
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,080
It's...

584
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:16,399
It's...

585
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,159
When will Hanchen return?

586
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,520
Your Majesty,

587
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,560
we received a letter a few days ago,

588
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,919
saying the army had
just left Baichuankou.

589
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:30,040
It'll take them about a month
to reach the capital.

590
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,919
I don't care if the Empress
told you to write this

591
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,239
or the grand tutor.

592
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:45,120
Remember, you're the Crown Prince,

593
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,639
not some literati

594
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,040
or sage.

595
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,560
The generals who protect the nation
and the people at the front line

596
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,000
fought the battle for three years.

597
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,760
If they return

598
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,520
to find your word,

599
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,239
"a bad year follows the war",

600
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,760
then they don't need

601
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:07,879
you as the Crown Prince.

602
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,260
Baichuankou

603
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,780
The memorial tablet of
the late soldiers of Baichuankou

604
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:44,719
Kneel!

605
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,959
First, kowtow to the war.

606
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,760
Secondly, kowtow to our comrades.

607
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,959
Thirdly, kowtow to
the souls of the deceased.

608
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,439
Get up!

609
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,199
The commander to offer sacrificial wine.

610
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,120
Offer sacrificial wine.

611
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:28,360
Are you not battle-dressed?

612
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,919
Let's share the plate for breast!

613
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,239
We shall go to the front line!

614
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,159
Let's make your lances shine!

615
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,360
Your foe is mine!

616
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,959

Let's share the coat and vest!

618
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,760

Let's make our halberds shine!

620
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,679
Your duty is mine!

621
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,360
Are you not battle-dressed?

622
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Let's share kilt and the rest!

623
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:53,600
We shall go to the front line!

624
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,479
Let's make our Armour shine!

625
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,719
March with your hand in mine!

626
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,120
It's 9 a.m.

627
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080

from Yangwu, Chenzhou.

00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,639
He joined the army three years ago.

635
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,439
He died of illness.

636

Put him down!

Why was it you who went?

Why was it you who went?

655
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,520
Why was it you who went?

656
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Scout Huang Liu

657
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760

and followed General Xu to Baichuankou.

In the battle to guard Gu City

662
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,000
over three months,

663
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,439
there was a shortage of provisions.

664
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,479
In order to safeguard
the last batch of provisions,

665
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,919
he went out the city gate
alone for the coordination

666
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,000
and was killed by a fire arrow.

667
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,199
Huang Liu,

668
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,760
Gu City

669
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,560
is protected.

670
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,239
General,

671
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,120
my brother and I

672
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,399
joined the army after
listening to your words.

673
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,000
You said, as a man,

674
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,199
we have to aspire for the great,

675
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
to fight on the battlefield,

676
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
and to protect our nation,

677
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,399
but does the nation

678
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:27,000
even value our lives?

679
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,040
Why we still haven't got the provisions?

680
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,719
Our brothers...

681
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,760
Did our brothers die in vain?

682
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:41,679
Get up.

683
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,879
Get up!

684
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,120
Bring the corpse away!

685
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,239
Light the fire!

686
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,760
Rest in peace!

687
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,080
No one will die in vain.

688
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:43,399
About the provisions,

689
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,760
I'll definitely give you an explanation.

690
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,560
Brothers,

691
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,479
wash up and pack your things.

692
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,239
We

693
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,479
are going home!

694
00:44:56,399 --> 00:44:57,159
Yes!

695
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,439
Yes!

696
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,439
Yes!

697
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120

Yes!
