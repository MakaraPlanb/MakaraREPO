(Jingnv Pavilion)

24
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,720
Did Zhao Xiaoqian agree just like that?

25
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:50,919
Yes.

26
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,440
I found it strange, too.

27
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,360
He forbade me from
doing anything before,

28
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,760
but he changed his mind suddenly.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,480
That's good.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,680
Minggu.

31
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,199
Have you reconciled with Yan Boyang?

32
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,600
Why is Lady Xue absent today?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,119
I heard she's going for
a blind date today.

34
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:16,880
A blind date?

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,160
Who is the potential candidate?

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Yan Boyang.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,479
Haven't you heard?

38
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,479
Yan Boyang?

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,440
Also,

40
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,039
Xie Ruying is getting married as well.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
Xie Ruying?

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,039
Who is it?

43
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,679
Who is she marrying?

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,600
Apparently, to the first son
of the Prefect of Tongzhou.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,520
However, he's rather ill.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Did Yan Boyang really go
for a blind date?

47
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,119
Xie Li,

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
why are you following me around?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,240
I go to meet my sister.

50
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,160
She's going to tutor me.

51
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,639
From now on,

52
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,559
I might not be able to attend
school with you anymore.

53
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,919
I'm leaving soon.

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,240
Where...

55
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,720
Where are you going?

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,679
My father received an order

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,160
to work in Tongzhou.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
My mother shall accompany him.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
I have no choice but to follow as well.

60
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,960
When are you leaving?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,639
In these two days.

62
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,119
This is for you.

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
If you leave now,

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,440
won't you attend
the rest of the classes?

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,679
Perhaps, you could talk to your mother.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,720
You're still young.

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,679
You need to study.

68
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:59,919
There are schools in Tongzhou as well.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,919
Actually,

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,919
I have a lot to say to you.

71
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,240
Sister Su told me that

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,839
I must confess...

73
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:08,399
All right.

74
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,160
My house is right there.

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,279
There's no need to send me.

76
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,160
Goodbye, Xie Li.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Fenniang!

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,119
Fenniang!

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,400
Yearning lasts forever.
Memory lasts forever.

80
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,839
Impermanent yearning seems boundless.

81
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,679
If I knew how agonizing it'd be,

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,519
I wish we haven't met at all.

83
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,020
(Dear Minggu, how I wish I can confess
my feelings for you.)

84
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,180
(Duke's Mansion)

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,880
(Duke's Mansion)

86
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
Greetings, Duke of Wuguo.

87
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,079
Call me your brother-in-law.

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Duke of Wuguo.

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Brother-in-law.

90
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,160
Duke of Wuguo.

91
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm going to beat you up.

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Brother-in-law.

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,079
I was told you did badly
in your studies.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,440
Your sister is concerned.

95
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,359
I've decided to teach you personally.

96
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,640
Before Chinese New Year's Eve,

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,279
you should fail everything.

98
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,760
If you fail everything,

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,880
I'll give you a pony, okay?

100
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,359
Come on.

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,679
What a good boy.

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,880
Keep that in mind.

103
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,000
Confucius said,

104
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,399
it's always a pleasure

105
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,040
to practice what you learned.

106
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,079
It's always a pleasure

107
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,760
to meet a friend who could teach.

108
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
It's a behaviour of a gentleman

109
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,040
to remain calm when misunderstood.

110
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,679
Memorize it.

111
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,279
It's always a pleasure

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,440
that's

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
not a behaviour of a gentleman.

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,760
It's always a pleasure

115
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,679
to practice what you learned.

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,079
It's always fun

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
to meet a friend who could teach.

118
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
It's always a pleasure.

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,119
Remain...

120
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,040
Remain misunderstood...

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,559
It's a behaviour of a gentleman

122
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,720
to remain calm when misunderstood!

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,679
You...

124
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
Kids these days surely are dumb.

125
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,200
They should just beg for food

126
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
by the streets by
Chinese New Year's Eve.

127
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,679
Memorize it!

128
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:04,839
It's...

129
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,839
It's...

130
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,920
Stand upright!

131
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,679
It's going to snow
during Chinese New Year's Eve.

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,079
Brat, come over here!

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Brother-in-law!

134
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,200
(Lotus Garden)
Hold it right there!

135
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,640
Brat!

136
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,119
What's wrong?

137
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,799
Stop running!

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Stop running!

139
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,640
Stop running!

140
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,760
Get over here!

141
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,239
You...

142
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,480
That's enough.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
I'll handle it, okay?

144
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,159
What's wrong?

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,239
What aggravated you?

146
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
That brat

147
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,039
can't even memorize

148
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,799
the simplest Analects.

149
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,400
He's doing it on purpose.

150
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
I told you so.

151
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
It's difficult being a teacher.

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,520
No matter how dull he is,

153
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,799
I'll succeed.

154
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,840
That's enough.

155
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,719
Let's talk inside.

156
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,119
Let's go.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,599
Calm down.

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,359
Were you eavesdropping

159
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,320
out here just now?

160
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,000
You're gloating.

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I wasn't.

162
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,320
I wasn't.

163
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,559
Don't accuse me.

164
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,799
I'm here to

165
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,840
talk to you about Yan Boyang.

166
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,880
What's going on with Boyang?

167
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,719
Recently,

168
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,479
Boyang is squabbling with Minggu.

169
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,960
He looks pretty upset.

170
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,239
How about this?

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's invite them over tomorrow

172
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,320
and we will talk it out.

173
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,559
What do you think?

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
Since when

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,159
are you concerned about them?

176
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,320
Of course I'm concerned
about my brother.

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,719
Yan Boyang is ridiculous.

178
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,840
He's a man,

179
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
yet he'd bicker with a lady.

180
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
It irritates me.

181
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,799
I understand.

182
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,520
All right.

183
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,640
Let's go.

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Do not change the topic.

185
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,960
Were you eavesdropping

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,799
out here just now?

187
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,799
I wasn't.

188
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,359
I wasn't.

189
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,640
I swear I wasn't.

190
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,520
I just missed you

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,119
so I came by to see you.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,559
Let's go.

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,020
(Half of spring has gone.)

194
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
One's yearning

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,280
is found on the fragrant lilac.

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,280
The beans...

197
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:30,039
The beans are gone.

198
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,520
Why aren't you going?

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,119
We've talked to Yan Boyang.

200
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Hanchen and I are getting married soon.

201
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,039
Will you still refuse to reconcile?

202
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,159
I won't go, period.

203
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,919
What's that?

204
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,280
A love letter from Luming Pavilion.

205
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,000
A love letter?

206
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,340
(To Minggu)

207
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,719
To Minggu?

208
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,460
(To Minggu)

209
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,860
(From Zhanzhi)

210
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,840
My feelings are genuine.

211
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,919
Believe me.

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,719
Minggu.

213
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,400
Zhanzhi?

214
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,640
You invited me to Duke's Mansion
tonight, right?

215
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:02,799
I'll go.

216
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,340
(Teachers' Office)

217
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,960
Look at Xie Li.

218
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
He's still young

219
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,960
yet he wrote a love letter.

220
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,520
He expressed his feelings

221
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
to Fenniang.

222
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,239
Matters of love belong
to the young.

223
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
However, it's a bit too early

224
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,919
for Xie Li.

225
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,599
Where's the letter?

226
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,239
Did you see the letter?

227
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:34,919
I collected it

228
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,719
from Fenniang this morning.

229
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
Why isn't it here?

230
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
So many people are here.

231
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,799
There are no outsiders.

232
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,280
Where's Yan Boyang?

233
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,320
Why hasn't he arrived?

234
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,479
Mr. Yan is here.

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm so sorry.

236
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,520
So sorry.

237
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm late.

238
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,280
Come on in.

239
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,719
Here.

240
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
Why is Yanwan here?

241
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,840
In the afternoon,

242
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,960
I was shopping with Yanwan,

243
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,440
so we came by together.

244
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,719
Is something wrong?

245
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,159
Nothing.

246
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
Everything is fine.

247
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,159
That's right.

248
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,400
Boyang was kind enough

249
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,799
to accompany me as
I shopped for some cosmetics.

250
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,200
Lady Su wants to drink.

251
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,479
You shouldn't stop her.

252
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,559
This is fine wine.

253
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,840
This is Bixiang.

254
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,359
It's not as strong.

255
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,000
Drink to your heart's content.

256
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,119
Of course.

257
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,440
This wine is perfect for you.

258
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,719
Your body is rather frail.

259
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
This wine will warm you up.

260
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,799
A little will do no harm.

261
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,000
What do you think?

262
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:20,960
How about this?

263
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,440
I

264
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,919
was late.
I shall take a shot as an apology.

265
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,599
Such fine wine.

266
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,239
The quality of wine

267
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,719
can be measured by a sommelier.

268
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,320
As for a quality of a person,

269
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,200
one can truly tell after
spending time with them.

270
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,080
Yanwan.

271
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,479
Yanwan,

272
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,960
eat more.

273
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,080
The dishes are turning cold.

274
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,880
You're getting yourself drunk.

275
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,280
Getting drunk or not
shows no difference.

276
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,479
Some people

277
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,440
could never sober up.

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,400
Yan Boyang.

279
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,119
What?

280
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,159
You're right.

281
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,280
Some people could never sober up.

282
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,440
Getting drunk or not
shows no difference.

283
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
Xue Yanwan has company.

284
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,919
No matter how drunk she is,
someone would send her home.

285
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm not the same.

286
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm afraid I can't drink anymore.

287
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,919
I have matters to attend to.

288
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
I shall take my leave.

289
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:44,880
Su Wei.

290
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,039
Boyang,

291
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,479
Minggu is a lady.

292
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
We're all friends.

293
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,080
What are you doing?

294
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,119
You're my friends.

295
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,440
She's not.

296
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,719
Are you done?

297
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,200
Do you feel good about this?

298
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,320
Are you even a man?

299
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,760
How ridiculous.

300
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,200
Let's go.

301
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,440
Thank you for the hospitality.

302
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I shall head home.

303
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,000
Wait.

304
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,200
Yanwan.

305
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,559
Allow me to send you home.

306
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,760
What's wrong with Yan Boyang?

307
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,520
We haven't met in a few days,

308
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,599
he's already so concerned about Yanwan.

309
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
You are wrong about him.

310
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,520
He just wanted to provoke Su Minggu.

311
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,679
He's a fool.

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,239
If Su Minggu left for real,

313
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
he'd be bawling his eyes out.

314
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,840
What do you mean?

315
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,479
You truly are a fool.

316
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,119
Can't you tell Yan Boyang's feelings

317
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,239
for Su Minggu?

318
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,320
What about your feelings?

319
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,919
Let's go make some babies.

320
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,440
Let me go!

321
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,320
Lady Xie!

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,719
Put me down.

323
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,400
What's the matter?

324
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,439
Lady Xie,

325
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,880
Li'er refuses to study again.

326
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,640
I lectured him,

327
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
but he wouldn't listen to me.

328
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,359
He even asked me to play with him.

329
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,479
All he does is play.

330
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,680
He refuses to study.

331
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,760
He wants to cook Shengwu
and Chunniang up as well.

332
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,119
I'm going to give him a lesson.

333
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,640
Calm down.

334
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,760
There's an order to everything.

335
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,040
You...

336
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,439
Get up!

337
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,359
It hurts!

338
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,280
Really?

339
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,160
What were you doing?

340
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,560
I told you to copy the Analects.

341
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,479
Are you done?

342
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,760
You're still young

343
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,239
yet you refuse to learn.

344
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,880
The person I love is
not going to school anymore.

345
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,920
You little brat.

346
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,959
What do you know about love?

347
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,199
I'm asking you.
Why aren't you doing your homework?

348
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,800
Leave me alone!

349
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
Have you ever liked someone?

350
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,479
Have you ever missed
someone so much that

351
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,439
you can't sleep,

352
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,400
yet you're eager to
meet her in your dream?

353
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,000
I...

354
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,959
You adults know nothing.

355
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,280
All you care about is homework.

356
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm done with study.

357
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,760
You brat.

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,560
Hold it right there.

359
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,280
Get back here!

360
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,479
Calm down.

361
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,520
I can't.

362
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,920
What's the problem?

363
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
That brat.

364
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,040
I told him to do his homework.

365
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
He was off doodling.

366
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,800
If you hit him,

367
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
would he stop?

368
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,520
When I was young,

369
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,959
I hated the teachers who hit me.

370
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,359
If you hit him for real,

371
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,800
he'd hate you for sure.

372
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
What should I do then?

373
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,880
In my opinion, education

374
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,359
should start from the beginning.

375
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,079
Forget about Xie Li.

376
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,439
We should focus on our kid.

377
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,439
Let's give birth to
a principal graduate.

378
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,839
That's all you ever think about.

379
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,800
You do not even care
about Xie Li's study.

380
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,199
Get out of here.

381
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:07,959
Get out.

382
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,439
You irritate me.

383
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,959
Calm down.

384
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,040
- Go away.
- Will you calm down?

385
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,560
There's no need to give birth
to a principal graduate.

386
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,959
Go away.

387
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,959
Let's give birth to a runner-up.

388
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Go away.

389
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,400
Please calm down.

390
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,199
They all

391
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,560
aggravate me.

392
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,800
Open up.

393
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,959
Yanwan.

394
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,719
Yanwan.

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,040
I...

396
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Yanwan, I'm sorry.

397
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
What's it?

398
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,199
Are you sorry for not
informing me beforehand

399
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,040
about the act you put on?

400
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,079
I...

401
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
It's fine.

402
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,040
I could tell you and Minggu are in love.

403
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,439
Therefore,

404
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,400
you didn't have to use me

405
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,280
as an excuse.

406
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
You're mistaken.

407
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:51,199
Minggu doesn't have feelings for me.

408
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,880
So you came to me?

409
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,400
No.

410
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:56,599
No.

411
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I don't mean it.

412
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,959
However, I have to obey

413
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:01,800
my parents.

414
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,959
I've never seen you

415
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,359
so obedient.

416
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,400
If you were obedient,

417
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,520
you would have been
married to Ruying by now.

418
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,199
No, I...

419
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,959
No matter who you have feelings for,

420
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,800
I, Xue Yanwan,

421
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,880
am not a lady nobody wants.

422
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,199
If my husband's heart
belongs to someone else,

423
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,800
and I insist on marrying him,

424
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,119
it's beyond shameful.

425
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I, Xue Yanwan,
am not concerned about a man.

426
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,359
I'll get married when I want to.

427
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,439
Yan Boyang,

428
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,640
if you'd like to marry me,

429
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,680
you should forget Lady Su first.

430
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,160
Old Madam Su,

431
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Lady Su is here.

432
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,520
Grandmother.

433
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,160
Did you ask for me?

434
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,680
Minggu.

435
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:49,959
Come here.

436
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,719
Sit right here.

437
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,959
Recently,

438
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,560
I've been ill.

439
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,880
Your parents have been

440
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,680
managing the matters of the household.

441
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,560
They are reluctant to trouble you.

442
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,520
I know.

443
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,880
Don't cry.

444
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,520
Just keep this in mind.

445
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,040
No matter what happens in the future,

446
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:25,319
remain upright.

447
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,959
Keep your chin up.

448
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,599
Grandmother,

449
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm an adult now.

450
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,439
I want to share your burdens.

451
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,959
I'm capable of doing that.

452
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,160
From now on,

453
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,439
I'll learn what I do not know.

454
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,520
I'll master them all, grandmother.

455
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,319
Child.

456
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,920
As your elderly,

457
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,280
we do not expect anything from you.

458
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,800
All we wish for you

459
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,439
is health

460
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,560
and happiness.

461
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,959
We hope you'd find a good husband.

462
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,199
Yan Boyang

463
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,040
is a good kid.

464
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,439
I could tell

465
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,119
his feelings for you.

466
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,359
When faced with hurdles,

467
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,199
try your best to overcome them.

468
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:24,359
Put the result aside.

469
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,800
Do not opt for shortcuts.

470
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,599
Otherwise, you'd regret

471
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,400
this deeply

472
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,560
for the rest of your life.

473
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,959
Grandmother,

474
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,920
what do I do if I'm uncertain

475
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,199
about my feelings?

476
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,079
Silly child.

477
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,319
If it affects you so much,

478
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,040
that means it matters to you.

479
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,880
Stop thinking too much.

480
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,719
Stop hesitating.

481
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,040
He's a good man.

482
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,439
Don't let him be taken by someone else.

483
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,439
Grandmother.

485
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,719
(I'm in a good mood today.)

486
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,800
(That's why the weather
today is fine as well.)

487
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,479
(They might have nothing
to do with each other.)

488
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,040
(However, my mood)

489
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,359
(changes according to yours.)

490
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,160
(I'm happy when you're happy.)

491
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,839
(When you're upset,)

492
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,079
(I no longer know what
it means to be happy.)

493
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
Tomorrow at noon,

494
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
I'll see you at Xiang Bridge.

495
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,839
Yours, Zhanzhi.

496
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,160
At noon tomorrow?

497
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,479
Zhanzhi.

498
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,800
Grandmother is right.

499
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,479
No matter what hurdles I face,

500
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,839
I must overcome them.

501
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,300
(Bailu Academy)

502
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:00,920
Lang Mengzi,

503
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,199
Yanwan didn't show up today?

504
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,160
He's on a date with Yan Boyang.

505
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,319
If the marriage is confirmed,

506
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,839
she'd be his first wife

507
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,599
and she will not attend school anymore.

508
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,599
Lady Xie.

509
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,920
Lady Xie.

510
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:19,640
Something went wrong.

511
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,640
Li is gone.

512
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,280
Duke of Wuguo sent for you.

513
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,920
What?

514
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,839
Xiaoman is here.

515
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,520
What happened to Li'er?

516
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,119
Was he absent from classes today?

517
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,520
He came by this morning,

518
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,920
but he was gone in a wink.

519
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,599
We searched the entire academy.

520
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,880
No one has seen Xie Li.

521
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:37,959
Did something happen at home

522
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,880
so he returned?

523
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,560
No.

524
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,000
He has been

525
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,599
staying at Duke's Mansion
the last few days.

526
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,719
Nothing happened at home.

527
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,439
Where could he go?

528
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
Is it because

529
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,680
I reprimanded him yesterday?

530
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:52,800
This is bad.

531
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,160
Wujiang Prefecture is huge.

532
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,040
What if he was abducted by

533
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:56,920
the human traffickers?

534
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,839
Do not panic.

535
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,079
I've sent men

536
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,160
to check the mansion
and Residence of the Su Family.

537
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Let's search the streets first.

538
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,319
All right.

539
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,040
Xingzhou,

540
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,760
return to the mansion and inform Liangji

541
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
to increase the manpower.

542
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,319
If we fail to find him,

543
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,839
head to Arms Instructor Qin
outside the city.

544
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,719
All right.

545
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,280
Let's go.

546
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:14,800
Slow down.

547
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,319
We agreed to meet at Xiang Bridge.

548
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,040
Where is he?

549
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,079
Sister Su.

550
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:39,880
Li'er.

551
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,880
What are you doing here?

552
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,680
Are you absent from school?

553
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm waiting for a friend.

554
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,959
We agreed to meet here.

555
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,400
I wrote her a letter.

556
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,400
What did you say in your letter?

557
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,160
Today at noon,

558
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,560
see you at Xiang Bridge.

559
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,319
Zhanzhi.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,760
Zhanzhi?

561
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,479
Yes.

562
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,880
Zhanzhi has been thinking and

563
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,359
yearning for you.

564
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,820
(From Zhanzhi)

565
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,520
- Li'er.
- Li'er.

566
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,079
Li'er.

567
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,359
Excuse me.

568
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,119
Have you seen a kid this tall?

569
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,640
Have you seen

570
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,160
a child with a book bag?

571
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,920
He's around this tall.

572
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,239
No.

573
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:22,719
Thank you.

574
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,479
Li'er.

575
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,199
Li'er.

576
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,040
Have you seen a kid this tall,

577
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,479
carrying a book bag?

578
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,079
No.

579
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,760
Thank you.

580
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,000
Where

581
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,920
could he be?

582
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,319
Don't worry.

583
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,680
Xie Li will be fine.

584
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,160
He's probably playful

585
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,439
so he's out playing somewhere.

586
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,319
It's all my fault.

587
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,439
It's all my fault.

588
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,800
I reprimanded him yesterday.

589
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,160
He's still young.

590
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
He couldn't take it.

591
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,280
Why did I

592
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,400
scold him?

593
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,640
Don't worry.

594
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,520
We'll find him.

595
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,319
Let's question him when we find him.

596
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,400
All right?

597
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,599
Your Highness.

598
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,239
Your Highness.

599
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,160
We found him.

600
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,160
Where is he?

601
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,719
Sit right here.

602
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,800
What's going on?

603
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,880
I wanted to write a letter,

604
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,680
but I didn't have large vocabulary.

605
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,079
I didn't want Fenniang to laugh at me.

606
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:18,199
While strolling on the streets,

607
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,959
I found a letter.

608
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,620
(From Zhanzhi)

609
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,239
I copied everything down

610
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,920
exactly.

611
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,760
Except to meet at the bridge,

612
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,959
I wrote that myself.

613
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,460
(From Zhanzhi)

614
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Why do you have that letter as well?

615
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,359
I gave it to Fenniang.

616
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,719
(Do you still remember that)

617
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,319
(back at Mount Kunyan Temple,)

618
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,760
(you got me out of trouble?)

619
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,400
(Back then, I knew)

620
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,640
(you were different from the rest.)

621
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,880
(You're genuine and loyal.)

622
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,239
(You're a lady yet you
possess qualities of a man.)

623
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,800
(Every time when I'm in trouble,)

624
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,199
(you always came to my rescue.)

625
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,560
(To others,)

626
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,400
(I may be unreliable,)

627
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,079
(but before you,)

628
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,160
(I really want to be bold.)

629
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,000
(Sometimes, I thought to myself,)

630
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,280
(if I had confessed)

631
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,119
(my feelings earlier,)

632
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,479
(could things)

633
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,000
(have ended up differently?)

634
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
(After falling in love with you,)

635
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
(I came to realize what it means for)

636
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,560
(the longing to disappear,)

637
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,479
(only to return thereafter.)

638
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,599
Did you

639
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,599
pick these up and copy them?

640
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,560
Xie Li.

641
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,040
Xie Li.

642
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,479
Why are you here?

643
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,920
Do you know how worried we are?

644
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:50,760
Minggu,

645
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
what are you doing here?

646
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Sister Minggu and I are on a date.

647
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,000
You...

648
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,560
Do you know where Yan Boyang is?

649
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,560
Boyang is at Taiping Tavern.

650
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,160
He's having a meal with
Prefect Xue and his family.

651
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,839
What's wrong?

652
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:06,880
Minggu.

653
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you know everyone
is out looking for you?

654
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,119
Why did you run away?

655
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,760
Why are you crying?

656
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,880
I...

657
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,359
Just apologize for your mistake.

658
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm sorry, sister.

659
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,959
Don't be mad.

660
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can no longer

661
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
see Fenniang whom I like.

662
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,280
Fenniang?

663
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,239
Who is Fenniang?

664
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,760
Fenniang is a student

665
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
of the academy.

666
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,839
She's leaving for Tongzhou today.

667
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,199
She will not come to school anymore.

668
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,199
I'll not be able to see her again.

669
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,599
All right. Stop crying.

670
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,640
I'll take you to her.

671
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
Along with your sister,

672
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,479
we will find Fenniang with you.

673
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Are you coming?

674
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,920
Yes.

675
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,599
Hurry up and apologize to your sister.

676
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Sister, I was wrong.

677
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't be mad at me.

678
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Do not disappear like this anymore.

679
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,280
Do you understand?

680
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,560
Let's go.

681
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,160
Let's go.

682
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,199
Where is he?

683
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:35,880
Lady.

684
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
Which room is the young master

685
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,160
of Bureaucrat Yan in?

686
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,199
Bureaucrat Yan?

687
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,959
West room on the second floor.

688
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:41,560
All right.

689
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,280
Thank you.

690
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,900
(Yayi Workshop)

691
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,800
We invited your family over today.

692
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,239
Yanwan is a great child.

693
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,680
I know that very well.

694
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,040
This hairpin

695
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,439
was chosen by Boyang himself.

696
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,719
Let him help you put in on.

697
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Boyang.

698
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,359
Yan Boyang!

699
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,079
Who is this?

700
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,439
How unruly.

701
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,479
Minggu.

702
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,119
What are you doing here?

703
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,119
Madam Yan.

704
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,359
Madam Xue.

705
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,239
My apology.

706
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,599
Come with me.

707
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:43,880
Boyang.

708
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
What's going on?

709
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,040
Yes.

710
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
What are you doing?

711
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Yanwan,

712
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,239
I need to talk to Yan Boyang.

713
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm really sorry.

714
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:57,880
Please go ahead.

715
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,520
Come with me.

716
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,839
Boyang.

717
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,199
Let's go.

718
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:02,680
Mother.

719
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,520
- Yan Boyang.
- Mother.

720
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,800
Boyang.

721
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:05,800
Mother.

722
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,599
Look at this child.

723
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,359
I do not want to marry.

724
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
I do not want to marry to Yan Boyang.

725
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,760
Su Minggu.

726
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,599
Su Minggu.

727
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
What's wrong with you?

728
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,760
How could you

729
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,800
drag me out like this?

730
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,280
What do you want?

731
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,640
I read all the letters

732
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,119
you wrote to me.

733
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,439
You can't restart your past.

734
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,400
Let bygones be bygones.

735
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:39,199
Longing is found on the fragrant lilacs

736
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,520
as they bloom in spring.

737
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
I hope you'd understand

738
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,920
my true feelings

739
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,599
and believe me.

740
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,280
I...

741
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:53,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

742
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,479
I'm sorry.

743
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,439
Boyang,

744
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,280
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,839
I'm the heir to Su Chang Ji.

746
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
I've always been just and honest.

747
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,439
I thought I was frank and forthright.

748
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,040
I haven't wronged anyone.

749
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,800
However, in terms of love,

750
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,439
I've wronged you.

751
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,840
All I cared about

752
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,719
were things out of my reach.

753
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,479
I neglected you who never left my side.

754
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,000
In the past, I was ignorant

755
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,120
of your feelings for me.

756
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,520
All I cared about was Xingzhou.

757
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,679
I cared about no one else.

758
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,840
I didn't know

759
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,360
that someone has been

760
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,360
by my side this whole time.

761
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,040
I was foolish. I was dumb.

762
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,399
I did not cherish what I had.

763
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,120
I pushed you away.

764
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,719
I took your effort for granted.

765
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,600
My grandmother told me that

766
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,120
I must overcome all the hurdles I face.

767
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,479
I cannot take the shortcut

768
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,719
or I'll regret it.

769
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,919
I didn't know what it means

770
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,800
until I realized

771
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,080
you and Xue Yanwan are getting engaged.

772
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,120
That's when I realized

773
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
how sad I was.

774
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,560
Boyang.

775
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,719
Thank you for your kindness.

776
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,840
Thank you for all that
you've done for me.

777
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,159
I dragged you out and talked nonsense.

778
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,560
I must have ruined your mood.

779
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:44,800
You should head inside.

780
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,040
I shall leave.

781
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,879
Minggu.

782
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,360
Su Minggu!

783
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,879
Stand right there!

784
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
I do not want Xue Yanwan.

785
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:09,840
I don't want anyone else.

786
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,000
Since the beginning,

787
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,320
you're the only one I loved.

788
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,479
Even if you do not feel the same,

789
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:16,479
even if you're in love
with someone else,

790
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,760
even if I'm only a friend to you,

791
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,520
keep this in mind, Su Minggu,

792
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
I will

793
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,520
only love you for the rest of my life.

794
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Stop screaming.

795
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,520
Stop embarrassing me in public.

796
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,679
I'm dumb.

797
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm not a man of ambition.

798
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,080
I might not be good enough for her.

799
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,199
Will you

800
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,360
talk to her on my behalf?

801
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
I'm willing to stay by her side.

802
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
I'll cheer her up when she's upset.

803
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,040
When she's bullied,

804
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,560
I'll be the first to protect her.

805
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,000
I'll only

806
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
be nice to her alone.

807
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,080
Can she give me a chance?

808
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,120
I'm not as good as you described.

809
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,679
You're perfect in every way.

810
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,760
So perfect that I'm
willing to wait for you

811
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,479
to fall in love with me

812
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,199
and until you're willing to marry me.

813
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,479
I'll wait for you.

814
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,879
Su Minggu.

815
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,159

Xie Li.

822
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
When I was young, my brother told me

823
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,679
that if you speak to the valley,

824
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:04,800
it'd reply you.

825
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,360
Would you like to try?

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,840

Where are you?

828
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:15,879
Did you hear that?

829
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,040
As it echoes through the valley,

830
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,360
it might reach Fenniang.

831
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:20,679
Give it a try.

832
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Fenniang!

833
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I've always wanted to be
your best friend!

Fenniang!

835
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,719
Sister, did you hear that?

836
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,600
I heard it.

837
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,080

Hurry up and marry me!

843
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,840
Let's give birth to a cute baby!

844
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,879
Xie Xiaoman!

845
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,479
You're allowed to be a teacher!

846
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,080
Xie Xiaoman!

847
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,760
After you marry me,

848
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,040
do not ever shut me out of your room!

849
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,800

00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,360

00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,879
I'll be waiting for you

I'll be waiting for you

Lord,

860
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,600
this is Su Chang Ji's ledger.

861
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
The time has come.

862
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,320
Old Madam Su's body

863
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,600
is failing.

864
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,320
I intended

865
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,800
to offer you the store of Su Chang Ji

866
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,879
a long time ago.

867
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,560
Are you serious about seizing
Su Family's possessions?

868
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,360
Old Madam Su's body

869
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,719
is failing her.

870
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
With your help, after it's done,

871
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,679
Su Chang Ji's ledger?

872
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,439
marry your daughter off to Tongzhou,

873
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,560
I'll give the store back at
Tongzhou as a token of

874
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,760
appreciation.

875
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
That could be considered

876
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,399
endowment for your daughter.

877
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,439
What do you think?

878
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,600
Good idea.
