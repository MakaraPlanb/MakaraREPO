21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(There's snow and the sound
of snowflake in the winter)

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,660
(Residence of the Su Family)

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:51,839
How is she doing?

24
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,559
Madam Su.

25
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,879
Since last night,

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
Old Madam Su has yet to open her eyes.

27
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,400
Right now,

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,559
it's getting harder to
feed her the medication.

29
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,080
What should we do?

30
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,519
Send for

31
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,800
the physician to check on her today.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Obtain a new prescription.

33
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,559
Let the physician know

34
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,479
it doesn't matter
how expensive the herbs are.

35
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,600
Use them as required.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,199
All right.

37
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,639
Also,

38
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,039
it's getting colder indoors.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,679
Warm some Dilong extract.

40
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,320
Don't worry, Madam Su.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,279
I've prepared all these.

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Mother,

43
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,119
don't give us a fright.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320
Mother, wake up.

45
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,199
Please wake up.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,559
Mother.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,639
Winter solstice is approaching.

48
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,399
Old Madam Su hates the winter.

49
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,119
Do not jinx it.

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,199
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,399
Father.

52
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,639
My mother is blessed by the heaven.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,279
Let me finish.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
When Minggu was still young,

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,399
every year end,

56
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,479
we'd hold
the Winter Solstice Prayer Ceremony

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,880
to pray for the family's
longevity and peace.

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Isn't that right?

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,520
We stopped holding the ceremony
after Minggu grew up.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I was thinking to

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,240
host the ceremony once again

62
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,880
to lift the mood of Old Madam Su

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
and get rid of the bad omen.

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,479
Perhaps, her condition would improve.

65
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,160
That's a good idea.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
The winter is the harbinger
of great harvest.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,679
We'd pray for my mother's health.

68
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,559
Minggu,

69
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,399
I'll leave the arrangement to you.

70
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,839
Mother,

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,320
we can't hold the ceremony.

72
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,479
You brat,

73
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
how could you

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,679
evade responsibilities at this moment?

75
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,759
Why not?

76
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,639
Grandmother favours you the most.

77
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,759
It's the least you could do.

78
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,919
You refuse to take the responsibility?

79
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,479
I...

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,720
That's not the reason.

81
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:33,720
It's because...

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,199
What's the reason?

83
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,119
I...

84
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:36,720
Madam Su.

85
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,880
Madam Su.

86
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,880
The second son of Prefect Yan
seeks an audience.

87
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,759
He has an urgent matter.

88
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,399
- Su Wei.
- Boyang?

89
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,399
Madam Su. Uncle Meng.

90
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,639
What's the matter?

91
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,000
Bad news.

92
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,199
Xie Xiaoman is here to

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,679
greet Princess Consort Pu.

94
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,360
May Your Highness be blessed.

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,119
You entered the mansion
for over half a year.

96
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,079
Are you getting used to the life here?

97
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,959
Your Highness,

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,799
I'm well-fed and

99
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,640
taken care of.

100
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,119
My life is pretty great.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
All right.

102
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,079
You've greeted me and served me tea.

103
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm tired.

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
You should leave.

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,279
Your Highness.

106
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,119
My...

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,320
My grandmother has been ill recently.

108
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,200
I'd like to return home to visit her.

109
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,880
I beg for your permission.

110
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
Her Highness has just arrived for a day

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,720
yet you're eager to return home.

112
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,480
You sure are respectful, Lady Xie.

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,959
Mother.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,559
Go ahead.

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Do return on time.

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

117
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,119
Hanchen.

118
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,079
Come with me.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,799
Just be frank.

120
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,239
What are you doing here?

121
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,200
My son is getting married.

122
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,480
As your mother, I have to show up.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,079
Do you still remember
your identity as my mother?

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,200
By the way,

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
are you happy with

126
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,079
my bride-to-be?

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,359
The woman is incompatible with you.

128
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,399
If she was made a concubine

129
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,239
to serve you, it's not a problem.

130
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,119
If you marry her as your first wife,

131
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,760
you'd become a laughing stock.

132
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,839
You should consider

133
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,399
the embarrassment
your father and I have to suffer.

134
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,079
Our compatibility is not up
to your decision.

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,079
I'll marry her because I want to.

136
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,399
Besides, you and father

137
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,399
have plenty of children.

138
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,839
One child less

139
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,040
wouldn't make a difference.

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,839
I'm an abandoned son.

141
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,920
There's no need for me

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
to abide by your instructions.

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,799
You want to keep Xie Xiaoman around.

144
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm not entirely against the idea,

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,839
but you must promise me

146
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,399
to leave this place
and return to the capital.

147
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,119
I'll marry Xie Xiaoman for sure.

148
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,079
However, I'll not return to the capital.

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,640
Forget it.

150
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,200
A grown son does not
need his mother anymore.

151
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,000
Su Tingshan is malicious!

152
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,200
How could he attempt to

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
seize the family fortune at this moment?

154
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,160
How could he be so ungrateful

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,920
to such extent?

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,399
He's completely inhumane!

157
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,440
Mother,

158
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,359
calm down.

159
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,679
I don't believe that

160
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
he'd be so daring...

161
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,279
Mother,

162
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,959
in broad daylight.

163
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,720
how is grandmother doing?

164
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,320
What's going on?

165
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,320
Old Madam Su is unconscious.

166
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Su Tingshan sued your uncle and aunt

167
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,959
at the magistrate,

168
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,119
attempting to seize the possession
of Su Chang Ji at Wujiang Prefecture.

169
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,519
The appeal has been submitted.

170
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,839
The case will be judged tomorrow.

171
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,160
What?

172
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
We shouldn't have helped him back then.

173
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,440
To help a brother in need?

174
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,799
To care for a member of the family?

175
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,920
In the end,

176
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,040
all we did was invite
disaster upon ourselves.

177
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
I'll confront him right now.

178
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,600
- Minggu.
- Hold it right there!

179
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,239
Stop making trouble!

180
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,720
Confront him?

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,279
We do not have any evidence.

182
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,160
What are you going to do?

183
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,000
I know.

184
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,440
I can testify at the court tomorrow.

185
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,959
Before grandmother fell unconscious,

186
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,600
she told me something

187
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,720
about the distribution of
family fortune.

188
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,320
Grandmother said,

189
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,079
after her death,

190
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,480
her fortune and business

191
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,280
will be inherited by aunt and Minggu.

192
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,200
I heard it with my very ears.

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,119
I can't be wrong.

194
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,599
I can be the witness.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,559
I can testify at the court.

196
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,940
(Bailu Academy)

197
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
Grandmother fainted?

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,080
Su Tingshan came to seize your store?

199
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,039
My family is in a mess right now.

200
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,000
Grandmother is unconscious right now.

201
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,599
We've lost our backbone.

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,359
In addition to this court case,

203
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,080
I don't even know

204
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
what I can do.

205
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,840
Minggu,

206
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,000
don't worry.

207
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
Like Xiaoman said, she will

208
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,440
head to the court

209
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,359
and testify on your behalf.

210
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,000
Testify?

211
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,119
Yes.

212
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,119
That's right.

213
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,559
I'm the witness to grandmother's will.

214
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
I'll testify.

215
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

216
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,320
Will I be able to

217
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,919
leave the Duke's Mansion?

218
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,840
Don't worry. I'm here.

219
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's go.

220
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,719
We're returning to class.

221
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,479
Wait.

222
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,119
Take it slow.

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,039
Do not rush.

224
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,200
Go on.

225
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,679
I'm sick of the both of you.

226
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
That's enough. Stop staring.

227
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's get back to class.

228
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,799
I have never met him in my life.

229
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,039
How could I marry him?

230
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
Forget it.

231
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,280
Marriage is often
decided by our parents.

232
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,359
I'm not marrying him.

233
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
I'll never marry him.

234
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,679
As ladies, we have to
get married sooner or later.

235
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,239
What's going on?

236
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,359
Haven't you heard?

237
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,479
Xie Ruying is getting married

238
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,719
to the son of Prefect of Tongzhou.

239
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Apparently,

240
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,039
the prefect's son is
down with tuberculosis.

241
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,799
He's a sick man.

242
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,159
He's bedridden.

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
What are you staring at?

244
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,200
A dejected woman whose
household is litigated!

245
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,280
What are you talking about?

246
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,840
That's enough.

247
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,840
We shouldn't fight among ourselves.

248
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,919
Let's have a seat.

249
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,599
All right. Calm down.

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,919
Su Family of Wujiang Prefecture

251
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
offers our fervent prayers

252
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,200
for the fall of snow

253
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,159
to eliminate calamity

254
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,359
and end eternal suffering.

255
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:00,359
Who is there?

256
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,000
Hold on.

257
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,799
Don't scream.

258
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,559
It's me.

259
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,440
What are you doing here?

260
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm worried about you.

261
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,919
I brought you some food.

262
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,799
Roasted sweet potatoes.

263
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,440
I don't want any.

264
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
No way.

265
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
You can't starve yourself.

266
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,479
I will not

267
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,760
allow you to starve.

268
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,840
Take it.

269
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,080
Let me share some good news with you.

270
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
About your family's case,

271
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
I begged my father for help.

272
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,119
He agreed to do so.

273
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
As long as you drag it on
to the county magistrate,

274
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,599
and push the case further

275
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,559
to the provincial office,

276
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,080
the case would be
under my father's supervision.

277
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,039
Everything will be fine then.

278
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,760
By then, when your case is settled,

279
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,280
All right.

280
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:54,960
we should

281
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,039
decide on a date then.

282
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,919
Don't be ridiculous!

283
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,479
What's this?

284
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
The prayer for
the Winter Solstice Prayer Ceremony.

285
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
Winter Solstice Prayer Ceremony?

286
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,919
It's a past tradition

287
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,159
of my household.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
My parents are planning
to hold the ceremony this year

289
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,559
(Prayers)
to pray for my grandmother's well-being.

290
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,599
However, I'm worried...

291
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,559
Don't worry.

292
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,080
Your grandmother will be fine.

293
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
She will definitely wake up.

294
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,159
I'm not concerned about that.

295
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,719
I'm concerned

296
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,080
that it wouldn't snow tomorrow.

297
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,640
I prayed sincerely.

298
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,119
If it doesn't snow,

299
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,599
could it represent a bad omen?

300
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,359
Is that

301
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,119
what you're worried about?

302
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,140
(Studio of Artlessness)

303
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,559
Are you indicating that

304
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,320
Su Family was caught in a lawsuit

305
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,559
because of Princess Consort Pu?

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm just speculating.

307
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,320
I aggravated her this morning,

308
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,359
but she remained unaffected.

309
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
I suspect her visit this time

310
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440
isn't as simple as it seems.

311
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,400
What's your plan?

312
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,359
I'll take it step by step.

313
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,520
Aren't you afraid Her Highness

314
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,479
is here to

315
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,000
ruin your marriage with Xiaoman?

316
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,400
The woman I seek to marry,

317
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
I will marry.

318
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,280
Nobody can stop me.

319
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,400
Forget about my mother.

320
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,760
Even the mother of the deity

321
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,400
cannot stop me.

322
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,420
(Duke's Mansion)

323
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,760
Where are you going, Lady Xie?

324
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,119
Princess Consort is awake now.

325
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm obligated to lead you there

326
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,719
to serve Her Highness

327
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,080
with her bath and meal.

328
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,679
Move out of the way.

329
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,280
A concubine is obligated to

330
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,440
serve her mother-in-law.

331
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,599
Filial piety must be practised
according to the teachings.

332
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,000
Your Highness,

333
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,679
please do not put me
in a difficult position.

334
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm going out today.

335
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,520
What will you do about it?

336
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,359
Such disturbance early in the morning.

337
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,719
Is this how things work
here in the Duke's Mansion?

338
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,880
Zhu Momo,

339
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,719
is that how you uphold
discipline in the mansion?

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Your Highness.

341
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,280
Your Highness.

342
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,080
My household is involved in an
important court case today.

343
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,080
I have to leave the mansion

344
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,359
and testify at the court.

345
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,119
I beg for Your Highness' grace

346
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,000
and allow me out.

347
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,760
Zhu Momo,

348
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,440
is this the etiquette you taught her?

349
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,840
I dare not, Your Highness.

350
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,760
It's daybreak.

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Your Highness and Zhu Momo
came out to stop us personally.

352
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
What's happening?

353
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,640
Does the sun rise earlier

354
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,479
in the capital than it does here?

355
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,559
Do not spew nonsense.

356
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
I set the rules in the Duke's Mansion.

357
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,000
If you're upset with me,

358
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,919
go ahead and punish me.

359
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,359
Xie Xiaoman has to
leave the mansion today.

360
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,119
Are you requesting for
the corporal punishment from me?

361
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,479
That depends if you

362
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,599
would allow me to leave.

363
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:33,280
A son who disobeys his mother

364
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,799
is unfilial.

365
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,119
Servants.

366
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,520
Flog him.

367
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,280
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,039
Your Highness.

369
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,159
I...

370
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,559
It seems like I will not be
able to leave today.

371
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,599
Xingzhou,

372
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,119
take Xiaoman with you first.

373
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,320
- Hanchen.
- Hanchen.

374
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,880
Hurry up and leave!

375
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,559
Xiaoman, let's go.

376
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,400
Zhao Xiaoqian.

378
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Is this worth it?

379
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,719
If you do not kill me,

380
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,919
do not expect me to obey!

381
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,479
Flog him.

382
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,080
Harder!

383
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,359
You lack in strength!

384
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:44,760
Go.

385
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,000
Settle this matter.

386
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,200
Yes, Your Highness.

387
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,940
(Magistrate Court of Wujiang)

388
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,760
Disgusting!

389
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,920
You're full of nonsense!

390
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
You're not allowed to
disturb the order at the court.

391
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,760
Defendant, Su Huazhong,

392
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,479
what else do you have to say?

393
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,719
Su Chang Ji is the possession

394
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,400
of my mother, Old Madam Su.

395
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,239
Su Family has always
honoured our elderly.

396
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,599
Our ancestor, Su Feihuan,

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,719
had always acknowledged

398
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,439
the private ownership of Su Chang Ji.

399
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,920
It's unlike his claims

400
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,199
that it belongs to Su Clan

401
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,160
and him!

402
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,439
Let me ask you.

403
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,520
What's Old Madam Su's maiden name?

404
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,239
My mother was born in Wang Family
in Jiangnan.

405
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,479
Your mother's maiden name is Wang.

406
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,719
You claimed that Su Chang Ji
is a possession of your mother.

407
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
Why is it called Su Chang Ji

408
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,520
instead of Wang Chang Ji?

409
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,119
You...

410
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,760
You're being unreasonable.

411
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,239
I'm warning you.

412
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:55,680
You...

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,520
Minggu.

414
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,199
My Lord.

415
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,119
I'm Meng Hanru,

416
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,520
the husband of Su Huazhong.

417
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,760
Su Tingshan is right.

418
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,479
Su Chang Ji's first store

419
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,359
wasn't named Su Chang Ji at first.

420
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,920
It was known as Xia Fei Ji.

421
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,040
It's a property endowed to Old Madam Su.

422
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,040
The seven branches that
were opened later

423
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,359
were expanded

424
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,719
through the operation of the main store.

425
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,040
By this statement,

426
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,760
the main store

427
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:28,280
is indeed a personal property
of Old Madam Su.

428
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,680
My mother is currently
ill and unconscious.

429
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,479
However, she has once
proclaimed her will.

430
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,199
After her death,

431
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
all her belongings

432
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,520
will be inherited by her daughter,
Su Huazhong,

433
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,839
and her granddaughter, Su Wei.

434
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,040
There is a witness to testify for this.

435
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,359
Where is the person?

436
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,040
Where is the witness?

437
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,040
Is the witness present?

438
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,520
Minggu,

439
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,400
where's Xiaoman?

440
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,239
Xiaoman promised to come.

441
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:01,839
Since...

442
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,599
The witness is present!

443
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm the witness.

444
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,640
(Justice)
Report your name and origins.

445
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,719
I'm Xie Xiaoman.

446
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm the niece of the owners
of Su Chang Ji, Su Huazhong

447
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,599
and Meng Hanru.

448
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,520
When Old Madam Su was sick in bed,

449
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:29,479
I often served her with medication.

450
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,479
I heard her will proclaimed
orally with my own ears.

451
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,239
All the properties of Su Chang Ji
and the household

452
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,680
will be inherited by Su Huazhong
and Su Wei.

453
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
My Lord.

454
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,839
Xie Xiaoman

455
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,880
is a relative of Su Family.

456
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,280
Their ties have always been close.

457
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,839
Her testimony

458
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,439
is invalid.

459
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,520
You...

460
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,119
Is that true?

461
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,400
When Old Madam Su voiced her will,

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
were there any other
witnesses present?

463
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:03,760
Others?

464
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
Since there aren't any other witness

465
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and testimony,

466
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,800
according to the law,

467
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,760
the time limit for the case is up.

468
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,599
A simple litigation
of the family fortune

469
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,719
must be concluded today.

470
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,280
Hold on!

471
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,520
Lord Xie has met with

472
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,959
Su Tingshan privately, right?

473
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,520
Lord,

474
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,520
this is Su Chang Ji's ledger.

475
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,959
The time has come.

476
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,040
Old Madam Su's body

477
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
is failing.

478
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,680
Su Chang Ji...

479
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,280
You...

480
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,599
Are you eligible to handle this case?

481
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,719
These are crimes of

482
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,959
bribery and nepotism.

483
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,400
Are you accountable
for the consequences?

484
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,839
Your duty is to serve the people and

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,119
you're being paid to do so.

486
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,599
Do not oppress the people

487
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,359
and misuse your authority.

488
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,760
Will you blatantly commit a crime,
Lord Xie?

489
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,680
You...

490
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,239
Since Prefect Xie is privately
associated to the plaintiff,

491
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,000
he's not qualified to handle the case.

492
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,280
According to the law,

493
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,199
the case will be presented
to the provincial office.

494
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,479
The case shall be concluded in ten days.

495
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,359
You...

496
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,479
The family fortune dispute of Su Family
will be presented to the province

497
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
and concluded by
the Bureaucrat of Wujiang Prefecture.

498
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,239
Court is dismissed!

499
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,280
Mother.

500
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,839
Lord.

501
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,599
This is great.

502
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,959
My Lord!

503
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,199
Mother.

504
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:40,520
She came right on time.

505
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,959
Madam Su.

506
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:41,520
Father.

507
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,119
Dear.

508
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:43,520
Madam Su.

509
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:43,920
Well...

510
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,439
Madam Su.

511
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,199
Old Madam Su is awake.

512
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:48,920
She's awake?

513
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,560
Yes.

514
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,640
That's really great.

515
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,760
She's finally awake.

516
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,760
Minggu,

517
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,640
hold the prayer today.

518
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:57,520
All right.

519
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,280
Dear,

520
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,719
victory belongs to us now.

521
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,439
Yes.

522
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,520
Xie Ruying.

523
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,239
Do not misunderstand.

524
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,520
I didn't do it to help you.

525
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,079
I know.

526
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,839
I just wanted to thank you.

527
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,880
My father wants to marry
me off to an ill man

528
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,920
in order to secure his promotion.

529
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,839
He intends to ruin my life.

530
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,880
I cannot let him have it all.

531
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,000
Since you're grateful,

532
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,479
do me a favour.

533
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,239
Go ahead.

534
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,719
I'm getting married soon.

535
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,319
I might not be able to
wait for Li Su's return.

536
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,920
After getting married,

537
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,599
it's inappropriate for us to meet again.

538
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,920
I might not be able
to see him ever again.

539
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,839
Please pass this letter to him.

540
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,839
I've admired him for years.

541
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Although my feelings are one-sided and
we're not meant to be together,

542
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,079
I need to express

543
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,880
what's needed.

544
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,460
(Congwen)

545
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,040
All right. I'll definitely help you.

546
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,640
You should be careful.

547
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,280
Although the court case may seem minor,

548
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,599
it's involving many parties.

549
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,959
About the constant banter in the past,

550
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,439
I...

551
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,319
I'm not sorry.

552
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,439
You possess too much.

553
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,040
You have glory, wealth,

554
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,800
love,

555
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,760
and even luck.

556
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,920
It turns my eyes green.

557
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,640
Xie Xiaoman.

558
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:34,959
Remember this.

559
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,959
I hate you.

560
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,040
It hurts.

561
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,319
I can't do this.

562
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:54,760
I can't sit down.

563
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:56,920
Your Highness,

564
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,719
you should stay in your room.

565
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,920
You can neither stand

566
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
nor sit out here.

567
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,040
Shut up.

568
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,040
Your Highness,

569
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,760
they are back.

570
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Help me over.

571
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Take it easy.

572
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,160
Be careful.

573
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,599
Zhao Xiaoqian.

574
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,439
Why are you here?

575
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,319
How many times were you flogged?

576
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,439
Does it hurt?

577
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,439
I'm fine.

578
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm totally fine.

579
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,560
Your husband has a strong build.

580
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Moreover, she's my mother.

581
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
She wouldn't go too far.

582
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,040
Zhao Xiaoqian.

583
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,199
What happened to you?

584
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,479
What do you mean?

585
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,400
My body is completely fine.

586
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,479
By the way,

587
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:37,959
how did everything go?

588
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:38,719
Was it resolved?

589
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,079
The case did not pass under
the county magistrate.

590
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,640
It's been passed on to
the provincial office,

591
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,520
which is

592
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,359
to the hands of Lord Yan.

593
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,359
Really?

594
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,959
That's great!

595
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,880
Of course.

596
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,640
It's time for the future son-in-law

597
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,119
of Su Family to shine.

598
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,119
Isn't that right?

599
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,160
What did you say?

600
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
It hurts.

601
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,359
Go easy on me.

602
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,839
Everyone is watching.

603
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,920
My grandmother has recovered.

604
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,599
Tonight,

605
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,079
stay here for dinner.

606
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
We will be holding

607
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,599
the Winter Solstice Prayer Ceremony
later.

608
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,599
All right.

609
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,560
Don't worry.

610
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,199
We're working together.

611
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,359
Everything will be perfect.

612
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,359
Isn't that right?

613
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,280
Old Madam Su, be careful.

614
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,000
Don't worry.

615
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,199
Watch your step.

616
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:34,640
Mother,

617
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,920
you just recovered.

618
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,319
Don't catch a cold.

619
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:40,920
Actually,

620
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,119
the ceremony

621
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
can be heard in your room.

622
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,479
It's fine.

623
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,280
I enjoy the bustle.

624
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,319
Being here with all of you

625
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,319
makes me happy.

626
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,760
Huazhong.

627
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,760
You loved sugar since you were young.

628
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,359
Open up your mouth.

629
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,920
Why are you crying?

630
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,520
Mother,

631
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm old now.

632
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,599
No matter how old you are,
you are still my beloved daughter,

633
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
my darling.

634
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:40,959
Take this.

635
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,760
Grandmother.

636
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Look at the goddess by the altar.

637
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,880
That's my granddaughter,

638
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,119
Minggu.

639
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,040
In the blink of an eye,

640
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,800
Minggu is now a grown lady.

641
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,760
The ceremony begins.

642
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,760
The glorious heaven

643
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,760
shines upon the land.

644
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,560
Rain upon the land

645
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,439
and grant snow.

646
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,839
Su Wei of Wujiang Prefecture

647
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,560
offer my prayers to the heaven.

648
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,319
Bestow upon the land

649
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,479
the divine grace.

650
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,199
Grant snow

651
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,079
to nourish the earth.

652
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,479
Without the snow,

653
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,199
there'd be no peace.

654
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,359
I offer my prayers to
the heaven and the earth.

655
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,839
It's snowing.

656
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,199
Mother.

657
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,839
It's snowing.

658
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:54,920
Mother.

659
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,000
It's really snowing.

660
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,760
It's an auspicious omen
granted by the heaven.

661
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,239
It's good luck, mother.

662
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,920
You will

663
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,920
recover soon from your illness.

664
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,119
Look,

665
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,439
Minggu is getting married as well.

666
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,160
Su Chang Ji

667
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,119
will open up many more branches.

668
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,560
Everything awaits your call.

669
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
Everything will be fine.

670
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,119
That's great.

671
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,959
The snow has fallen right on time.

672
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,800
For the next whole year,

673
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
everything will

674
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,239
go smoothly for us.

675
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,800
Everything will be fine.

676
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,839
Master,

677
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,920
you've done the impossible.

678
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,760
Listen to me.

679
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,199
After I marry Minggu,

680
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,680
I will

681
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,199
pray for her and her family as well.

682
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,900
(Yan's Mansion)

683
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,280
I came

684
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,400
bearing the message
from Princess Consort Pu.

685
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:58,040
The store of Su Chang Ji should
be given to the right person.

686
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,920
Whatever that is concluded
by the county magistrate,

687
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,199
the provincial office should not object.

688
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,719
I'm sure you're aware

689
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,079
of the consequences.

690
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,920
There's no need for me
to explain further.

691
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,199
I understand.

692
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,479
If that's the case,

693
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,640
I shall excuse myself.

694
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,180
(Yan Nengfu, Bureaucrat of Wujiang)

695
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

696
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,680
The case of Su Family is concluded.

697
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,319
There will be no changes anymore.

698
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
This isn't enough.

699
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,560
How are things going on in the capital?

700
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,760
Don't worry, Your Highness.

701
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,439
We've received the secret letter.

702
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,839
The brother of Lady Xie is Xie Xun.

703
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,880
No matter how arbitrary she acts,

704
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,719
she wouldn't

705
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,920
place her brother's
future and life at stake.

706
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,880
This is Xie Xun's jade.

707
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,520
Principal.

708
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,800
There's news from the authority.

709
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,079
Li Guangwen...

710
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,319
In the capital, Li Guangwen's

711
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,040
possessions have been confiscated.

712
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,640
We...

713
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,079
Bailu Academy

714
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,680
is on the list as well.

715
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,760
(Magistrate Court of Wujiang)

716
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,880
Court shall commence.

717
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,199
Silence.

718
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,839
Lord Yan,

719
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,280
Su Tingshan's claims

720
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,400
that Su Chang Ji belongs
to my late father,

721
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Su Feihuan,

722
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,800
were baseless.

723
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,439
Su Chang Ji is a property

724
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,599
of my mother.

725
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,959
My mother has once stated her will.

726
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,040
There was a witness
to testify the claims.

727
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
The witness is present right now.

728
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,120
Lord Yan.

729
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:22,919
I'm Xie Xiaoman.

730
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,040
On the 28th of last month,

731
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,520
I went to the Residence of the Su Family

732
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,120
to visit Old Madam Su who was ill.

733
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,000
When I was serving her with medication,

734
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,439
I heard that she stated her will.

735
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,520
After her death,

736
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,800
all the properties and
the stores of Su Chang Ji

737
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,959
will be inherited by her daughter,
Su Huazhong

738
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,000
and granddaughter, Su Minggu.

739
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,320
After that, she fell unconscious.

740
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
She was in a critical condition.

741
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,919
However, Old Madam Su
has now regained consciousness.

742
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,479
She has yet to completely recover,

743
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,959
so she's unable to
attend the court personally.

744
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,080
I obtained Old Madam Su's confirmation

745
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
that her will is still valid.

746
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:00,919
Besides, she has also presented

747
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,120
an official will.

748
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,120
After the case is concluded,

749
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,560
she'd submit the written document.

750
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Plaintiff, Su Tingshan,

751
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,120
what else do you have to say?

752
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,040
Lord,

753
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,120
allow me to present the evidence.

754
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,840
This was the agreement of
property distribution between

755
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,120
my late father, Su Feihuan and
his younger brother, Su Feiyun.

756
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
In the document, the ownership

757
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,800
of Su Chang Ji is clearly stated.

758
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,840
How ridiculous.

759
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,360
There wasn't any agreement.

760
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,120
Old Madam Su.

761
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,520
The whole of Su Family,

762
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,280
besides our bloodline,

763
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:59,879
are all idlers who survived
on the inherited wealth.

764
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,879
His brother, Su Feihuan,

765
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,520
sent someone to seek help back then.

766
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,600
My husband was moved by kindness.

767
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,719
He decided to give them some stores

768
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:21,040
and drafted an agreement.

769
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,040
Very soon,

770
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,800
he realised they are incapable
of running any businesses.

771
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,040
All they wanted was money

772
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,959
and to reap without sowing.

773
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:43,000
The agreement of property
distribution did not exist.

774
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:53,840
It must be the wastepaper found
in the study back then.

775
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,600
Old Madam Su,

776
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,120
calm down.

777
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,360
The one Su Feihuan sent over then
to borrow money

778
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
was Su Tingshan.

779
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
Could he have stolen

780
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,479
the drafted documents
of the late master?

781
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,280
He schemed and brooded
over the years

782
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,919
just to do this.

783
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,120
Go

784
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,280
and deliver my message.

785
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,040
There aren't

786
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,080
any seals nor signatures
on the agreement.

787
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,239
Hurry over.

788
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,600
I'll inform Madam Su immediately.

789
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,800
Momo,

790
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,800
help me in.

791
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Fetch me the papers and pen.

792
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,879
Old Madam Su.

793
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,360
I shall speak

794
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,600
while you write.

795
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,600
Huazhong,

796
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,760
my daughter.

797
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,399
My granddaughter,

798
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,719
Minggu.

799
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm aware that

800
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,120
my time has come.

801
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,439
The agreement of property distribution

802
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,120
must have been forged by Su Tingshan!

803
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,760
Yes!

804
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:37,840
It's fake!

805
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,320
I possess

806
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,560
the handwriting of Su Feiyun.

807
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,439
The adviser shall
compare the penmanship.

808
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,360
Yes.

809
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,080
Lord Yan,

810
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,959
I'm the witness to Old Madam Su's will.

811
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,879
Why is my testimony nullified?

812
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,360
Silence!

813
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,600
The court is solemn.

814
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,719
Do not speak when
you're not permitted to.

815
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,000
If the agreement is genuine,

816
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,280
that means,

817
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,120
even if the testimony of
the will was true,

818
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
it will not be considered.

819
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,719
But Old Madam Su is still alive.

820
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,840
If the agreement is genuine,

821
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,280
she would have learned
of this long before.

822
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,360
She wouldn't have left
the property given to others

823
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,600
to her daughter.

824
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,280
That's right.

825
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,360
Yes, Lord Yan.

826
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,879
Silence!

827
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,959
Do not speak when
you're not permitted to.

828
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,120
If you repeat this once more,

829
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,120
you will be cast out.

830
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,100
(Agreement of property distribution)

831
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:33,919
My Lord.

832
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,479
The agreement

833
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,320
was indeed written by Su Feiyun himself.
