<i>Episode 29</i>

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
<i>Everything has changed,
dreaming of going on Fangzhou Road</i>

22
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,879
How impressive.

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,199
That is impressive.

24
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,919
Minggu,

25
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:56,760
check that out.

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,879
That looks fun, too.

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,000
The temples outside the town

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
must be more interesting.

29
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,839
Let's head inside.

30
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:05,800
We can't.

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
The graduates are revealed

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,559
for the first time in the capital today.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,160
It's an important occasion.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,039
If you do not show up,

35
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,960
what happens

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,679
if your husband is abducted?

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,119
Get lost.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,559
Come on! Who wants to be your wife!

39
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,880
It's so crowded.

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,960
How lively.

41
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,360
There are so many fishes.

42
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,360
Can you give me some of the fish feed?

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,759
There you go.

44
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,360
Thank you.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,279
What is Xie Xiaoman doing here?

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,960
We were schoolmates.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,639
I invited her here.

48
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,199
Fellow graduates,

49
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,759
today is the Qionglin Banquet.

50
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,839
By His Majesty's grace,
the Jinming Lake is open to public

51
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,679
in order to celebrate
the scholars who passed the exam.

52
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,240
Instead of focusing
merely on verbal discussion,

53
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,119
in conjunction to the sages
and people of the nation,

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,479
the contention of different schools
of thoughts is encouraged.

55
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,240
Bravo!

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,639
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

57
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,399
Release the banner.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
<i>The stability of the state lies in
benevolent policies, not evoking fear.</i>

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Today's topic is

60
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,679
"the stability of the state

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,639
lies in benevolence, not violence."

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,559
It is coming at you.

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,260
<i>Qionglin Banquet</i>

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,894
<i>The stability of the state lies in
benevolence, not violence.</i>

65
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,000
Allow me

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,440
to voice my humble opinion first.

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
The emphasis on benevolence
instead of violence

68
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,479
in order to defend a state

69
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,160
relies essentially on the wisdom
of sages in governance

70
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,479
instead of strong defense

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,759
and tyrannous rulership.

72
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,639
In ancient times, under the reign
of King Jie of the Sanmiao Tribe,

73
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,559
and the reign of King Zhou of Shang,
during critical times,

74
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,399
although the territories
were fortified,

75
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,119
these rulers

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,359
failed to uphold morality,

77
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,519
failed to implement
effective governance,

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
and failed to protect their people.

79
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,200
In the end,

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,160
their territories were subjugated.

81
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,480
Everyone born in this world

82
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
has people

83
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,720
they care about.

84
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,679
In the War of Baichuankou,

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
of 30,000 soldiers, 10,000 were lost.

86
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,559
A victory gained this way

87
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
evoked agony and anger from the people.

88
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,640
This is unjustified.

89
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,239
Fellow gentleman,

90
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,679
are you addressing the topic
or disparaging others?

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
Do you know that the commander

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
of the War of Baichuankou
is present as well?

93
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,160
Since the Warring States period,
Gongsun Qi

94
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,440
employed military knowledge
and strategies,

95
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,640
assembled remarkable approaches,

96
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,519
and shocked the world.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Despite his brilliant
achievements in war,

98
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,839
the people he killed were countless,

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,839
he was no different from a mass murderer.

100
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,320
Right now,

101
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,040
a certain commander in our empire

102
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,239
is imitating such cruelty and atrocity.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,399
By the excuse of annihilating the enemy,

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
he satiated his blood lust
through the war.

105
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,239
As time passes,

106
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,320
the order and morality of
a nation will be destroyed.

107
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,559
You're full of nonsense!

108
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't take it personally.

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,200
Fellow scholars,

110
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
you're all disciples of the Emperor.

111
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,799
All of your arguments are sound.

112
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,239
However,

113
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,480
it seems like

114
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,920
you've all deviated from the topic.

115
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:32,920
Who are you?

116
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm just here to have fun.

117
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,359
Since you're all disciples
of the Emperor,

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm sure you're tolerant
and broad-minded.

119
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,839
The topic of the discussion is

120
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
we should emphasize benevolence
instead of violence.

121
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,799
However, in my opinion,

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,839
the stability of a nation

123
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,239
lies in both benevolence and violence.

124
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,239
Circumstantial advantages and
the political attitude of people

125
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,839
are different things altogether.

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
Although I'm just a commoner,

127
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,600
I understand that in contention,

128
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,959
there are always two sides.

129
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,519
Marching through war

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,679
is a way to subdue
the world with violence,

131
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,839
yet it's also a manifestation

132
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,200
of strong defense power of a nation.

133
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,079
Just like how the combination

134
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,600
of healers and fighters

135
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,799
leads to the security of a nation.

136
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,799
The one you're going against is me.

137
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,600
As for the discussion of teachings,

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm ignorant.

139
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,480
However, there's one thing I know.

140
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,359
According to the Rites of Zhou,

141
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,839
those who sit in peace
while contemplating policies

142
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,320
are of nobility and royalty.

143
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
Those who implement
policies through action

144
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,399
are the literati.

145
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,959
Do you intend to overthrow
the Zhao Family

146
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,279
and replace us as royalty

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
or do you intend to

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,359
serve the state as a literati?

149
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm rather curious.

150
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,519
Lingniang,

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,799
I'm bored already.

152
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,399
Let's take a stroll by the lake.

153
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,959
All right.

154
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,640
Look at Zhao Xiaoqian.

155
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:09,920
Xiaoman.

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,880
Look at you.

157
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,760
Your Highness' demeanour

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,399
is eminent and incomparable.

159
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,799
Even the Qionglin Banquet
has to succumb to your grandiosity.

160
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,079
Lingniang,

161
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
he proposed to you.

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,880
You must watch out for this man.

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,480
Brother,

164
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,200
don't be ridiculous.

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Watch your mouth.

166
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,119
Xiongjie Camp's reputation

167
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,480
was ruined because of you.

168
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,399
Because of me?

169
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
The public called you a murderer.

170
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Your Highness.

171
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,200
Lady Xie seeks an audience.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,480
This show

173
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,239
has ended even after three years.

174
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,880
If you do not meet me today,

175
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm not going anywhere.

176
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,720
Come with me.

177
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,039
You want to talk to me, right?

178
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,799
What's it?

179
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,159
I...

180
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
I made you knee guards.

181
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,320
During rainy days,

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
if your knees still hurt,

183
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,520
put them on.

184
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,080
They're made with medicinal herbs.

185
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,719
They will get rid of the cold.

186
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,799
My father uses them
when he suffers from arthritis.

187
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,599
Give them a try.

188
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,479
Did you come to see me

189
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,799
for these?

190
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,599
I...

191
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,119
In the end,

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,119
you just wanted to ask me

193
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,359
if I sacrificed over 10,000 of lives

194
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,479
for my greed to attain merits.

195
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,640
I wanted to ask you

196
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,719
what's going on recently.

197
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,919
Why would the Qionglin Banquet

198
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,880
end up this way?

199
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,119
What are you expecting

200
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,960
from me?

201
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,039
Xie Xiaoman.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,159
You're pretty impressive.

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,760
You were the one who
left me in the first place,

204
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,840
yet you come back to me now.

205
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,440
Do you think I need
the knee guards you made?

206
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,000
What I need is women.

207
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,719
What's wrong?

208
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,320
Right now, it's your turn

209
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,200
to beg for my attention.

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Is this what you've become
after three years?

211
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,119
How do you like me now?

212
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:04,880
I like.

213
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,359
I like very much.

214
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,679
Your Highness is splendid.

215
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,719
I'm afraid I can't keep up!

216
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,559
Hanchen.

217
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,679
Bad news.

218
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,960
Chancellor Xu has begun to take action.

219
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,119
I received secret information.

220
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,640
Tonight after the Qionglin Banquet,

221
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,599
they placed an ambush
at Tianshui Alley.

222
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
When you pass through Tianzhu Road,

223
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,559
do not take Tianshui Alley.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,719
I've dispatched the covert guards
to keep you safe.

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Got it.

226
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,080
Why did you invite

227
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,479
Xie Xiaoman over?

228
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,239
I just wanted to catch up with her.

229
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:09,719
- Where is she?
- Be honest!

230
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,039
I genuinely wanted to...

231
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
I just wanted to...

232
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,679
What's wrong?

233
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:23,960
Are you afraid?

234
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,679
Just because you're
the Commandery Princess Rong'an,

235
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,840
don't think I dare not
lay a finger on you.

236
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,880
Let me ask you again.

237
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,000
What's your purpose of inviting

238
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,239
Xie Xiaoman to the Qionglin Banquet?

239
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,599
I wanted to see whether

240
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,359
Commandery Prince of Julu
who asked for my hand in marriage

241
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,640
loves me

242
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,200
or her.

243
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,359
How will you do that?

244
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:50,880
Zipei...

245
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:55,119
Zipei placed some informants
around the entrance.

246
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,119
Hanchen.

247
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,640
Your Highness.

248
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,479
Young lady.

249
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,479
What do you want?

250
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,000
What do we want?

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
What do you think?

252
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,919
After her!

253
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,159
- Hold it right there!
- Do not run!

254
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,280
Hold it!

255
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,679
- Hold it right there!
- Stop running!

256
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,060
<i>Tianshui Alley</i>

257
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,380
<i>Tianshui Alley</i>

258
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,280
Hold her!

259
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,239
- After her!
- Hold it!

260
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:26,799
Hold it right there!

261
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,359
Hurry up!

262
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,799
Stop running!

263
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
- Hold it!
- Stop running!

264
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,359
Do not come near me.

265
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
What?

266
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,359
If we do not go near,

267
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,000
you'd grow

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
impatient.

269
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
I'll kill myself if you get any closer.

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,599
How impressive.

271
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,760
Do you even want a corpse?

272
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,000
Fine.

273
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,159
Give it a try.

274
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,679
Sure.

275
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll give it a try.

276
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,760
Big brother!

277
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,559
Big brother!

278
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,640
Do not make a move!

279
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
Did they hurt you?

280
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,000
No.

281
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,919
Show up in the capital again

282
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,000
and I'll kill all of you.

283
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,640
All right.

284
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Get out of here.

285
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,719
Let's go.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,440
Let's go.

287
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,239
Let's go.

288
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,039
Don't go.

289
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,559
I've helped you.

290
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,479
Why are you holding me?

291
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,960
If you do not explain yourself,

292
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm not going to leave you.

293
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,080
Leave.

294
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,679
I'm asking you to go. Do you hear me?

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,479
You want to know

296
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,760
how I end up like this?

297
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:17,799
Fine.

298
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,280
Try to experience death

299
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,039
at Baichuankou.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,760
Try to experience

301
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,320
how it feels watching over 10,000
of soldiers dying before you.

302
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,479
I returned to secure a wealthy life.

303
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,679
You intend to stop me?

304
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,320
Get over yourself.

305
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,679
You've changed.

306
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,239
We all changed.

307
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,919
So did you.

308
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,359
Get out of my sight.

309
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,640
Zhao Xiaoqian!

310
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,440
Why do you intend to assassinate me?

311
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,760
Zhao Xiaoqian,

312
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
you evil commander!

313
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,559
You have no regards
for the life of others!

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,039
For the over 10,000 of
deceased soldiers at Baichuankou,

315
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,039
I shall avenge

316
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,479
my son!

317
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Return my son to me!

318
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,919
Even in his death,

319
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,840
my son would haunt you forever!

320
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,760
What's the name of your son?

321
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,119
My son is Zhou Shixian!

322
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,799
My son is Zhou Shixian!

323
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,679
Lieutenant of Camp 57, Zhou Shixian.

324
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,280
He served the army for two years.

325
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,960
During the war at Gu City,

326
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,719
he died guarding the city.

327
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,520
Even at the last moment,

328
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,640
your son did not surrender to the enemy.

329
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,679
For my sake,

330
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,840
for the sake of the people,

331
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,840
and for the sake of his father,
he guarded the city.

332
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,239
He was a good soldier.

333
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,400
He was also a good son.

334
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,199
Sir,

335
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,839
you're being used.

336
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
If you'd like to take revenge on me,

337
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,680
hurry up and leave.

338
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,319
Watch out!

339
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm the one they're after.

340
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,160
Run now.

341
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,040
After him!

342
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,560
Hanchen.

343
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,599
Mr. Zhong.

344
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,000
Mr. Zhong.

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,760
A report from the spy.

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
After waylaying at
Tianzhu Road for hours,

347
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,319
His Highness was nowhere to be seen.

348
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm going to dispatch the troop.

349
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,839
Inform Mr. Liangji

350
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,920
to search for His Highness.

351
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:36,719
Yes.

352
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,400
Get on the boat first.

353
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Hold it.

354
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,640
Do not move.

355
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
Put your sword down.

356
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,920
Kneel.

357
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,359
Zhao Xiaoqian.

358
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
There are pursuers on land.

359
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,640
There's an island across the lake.

360
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,839
We may take a breather there.

361
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,839
Are you all right?

Don't worry.

364
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,640
The arteries are unharmed.

365
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,920
The bleeding will stop in a while.

366
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,800
Get some sleep.

367
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,920
When the sun comes out,

368
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
they'd find us.

369
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
You're injured, too?

370
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:49,680
Let me take a look.

371
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,280
It's fine.

372
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,239
Let me take a look.

373
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,359
Who did you offend?

374
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,400
Why are they trying to kill you?

375
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,520
Too many people died

376
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,680
in the war.

377
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,000
Grudges were built against me.

378
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,160
Since they failed to kill me today,

379
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,680
more will come tomorrow.

380
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,160
You should distant yourself.

381
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,400
That's why

382
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,839
you pushed me away.

383
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,760
You're worried of implicating me.

384
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,680
If I do not push you away,

385
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
are you going to stay?

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,880
You're wrong.

387
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,119
I'm not pushing you away on purpose.

388
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,680
It's because you no longer

389
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,880
mean anything to me.

390
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,319
You're lying.

391
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,839
If I mean nothing to you,

392
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,160
why did you save me?

393
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,160
If I mean nothing to you,

394
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,680
you should've abandoned me just now.

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,400
Why did you bring me here?

396
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,920
Don't you get it, Xie Xiaoman?

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,599
In the past,
I loved you more than anything.

398
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,400
That was the past.

399
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,160
Do you live in the past,

400
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,839
Xie Xiaoman?

401
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,040
That's why

402
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,599
you're marrying Shen Zhaowen?

403
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:16,560
Yes.

404
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,119
Do you like her?

405
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,839
Yes.

406
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,079
Look me in the eyes.

407
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,479
Do you truly like her?

408
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes.

409
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,560
You're right.

410
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,079
I've been living in the past.

411
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,839
I'm a great joke.

412
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm being ridiculous.

413
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
I shouldn't have come to look for you.

414
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,439
At this point,

415
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,839
why am I still so pathetic?

416
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,319
Don't worry.

417
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll no longer bother you ever again.

418
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,040
I wish all the happiness for

419
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,439
you and Shen Zhaowen.

420
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,160
Thank you.

421
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,839
Zhao Xiaoqian.

422
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,760
Report!

423
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,800
General,

424
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,119
the second troop sent
a report in the morning.

425
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,319
The provision that was expected to

426
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,680
arrive at Xiliangkou during
wee hours has yet to come.

427
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,719
<i>To General</i>
Great smoke was noted at the west.

428
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,719

00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,119
Xingzhou.

460
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,079
Our return to the capital this time

461
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,199
may invite grave danger.

462
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,599
I might probably die in the capital.

463
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,719
You might, too.

464
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400

00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,119
No.

466
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,800
I do though.

467
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,560
Regarding the loss
of provisions at Baichuankou,

468
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,920
I'll not let that slide.

469
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,640
In order to eliminate
Chancellor Xu and his party,

470
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,800
I must become
the Imperial Grand Governor.

471
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you saying

472
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,439
the evidence could be found
in the magistrate office?

473
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,479
In order to seize
the governance of the capital

474
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,359
and investigate this matter in secret

475
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,520
without their detection,

476
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I have to show them that

477
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,560
I aim at something else.

478
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,359
After the throne?

479
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,319
Become the Imperial Grand Governor,

480
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
request to marry Shen Zhaowen,

481
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,839
openly covet after the throne,

482
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,959
and investigate the correlation
between Chancellor Xu and

483
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,560
the loss of Baichuankou's
provisions covertly.

484
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,439
No, Hanchen.

485
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,400
This is too dangerous.

486
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,479
Not only Chancellor Xu
would eliminate you,

487
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,119
even His Majesty would not allow this.

488
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,319
Xingzhou.

489
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,199
Many lives at Baichuankou

490
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,319
were trusted with me.

491
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,479
I failed to bring them home.

492
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,839
These lives

493
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,199
are debts I have to pay.

494
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:15,760
My life

495
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,000
was long given to Baichuankou.

496
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,119
My life doesn't matter.

497
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,239
You and Xiaoman are different.

498
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,839
You must stay alive.

499
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,400
Find this person for me after
returning to the capital.

500
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,439
Li Guangwen.

501
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,079
After finding him,
leave the capital with Xiaoman.

502
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,119
Do not return no matter what happens.

503
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,959
If I'm still alive,

504
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I'll find you guys.

505
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,839
After this,

506
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,640
I may commit grave crimes.

507
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,560
I'll be penalized by the public.

508
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,160
Perhaps, we may not be
able to enjoy a drink

509
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
just like the old days anymore.

510
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,800
Perhaps...

511
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
Perhaps, I might even hurt her.

512
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,560
However,
I want you to keep this in mind.

513
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,920
I'll always be the Zhao Xiaoqian
you used to know.

514
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,640
If I die,

515
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:11,880
spare

516
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,959
these from her.

517
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
Your Highness!

518
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,839
Hanchen!

519
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,839
Your Highness!

520
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,520
Hanchen!

521
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,079
Hanchen!

522
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,439
Hanchen!

523
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,959
Hanchen!

524
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:05,239
Hanchen!

525
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,880
I'll arrange someone to
pick you up after I leave.

526
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,920
Hanchen!

527
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,560
Hanchen.

528
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,160
Are you all right?

529
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,359
Are you injured?

530
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,280
Xingzhou told me that you were missing.

531
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,280
We searched the entire night for you.

532
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm fine.

533
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,199
Inform Xie Family to pick her up.

534
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,280
Come with me.

535
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,520
You asked me yesterday

536
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,319
if I genuinely want to marry you.

537
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,520
I'll give you my answer today.

538
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,439
Hanchen,

539
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,680
we can talk tomorrow.

540
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,160
In future...

541
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,719
The answer is no.

542
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,319
Everything you've done in the past,

543
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,280
I may let them slide.

544
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,160
Perhaps, I have yet made
things clear to you.

545
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,560
Marrying you

546
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,719
is but a play for power.

547
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,880
I told you this before.

548
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,959
I may repeat myself.

549
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,640
It's only a play for power.

550
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,680
There are no feelings attached.

551
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,479
It was my fault for giving you

552
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,319
the wrong idea.

553
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,359
Hanchen.

554
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,880
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,000
You wondered

556
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,199
whom my heart belongs to.

557
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,040
Today, I can also

558
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,319
tell you the answer clearly.

559
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
It's Xiaoman.

560
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,800
It was her in the past.

561
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,959
It's the same right now.

562
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,160
In the future,

563
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,439
it will still be her.

564
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,479
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,160
Hanchen!

566
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,100
<i>Commandery Prince's Mansion</i>

567
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,040
Hanchen,

568
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,280
this was found on the assassin.

569
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,479
This case has been

570
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,680
reported to the imperial palace.

571
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,100
<i>Grand Chancellor's Mansion</i>

572
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,760
Chancellor Xu wouldn't have thought

573
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,239
that his assassination

574
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,239
would work if I was dead.

575
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm not dead,

576
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,599
so he has done me a favor.

577
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,079
He's shooting himself in the foot.

578
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,719
He has been the grand chancellor
for over 20 years.

579
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,520
I'm afraid he's used to
doing whatever he wants,

580
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,079
but he's going to fail by the hands
of an insignificant man like me.

581
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,000
What are you planning to do?

582
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:03,599
I'm entering the imperial palace

583
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,239
to ask for a position.

584
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,199
Are you planning to
threaten His Majesty?

585
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,599
Are you serious?

586
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,000
Xiaoman.

587
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,439
Congwen.

588
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,319
Are you all right?

589
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm fine.

590
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,959
The boatman is an old friend of mine.

591
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,479
I spoke to him.

592
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,680
He'll not reveal this incident.

593
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,560
Don't worry.

594
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,160
As for the reason you
spent the night out,

595
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,479
I'll not question you either.

596
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,400
However, your family is concerned.

597
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,600
The neighbors may
gossip here and there.

598
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,280
Do not let it affect you.

599
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:15,959
I don't want you

600
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,959
to experience such slander either.

601
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,080
Xiaoman,

602
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,360
will you marry me?

603
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,560
Three years ago,

604
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,000
I missed out on you
due to my indecisiveness.

605
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,360
After three years,

606
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,919
I do not want to repeat
the same mistake again.

607
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,199
Xiaoman.

608
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,959
Marry me.

609
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,800
Allow me to fulfil your dreams.

610
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
We shall leave this place of strife

611
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,239
and live our lives as
regular husband and wife.

612
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,639
Will you say yes?

613
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,879
I'll repeat myself.

614
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
The governance of the capital
belongs to the Crown Prince.

615
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,560
Zhao Xiaoqian.

616
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,080
Are you coveting after my throne?

617
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,399
I dare not.

618
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,360
The Crown Prince is still young.

619
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,280
Chancellor Xu is tyrannous.

620
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm the Commandery Prince of Julu
Your Majesty granted personally.

621
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,439
In broad daylight,

622
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,959
he attempted to assassinate me.

623
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,760
Your Majesty claimed

624
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,760
that I wanted to rob the title
of the Crown Prince.

625
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,679
Your Majesty, don't you know that

626
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,040
they want me dead?

627
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,919
Shut up!

628
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,120
I may keep quiet,

629
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,959
but the soldiers in Baichuankou

630
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,919
will not be able to.

631
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,639
What did you say?

632
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,000
I said,

633
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,919
I may keep quiet,

634
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,080
but if the entire nation learns

635
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,239
that the Emperor of the nation
and the Grand Chancellor in office

636
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,520
would openly assassinate a general

637
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
who just returned after a victory,

638
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,040
the people will not keep quiet!

639
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,120
Your Majesty's reputation
would be at stake.

640
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
The soldiers in Baichuankou

641
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,000
would not let this slide, too!

642
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,760
If you do not want anyone
to find out about this,

643
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,479
please grant me the title
of the Imperial Grand Governor.

644
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,220
<i>Grand Chancellor's Mansion</i>

645
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,000
<i>All shall heed.</i>

646
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,239
<i>By the grace of god and heaven,</i>

647
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,760
<i>for the sake of the greater good,</i>

648
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,479
<i>for the honourable deed
of fighting the enemies</i>

649
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,760
<i>to defend the stability of the state,</i>

650
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,959
<i>such achievement has brought
blessing to the nation,</i>

651
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,520
<i>and secured the foundation
of the state.</i>

652
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,560
<i>My nephew, Xiaoqian,</i>

653
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,439
<i>displays loyalty and bravery.</i>

654
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,760
<i>At the same time, he upholds
the teachings of a gentleman.</i>

655
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,560
<i>He is a great defender of the state,</i>

656
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,479
<i>with merits of quelling
the war by the borders.</i>

657
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,360
<i>Alas,</i>

658
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,760
<i>a secure state brings peace.</i>

659
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,760
<i>The state's reputation
ought to be upheld.</i>

660
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,239
<i>I know my son well.</i>

661
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,439
<i>With a clear conscience
towards the forefathers,</i>

662
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,639
<i>Xiaoqian shall be promoted as

663
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,600
<i>All shall heed the imperial edict.</i>

664
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,760
Lady Shen.

665
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,159
You might injure yourself.

666
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,639
He said it!

667
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
He has no feelings for me.

668
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,479
He only has feelings for Xie Xiaoman.

669
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,959
Even if I'm injured,

670
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,719
nobody would care.

671
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,600
Since Zhao Xiaoqian

672
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,199
does not care about my feelings,

673
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,360
he can't blame me for being ruthless.

674
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,239
I refuse to believe,

675
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,919
for the sake of Xie Xiaoman,

676
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,040
he'd...

677
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,399
He'd make Shen Family an enemy

678
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,159
at a moment like this.

679
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,380
<i>Su Chang Ji</i>

680
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,239
Get out of the way!

681
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Get out of here!

682
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,239
Get lost!

683
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Officer!

684
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,239
Shut the place down.

685
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,399
Officer.

686
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,040
Let's talk it out.

687
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
What are you doing?

688
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,360
Su Chang Ji can no longer
open the store here.

689
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,760
What?

690
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,959
Why not?

691
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,239
Who do you think you are?

692
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,600
Su Chang Ji has

693
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
signed a contract.

694
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,239
You can't violate
the terms just like that.

695
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:53,959
Are you the shopkeeper?

696
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,760
Yes, I am.

697
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,919
Officer.

698
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:56,919
It's me.

699
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,399
I'm the shopkeeper.

700
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
She's my daughter.

701
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,080
You may speak to me.

702
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,760
A few days ago,
Commandery Princess Rong'an

703
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,360
bought some silk from your store.

704
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,439
She claimed the goods to be fake.

705
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,919
That's impossible!

706
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:08,879
We...

707
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,520
We would never sell fake silk.

708
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,679
We're Su Chang Ji of Wujiang Prefecture.

709
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,520
I'm sure you've heard.

710
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,760
It must be a misunderstanding.

711
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,280
Arrest him!

712
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:17,760
Move it!

713
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,639
- Officer!
- Father!

714
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,199
- Officer!
- Father!

715
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,760
Minggu!

716
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:22,120
- Let's talk it out!
- Release my father!

717
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,199
Do not resort to violence!

718
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,879
You're abusing your power

719
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,399
and bullying the commoners!

720
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,879
You accuse Su Chang Ji
of selling fake silk!

721
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,360
Check it yourself!

722
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,199
There isn't any fake silk!

723
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:29,879
Go ahead!

724
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,040
Commandery Princess Rong'an
said the goods are fake.

725
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,239
You can't

726
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,080
possibly deny that.

727
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,620
<i>To Xie Fu An</i>

728
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,639
