<i>Su Chang Ji</i>

23
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,599
Look.

24
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,720
The material is pretty good, isn't it?

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,559
Yes, it is.

26
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:47,360
Let me measure on you.

27
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,160
I'll make you some garments later.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,680
You should leave it for yourself.

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,239
Don't worry about it.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,400
Xiaoman!

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,519
Mother!

00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,319
What's the matter?

00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,839
Mother!

Father

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,120
was arrested by the magistrate.

39
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,320
Su Chang Ji is alleged
of selling fake silk.

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,160
How ridiculous.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Su Chang Ji would never
produce fake silk.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,639
What's going on?

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,479
Shen Zhaowen was behind it.

45
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,440
They claimed that

46
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,160
Commandery Princess Rong'an

47
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,080
purchased fake silk from our store.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,919
That's why she sent guards
to shut the store down

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
and arrested father.

50
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,440
She left this for you.

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,940
<i>Meet me at Fengyue Tavern at 1:45 p.m.

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
She's doing this to aggravate me.

53
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,039
I'm going to meet her right now.

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,559
You should go.

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,119
Hurry up.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,119
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

57
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:55,759
Don't worry.

58
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,720
The silk produced by Su Chang Ji

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,399
is indeed finer than other stores.

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,039
Shen Zhaowen!

61
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:09,720
Hold it!

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,119
Shen Zhaowen!

63
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,679
You're not allowed to enter!

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,880
Let her in.

65
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,720
- Let go!
- Let go!

66
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,039
You're distorting the facts

67
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,720
and oppressing the innocent.

68
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,720
The taxpayers don't pay tribute
to you, Commandery Princess Rong'an,

69
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,160
to allow you

70
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,240
to oppress us.

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
I oppress you.

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,119
What can you do?

73
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,119
I...

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,639
What do you want?

75
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,320
It's always easy to talk to you.

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,279
It's been many years.

77
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,600
You and I can finally treat
each other with honesty.

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,039
To be honest, there's nothing I want.

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,639
I just want you to know

80
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,360
that Hanchen and I are getting married.

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
To be frank,

82
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,679
you were in love before.

83
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,440
I feel uneasy.

84
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,960
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Why would you pester him then?

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,440
What I want is rather simple.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm aware that Li Congwen
has feelings for you.

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,000
If you're willing to marry Li Congwen,

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,639
perhaps that would put my mind at ease.

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
When I'm at ease,

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Hanchen would be happy as well.

92
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,600
No trouble would befall
Shopkeeper Meng.

93
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,880
Is this your will?

94
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,359
Currently, Shopkeeper Meng

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,880
is being detained at the
local government office.

96
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,239
Hanchen is the Imperial Grand Governor.

97
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,559
What do you think?

98
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,799
Hanchen also said,

99
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,239
if you're willing,

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,440
he'd offer endowment

101
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,480
to sever the ties

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,959
between you.

103
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,839
Let me ask you again.

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,559
Did Zhao Xiaoqian really say so?

105
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,320
Xiaoman, what are you doing?

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,760
Calm down.

107
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,239
Yes.

108
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,200
What do you think you're doing?

109
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,040
You...

110
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:46,880
Xiaoman.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,399
Guards!

112
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,119
Let me go!

113
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,720
Xiaoman.

114
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,079
Let me go!

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
I warned you a long time ago.

116
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,519
The capital is a complicated place.

117
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,760
There is no place

118
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
for a common folk like you.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,959
You insisted on coming here.

120
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
When you're hurt,

121
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,239
you seek to take revenge
against the powerful.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,119
When you're crushed to death,

123
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,920
you will not be able
obtain the justice you seek.

124
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
Isn't that right?

125
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,079
What if I insist on taking revenge?

126
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,160
I've arrested Meng Hanru today,

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,079
I can do the same to you tomorrow.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,880
Xie Xiaoman.

129
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
You're too naive.

130
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,399
Pride will do you no good.

131
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,200
Nobody would take the grudges
of the insignificant

132
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,200
seriously.

133
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,559
Xiaoman.

134
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,480
I need to talk to Zhao Xiaoqian.

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,020
<i>Commandery Prince's Mansion</i>

136
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>Admission Record Documents</i>

137
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,640
Something happened.

138
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,320
Xiaoman...

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
What happened to Xiaoman?

140
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,720
Nothing.

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
It's fortunate that you managed to
seize the governance of the capital.

142
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,559
Past records of the incident
are kept in the office.

143
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,920
I divided them into three parts.

144
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,640
On the right are the records
of provision distribution.

145
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,760
All the relevant admission documents

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,160
from the capital to Baichuankou
are there.

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,760
On the left

148
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,880
are the audit files
of Jingdong and Jingxi Roads.

149
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,200
What about the bank of Li Guangwen?

150
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,480
Did you investigate it?

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,679
Yes,

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,119
but there aren't any
suspicions detected yet.

153
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,079
The bank is a personal property
of Li Guangwen.

154
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,040
I suspect that the ledger
is already destroyed.

155
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,760
Are you implying that the accounts
of both Jingdong and Jingxi Roads

156
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,359
are related to Li Guangwen?

157
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,799
The accounts of
Jingdong and Jingxi Roads

158
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,679
must be related to the bank.

159
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,799
Li Guangwen was an important
member of Xu's party then.

160
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,640
He was relegated due to his corruption.

161
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,799
Xu Huan terminated his right-hand man

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
and kicked Li Guangwen out.

163
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,600
Without the involvement of Li Guangwen,

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,119
the operation to embezzle the funds
through Jingdong and Jingxi Roads

165
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,119
shows clear deficit very soon.

166
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,839
That's why

167
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,279
they decided to use military funds
to fill the shortages.

168
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,640
Today...

169
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Your Highness.

170
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,320
Lady Xie seeks an audience.

171
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,559
Tell her I'm not home.

172
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,239
Zhao Xiaoqian.

173
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,480
Zhao Xiaoqian, come out here right now.

174
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,440
Please give me a moment.

175
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
My uncle is a law-abiding citizen.

176
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,320
He has been operating his business
with clear conscience.

177
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,959
He's being accused.

178
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,320
Su Chang Ji would never
produce fake silk.

179
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,040
Zhao Xiaoqian,

180
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,320
please help us out.

181
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,119
Lady Xie,

182
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,239
His Highness is not in at the moment.

183
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,559
Zhao Xiaoqian, come out here.

184
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,480
Listen to me.

185
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,519
I was told

186
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,119
you're now the Imperial Grand Governor
of the capital.

187
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,119
My uncle is being detained
at your office right now.

188
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,279
My father doesn't know anything.

189
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,959
He didn't do anything wrong.

190
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,880
My father is being accused.

191
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,119
Zhao Xiaoqian, please save him.

192
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,239
I'm begging you.

193
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,040
He's innocent.

194
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,679
I'm begging you.

195
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
Please help us out.

196
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,279
The magistrate received
a new case today.

197
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,160
Su Chang Ji sold fake silk.

198
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,760
The person in custody

199
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,119
is Meng Hanru.

200
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,519
The plaintiff is
Commandery Princess Rong'an.

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,679
She

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,559
wants the union of
Xiaoman and Li Su.

203
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,079
Is this what you wanted
to tell me just now?

204
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
Zhao Xiaoqian, sober up.

205
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,880
It's not the time to get
involved in this case.

206
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,280
Mr. Liangji.

207
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm begging you.

208
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,119
Please lend us a hand.

209
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,719
Yes.

210
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,840
If you refuse,

211
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,960
my uncle is old,

212
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,440
and he can't endure such a plight.

213
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,239
Mr. Liangji.

214
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:46,799
Well...

215
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,719
I'm begging you.

216
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,960
Lady Xie.

217
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,320
Lady Xie, please stop making a scene.

218
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,000
If you continue on like this,

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,960
I have no choice

220
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,479
but to send for the guards.

221
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,440
He's unwilling to meet me,

222
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,159
isn't he?

223
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,520
Zhao Xiaoqian, you rascal!

224
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,000
Let me go.

225
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,359
Hanchen.

226
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,599
Did you forget

227
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,679
the oath you swore
back at Baichuankou?

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,559
You asked me to help to defeat Xu Huan.

229
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,880
We finally

230
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,960
made it this far

231
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,280
and obtained the governance
of the capital.

232
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,960
We can finally investigate
the case of the lost provisions.

233
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,039
If you offend Shen Zhaowen right now

234
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,719
and expose yourself,

235
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,400
the evidence we collected today

236
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,159
would vanish by tomorrow.

237
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,960
Shen Zhaowen knew
the marriage was a hoax.

238
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Why would she corner me?

239
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,479
I know.

240
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,719
However, what can we do?

241
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,719
We are at the crucial moment.

242
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,400
Hanchen.

243
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,000
One more step

244
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,239
and we can uncover the collusion

245
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,599
between the bank and the provisions.

246
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,679
We can finally

247
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,960
obtain the evidence of
Xu Huan's corruption.

248
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,280
It's Xie Xiaoman we're talking about!

249
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Lord Zhao,

250
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,400
please reconsider your priorities.

251
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,159
You advanced step by step

252
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,239
and finally made it this far.

253
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,039
For the sake of investigation,

254
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,080
you endured the infamy
of coveting the throne

255
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,479
and took over the governance
of the capital.

256
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,000
You requested Shen Zhaowen
to be betrothed to you

257
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
all for the sake of

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,039
convincing Xu Huan that
you're after the throne

259
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,760
instead of the investigation.

260
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Right now,

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,359
if you turn against Shen Zhaowen,

262
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,159
by Xu Huan's cunningness,

263
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,320
your true goal would
be revealed to him.

264
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,000
In the time to come,

265
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,320
we will be stuck.

266
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,520
The case of Baichuankou
will never be resolved.

267
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
All you want is for me to marry Li Su.

268
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,000
You just want me

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,080
to give up on you.

270
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,159
Fine.

271
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,080
I admit defeat.

272
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll marry him.

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,919
I'll marry him!

274
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,760
Why did he refuse to meet me?

275
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,640
Fine.

276
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,599
Convey my message to him.

277
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,679
If that's the case,

278
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,760
we will never meet again.

279
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,599
Xiaoman.

280
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,340
<i>Commandery Prince's Mansion</i>

281
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,559
Meng Hanru is imprisoned.

282
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
No visitors allowed.

283
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,159
Keep him safe during
this period of time.

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll deal with

285
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,960
Shen Zhaowen.

286
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,080
Mother.

287
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,679
Father would return safe and sound.

288
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,919
Sister-in-law.

289
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,400
You should eat something.

290
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,599
Mother.

291
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,599
Have some congee.

292
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,280
Here.

293
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,080
Here.

294
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,340
<i>Studio of Artlessness</i>

295
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,940
<i>No evidence was found</i>

296
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,100
<i>From the investigation of
Jingdong and Jingxi Roads</i>

297
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:19,878
<i>Shuozhou</i>

298
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,159
Are these the evidences you found?

299
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,520
Everyone believed that
I was after the throne.

300
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,159
I'm afraid that
even Your Majesty thought so as well.

301
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,479
However,
I came back for only one reason,

302
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,640
to avenge the wronged death
of the soldiers at Baichuankou.

303
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,000
There weren't wronged
deaths at Baichuankou.

304
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,479
You won the war as well.

305
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,880
The governance of the capital
was given to you.

306
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,880
What else do you want?

307
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,919
A year ago,

308
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
General Xu Zi and I

309
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,039
were suppressing the enemy
at Baichuankou.

310
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,599
Your Majesty approved the
military provisions of 300,000 piculs

311
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,320
to be delivered to Baichuankou.

312
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,080
Among the batch,

313
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,640
200,000 piculs were burned

314
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,359
and destroyed by the fire at Shuozhou.

315
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
General Xu Zi and I

316
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,679
led the Xiongjie Army at Baichuankou

317
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,080
and fought the war with the limited
100,000 piculs left for half a year.

318
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,119
We finally cast the enemy
out of our borders.

319
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,840
However, the mere 100,000 piculs
of provisions

320
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,039
weren't sufficient to feed
the brothers at Baichuankou.

321
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
10,000 of our soldiers died.

322
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,359
Some of them were

323
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,320
starved to death on the battlefield.

324
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,239
Although

325
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,640
victory was seized,

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,760
it was a great lost.

327
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,159
The transporting officers
of military provisions

328
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,799
were all dead. There were
no witnesses to testify.

329
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,080
Among the 200,000 piculs,

330
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,760
they weren't provisions

331
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,119
but hay instead.

332
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Zhao Xiaoqian.

333
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you know how much trouble

334
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,080
this statement will cause?

335
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Three years ago,

336
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,559
Li Guangwen was relegated
due to his involvement in corruption.

337
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,760
A year ago,

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,119
Your Majesty ordered to inspect the
accounts of Jingdong and Jingxi Roads.

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,280
That corrupt, Xu Huan,

340
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,799
embezzled all the funds involved.

341
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,640
Your Majesty, are you unaware of

342
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,799
how the deficits of the accounts
were suddenly made up for?

343
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,400
Why did the 200,000 piculs
worth of provisions

344
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,599
are hay?

345
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,000
Why would Xu Huan behave this brazenly?

346
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,239
Xu Huan has been
indicted over the years,

347
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,440
but the officials who
charged him of misconduct

348
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,039
were either exiled

349
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
or executed.

350
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,799
Everyone knows

351
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,960
Xu Huan cannot be investigated.

352
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,919
If they get to the bottom of this,

353
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,359
the Crown Prince would be implicated.

354
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,159
Zhao Xiaoqian.

355
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,280
Your Majesty,

356
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,760
isn't that right?

357
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,559
Your Majesty, are you aware of

358
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,359
the money that came from

359
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,239
the corruption of the two roads

360
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,280
did not only go into
the pocket of Chancellor Xu,

361
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,599
but also

362
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,959
the pocket of the Crown Prince.

363
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,400
Zhao Xiaoqian!

364
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
I've uncovered the truth!

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,839
All the evidences are
listed in the memorial!

366
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,199
I beg for Your Majesty
to get to the bottom of this!

367
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,380
<i>Memorial to the throne</i>

368
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
What about your witnesses?

369
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,319
Do you have the witnesses?

370
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,040
These are serious accusations.

371
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Without witnesses,

372
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,640
according to the law,

373
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
the investigation is nullified.

374
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,520
Your Majesty.

375
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
You're dismissed.

376
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,079
I'll pretend like

377
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,880
I've never heard this.

378
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,280
Your Majesty.

379
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,599
During the War of Baichuankou,
because of the lack of provisions,

380
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,719
many have died.

381
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,239
Everyone claimed that I
sacrificed lives for my pride.

382
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,119
However, the true perpetrator

383
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,239
is Xu Huan who led the Crown Prince

384
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,680
to swallow the state
Your Majesty built gradually.

385
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,560
Your Majesty,

386
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,079
the country is falling apart.

387
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,680
Your Majesty, are you going to leave it?

388
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,119
Did the soldiers who offered
their lives to guard the state

389
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
deserve to starve to death?

390
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
<i>Memorial to the throne</i>

391
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:11,839
Your Majesty,

392
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,079
you knew about this a long time ago,
right?

393
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:15,959
You were planning

394
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,640
to suppress this case

395
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,199
because the thief got
the Crown Prince implicated.

396
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:22,760
Fine.

397
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
Fine.

398
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,479
Xu Huan is brilliant.

399
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,880
Xu Huan is brilliant.

400
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,280
This party that consists of
the corrupted and perverse,

401
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,760
despite the sufferings of the people,

402
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:34,880
the invasion of the state,

403
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,119
no one could put the party to justice!

404
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,439
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

405
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,800
Get out of here!

406
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,040
I beg for Your Majesty to reinvestigate
the case of Baichuankou!

407
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:44,359
Guards!

408
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,119
Seize him!

409
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:47,839
Your Majesty,

410
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,319
the nation is falling apart.

411
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,439
Your Majesty,

412
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
the nation is falling apart.

413
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:52,959
The nation is falling apart!

414
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,359
Brat!

415
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:53,880
The nation is falling apart!

416
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,160
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

417
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,239
How dare you go against me?

418
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,079
Submit him to flogging!

419
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:57,599
Your Majesty!

420
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,359
Flog him!

421
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,839
The nation is falling apart!

422
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,239
Your Majesty!

423
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,000
Flog him!

424
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,119
Flog him!

425
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,439
Move it!

426
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,439
He will be flogged 20 times!

427
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,280
Your Majesty!

428
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,119
Why did Your Highness
go against His Majesty?

429
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,119
Today is the engagement of Xiaoman.

430
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,599
I beg your pardon, Your Highness?

431
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,000
Today

432
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,040
is the engagement of Xiaoman.

433
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,359
This servant is treated like a princess.

434
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,880
I even have to take care of you.

435
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,719
Rascal.

436
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,079
Rascal.

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,880
You...

438
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,839
You're so mean.

439
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,760
Please let me go.

440
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,719
I'll resolve everything!

441
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,560
I disagree!

442
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,160
<i>There's only one Zhao Xiaoqian</i>

443
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,079
<i>who'd love you above everything else.</i>

444
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,239
That's my whole life!

445
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,359
My whole life!

446
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,119
Two years.

447
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,479
I do!

448
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,839
<i>Zhao Xiaoqian,</i>

449
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,640
<i>it's not supposed to end up like this.</i>

450
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,160
<i>You're a man of ambitions.</i>

451
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,160
<i>There are things you want to do.</i>

452
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,239
Your Highness.

453
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,359
Your Highness.

454
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,839
The altitude of Baichuankou is high
on the west and low on the east.

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,119
Zhending Prefecture is on the left.

456
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,359
Hebei Road is on the right.

457
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,479
It's a strategic land

458
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,599
essential to all the states.

459
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:18,119
By the end of Han Dynasty,

460
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Huangfu Song defeated the Yellow
Turban Rebels at Xiaquyang County.

461
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,239
He captured over tens of thousands

462
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,839
and renamed it Gu City

463
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:28,439
at southwest.

464
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,560
Your Highness.

465
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:37,880
I

466
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,119
will fight till the end.

I've implicated you.

I'm sorry.

476

I'm fine.

Don't worry.

Xiaoman.

After a while,

480
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,319
Shopkeeper Meng will be released.

481
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,680
I know you're upset,

482
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,119

Eat it while it's hot.

484
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,719
Aren't you mad at me?

485
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,959
You should eat.

486
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:08,920
I'll get back to work.

487
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,680

do not push your luck.

00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,280
Your Highness.

535
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,880
Can you please stop
pestering my daughter?

Please just let her live

537
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,479
okay?

I'm begging you.

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,199
Yes, Your Highness.

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,079
Zhao Xiaoqian.

541
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,359
Let Xie Xiaoman go at once.

542
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,599
You pushed her

543
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,800
to the corner.

544
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,760
What else do you want?

545
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,239
Let her go.

546
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,119
I don't want to.

547
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
I can't.

548
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,760
My apologies.

549
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,119
Let go!

550
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,560
Hanchen.

551
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:00,839
Get out of the way.

552
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,959
What's wrong with you?

553
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,599
Hanchen.

554
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,920
Put the sword down.

555
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,079
Calm down.

556
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,520
Let go of Xiaoman

557
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,839
and I'll move.

558
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,319
Today is the day of my engagement
with Xiaoman.

559
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,000
You can't take her away.

560
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,280
Are you willing to die for it?

561
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,719
Are you done?

562
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,239
Calm down.

563
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,079
Zhao Xiaoqian.

564
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,079
Watch out!

565
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,920
You can't do this!

566
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
No!

567
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:43,880
Xiaoman.

568
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,560
- Put me down!
- Whoever tries to follow us

569
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,319
shall die!

570
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,119
- Zhao Xiaoqian!
- Hanchen!

571
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,800
Hanchen! Minggu.

572
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,680
After them!

573
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,280
Let's go.

574
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,680
Hurry up!

575
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,359
Watch out!

576
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,599
After them!

577
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,479
Let me go at once.

578
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,520
Let me go.

579
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,319
Stop moving around.

580
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,599
Let me go.

581
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,839
You're terrible!

582
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,760
Yes, I'm terrible.

583
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,560
You're shameless!

584
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,959
Yes, I'm shameless.

585
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
What do you want?

586
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,839
What do you want actually?

587
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,040
I said it.

588
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,359
I stopped the engagement.

589
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,319
Let me go. Let me go.

590
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,199
Let me go now.

591
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,199
That night wasn't a dream,

592
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,719
was it?

593
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,400
No.

594
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,880
Rascal!

595
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,319
Yes.

596
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,319
You refused to see me.

597
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
You even locked my uncle up.

598
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,160
You wanted me to...

599
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,760
Let me go.

600
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,439
I wasn't involved in all that you said.

601
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,640
I never wanted you
to marry someone else.

602
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,839
Due to some circumstances,
I can't step up.

603
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,800
However, I can now.

604
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,199
Are you willing to trust me once more?

605
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,079
I have a condition though.

606
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,199
You have to marry me.

607
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,439
Marry you?

608
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,119
Marry you as your concubine again?

609
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,000
Half a year.

610
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,119
Give me half a year.

611
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:52,959
I'll give you

612
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,160
a rightful title.

613
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,280
In your dreams!

614
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,239
You love me, don't you?

615
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,079
You love me, don't you?

616
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,599
You want to spend the rest
of your life with me, don't you?

617
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,760
As long as I'm still alive,

618
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,719
you belong to me alone.

619
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,680
You're mine

620
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
be life or death.

621
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,040
Do you understand, Xie Xiaoman?

622
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,680
No.

623
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm not marrying you.

624
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,680
Cut the crap.

625
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

626
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,719
Come back here, Zhao Xiaoqian.

627
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,079
Zhao Xiaoqian!

628
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,400
Zhao Xiaoqian, where are you?

629
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,319
Xiaoman.

630
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,680
I'll save your uncle.

631
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll protect Su Chang Ji.

632
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
As long as I'm here,

633
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,119
no one could harm your family.

634
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,040
I'll use the geese eggs as my endowment.

635
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
From today onwards,

636
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,439
you're my wife.

637
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,800
That's all.

638
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,079
During this period of time,

639
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,560
get ready.

640
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,920
I'll marry you in a few days.

00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,199
Maoya!

659
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,719
Maoya!

660
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,680
Xiaoman!

661
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,839
- Maoya!
- Xiaoman!

662
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:22,920
She's over there!

663
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Xiaoman.

664
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,800
Maoya.

665
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,439
Xiaoman.

666
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,599
Are you all right?

667
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,400
Did he harm you in any way?

668
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's go home.

669
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,800
That gave me a scare.

670
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,319
Let's go.

671
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,359
Let's go.

672
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,839
He said he will save my uncle

673
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,359
only if I marry him.

674
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,400
Hence,

675
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
what do you want to do?

676
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,199
I told him I refuse to marry him.

677
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,600
But when he handed

678
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,000
the geese eggs to me,

679
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,199
I...

680
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,560
We separated before

681
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,600
due to the differences in status.

682
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,120
Too many people were
implicated because of us.

683
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm a mere commoner.

684
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm not worthy to be the wife
of the Commandery Prince

685
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
granted by His Majesty.

686
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
However, when I saw him again,

687
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
I realized that

688
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:42,439
I've not forgotten about him.

689
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,120
I love Zhao Xiaoqian.

690
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,479
I love him very much.

691
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,479
No matter who he is,

692
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,719
no matter who I am,

693
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,800
I just want to spend
the rest of my life with him.

694
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,520
If he didn't come today,

695
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,639
perhaps my feelings

696
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,879
would have been buried deep in my heart.

697
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
However, I know that

698
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,520
Zhao Xiaoqian must be

699
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,320
involved in something

700
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,800
extremely dangerous.

701
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,959
Although I do not know what it is,

702
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,719
I know

703
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,479
if I do not stay by his side,

704
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,719
in the future,

705
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,280
I'll no longer be able to.

706
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,040
Congwen.

707
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,879
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,239
Actually, deep in your heart,

709
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,679
you've already made your decision.

710
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,239
When Lady Shen threatened you
to marry me,

711
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,159
I asked for your hand in marriage.

712
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,479
You told me that

713
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,879
the marriage was but an arrangement.

714
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,479
I knew then

715
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,600
that you've made up your mind.

716
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,959
You'd never

717
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,199
truly become my wife.

718
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,479
Why would you help me then?

719
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,719
Even if you knew I wouldn't
marry you in the end,

720
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,199
you're still willing to do so?

721
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,600
Because I love you, Xiaoman.

722
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,120
However, I know

723
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,919
that your heart doesn't belong to me.

724
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,199
I can't help it.

725
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I love you.

726
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,199
That's why I'm concerned about you.

727
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,840
I'm concerned about your uncle.

728
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm concerned how your parents
would be implicated.

729
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,439
I'm concerned the academy
may not be able to keep you.

730
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,719
I thought, by proposing,

731
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,679
even if you're unwilling
to marry me in the future,

732
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,719
at least you will be safe.

733
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,679
Perhaps,

734
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,199
my heart still bears a slight hope

735
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,159
that one day,

736
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,479
you will realize my feelings for you.

737
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,040
It doesn't matter.

738
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:55,840
Your heart belongs to him,

739
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,560
just like my heart belongs to you.

740
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,320
Even if there are
thousands of enemies ahead,

741
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,199
I'll stand before you and protect you,

742
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,840
just like how you'd stand
before him to protect him.

743
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,719
Isn't that right?

744
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,719
Back then at Yuyangli Village,

745
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,919
who could have thought

746
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,360
that I'd fall deeply in love with you?

747
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,719
Go on.

748
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,679
If he mistreats you in the future,

749
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,199
you can always come back to me.

750
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,199
No matter where you are,

751
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,919
no matter what happens,

752
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:28,919
I'll always be there for you.

753
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,840
Congwen.

754
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,439
I've made my decision.

755
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,520
However, do not worry.

756
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,840
No matter what happens,

757
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,719
I will take it.

758
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,679
His promises do not matter.

759
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,719
My marriage

760
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,560
isn't a deal.

761
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:13,719
Your Highness.

762
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,879
Lady Xie submitted
an appeal for the case.

763
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,320
I said I'll help her out.

764
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,580
<i>I'm willing to follow the rules.</i>

765
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>I marry you because of love,
not for other reasons</i>

766
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,399
Lingniang.

767
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,360
Previously, Hanchen and I told you

768
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,520
not to take this marriage seriously.

769
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,080
It is all but a hoax.

770
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,080
Why...

771
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,679
Why can't you let it go?

772
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,199
Over the years,

773
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,080
have I waited for nothing?

774
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,080
Hanchen has wronged you in this.

775
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,639
If your reputation is
affected in any way,

776
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,320
I'll make him pay.

777
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,719
However,

778
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,719
you should let

779
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,439
the marriage go.

780
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,360
Father. Mother.

781
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:05,520
Please have tea.

782
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:30,719
Xiaoman,

783
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,000
after marriage,

784
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,199
you must respect your in-laws.

785
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:38,199
Get along with His Highness.

786
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,439
Love and respect each other.

787
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,719
Look at you.

788
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,919
Why do you insist on
implicating yourself?

789
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,360
Look at our origins.

790
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,520
Getting yourself involved

791
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,959
will only hurt you

792
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,040
with nothing left to spare.

793
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:56,719
Mother.

794
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,439
It's an auspicious day.

795
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,639
Don't bring these up.

796
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,479
I'm doing this willingly.

797
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,360
Mother.

798
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,199
I know you're worried about me.

799
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,040
I know

800
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,959
how complicated it is
to enter the household.

801
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
I'm used to creating troubles.

802
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,719
Please allow me to behave
arbitrarily for the last time.

803
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,199
The Commandery Prince's Mansion
is a significant household.

804
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,320
After marrying over,

805
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,679
you must watch your words
and your behaviour.

806
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,719
Keep your temper under control,
understand?

807
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,040
Since you're marrying him,

808
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,399
make sure to live happily.

809
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,080
Communication is key
to a happy marriage.

810
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,919
I understand, mother.

811
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,000
The groom is probably getting impatient.

812
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,399
The band is playing to receive you.

813
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,199
Make him wait a little longer.

814
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,919
It's not that easy

815
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,320
to receive the bride.

816
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:02,840
All right.

817
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,959
Xiaoman.

818
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,360
Go on.

819
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,919
Go on.

820
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:21,879
Maoya.

821
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,719
This time,

822
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:26,479
are you going to regret this?

823
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,239
No.

824
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,120
All right.

825
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,199
As long as you're happy,

826
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:36,879
I'm at ease.
