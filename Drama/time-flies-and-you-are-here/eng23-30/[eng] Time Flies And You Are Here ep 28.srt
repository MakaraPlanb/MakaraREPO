21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
The journey is long, hoping that the
wind will blow me to the eastern ocean

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,100
Baichuankou

23
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,120
Hanchen.

24
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,319
Did you receive any news?

25
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,239
Just like you thought.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,080
300,000 piculs of provisions
were destroyed in the fire.

27
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,120
200,000 piculs were hay.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,279
None of the transporting officials survived.

29
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,440
Right now,

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,559
it's another unsolved case.

31
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,039
At the capital,

32
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,000
Grand Secretariat Qin is

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,119
investigating this case covertly.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,039
According to the letter,

35
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,360
apparently...

36
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,960
A year ago,

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,600
His Majesty inspected the accounts of

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,479
both Jingxi and Jingdong.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,279
The funds meant for military salaries

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,919
were used to

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,960
make up for the deficits
by the officials.

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,880
As for the reason both
treasuries were empty,

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,679
I'm afraid only
Grand Chancellor Xu knows.

44
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,199
Besides that...

45
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:39,639
Spill it.

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,119
The Crown Prince is involved as well.

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
The Crown Prince is still young.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,679
He had no idea that he's being used.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
However, Noble Consort Cao

50
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,039
watched idly

51
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,279
while the heir to the throne

52
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,679
was made into pest.

53
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,919
What's your plan?

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,639
Grand Chancellor Xu
involved the Crown Prince

55
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,039
to protect himself.

56
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,160
Even if His Majesty
intends to investigate

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,119
and finds out the truth,

58
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,320
His Majesty has no choice
but to let it slide.

59
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,720
This geezer

60
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,679
made the Crown Prince
his chess piece.

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,600
If the title of Crown Prince
was given to someone else,

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,559
what could he do?

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Excuse me.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,279
Make way.

65
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,520
Make way.

66
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,520
Mr. Liu.

67
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:39,839
Douzi, hurry up.

68
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,520
Find it.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm trying.

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,720
Please be patient.

233rd, Yan Boyang

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,479
Master!

76
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,160
You got it!

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Where?

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
There!

79
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,639
You attained the 233rd place!

80
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,199
I passed!

81
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,500
Yan Boyang

82
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,199
I passed the imperial examination!

83
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,320
Mr. Liu, did you see that?

84
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,440
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Thank you.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
Congratulations.

87
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,279
All right. I need to go.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,640
I need to share this
great news with Minggu.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,519
- All right.
- Congratulations.

90
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,079
Congratulations.

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,920
Please excuse me.

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,279
Master.

93
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,040
- Slow down!
- Minggu!

94
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,640
- Minggu!
- Master!

95
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,440
You heartless people.

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,200
General Zhao is guarding
the borders for us,

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
yet you slander him.

98
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,279
All you do is talking nonsense.

99
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,160
Get out of here.

100
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,959
Forget reasoning with them.

101
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,119
Let's just beat them up.

102
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,760
Stop it.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,200
I'll kill you.

104
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,000
Stop it!

105
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:44,799
What's wrong?

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
The rumor is known everywhere.

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,959
In order to seize victory,

108
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,480
General Zhao sacrificed
more than 10,000 soldiers.

109
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:51,839
Since he did it,

110
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,720
why can't I tell the truth?

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,959
You know nothing,

112
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,079
yet you're spewing nonsense.

113
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,040
Get lost!

114
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:57,959
You...

115
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,559
You feisty tramp.

116
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,920
You lying scholar.

117
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,880
Lying scholar.

118
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,200
Feisty tramp.

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,880
What are you doing?

120
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,559
Who are you calling a feisty tramp?

121
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,359
Have you passed
the imperial examination?

122
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,279
How atrocious.

123
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,079
I...

124
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,160
What?

125
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,000
Get lost.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,760
Get out of my sight.

127
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,279
Let's go!

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,320
Get lost.

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,359
There's nothing to see here.

130
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,000
That's enough.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Boyang.

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,399
Get out of here.

133
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:19,959
Disperse.

134
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,320
Did you pass?

135
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,320
Go.

136
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
That's great!

137
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,600
You finally did it!

138
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,359
Here. Let's cheer for this.

139
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Here.

140
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,559
Today is a great day.

141
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,320
Although

142
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm at the 233rd place,

143
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,640
it's not exactly the best.

144
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,200
But no matter what,

145
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm a Jinshi,

146
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,839
right?

147
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Minggu,

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
when are we going to...

149
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,200
Come on.

150
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,839
That's all you know?

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,959
Don't bring it up till
you start to make money.

152
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,119
Previously,

153
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,839
you promised you'd marry Boyang

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,359
after he passed the examination.

155
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,720
That's right.

156
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,839
Look at both of you.

157
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm not done with you.

158
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Zhao Xiaoqian

159
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
is the great General Zhao now.

160
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,519
After he returns in triumph,

161
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,640
he'd become an official
back at the city.

162
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,720
Public opinions will not hurt him.

163
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,760
On the contrary,

164
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,160
you're off defending him

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,279
with a broom every day.

166
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,160
If you keep doing this,

167
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,079
you will be known

168
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,480
as the feisty tramp around here.

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,640
Do you know he's returning soon?

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,799
Yes.

171
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,519
Everyone in the academy
is talking about it.

172
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,600
Well,

173
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,239
do you want to see him?

174
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,399
Xiaoman,

175
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
let's drink.

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,239
Here.

177
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,079
Cheers.

178
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,399
Look at me.

179
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,239
What am I talking about!

180
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,959
We parted ways long time ago.

181
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,679
By the way,

182
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,480
an old friend from Wujiang Prefecture

183
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,359
is coming to the capital.

184
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Tomorrow night,

185
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,279
come over to my store.

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,480
I'll make you a garment

187
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,640
and make you pretty.

188
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm going to tend to the store.

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
You should hurry back to the academy.

190
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,399
I'll see you tomorrow night.

191
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's go.

192
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,359
Come with me.

193
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:44,880
Wait.

194
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,920
What's the rush?

195
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Let's celebrate your achievement.

196
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,880
Really?

197
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,060
♪I've been thinking♪

198
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,220
♪I haven't heard from you for a year♪

199
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,580
♪Everything has changed♪

200
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,700
♪Dreaming of going on Fangzhou Road♪

201
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Minister of Rites, He Yong.

202
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,200
Two gold goblets.

203
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,720
Minister of Works, Liu Cheng'en.

204
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,920
A piece of Sunset Painting.

205
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Deputy Decal Minister, Shen Shidao.

206
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,880
One unit of
Celadon Hundredfold Crackle Vase.

207
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,200
Minister of Military Affairs,
Liu Shunchen.

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
A box of ambergris from
the Saracen Empire.

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Directorate of Imperial Academy,
Lu Songqing.

210
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
Ten units of Tinggui Ink from Huizhou.

211
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,479
Official of Personnel Division
of East Road, Huzhou, Qian Yide.

212
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,479
A piece of Hidden Arhat Painting.

213
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,159
What about Shen Yan?

214
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,520
A month ago, General Shen

215
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,080
returned to the capital
with General Xu.

216
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,640
He did not garner the privilege

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
to participate in
the tribute of ministers.

218
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,280
They are

219
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,799
those who grovel before the influential.

220
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,559
Ignore them.

221
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,239
What's the current situation
in the capital?

222
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,880
Things are grim.

223
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,679
Although the accounts of
Jingxi and Jingdong

224
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,679
embezzled military funds,

225
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,679
no problems are detected yet.

226
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,280
Things are advancing
according to Xu Huan's plans.

227
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,119
Grand Secretariat Qin is unable to
oppose him alone in the capital.

228
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,479
He said he let you down

229
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,400
for failing to protect the reputation
of the war of Baichuankou.

230
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,280
Right now,

231
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:17,799
the rumors about you

232
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,960
are spreading like virus.

233
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:21,520
They called you the
reincarnation of evil,

234
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,640
an aggressive warlord.

235
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,320
The situation isn't certain for now.

236
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,880
Are you sure

237
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,679
it's a good time to declare war
against Xu Huan right now?

238
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,840
Further adventures in finance and felony.

239
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,080
What do you think?

240
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,119
By the way,

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,119
there's another thing.

242
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
The Spring Exam ended not long ago.

243
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,159
Boyang passed the exam.

244
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,400
They all

245
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,719
know you're coming back.

246
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,599
Withdraw the spy from

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,200
Xie Family.

248
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
Capital

249
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,180
Shun

250
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,359
Excuse me.

251
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,200
Which prince could it be?

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,880
What a great commotion.

253
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,760
Don't you know?

254
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,239
General Zhao is returning
to the imperial court in triumph today.

255
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,479
His Majesty is honoring his return.

256
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,760
The Living King Yama is back?

257
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,239
Zhao Xiaoqian!

258
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,359
Zhao Xiaoqian!

259
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,960
Zhao Xiaoqian!

260
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,960
Zhao Xiaoqian!

261
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Zhao Xiaoqian!

262
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,719
Shen.

263
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Duke of Wuguo is back.

264
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,479
What should I offer as a gift?

265
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,119
If the gift is too expensive,

266
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,239
His Majesty would be unhappy.

267
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,080
Should I...

268
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,719
I shall offer him some fruits.

269
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,479
The returning general shall be

270
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,760
rewarded personally by His Majesty.

271
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,359
There's no need for you to
concern yourself, Chancellor Xu.

272
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,119
Civil officials like you don't
know how things work.

273
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,799
Duke of Wuguo has arrived.

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
Your Highness.

275
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
Chancellor Xu,

276
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,000
are you teasing the innocent again?

277
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Back then,

278
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,200
you learned the Analects from me.

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
You were still a child back then.

280
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
Today,

281
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,840
you won the war

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
and returned in triumph.

283
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,719
You have a bright future ahead.

284
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
You have a bright future ahead.

285
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,719
Duke of Wuguo returned victoriously

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and magnified the glory of the state.

287
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
You have my deepest admiration.

288
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,520
You have my deepest admiration.

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
The imperial meeting commences.

290
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,599
Deputy Commander of Guanxi Borders,

291
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,200
Commander of Xiongjie Army,
Zhao Xiaoqian

292
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
offers greetings to Your Majesty.

293
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
Long live the Emperor.

294
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Long live the Emperor.

295
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,559
Baichuankou attained victory!

296
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,520
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

297
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,559
Long live the Emperor!

298
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,320
You may rise.

299
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,280
Let me take a good look at you.

300
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,679
Thank you, Your Majesty.

301
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,679
Hanchen of the Zhao Family

302
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
clad in Armour,
defeated the enemies at war.

303
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,200
His merit and contribution
to the state are vast.

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,559
I

305
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,119
have raised you right.

306
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,479
Hanchen

307
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,359
retrieved the lost territories
of Baichuankou

308
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,880
and attained victory.

309
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,000
I've decided to

310
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,799
promote Zhao Xiaoqian

311
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,119
as the Commander of Pengri Army
of Sixiang Province

312
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,359
and Commandery Prince of Julu.

313
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,520
Scholar Han Lin shall draft the edict.

314
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,039
The edict takes effect today.

315
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

316
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,440
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

317
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,359
Congratulations,
Commandery Prince of Julu.

318
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
Your Majesty,

319
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,080
I'd like to ask for
a different position.

320
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,840
Since I attained victory,

321
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,520
I do not have further requests.

322
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:23,239
I only seek to assume position as
the Imperial Grand Governor.

323
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,080
The Imperial Grand Governor?

324
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,520
I beg for Your Majesty's approval.

325
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Su Chang Ji

326
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Zhao Xiaoqian.

327
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,320
Madam Wang from the street said

328
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,760
General Zhao came back from hell.

329
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,960
I heard that he killed
countless lives at the borders.

330
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,599
He's aggressive and tyrannous.

331
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,559
He can't be suppressed.

332
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,359
You're right.

333
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,119
He returned to the court today.

334
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,719
Lady Su wouldn't allow us
to talk about it.

335
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,159
I'm not sure why either.

336
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,479
I heard

337
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:04,239
that he was pierced through
by an arrow at the chest,

338
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,919
but he survived.

339
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,080
He's the Living King Yama.

340
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
There's no doubt.

341
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,760
You're right.

342
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,640
What did you say?

343
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,799
What do you mean he was
pierced through the chest?

344
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,359
Well...

345
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,520
Spill it.

346
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,960
What's going on?

347
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,840
Xiaoman.

348
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,479
What's the matter?

349
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
He's injured?

350
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,359
Such rumor

351
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,559
is going around the neighbourhood.

352
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,919
I want to see him for once.

353
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,479
Just once.

354
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,719
Minggu,

355
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,880
can you ask Boyang to
deliver a letter for me?

356
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,599
All right.

357
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,200
Brat.

358
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,679
You caused a clamour
the moment you returned.

359
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,039
Father.

360
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,119
Come here.

361
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,479
Drink tea with me.

362
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,039
What's wrong?

363
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,559
You rejected my offer to grant you
the title as the Commandery Prince.

364
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,119
Are you capable of being
the Imperial Grand Governor?

365
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,919
If others can do it,

366
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
so can I.

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,839
Tell me.

368
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
Why the position of

369
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,640
the Imperial Grand Governor?

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,160
It's for the sake of my pride.

371
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,119
I'm bored of military positions.

372
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,839
I'd like to be serve
as a regular official.

373
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,040
Pride?

374
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,319
In the war of Baichuankou,

375
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
there were over 10,000 of casualties.

376
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,560
Do you know

377
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,400
what the public calls you?

378
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,479
An aggressive warlord.

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The reincarnation of evil.

380
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:36,959
You're aware,

381
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,680
yet you're asking to be an official.

382
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,920
Do you know

383
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,680
that's the position for the Crown Prince?

384
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,239
As for the heavy casualties
in Baichuankou,

385
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,599
how will you justify yourself?

386
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,800
A good commander knows how to

387
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,680
defend when attack fails,

388
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,199
retreat when defend fails,

389
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,920
and escape when retreat fails.

390
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,760
Or else, one should die fighting.

391
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,800
I couldn't retreat

392
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,000
or run.

393
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,479
The only thing I could do was
to fight the enemy head on.

394
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,040
There's no rush.

395
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,079
Your Majesty may take time
to consider my request.

396
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,119
I can wait.

397
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,119
I

398
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,439
shall excuse myself.

399
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,079
I'm leaving, Your Majesty.

400
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,199
Hanchen

401
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,560
has indeed changed.

402
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:13,920
Chancellor,

403
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,920
the Imperial Grand Governor

404
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,359
has always been
the Crown Prince's position.

405
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,439
Right after Duke of Wuguo returned,

406
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,280
he asked to occupy the role
of the Crown Prince.

407
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,319
He's...

408
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,560
Chancellor.

409
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
Chancellor.

410
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,439
The meeting at Ruisi Palace has ended.

411
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,079
His Majesty did not agree.

412
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,439
Thank you for the hard work, eunuch.

413
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,400
Do not panic.

414
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,359
His Majesty did not agree.

415
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,439
The war of Baichuankou

416
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,959
wasn't attained by him alone.

417
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,040
However, all the credits

418
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,439
went to him alone.

419
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,920
His Majesty is being partial.

420
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:53,959
Chancellor.

421
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,640
A few days ago, I heard that

422
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,199
His Majesty reprimanded
the Crown Prince

423
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,680
while His Majesty promoted and
rewarded Zhao Xiaoqian today.

424
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,959
Do you think...

425
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,959
A few days ago, I was told

426
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,439
that the military caused
a ruckus at the city.

427
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,119
I'm rather concerned with this matter.

428
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,040
Should I recruit men

429
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,760
to cause Duke of Wuguo some trouble?

430
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,920
Your request at
the imperial court today

431
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,520
must have evoked suspicion.

432
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,119
Chancellor Xu would
make an attempt soon.

433
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,160
You must take precautions.

434
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,599
Also,

435
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,920
Boyang delivered an invitation.

436
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,599
He wants to catch up with you.

437
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,040
Xiaoman will be there as well.

438
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:54,680
We're under

439
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,959
Chancellor Xu's surveillance right now.

440
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,119
I'm sure they are aware

441
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,839
Xiaoman and Boyang are in the capital.

442
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,839
The best way around

443
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,119
is to act as usual.

444
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,079
I understand.

445
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,199
Your Highness.

446
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,119
Zhu Momo.

447
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,040
You're still around.

448
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,640
Mother.

449
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,599
I'm here.

450
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,400
Kneel.

451
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,380
The memorial tablet of the eldest son,
Zhao Xiaojie

452
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,079
Let me ask you.

453
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
How many lives do you have?

454
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,959
How dare you request His Majesty for
the role of the Imperial Grand Governor?

455
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,640
Don't you know

456
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,599
that the Imperial Grand Governor

457
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,079
can only be assumed
by the Crown Prince.

458
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,959
You surely receive news quickly, mother.

459
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Less than a day has passed since
the adjournment of the court,

460
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,199
yet you knew everything.

461
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,199
I'm afraid the Empress

462
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,640
found out even earlier.

463
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,959
If what you did in the court today

464
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,439
reached Her Highness,

465
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:40,280
she will think you want to
compete for the throne.

466
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,160
If you continue this farce,

467
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,640
you're going to lose your life.

468
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,839
It doesn't matter if she finds out.

469
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,640
Her Highness can't possibly

470
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,079
poison me as well.

471
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,640
You...

472
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I did not come home

473
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,079
to argue with you.

474
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,560
I came to offer my respects to brother.

475
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,439
On the year of brother's death,

476
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
my fate was already set.

477
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,880
If you have time,

478
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,359
you may enter the palace

479
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,640
and talk to the Empress.

480
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,280
Since she failed to
discipline the Crown Prince,

481
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,719
the change of position

482
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,959
will no longer be up to her.

Hanchen.

488
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,599
You've finally arrived at the capital.

489
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,800
I wonder

490
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,079

Give them some time. Do not eat first.

497
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,239
He will be here soon.

498
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,319
Zhanzhi.

499
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:47,680
Boyang.

500
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,280
Hanchen.

501
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,160
Xingzhou.

502
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,280
Let me take a good look at you.

503
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,599
You brat.

504
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,439
You are lucky indeed.

505
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,839
You were pierced through
by an arrow at your chest,

506
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,880
yet you came back alive.

507
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,760
You're doing great yourself.

508
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,959
You ranked the 233rd place.

509
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,839
I almost ended up last.

510
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,280
How about asking His Majesty

511
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,560
to promote me to
the 33rd place instead?

512
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,400
Let me enter the Hanlin Academy as well.

513
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,520
Forget it.

514
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,319
Let's all grab a seat,

515
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,680
233rd place.

516
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,680
You need to work harder.

517
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,520
Here. Have a seat.

518
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,160
Come on.

519
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:30,839
Have a seat.

520
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,599
I heard that your father was promoted.

521
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,040
Your brother

522
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,199
had two kids in the same year.

523
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,760
What's going on?
Did he marry a concubine?

524
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,280
Don't be ridiculous.

525
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,400
My sister-in-law gave birth to twins.

526
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Isn't that right, Minggu?

527
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,280
Yes.

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,319
Let's put this aside.

529
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,359
We haven't met in three years.

530
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
Bottoms up.

531
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,000
A toast to the survival
of Xingzhou and Hanchen.

532
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,439
- Here.
- Here.

533
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,160
Cheers.

534
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,800
I heard that

535
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,760
you were injured at Baichuankou.

536
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,400
Are you all right?

537
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm fine.

538
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
Hanchen's injury wasn't severe.

539
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,239
Don't worry.

540
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,599
Baichuankou was rather chilly though.

541
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,239
His knees would hurt
when it started to rain.

542
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,520
It's not a big deal, right?

543
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,640
You must take it seriously.

544
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,479
Have you consulted the physician?

545
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,319
Are you married?

546
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,000
You're no longer young.

547
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,400
There's no time to waste.

548
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,880
No one has proposed to me yet.

549
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,719
Don't worry.

550
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:44,880
Take your time.

551
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,319
Once you find someone,
I'll offer you the endowment.

552
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,880
Zhao Xiaoqian, what do you mean?

553
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,560
Marriages and funerals

554
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,400
are natural events.

555
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,239
I'm just concerned about Xiaoman.

556
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:03,959
Zhao Xiaoqian!

557
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,719
Zhao Xiaoqian!

558
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,599
Zhao Xiaoqian!

559
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Pay for my son's life!

560
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,040
Who are you?

561
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,119
Return my son to me!

562
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,800
If it wasn't for your greed for merits

563
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,479
and ignored the lives of the soldiers,

564
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,359
my son wouldn't have died!

565
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,680
Return my son to me!

566
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,959
If you're able to kill me,

567
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll pay for his life with mine.

568
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,199
What do you say?

569
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,839
You aggressive warlord!

570
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,839
You're the reincarnation of evil!

571
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,680
You will die a nasty death!

572
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,479
You will die a nasty death!

573
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,719
I'm not in the mood.

574
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,479
Let's meet up another time.

575
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,439
Xiaoman.

576
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

577
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,160
Zhao Xiaoqian.

578
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,319
What's the matter?

579
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,719
Xingzhou said

580
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,479
your knees hurt when it rains.

581
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,199
What kind of pain do you experience?

582
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,079
Back at Yuyangli Village, I...

583
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,160
Stop bringing Yuyangli Village up.

584
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,599
There are plenty of
imperial physicians in the palace.

585
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,079
It's none of your concern.

586
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
The old man just now...

587
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
What's wrong?

588
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,439
A war comes with deaths.

589
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,160
There are plenty who have suffered.

590
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,640
It's no big deal.

591
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,439
Why?

592
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,119
Are you disappointed?

593
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,439
How could this be?

594
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,680
Everyone

595
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,839
called you an aggressive warlord

596
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,719
who only cares about merits.

597
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,479
The public said you coveted after

598
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,560
power once you returned.

599
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

600
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,319
Lady Xie.

601
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
No matter what you say
behind my back,

602
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,359
in public,

603
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,079
you should address me as
the Commandery Prince.

604
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,079
This is the capital.

605
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,560
The situation is very complicated.

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
I do not have time to

607
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,599
take care of the insignificant peasants
like you.

608
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,520
You should take care of yourself.

609
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,079
All right!

610
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,560
I'll be cautious.

611
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,880
I do not need your concern!

612
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,079
You fool.

613
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,920
He's currently a man of power.

614
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,839
He has no time for you.

615
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,599
You're still thinking about him.

616
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,479
You're a fool.

617
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:29,920
You're dumb.

618
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,359
You're pathetic.

619
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
You want to give me the endowment?

620
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,839
I do not need your money.

621
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,239
In the past,

622
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,760
I was the one who left you first.

623
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
What am I afraid of?

624
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,560
Did you think I went to see you

625
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,319
for reconciliation?

626
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,199
In your dreams!

627
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
I just wanted to see
if you're dead.

628
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,079
I'm not dead.

629
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,119
Are you proud of your position
as the general?

630
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,479
You're disturbing me even in my dreams.

631
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,280
Yes.

632
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,959
I'm afraid you'd hit me during the day,

633
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,040
so I had to come in your dreams.

634
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,479
That way, it wouldn't hurt
when you hit me.

635
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
Are you still mad at me?

636
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Yes.

637
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm extremely mad.

638
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,800
Go away.

639
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,680
We're done.

640
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,400
Be on your own way,

641
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,560
and I'll go my own.

642
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,239
What if I want to join you on your path?

643
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:09,920
It's too narrow

644
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,479
for two.

645
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,719
Stop laughing.

646
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,839
You're terrible.

647
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,839
Yes, I am.

648
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,160
You refused to see me.

649
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,959
You wanted to marry me off.

650
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,880
You wanted to offer me the endowment.

651
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,479
Who do you think you are?

652
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,319
Are you my father?

653
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,439
Stay away from me.

654
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,041
You traitor.

655
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,239
You heartless man.

656
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,079
You're worse than animals.

657
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,640
You're heartless.

658
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,040
You're my woman.

659
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,959
When I hurt you for a bit,

660
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,160
it will hurt me ten times more.

661
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,920
How could I possibly forget you?

662
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,160
You wanted to marry me off.

663
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,800
Ridiculous.

664
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,239
Try and marry someone else.

665
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,479
If you do,

666
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,119
I'll stop it no matter what.

667
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:13,719
Really?

668
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,800
Yes.

669
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,040
Go to bed.

670
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,040
Dream of this when you're asleep.

671
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,680
In the dream, we'd be married.

672
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,119
I'll take you openly as my wife.

673
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,400
All right?

674
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,820
Studio of Artlessness

675
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,560
I've investigated the case.

676
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,919
The old man

677
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,120
was sent by Chancellor Xu.

678
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,439
What do you plan to do next?

679
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,879
I'm going to request His Majesty to
betroth Shen Zhaowen to me tomorrow.

680
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,080
The plan goes on.

681
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,840
It was indeed just a dream.

682
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,199
Sister.

683
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,239
Where have you been?

684
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,320
You even skipped breakfast.

685
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,159
Hurry up and eat.

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,399
Someone treated me to crustacean.

687
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,879
Xiaoman.

688
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,040
An old friend from
Wujiang Prefecture is here.

689
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,719
Congwen.

690
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,760
Stop standing around.

691
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Hurry up and treat Congwen

692
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,239
to some good food.

693
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,639
We have no more food at home.

694
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,439
Go on.

695
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,719
Go on.

696
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,679
Let's take a stroll outside.

697
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,639
I haven't taken a morning stroll around
the capital in a while.

698
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,959
The eight views of the capital

699
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,000
include the spring landscape
of the capital.

700
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,040
Last year,

701
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,679
you did odd jobs
for Teacher Liu.

702
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,919
I was told that you became
a teacher this year.

703
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't tease me.

704
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,439
With my proficiency,

705
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,679
I'm not eligible to be a teacher.

706
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm just teaching
the Thousand Character Classic now.

707
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,879
On the contrary,

708
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,360
you'd come to the capital
every spring to teach.

709
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,959
It must have been tough.

710
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,040
Well, I did not return this time

711
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,639
only to teach.

712
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:19,919
Have a seat.

713
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,479
I brought you some rice cakes.

714
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,320
Thank you.

715
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,320
Did you meet him yesterday?

716
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,239
Before his return,

717
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,239
I didn't believe

718
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,479
the rumors.

719
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Hanchen is a righteous man.

720
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,040
However, yesterday,

721
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,800
an old man accused him
of coveting merits

722
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,239
and sacrificing his son.

723
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,959
The old man looked

724
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,360
so frail and helpless.

725
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,719
In the span of three years,

726
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,719
do you think someone

727
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,159
could change completely?

728
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,719
You should ask him yourself.

729
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,959
In your heart, he may
be kind and righteous.

730
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,399
However, in your eyes,

731
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,159
he'd treat others as nothing but ants.

732
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,399
Your heart is questioning

733
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,239
why he ended up this way.

734
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,520
However, you refuse to believe

735
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,520
the claim of others.

736
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,320
Only if you ask him yourself

737
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,280
can you obtain peace in your heart.

738
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,919
Your Majesty,

739
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,919
the victory in Baichuankou

740
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,800
came with heavy casualties.

741
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,000
If the court offers compensation,

742
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,879
it will cost a hefty sum.

743
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,919
I beg for your pardon, Your Majesty.

744
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:52,840
Your Majesty,

745
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,360
I think we mustn't conserve

746
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,040
on the compensation.

747
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,479
The soldiers sacrificed
themselves for the state

748
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,520
and fought the enemy bravely.

749
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,910
If the soldiers' families
are not cared,

750
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,320
it will hurt the morale and patriotism

751
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:08,159
of the fellow soldiers.

752
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,479
If the state is under
the enemy's attack in the future,

753
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,239
no one would be willing to

754
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,399
fight the war at the cost of their lives.

755
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,520
What do you think, Hanchen?

756
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,199
Your Majesty,

757
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,520
the decision

758
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,520
lies in Your Majesty.

759
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,520
I have a request

760
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,199
I would like to make for myself.

761
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,040
Speak.

762
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm well past the age of 20.

763
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,520
Your Majesty granted
the Commandery Prince's Mansion to me.

764
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,239
The mansion

765
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,320
needs the Commandery Princess.

766
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,959
How ridiculous.

767
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,360
He intends to marry a wife
right after returning from war.

768
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,479
Do you have someone in mind?

769
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,280
Commandery Princess Rong'an,
Shen Zhaowen,

770
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,199
grew up with me.

771
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,959
I have deep feelings for her.

772
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,760
I beg for Your Majesty's approval.

773
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,980
Kunning Palace

774
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,360
You're all dismissed.

775
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,520
Leave Wang Xian to serve me alone.

776
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,399
Chancellor Xu conveyed a message
from the court.

777
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,040
Commandery Prince of Julu

778
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,520
asked for the office of
the Imperial Grand Governor previously.

779
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,520
During the court meeting just now,

780
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,040
he requested to marry
Commandery Princess Rong'an.

781
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,439
What did His Majesty say?

782
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:55,280
Luckily His Majesty didn't approve.

783
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,399
After winning the war,

784
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,159
he forgot his own place.

785
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,840
It was my negligence

786
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,679
for failing to eliminate him
together then.

787
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,280
Inform Chancellor Xu.

788
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll leave the matter to him.

789
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,879
Yes, Your Highness.

790
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,919
What's the matter?

791
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,679
Is there something else?

792
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,639
According to Chancellor Xu,

793
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,239
Commandery Prince of Julu is coveting
the position of Imperial Grand Governor

794
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,959
to replace the Crown Prince.

795
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,199
How dare he?

796
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,399
Chancellor Xu also said,

797
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,159
he must be annihilated.

798
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,760
He already has a plan.

799
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,520
Chancellor Xu said,

800
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,520
in order to protect the Crown Prince,

801
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,320
Your Highness must...

802
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,280
After achieving victory in war,

803
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,760
he's after the role of the Crown Prince.

804
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,760
He wants to marry the daughter
of Commander of Majun Province.

805
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,199
Although Zhao Xiaoqian
is not the rightful heir,

806
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,280
his ambitions are daunting.

807
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,800
He has been suppressed for a long time.

808
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,239
Once he retaliates,

809
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,280
he is capable of causing a turmoil.

810
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,479
Does that mean

811
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,760
Zhao Xiaoqian is after
something greater,

812
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,199
like the position of Crown Prince?

813
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,520
Since he pursues something
beyond his place,

814
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:30,919
why not

815
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,360
eliminate him?

816
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:42,439
Do you know that

817
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,360
how I landed the position
of the grand chancellor?

818
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,040
I keep no one

819
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:50,040
who gets in my way.
