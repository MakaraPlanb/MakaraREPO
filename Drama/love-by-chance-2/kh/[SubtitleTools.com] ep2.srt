1
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,060
I don't care If something happens to me

2
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,080
As long as you're here with me

3
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,320
But you're not here with me now

4
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,680
Dude

5
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,560
I need help

6
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,280
Right now

7
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,570
That's good, everyone!

8
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,530
That's right. Keep running

9
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,470
If you guys keep practicing like this

10
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,730
The victory will be ours this year

11
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,610
Over there! Don't be lazy

12
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,670
Why did you stop practicing?

13
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,750
What are you guys laughing at?

14
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:12,950
Techno

15
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,370
huh?

16
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,150
Behind you

17
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,010
Behind me?

18
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,090
Techno

19
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,390
Are you thirsty?

20
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,970
I'll bring it for you

21
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:22,950
Little monkey

22
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,530
Let me kick your ass!

23
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,130
Don't run!

24
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,450
Catch me if you can

25
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,190
You'll die if I can catch you, little monkey!

26
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,670
Why our captain is so slow?

27
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,980
Why are you running like that?

28
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,130
I'm so tired

29
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,470
I've been practicing for a while already

30
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,190
It's raining too!

31
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,450
Stop complaining

32
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,010
If you want to be the first-choice lineup, you have to do this

33
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,630
Are you sure that you're not taking revenge on me?

34
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,850
I'm sure you won't do that

35
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,050
A respectful captain like you

36
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,950
Nahhh

37
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,150
I just...

38
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,790
I just want to help you

39
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,090
One-on-one

40
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,990
But I'm tired

41
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,630
Where's Ae?

42
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,830
He didn't come to practice many times already

43
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,850
I have no clue

44
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,810
Pond told me that he's not doing well

45
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,170
Why don't you go talk to him?

46
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,010
You're close to him, right?

47
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,270
Who would dare to do that?

48
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,530
He's scary

49
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,450
Even Pond wouldn't dare to approach him

50
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:52,970
Techno

51
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,310
Hm?

52
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,450
Why being in love makes you sad?

53
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,870
Why are you asking me?

54
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,790
Look at Ae

55
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,010
After he broke up with Pete, he started to drink and smoke

56
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,670
He completely changed

57
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,750
Back then he took care of himself so well

58
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,930
Whatever

59
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,390
I won't fall in love

60
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,630
You want to poo?

61
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,070
Huh?

62
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,050
It's nothing

63
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,790
I will go pack up stuff first

64
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,270
Techno!

65
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,850
You said you will buy me food

66
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,770
Nope

67
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,570
I'm hungry

68
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,930
Hungry!

69
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,790
I want to eat!

70
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,650
I'm hungry!

71
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,230
I have no energy!

72
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,760
Right now

73
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't want to talk to you, Kla

74
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,110
How can I tell you that on that day...

75
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,390
It felt so good

76
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,890
Why do I feel this way?

77
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,570
Techno

78
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,970
You said that after practice you would treat me to dinner

79
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,350
Where the hell is he now?

80
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,650
I'm so hungry. I don't have any energy left

81
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,110
Am I going to die?

82
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,670
That's right!

83
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,170
Yes! I survive!

84
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,890
You're in the way

85
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,710
You again?

86
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,310
I'm just stating the fact

87
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:24,890
No!

88
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,850
I can stand anywhere I want

89
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,270
I can eat what I want

90
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,870
Also

91
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,270
This car

92
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,450
Not yours right?

93
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,250
Oh it's yours

94
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,450
Yes

95
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,810
And you're making it dirty

96
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,450
Why do you have to say that I'm dirty?

97
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,330
I'm not dirty

98
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,610
I might forget to take a shower and brush my teeth sometimes

99
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,440
I might sweat a lot because I was running

100
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,930
But my hair still smell good

101
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,710
Do you want to smell?

102
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,270
Try to smell it

103
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,190
Disgusting

104
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,430
Disgusting

105
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,430
Disgusting right?

106
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,030
Now your car is dirty like me

107
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,230
How's that?

108
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,450
You're also dirty

109
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,710
Same as your car

110
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,970
Ew disgusting!

111
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,290
You're dirty

112
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,930
Why are you smiling?

113
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,010
Throw it away for me

114
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,830
Do it yourself!

115
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,090
I don't want someone who just stood next to my car

116
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,770
To choke to death

117
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,950
You can die somewhere else

118
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,450
Someone like me

119
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,630
Won't die...

120
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,470
I don't want to take it

121
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,850
But my parents teach me not to waste anything

122
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,150
What a weirdo

123
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,570
Dude

124
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,830
Slow down

125
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,750
You'll die

126
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,710
Leave me alone

127
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,690
I'm just worried

128
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,910
Pond!

129
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,600
Right here

130
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,610
Okay

131
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,270
He looks really bad

132
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,390
How did you find him?

133
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,370
I called him so many times but he turned off his phone

134
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,730
I'm here with my high school friends

135
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,410
I was looking around and saw someone who looks familiar

136
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,090
It turned out to be him

137
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,850
Dude

138
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,210
I have no idea what's going on between them

139
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,130
But

140
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,110
Pete won't come and check on him?

141
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,130
They used to love each other so much

142
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,230
It's not what you think

143
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,310
Shut up!

144
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,770
The reason that we broke up is not because we didn't love each other

145
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,210
Do you understand that?

146
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,810
Do you?

147
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,710
Do you understand?

148
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,130
He never leaves me

149
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,690
Ae

150
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,250
Calm down

151
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,290
Do you understand that I love him?

152
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,050
I know

153
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,670
Bow didn't blame Pete

154
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,530
She just didn't know what happened between you two

155
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,070
Don't put it on her

156
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,310
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it

157
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,010
I don't understand

158
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,350
Who do you think is the hottest guy this year?

159
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,710
Definitely Pete!

160
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,930
Sadly

161
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,890
He moves to study abroad

162
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,050
I don't agree with you

163
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,150
It must be Tin

164
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,770
Nah, he is so arrogant

165
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,090
But he is perfect

166
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,750
Who is he?

167
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,910
You don't know him?

168
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,230
Oh I see, you didn't study with him and Pete last semester

169
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm not surprised that you don't know them

170
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,250
Do I need to know them?

171
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,630
Of course!

172
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,070
Handsome, rich, and smart

173
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,810
Our faculty has a lot of good looking people

174
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,470
But Tin is exceptional

175
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,070
Do you know Methanan?

176
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,550
The powerful real estate company in Thailand

177
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,730
If you don't know him maybe you heard of Tun Methanan before

178
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,940
He is so smart that he was featured in a business magazine

179
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,530
He is handsome

180
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,850
Super rich

181
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,510
Good Family

182
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,730
Sadly

183
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,110
He is not single

184
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,560
That guy is Tin?

185
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,870
That's right

186
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,190
Tin, the youngest son of Medthanan

187
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,930
The perfect one from our faculty

188
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,130
He is handsome, rich, and smart

189
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,130
He comes from a good family

190
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,330
He is single and never has eyes on anyone

191
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,790
You said single right?

192
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,370
Hey girl

193
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,070
He is very arrogant

194
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,730
You never know if you never try

195
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,090
Hello Job, where are you?

196
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,710
I'm in front of the international college building

197
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,610
What are you doing there?

198
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,410
What?

199
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,630
You invited me here for lunch

200
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,390
You said the food is good, lots of cute girls and the price is cheap

201
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,210
How can you say that?

202
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,550
Do you know?

203
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,010
I didn't have class this morning so I woke up late

204
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,970
I woke up late so my mom didn't prepare breakfast for me

205
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,210
Nothing is in my stomach yet

206
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,670
Do you think our faculty is near international college building?

207
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,930
I have no energy to walk

208
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,510
I'm gonna die If I keep walking

209
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,090
Job!

210
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,890
Such a bad friend!

211
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,130
I'm gonna die

212
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,550
Should I eat at international college building?

213
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,130
But I don't wanna see him

214
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,610
What should I do?

215
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,330
Tin

216
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,890
Tin

217
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,090
Tin

218
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,890
Tin

219
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,370
Tin

220
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,710
Why are you in such a hurry?

221
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,170
What do you want?

222
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,970
I need a partner to do the report

223
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,270
You must see that all of our friends already have their partners

224
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,810
So I'm left alone

225
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,910
Could you be my partner?

226
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,190
Find someone else

227
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,310
Hold on, Tin

228
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,190
You don't have partner as well right?

229
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,290
Let's work together

230
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,490
I promise that I will help you with the report

231
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,830
I told you already

232
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,090
Find someone else

233
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,970
I know that you get annoyed easily

234
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,030
But don't you feel sorry for me?

235
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,910
Or do you think that I approach you because other reason?

236
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm here just...

237
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,410
to find a partner

238
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,310
What's your name?

239
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,050
I'm Ongfong

240
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,830
You can call me Fong

241
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,750
By the way

242
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,810
You are the brother of Tun Medthanan right?

243
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,610
You don't want my number anymore?

244
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,070
How do you know my brother?

245
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,030
Everyone knows

246
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,430
Let me tell you something

247
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,970
Sure. What is it?

248
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,590
Medthanan sons

249
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,610
Don't like a girl like you

250
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,690
Tin

251
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,710
Here you are

252
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,850
I look for you every where

253
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,850
I'm starving. I'm going to die soon

254
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,890
Are you done?

255
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,330
Let's go. I'm hungry

256
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,970
Hurry!

257
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,650
Almost

258
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,550
Almost what?

259
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,730
Will you let go of my hands?

260
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,770
I don't want to hold your hands

261
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,130
You should thank me

262
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,710
For helping you in time

263
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,310
Wait!

264
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,170
Don't act like my hands are disgusting

265
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,270
My hands are clean

266
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,270
Wait...

267
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,830
Did I wash my hands after I went to the toilet this morning?

268
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,510
What about you?

269
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,890
What were you trying to do just then?

270
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,610
It should be me who ask that question

271
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,280
Why did you interfere?

272
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,370
You were about to insult the girl, right?

273
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,310
I know what you're going to say before you even open your mouth

274
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,250
How could you do that to her?

275
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,650
She is so pretty

276
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,950
Pretty?

277
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,350
She's so pretty and cute

278
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,430
Did you even use your eyes to look?

279
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,650
A girl like that?

280
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,850
You are so...

281
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,790
Do you remember my surname now?

282
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,450
I forgot

283
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:20,850
I cannot remember

284
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,730
My brain's memory is short

285
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,210
Why?

286
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,790
You are going to call me stupid again?

287
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,250
At least you are better than her

288
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,150
What's wrong with you?

289
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,110
Whatever. At least I did some good deed today

290
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,310
I'm off

291
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,510
Wait

292
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,090
What now?

293
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,070
You said you're going to have lunch with me

294
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,010
I didn't mean it. I'm not hungry

295
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,900
You can finish all this?

296
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,410
Just wait and see

297
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,350
You're going to pay for me?

298
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,230
I told you that already

299
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,770
You are so...

300
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,410
Every single word you say

301
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,950
Why does it seem so hard to come out?

302
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,350
You can say more than just a few words

303
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,710
You said you helped me

304
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,690
Even though I don't think it's helping much

305
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,210
But I don't want to owe anyone

306
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,410
I did help you

307
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,850
It doesn't matter how rude you are

308
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,390
You have no rights to yell at girls

309
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,150
Other people will say that you are a pussy

310
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,790
I helped you. You should be grateful

311
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,850
A girl like that

312
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,410
Deserves it

313
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

314
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,510
Dirty

315
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,490
You insult me again

316
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,450
But you're cuter than those girls

317
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,280
So dirty

318
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,720
Throw it away for me

319
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,710
Did he just insult me or compliment me?

320
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,790
Dirty but cute

321
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,270
Did he compliment or insult?

322
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,850
What's wrong?

323
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,650
Lemon

324
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,030
Can I ask you something?

325
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,070
Nope

326
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,990
You like to ask nonsense questions

327
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,510
I should spend my time to read something that is more useful

328
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,710
What?

329
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,070
Lemon

330
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,670
If someone says that you're dirty

331
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,270
It's an insult right?

332
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,710
Yes...Maybe...

333
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,210
What about...

334
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,410
Someone says you're cute. It's a compliment, right?

335
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,830
Yes

336
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,210
What if a person says

337
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,250
You're dirty but cute. What does that mean?

338
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,990
He probably...

339
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,610
Compliments and insults at the same time

340
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,210
I have a smart sister

341
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,150
But she is useless

342
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,270
Who will be stupid like you?

343
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,430
I don't know anymore

344
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,610
You're so annoying

345
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,850
I won't think about it anymore

346
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,330
What's wrong with him?

347
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,730
I can't figure it out

348
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,350
I don't understand

349
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,330
Can!

350
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,810
I can't figure it out. I've got a headache

351
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,070
You're so annoying

352
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,530
That hurts!

353
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,500
I...

354
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,860
I have a present for you

355
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,500
I told you not to buy me anything

356
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,700
I didn't buy it

357
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,760
I made it by myself

358
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,760
I don't know if you will like it or not

359
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,920
Ae

360
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,160
Thank you

361
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,680
I will take a good care of you

362
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,780
Pete

363
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,150
This flavor is really spicy

364
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,590
I love it

365
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,670
I like this flavor too

366
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,470
Let me have some

367
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,450
Why are you still eating here? You said you're going to see Ae

368
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,430
I did?

369
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,170
You completely forgets about him

370
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,650
Give it to me, I'll finish it

371
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,910
I want to redeem the item in the game

372
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,370
It's mine!

373
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,470
Enough, I'll keep it

374
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,430
Why don't your share it with your friends?

375
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,930
Aren't you in a hurry to go to class?

376
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,090
I'll play the game first

377
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,010
We should go now

378
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,450
It's so spicy

379
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,910
See you later

380
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,810
Pond!

381
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,710
The snacks

382
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,830
Nah, I won't give you

383
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,770
Die!

384
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,650
Eh...

385
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,910
What's your name again?

386
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,750
You've been sitting here for a while but you still don't know my name?

387
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,390
It's Mai

388
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,630
I think that I'm about to get hit by Mai

389
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,670
Don't you have class?

390
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,080
Just leave

391
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,410
Actually, I don't but...

392
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,070
Pond!

393
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,350
I think I have a class now

394
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,210
Bye bye Mai

395
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,870
How can you leave me with him?

396
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:28,670
Techno

397
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,550
This is my friend

398
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,550
He wants to join the team

399
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,870
Hello Champ. Hello Techno

400
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,070
Why do you want to join us?

401
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,850
Do you want a perfect answer or a real answer?

402
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,630
Perfect one first

403
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,030
Because football is the sport that I love since I was young

404
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,390
I think that

405
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,850
Becoming a part of the team

406
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,990
Is an honor

407
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,350
And the real one?

408
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,790
All the girls will like me

409
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,930
Dude

410
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,250
Why did you answer like that?

411
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,050
You want to join the team because you want us to become the champion

412
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,050
How can you answer like that? Techno won't let you in

413
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,630
Okay

414
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,350
You're in

415
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,660
Techno...

416
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,470
Why not?

417
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,530
He's sincere

418
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,550
What the hell?

419
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,190
That's right. My answer is very sincere

420
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,790
Techno, you're kind to everyone

421
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,030
You're only mean to me

422
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,750
You said I'm mean, right?

423
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,030
Go buy water

424
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,130
But for everyone too

425
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,030
And you, new kid

426
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,630
Let me test your skill first

427
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,750
Yes sir

428
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,570
Go buy water

429
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,390
By myself?

430
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,270
That's right

431
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:39,870
Go

432
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,850
Are you going or not?

433
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,390
Fine. I'll go

434
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,080
I will tell everyone that you're so mean

435
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,910
How dare you?

436
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,670
Techno

437
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,410
He uses me too much

438
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,910
I will tell Type

439
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,850
What kind of nonsense party that I have to go?

440
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,390
If you want your favorite son to go

441
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,010
Then that person is not me

442
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,290
I won't go

443
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,370
Don't call me

444
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,220
Mom, you're annoying

445
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,750
Damn you, Tin!

446
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,410
How can you talk to your mom like that?

447
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,390
I'm talking to you

448
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,970
Stop acting like I'm nothing to you

449
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,650
Good that you know that

450
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,930
Tin

451
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,490
What's wrong with you?

452
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,630
I thought you were good guy

453
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,050
And you behave like this again

454
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,230
I don't know who you are

455
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,930
But yelling at your mom like that is sinful

456
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,570
You must say sorry to her now

457
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,410
Are you done?

458
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,330
No

459
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,870
Until you say sorry

460
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,170
I'm not going to say that to her

461
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,750
And you should stop messing with me

462
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,510
You're annoying

463
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,050
Fine!

464
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,910
I forget

465
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,470
That you're the unloved child

466
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,750
What did you just say?

467
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,070
I said..

468
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,310
You are...

469
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,330
The unloved child

470
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,670
Shut your mouth!
