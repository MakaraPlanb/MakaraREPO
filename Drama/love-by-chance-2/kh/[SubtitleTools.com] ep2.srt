1
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,060
I don't care If something happens to me

2
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
As long as you're here with me

3
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,320
But you're not here with me now

4
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,680
Dude

5
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,560
I need help

6
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,280
Right now

7
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,570
That's good, everyone!

8
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,530
That's right. Keep running

9
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,470
If you guys keep practicing like this

10
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,730
The victory will be ours this year

11
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,610
Over there! Don't be lazy

12
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,670
Why did you stop practicing?

13
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,750
What are you guys laughing at?

14
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,950
Techno

15
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,370
huh?

16
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,150
Behind you

17
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,010
Behind me?

18
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,090
Techno

19
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,390
Are you thirsty?

20
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,970
I'll bring it for you

21
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:14,950
Little monkey

22
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,530
Let me kick your ass!

23
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,130
Don't run!

24
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,450
Catch me if you can

25
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,190
You'll die if I can catch you, little monkey!

26
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,670
Why our captain is so slow?

27
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,980
Why are you running like that?

28
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,130
I'm so tired

29
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,470
I've been practicing for a while already

30
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,190
It's raining too!

31
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,450
Stop complaining

32
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,010
If you want to be the first-choice lineup, you have to do this

33
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,630
Are you sure that you're not taking revenge on me?

34
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,850
I'm sure you won't do that

35
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,050
A respectful captain like you

36
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,950
Nahhh

37
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,150
I just...

38
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,790
I just want to help you

39
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,090
One-on-one

40
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,990
But I'm tired

41
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,630
Where's Ae?

42
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,830
He didn't come to practice many times already

43
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,850
I have no clue

44
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,810
Pond told me that he's not doing well

45
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,170
Why don't you go talk to him?

46
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,010
You're close to him, right?

47
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,270
Who would dare to do that?

48
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,530
He's scary

49
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,450
Even Pond wouldn't dare to approach him

50
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,970
Techno

51
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,310
Hm?

52
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,450
Why being in love makes you sad?

53
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,870
Why are you asking me?

54
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,790
Look at Ae

55
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,010
After he broke up with Pete, he started to drink and smoke

56
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,670
He completely changed

57
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,750
Back then he took care of himself so well

58
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,930
Whatever

59
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,390
I won't fall in love

60
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,630
You want to poo?

61
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,070
Huh?

62
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,050
It's nothing

63
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,790
I will go pack up stuff first

64
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,270
Techno!

65
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,850
You said you will buy me food

66
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,770
Nope

67
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,570
I'm hungry

68
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,930
Hungry!

69
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,790
I want to eat!

70
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,650
I'm hungry!

71
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,230
I have no energy!

72
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,760
Right now

73
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,200
I don't want to talk to you, Kla

74
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,110
How can I tell you that on that day...

75
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,390
It felt so good

76
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,890
Why do I feel this way?

77
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,570
Techno

78
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,970
You said that after practice you would treat me to dinner

79
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,350
Where the hell is he now?

80
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,650
I'm so hungry. I don't have any energy left

81
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,110
Am I going to die?

82
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,670
That's right!

83
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,170
Yes! I survive!

84
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,890
You're in the way

85
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,710
You again?

86
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,310
I'm just stating the fact

87
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,890
No!

88
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,850
I can stand anywhere I want

89
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,270
I can eat what I want

90
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,870
Also

91
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,270
This car

92
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,450
Not yours right?

93
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,250
Oh it's yours

94
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,450
Yes

95
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,810
And you're making it dirty

96
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,450
Why do you have to say that I'm dirty?

97
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,330
I'm not dirty

98
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,610
I might forget to take a shower and brush my teeth sometimes

99
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,440
I might sweat a lot because I was running

100
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,930
But my hair still smell good

101
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,710
Do you want to smell?

102
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,270
Try to smell it

103
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,190
Disgusting

104
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,430
Disgusting

105
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,430
Disgusting right?

106
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,030
Now your car is dirty like me

107
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,230
How's that?

108
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,450
You're also dirty

109
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,710
Same as your car

110
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,970
Ew disgusting!

111
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,290
You're dirty

112
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,930
Why are you smiling?

113
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,010
Throw it away for me

114
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,830
Do it yourself!

115
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,090
I don't want someone who just stood next to my car

116
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,770
To choke to death

117
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,950
You can die somewhere else

118
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,450
Someone like me

119
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,630
Won't die...

120
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,470
I don't want to take it

121
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,850
But my parents teach me not to waste anything

122
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,150
What a weirdo

123
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,570
Dude

124
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,830
Slow down

125
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,750
You'll die

126
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,710
Leave me alone

127
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm just worried

128
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,910
Pond!

129
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,600
Right here

130
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,610
Okay

131
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,270
He looks really bad

132
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,390
How did you find him?

133
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,370
I called him so many times but he turned off his phone

134
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,730
I'm here with my high school friends

135
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,410
I was looking around and saw someone who looks familiar

136
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,090
It turned out to be him

137
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,850
Dude

138
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,210
I have no idea what's going on between them

139
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,130
But

140
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,110
Pete won't come and check on him?

141
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,130
They used to love each other so much

142
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,230
It's not what you think

143
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,310
Shut up!

144
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,770
The reason that we broke up is not because we didn't love each other

145
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,210
Do you understand that?

146
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,810
Do you?

147
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,710
Do you understand?

148
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,130
He never leaves me

149
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,690
Ae

150
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,250
Calm down

151
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,290
Do you understand that I love him?

152
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,050
I know

153
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,670
Bow didn't blame Pete

154
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,530
She just didn't know what happened between you two

155
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,070
Don't put it on her

156
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,310
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it

157
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,010
I don't understand

158
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,350
Who do you think is the hottest guy this year?

159
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,710
Definitely Pete!

160
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,930
Sadly

161
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,890
He moves to study abroad

162
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,050
I don't agree with you

163
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,150
It must be Tin

164
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,770
Nah, he is so arrogant

165
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,090
But he is perfect

166
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,750
Who is he?

167
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,910
You don't know him?

168
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,230
Oh I see, you didn't study with him and Pete last semester

169
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,550
I'm not surprised that you don't know them

170
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,250
Do I need to know them?

171
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,630
Of course!

172
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,070
Handsome, rich, and smart

173
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,810
Our faculty has a lot of good looking people

174
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,470
But Tin is exceptional

175
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,070
Do you know Methanan?

176
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,550
The powerful real estate company in Thailand

177
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,730
If you don't know him maybe you heard of Tun Methanan before

178
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,940
He is so smart that he was featured in a business magazine

179
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,530
He is handsome

180
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,850
Super rich

181
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,510
Good Family

182
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,730
Sadly

183
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,110
He is not single

184
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,560
That guy is Tin?

185
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,870
That's right

186
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,190
Tin, the youngest son of Medthanan

187
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,930
The perfect one from our faculty

188
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,130
He is handsome, rich, and smart

189
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,130
He comes from a good family

190
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,330
He is single and never has eyes on anyone

191
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,790
You said single right?

192
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,370
Hey girl

193
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,070
He is very arrogant

194
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,730
You never know if you never try

195
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,090
Hello Job, where are you?

196
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm in front of the international college building

197
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,610
What are you doing there?

198
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,410
What?

199
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,630
You invited me here for lunch

200
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,390
You said the food is good, lots of cute girls and the price is cheap

201
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,210
How can you say that?

202
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,550
Do you know?

203
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,010
I didn't have class this morning so I woke up late

204
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,970
I woke up late so my mom didn't prepare breakfast for me

205
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,210
Nothing is in my stomach yet

206
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,670
Do you think our faculty is near international college building?

207
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,930
I have no energy to walk

208
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,510
I'm gonna die If I keep walking

209
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,090
Job!

210
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,890
Such a bad friend!

211
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,130
I'm gonna die

212
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,550
Should I eat at international college building?

213
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,130
But I don't wanna see him

214
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,610
What should I do?

215
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,330
Tin

216
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,890
Tin

217
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,090
Tin

218
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,890
Tin

219
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,370
Tin

220
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,710
Why are you in such a hurry?

221
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,170
What do you want?

222
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,970
I need a partner to do the report

223
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,270
You must see that all of our friends already have their partners

224
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,810
So I'm left alone

225
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,910
Could you be my partner?

226
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,190
Find someone else

227
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,310
Hold on, Tin

228
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,190
You don't have partner as well right?

229
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,290
Let's work together

230
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,490
I promise that I will help you with the report

231
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,830
I told you already

232
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,090
Find someone else

233
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,970
I know that you get annoyed easily

234
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,030
But don't you feel sorry for me?

235
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,910
Or do you think that I approach you because other reason?

236
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,750
I'm here just...

237
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,410
to find a partner

238
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,310
What's your name?

239
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,050
I'm Ongfong

240
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,830
You can call me Fong

241
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,750
By the way

242
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,810
You are the brother of Tun Medthanan right?

243
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,610
You don't want my number anymore?

244
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,070
How do you know my brother?

245
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,030
Everyone knows

246
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,430
Let me tell you something

247
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,970
Sure. What is it?

248
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,590
Medthanan sons

249
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,610
Don't like a girl like you

250
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,690
Tin

251
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,710
Here you are

252
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,850
I look for you every where

253
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,850
I'm starving. I'm going to die soon

254
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,890
Are you done?

255
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,330
Let's go. I'm hungry

256
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,970
Hurry!

257
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,650
Almost

258
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,550
Almost what?

259
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,730
Will you let go of my hands?

260
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,770
I don't want to hold your hands

261
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,130
You should thank me

262
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,710
For helping you in time

263
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,310
Wait!

264
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,170
Don't act like my hands are disgusting

265
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,270
My hands are clean

266
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,270
Wait...

267
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,830
Did I wash my hands after I went to the toilet this morning?

268
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,510
What about you?

269
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,890
What were you trying to do just then?

270
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,610
It should be me who ask that question

271
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Why did you interfere?

272
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,370
You were about to insult the girl, right?

273
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,310
I know what you're going to say before you even open your mouth

274
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,250
How could you do that to her?

275
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,650
She is so pretty

276
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,950
Pretty?

277
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,350
She's so pretty and cute

278
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,430
Did you even use your eyes to look?

279
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,650
A girl like that?

280
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,850
You are so...

281
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,790
Do you remember my surname now?

282
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,450
I forgot

283
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:12,850
I cannot remember

284
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,730
My brain's memory is short

285
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,210
Why?

286
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,790
You are going to call me stupid again?

287
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,250
At least you are better than her

288
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,150
What's wrong with you?

289
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,110
Whatever. At least I did some good deed today

290
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,310
I'm off

291
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,510
Wait

292
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,090
What now?

293
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
You said you're going to have lunch with me

294
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,010
I didn't mean it. I'm not hungry

295
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,900
You can finish all this?

296
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,410
Just wait and see

297
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,350
You're going to pay for me?

298
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,230
I told you that already

299
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,770
You are so...

300
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,410
Every single word you say

301
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,950
Why does it seem so hard to come out?

302
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,350
You can say more than just a few words

303
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,710
You said you helped me

304
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,690
Even though I don't think it's helping much

305
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,210
But I don't want to owe anyone

306
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,410
I did help you

307
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,850
It doesn't matter how rude you are

308
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,390
You have no rights to yell at girls

309
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,150
Other people will say that you are a pussy

310
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,790
I helped you. You should be grateful

311
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,850
A girl like that

312
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,410
Deserves it

313
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

314
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,510
Dirty

315
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,490
You insult me again

316
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,450
But you're cuter than those girls

317
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
So dirty

318
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,720
Throw it away for me

319
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,710
Did he just insult me or compliment me?

320
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,790
Dirty but cute

321
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,270
Did he compliment or insult?

322
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,850
What's wrong?

323
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,650
Lemon

324
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,030
Can I ask you something?

325
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,070
Nope

326
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,990
You like to ask nonsense questions

327
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,510
I should spend my time to read something that is more useful

328
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,710
What?

329
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,070
Lemon

330
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,670
If someone says that you're dirty

331
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,270
It's an insult right?

332
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,710
Yes...Maybe...

333
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,210
What about...

334
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,410
Someone says you're cute. It's a compliment, right?

335
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,830
Yes

336
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,210
What if a person says

337
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,250
You're dirty but cute. What does that mean?

338
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,990
He probably...

339
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,610
Compliments and insults at the same time

340
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,210
I have a smart sister

341
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,150
But she is useless

342
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,270
Who will be stupid like you?

343
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,430
I don't know anymore

344
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,610
You're so annoying

345
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,850
I won't think about it anymore

346
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,330
What's wrong with him?

347
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,730
I can't figure it out

348
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,350
I don't understand

349
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,330
Can!

350
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,810
I can't figure it out. I've got a headache

351
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,070
You're so annoying

352
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,530
That hurts!

353
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,500
I...

354
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,860
I have a present for you

355
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,500
I told you not to buy me anything

356
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,700
I didn't buy it

357
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,760
I made it by myself

358
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,760
I don't know if you will like it or not

359
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,920
Ae

360
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,160
Thank you

361
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,680
I will take a good care of you

362
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,780
Pete

363
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,150
This flavor is really spicy

364
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,590
I love it

365
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,670
I like this flavor too

366
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,470
Let me have some

367
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,450
Why are you still eating here? You said you're going to see Ae

368
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,430
I did?

369
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,170
You completely forgets about him

370
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,650
Give it to me, I'll finish it

371
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,910
I want to redeem the item in the game

372
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,370
It's mine!

373
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,470
Enough, I'll keep it

374
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,430
Why don't your share it with your friends?

375
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,930
Aren't you in a hurry to go to class?

376
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,090
I'll play the game first

377
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,010
We should go now

378
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,450
It's so spicy

379
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,910
See you later

380
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,810
Pond!

381
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,710
The snacks

382
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,830
Nah, I won't give you

383
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,770
Die!

384
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,650
Eh...

385
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,910
What's your name again?

386
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,750
You've been sitting here for a while but you still don't know my name?

387
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,390
It's Mai

388
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,630
I think that I'm about to get hit by Mai

389
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,670
Don't you have class?

390
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,080
Just leave

391
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,410
Actually, I don't but...

392
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,070
Pond!

393
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,350
I think I have a class now

394
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,210
Bye bye Mai

395
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,870
How can you leave me with him?

396
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,670
Techno

397
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,550
This is my friend

398
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,550
He wants to join the team

399
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,870
Hello Champ. Hello Techno

400
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,070
Why do you want to join us?

401
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,850
Do you want a perfect answer or a real answer?

402
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,630
Perfect one first

403
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,030
Because football is the sport that I love since I was young

404
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,390
I think that

405
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,850
Becoming a part of the team

406
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,990
Is an honor

407
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,350
And the real one?

408
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,790
All the girls will like me

409
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,930
Dude

410
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,250
Why did you answer like that?

411
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,050
You want to join the team because you want us to become the champion

412
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,050
How can you answer like that? Techno won't let you in

413
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,630
Okay

414
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,350
You're in

415
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,660
Techno...

416
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,470
Why not?

417
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,530
He's sincere

418
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,550
What the hell?

419
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,190
That's right. My answer is very sincere

420
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,790
Techno, you're kind to everyone

421
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,030
You're only mean to me

422
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,750
You said I'm mean, right?

423
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,030
Go buy water

424
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,130
But for everyone too

425
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,030
And you, new kid

426
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,630
Let me test your skill first

427
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:27,750
Yes sir

428
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,570
Go buy water

429
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,390
By myself?

430
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,270
That's right

431
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,870
Go

432
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,850
Are you going or not?

433
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,390
Fine. I'll go

434
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,080
I will tell everyone that you're so mean

435
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,910
How dare you?

436
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,670
Techno

437
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,410
He uses me too much

438
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,910
I will tell Type

439
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,850
What kind of nonsense party that I have to go?

440
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,390
If you want your favorite son to go

441
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,010
Then that person is not me

442
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,290
I won't go

443
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,370
Don't call me

444
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,220
Mom, you're annoying

445
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,750
Damn you, Tin!

446
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,410
How can you talk to your mom like that?

447
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,390
I'm talking to you

448
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,970
Stop acting like I'm nothing to you

449
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,650
Good that you know that

450
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,930
Tin

451
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,490
What's wrong with you?

452
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,630
I thought you were good guy

453
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,050
And you behave like this again

454
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,230
I don't know who you are

455
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,930
But yelling at your mom like that is sinful

456
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,570
You must say sorry to her now

457
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,410
Are you done?

458
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,330
No

459
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,870
Until you say sorry

460
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,170
I'm not going to say that to her

461
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,750
And you should stop messing with me

462
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,510
You're annoying

463
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,050
Fine!

464
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,910
I forget

465
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,470
That you're the unloved child

466
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,750
What did you just say?

467
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,070
I said..

468
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,310
You are...

469
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,330
The unloved child

470
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,670
Shut your mouth!
