1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dude

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no idea what's going on between them

3
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,960
But

4
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,720
Pete won't come and check on him?

5
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,120
They used to love each other so much

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,580
What did you just say?

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,200
I said

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,460
You're just

9
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,420
An unloved child

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,220
Why didn’t you go to the party with mom?

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,920
Did she report that to her favorite son?

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,320
It’s you

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,020
You’re the son that she loves most

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,100
Don’t make me laugh

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,320
It’s because you’re not free today

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,380
That’s why she told me to come

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,120
You’re overthinking

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,160
How can she love a stepson like me

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,180
more than her real son?

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,040
If you want to keep acting

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,340
Do it somewhere else

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,960
I’m sick of it

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,760
You’re always like this

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,660
You should pay more attention to your family

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,680
Just do whatever you want

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,360
Someday

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,480
I will tear off your mask

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,340
That day won’t come

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
That day won’t come

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,300
What did you just say?

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,980
I said

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
You are

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,120
An unloved child

34
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,290
He’s not disgusting…

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,350
But he called me an unloved child, didn’t he?

Can

60
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,450
What’s wrong?

61
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,890
Can!

62
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,030
No! I didn’t kiss!

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,030
What’s wrong?

64
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,390
No

65
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,730
Nothing’s wrong

66
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,330
That’s right

67
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,510
I’m eating breakfast

68
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,490
Are you sure?

69
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,410
Sure

70
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,950
I’m just eating my breakfast

71
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,310
Sure?

72
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,990
Sure

73
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,430
Alright everyone

74
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,410
You guys probably understand about this

75
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,050
About today...

76
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,690
What I wrote on the board...

77
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,190
Please wake your friend up

78
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,210
If he’s going to sleep then don’t disturb other people

79
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,570
Can

80
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,550
Can!

81
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,790
No! I didn’t kiss!

82
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,930
It seems like you really miss your girlfriend

83
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,610
Why don’t you just drop the class and stay with her?

84
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,830
I…I don’t have any girlfriend

85
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,630
Also, I don’t want to drop the class

86
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,110
Let’s continue with the class

87
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,270
Are you serious?

88
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,750
Can was daydreaming and yelling in the class?

89
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,290
You’re amazing

90
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,450
I’m serious

91
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,310
He suddenly yelled in class

92
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,390
Even though he likes to yell and annoy others

93
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,730
But today he’s even worse

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,830
I think he’s crazy

95
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,170
I’m not

96
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,250
I just…

97
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,270
I didn’t sleep that much last night

98
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,850
What did you do then?

99
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,990
Bro

100
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,810
I have something to think about

101
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,770
Someone like you?

102
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,510
Apart from eating

103
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,090
And talking too much

104
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,550
I don't think you've used your brain much

105
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,210
So, what were you thinking about?

106
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,070
Maybe I can help you

107
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,230
That’s right

108
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,910
Tell us

109
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,130
Maybe we can help

110
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,390
Why would I tell you guys?

111
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,210
I won’t say a word!

112
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,910
Wait, Can!

113
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,610
Damn it

114
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,470
I still don’t know who he kissed and turned him into this

115
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,950
Exactly

116
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,730
Who would want to kiss someone like Can?

117
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,990
Come on

118
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,410
Look at Techno

119
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,450
Someone already has eye on him

120
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,290
Someone might like Can too

121
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,630
Even though he’s talkative

122
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,990
But…

123
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,090
You cannot even think about other good things about him

124
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,750
Wait, Bro. What were you saying again?

125
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,130
Who has eye on Techno?

126
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,090
Why would I tell you?

127
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,610
You again?

128
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,590
I still didn’t clear things up for what you did

129
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,690
Do you know that my life is such a mess now?

130
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,030
My sister scolded at me

131
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,490
Teacher also told me to drop the class

132
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,170
My friends were laughing at me

133
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,590
Also…

134
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,670
You kissed me

135
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,650
Where’s the guy named Ae?

136
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,250
You’re Ae’s friend?

137
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,150
No

138
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:29,930
Huh?

139
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,090
There's no reason for me to be friend with a guy from Thai program

140
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,410
Hey!

141
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,310
Are you here to mess with my friend?

142
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,930
If you’re here to mess with him, I’ll punch you in the face first

143
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,550
Whatever

144
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,590
You’re all pathetic

145
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,790
I don’t like it when other people insult my friend

146
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,330
You can call me stupid, annoying, dirty

147
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,190
Just do it

148
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,790
But you have no rights to insult my friend

149
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,330
What’s your problem?

150
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,530
Why are you so hostile towards everyone?

151
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,870
Who made you become like this?

152
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,890
Did the world hurt you so badly that’s why you become like this?

153
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,270
Maybe I’m like what you said

154
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,490
I said many things

155
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,590
Which one are you referring to?

156
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,430
An unloved child

157
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,930
Are you crazy?

158
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,350
Do you want to die?

159
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,830
Are you too stupid to know that you’re not supposed to cut off like that?

160
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,850
I’m sorry

161
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,290
What?

162
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,330
Please

163
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,390
I’m sorry

164
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,070
I know that I just knew you

165
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,810
I shouldn’t call you an unloved child

166
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,930
I’m sorry

167
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,530
Please

168
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,150
Forgive me

169
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,690
But you started it first

170
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,710
You’re foul-mouthed

171
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,830
But I didn’t mean to blame it on you

172
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,570
It’s my fault

173
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,830
Please don’t be mad at me

174
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,970
Or else I won't be able to sleep tonight. I will have a nightmare for sure

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,130
I don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings

176
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,690
Please

177
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,370
Let’s make peace

178
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,270
What did you do?

179
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,710

202
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,350
Why did you just come back?

203
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,030
I waited for you for such a long time

204
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,510
I miss you

205
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,970
I miss you too

206
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,590
Are you here alone?

207
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,010
Yes

208
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,950
Dad is not here. He’s still at work

209
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,630
Mom went out to see grandmother

210
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,090
I’m so lonely. I’m home alone

211
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,710
Phupha

212
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,150
You’re here

213
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,130
Don’t rush out just like that

214
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,650
I’m already old

215
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,570
I cannot keep up with you

216
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,110
Then don’t follow me

217
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,030
I didn’t ask you to do that

218
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,350
What does she mean by rushing out?

219
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,910
When you abruptly ran out of the room like that

220
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,330
No one’s home?

221
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,630
No one comes back yet

222
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,370
Vadee said she will go to another house first

223
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,810
She left Phupha with me

224
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,990
Everyone left me alone again

225
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,590
Don’t say that, Phupha

226
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,910
Come with me

227
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,250
I don’t want to

228
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,510
I want to stay with uncle Tin

229
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,270
Okay

230
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,310
I will take care of him

231
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,230
Okay

232
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,050
Thank you so much

233
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,330
Let’s go and play over there

234
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,370
Uncle Tin, it wasn't fun at all to hang out with mom

235
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,930
I wanted to come back home

236
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,290
I missed dad

237
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,150
I missed you too, uncle Tin

238
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,570
It’s so cold there

239
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:42,910
Why?

240
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,870
You didn’t have any friends there?

241
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,490
No

242
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,310
I don’t want any friends

243
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,370
I just want dad to hang out with me

244
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,150
Do you feel lonely?

245
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,630
How about you?

246
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,690
Should I be lonely?

247
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,470
Of course

248
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,970
If I'm not here with you

249
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,910
You must think of me, okay?

250
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,110
My hair is messy now

251
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,810
Really?

252
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,610
When will dad come back home?

253
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,130
Why?

254
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,450
Because I miss him

255
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,910
You love him a lot, don’t you?

256
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,210
I love him so much

257
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,090
I love him this much

258
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,030
I love dad so much

259
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,990
I like my name too

260
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,310
Because Phupha means

261
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,090
The love that I have for someone

262
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,500
That love is strong and eternal

263
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,860
Dad!

264
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,620
I miss you so much

265
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,040
I miss you too

266
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,950
Thank you, Tin

267
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,450
For what?

268
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,230
Taking care of my love

269
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,460
Have you eaten yet?

270
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes

271
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,580
Why did I suddenly think of him?

272
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,970
I know now who he’s like

273
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,010
He’s like a 5 years old kid

274
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,430
Hello

275
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,890
I have something for you to search for me

276
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,970
Ae!

277
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,310
Stop it

278
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,090
Are you going to keep drinking until you die?

279
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,650
I will drink until I die. Isn’t that great plan?

280
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,350
Pete won’t be happy to see you like this

281
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,350
He’s not here with me

282
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,250
He’s not here. Do you hear me?

283
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,870
He’s not here with me

284
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,010
I told you to stop

285
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,830
Leave me alone

286
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,070
Damn it

287
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,830
What should I do?

288
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,790
Mai

289
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,550
Right here

290
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,650
What’s up

291
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,830
Can you help me?

292
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,210
I can’t stop him

293
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,750
Hey!

294
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,010
What’s wrong with you, shorty?

295
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,310
I don’t know how long he’s been drinking like this

296
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,930
Normally he never drank

297
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,490
He always took care of his health

298
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,870
Look at him now

299
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,910
All you do is lecturing him

300
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,870
Do you think he will listen?

301
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,090
He’s drunk

302
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,790
What do you expect me to do?

303
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,690
What the hell are you doing, asshole?

304
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,730
Come with me, shorty

305
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,390
What are you doing?

306
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,050
Come with me

307
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,190
Let me go

308
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,980
Mai!

309
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,270
Come here

310
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,950
Get the ball for me, Pond

311
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,750
Just get it

312
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,270
Fine

313
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,550
Keep your eyes on him

314
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,890
Don’t fight with him

315
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,260
He's out of his mind now

316
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,720
I know

317
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,970
Look at my friend

318
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,890
He’s no better than a dog

319
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,430
Just leave me alone, asshole

320
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,350
I don’t want to bother you

321
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,250
If you’re not my friend

322
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,750
Give it to me

323
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,290
What are you going to do?

324
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,230
Wait

325
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,050
Mai, don’t

326
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,450
Mai!

327
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,650
You like to play football, don’t you?

328
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Get up!

329
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,860
Why don’t you come back and play the sport that you love?

330
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,840
How long are you going to let yourself fall apart?

331
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,580
My friend, Ae, won't be weak like this

332
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,410
You’re not a loser before

333
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,810
Do you think your boyfriend will be happy to see you being pathetic like this?

334
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,140
Tell me

335
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,460

377
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,340
Shit! What happened?

378
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,760
Shorty!

379
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,820
How dare you kick me off the bed?

380
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,020
Why not?

381
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,240
How come you’re sleeping on my bed?

382
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,640
Last night

383
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,700
You two wouldn’t stop hugging each other

384
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,060
That’s right

385
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,600
Last night, you hugged me

386
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,220
And something more

387
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,600
Shit! We’re doomed!

388
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,480
How come you’re here?

389
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,360
That dude

390
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,060
Your wife called me to come

391
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,820
He’s not my wife

392
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,080
Where’s your uniform?

393
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,720
Mai

394
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,560
I asked you to help him

395
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,680
Not to add insult to injury

396
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,520
If Pond didn’t threaten me that he will ask Dear to come instead

397
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,420
I won't come here at all

398
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
I didn’t ask for your help

399
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,320
Shorty

400
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,360
You should talk to me nicely

401
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,080
I told you already

402
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,180
I didn’t ask for help

403
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,780
You two, calm down

404
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,600
We’re friends

405
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,220
Ae

406
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,380
What did you tell us what friends are for?

407
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,960
You like to help other people, right?

408
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,380
Then why don’t you care about us?

409
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,020
We are very worried about you

410
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,740
Look at Pond

411
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,660
He’s so freaking worried about you

412
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,100
Have you thought about our friends?

413
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,360
We all know that you’re suffering

414
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,080
Do you think about them?

415
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,720
Do you know how they feel?

416
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,360
Huh?

417
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,020
We are very worried

418
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,880
Shorty

419
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,060
I’m not telling you to stop feeling sad

420
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,580
But please rely on us to help you

421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,920
Understand?

422
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,780
Do you know what makes me angry the most?

423
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,680
You didn’t ask me to drink with you!

424
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,460
Damn it

425
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,440
What a waste

426
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,340
Damn it. You didn't even ask me to join you

427
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,240
How can you do that to me?

428
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
You’re always like this, asshole

429
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,180
You’re going to heal your heart

430
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,000
But you won't let me accompany you?

431
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Damn you

432
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,880
I can’t believe it that you would kick the ball at Ae like that

433
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,720
Because he loves football so much

434
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,840
So, I need to use it to wake him up

435
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,080
Do you think…

436
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,500
he can think clearly now?

437
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,000
I don’t know

438
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,480
Damn you

439
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
I asked you for help

440
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
I don’t know

441
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,680
My job is to get him out of the bar

442
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,220
He’s wasting too much alcohol

443
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
He doesn’t know the pleasure of drinking

444
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,200
Obviously

445
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,780
Who would be such a drunker like you?

446
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,960
Normally it’s Ae who takes you out of the bar

447
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,600
So, you wanted to take a revenge on him, right?

448
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,240
Do you think I don’t know that?

449
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,100
Don't you know who I am?

450
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,860
I'm, Pond, Mr. know it all

451
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,560
You miss it. Come and get me

452
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,500
Come and get me if you dare

453
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Can

454
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,280
Can

455
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,560
What?

456
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Don’t bother me now

457
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,620
I don’t want to lose

458
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,440
Can you come with me?

459
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,460
I don’t want to go. I’m lazy

460
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,180
I’m going shopping. Can you come with me to carry all the stuff?

461
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,300
I don’t want to. I won’t go

462
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,220
It’s my holiday

463
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,980
I’m too lazy

464
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,260
Are you coming or not?

465
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,980
No, I'm not

466
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,800
Fine

467
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,100
I will tell mom

468
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,560
Where you hide the porn magazine

469
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,900
On the bookshelf, second row

470
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,600
Inside your textbook

471
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,380
Mommy

472
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,200
Okay, my lovely sis

473
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,740
Calm down

474
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,140
Tell me where you want to go

475
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,540
I’ll take you there

476
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,900
Come on

477
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Lemon

478
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,620
Do you know what you’re going to buy yet?

479
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,500
What’s the matter?

480
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,460
I cannot accept this

481
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,940
What are you talking about?

482
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,180
What can you not accept?

483
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,080
Pimple is right in front of your face. Can’t you see it yourself?

484
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,920
What are you doing?

485
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,460
Cover up your pimple so you will look more human-like

486
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,580
I don’t want to

487
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,960
I know that I’m stupid but at least I know that you shouldn’t apply makeup when you have pimple

488
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,060
You’re seriously stupid

489
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,020
This one can both reduce and cover pimples

490
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,400
Like this

491
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,140
Apply just a little bit

492
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,900
That’s it

493
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,860
It smoothly covers it

494
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,140
I told you

495
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,100
Well…

496
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,400
Can I have it?

497
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,120
I’ll take it as my reward for carrying stuff for you today

498
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,100
I’m off

499
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,740
It’s mine!

500
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,340
I have to use it to cover my pimple too!

501
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,760
Can!

502
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,960
I want this one

503
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,100
Let's go

504
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,740
Let's pay

505
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,540
Let’s go

506
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,240
Give me your hand

507
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,440
This one seems fun

508
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,840
This one too

509
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
This one!

510
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,660
Can I play?

511
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,220
Please

512
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,080
Can I play, please?

513
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Give me the coin

514
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
This one looks fun

515
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,400
No! Let’s go

516
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,980
Get all the bags and let’s go

517
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,700
Quickly!

518
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
You are too slow

519
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,580
I want to go home now

520
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,800
I’m tired

521
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,900
I’m hungry

522
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Lemon

523
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,420
Why did you buy so many things?

524
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
And you won’t carry anything by yourself

525
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,280
My arms and my back hurt

526
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,140
My arms hurt so much

527
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,340
Every time I see you

528
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,100
Why do you always look so weird?

529
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,880
How come you’re here?

530
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,260
Don’t you have any other question?

531
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,600
You suddenly show up

532
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,740
It’s not a coincidence, right?

533
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
It’s a coincidence

534
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,080
Tell me the truth

535
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,200
Are you here to take revenge because you’re mad at me since last time?

536
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,100
Hey!

537
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,540
Who tell you to sit down?

538
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,420
I want to

539
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,400
Fine

540
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,060
Just do whatever you want

541
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,880
What if it’s not a coincidence?

542
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
What the hell?

543
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,180
You just said it’s a coincidence

544
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,860
What if I tell you that…

545
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,920
I want to see you

546
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,600
What are you going to do?

547
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,900
What’s wrong with you?

548
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,220
I’m just joking

549
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,380
My heart is skipping a beat

550
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
I’m here to do an errand

551
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,500
What are you doing here?

552
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,780
It’s my business

553
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,180
Don’t stick your nose into my business

554
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,440
Who are you here with?

555
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,820
I told you

556
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,260
Don’t stick your nose into my business

557
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,180
Have you eaten yet?

558
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,260
Tin

559
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,960
I’m hungry

560
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,040
Tin

561
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,340
I told you not to bother me

562
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,360
That’s right

563
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,820
These are my girlfriend’s stuff

564
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,900
Girlfriend?

565
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,220
Why not?

566
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,840
Do you think someone like me don’t have a girlfriend?

567
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,260
You should go back where you came from

568
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,980
Can!

569
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
Where were you?

570
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,080
I called you but you didn’t pick up the phone

571
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,140
Opps

572
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,800
Hello

573
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,600
You are Can's friend?

574
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,080
I’m Lemon

575
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,640
I am Can’s sister

576
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,960
Sister?

577
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,500
Not girlfriend?

578
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,640
No!

579
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,240
Of course not!

580
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,720
Just sister

581
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,860
A guy like him cannot find any girlfriend

582
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,810
Give me that

583
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,270
Look up and look into my eyes

584
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,650
Look up!

585
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,630
You can cry only because of me

586
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,930
