1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,560
Don't be naughty like that boy.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,360
I'm not naughty like that younger brother.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,700
A naughty child...

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,480
that no one wants.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,200
Why don't you tell him

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,960
who made him become like that?

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,320
I used to think that my brother

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,360
was everything to me.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,860

Do you think I’m pathetic?

31

Who told you that?

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,040
Tell me who.

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,740
I’ll punch that person in the face.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,040
I really despise your brother now.

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,360
How can he do that to his brother?

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,240
I have one sister.

37
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,940
No matter how mean she is to me,

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
but if someone hurts her,

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll fight for her.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
I’ll punch that person in the face.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,860
Thank you.

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,940
For what?

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,800
I didn’t do anything.

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,060
You did.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,360
What did I do?

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,520
Staying by my side.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Okay.

48
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,760
I’ll be right here.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,500
What’s wrong?

50
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,180
I’m angry at your brother!

51
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,840
I'll hit him in the face when I see him.

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Promise me.

53
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,320
Promise you what?

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
If you meet my brother,

55
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,020
don’t mess with him.

56
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
You’ll never know

57
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,900
what he’s going to do to you.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
But…

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Promise me.

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,300
Fine.

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
I’ll try to do that.

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,460
But Tin,

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,380
to deal with your brother,

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,780
it should be an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,620
That’s what my captain taught me.

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,240
Tit for tat.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,600
By the way,

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,840
I’m sorry.

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,820
I didn’t let you go inside the house.

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,420
It’s already late. Everyone’s probably sleeping.

71
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,240
Lay will stab me if we make noise.

72
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,340
I don’t want to die yet.

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,180
Tin!

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,200
This is enough.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,000
You should go inside.

76
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,000
It’s already late.

77
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,580
You kissed me without permission again.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,740
Go now.

79
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,740
Tin!

80
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,120
Go back inside the house now.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,460
It’s late.

82
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,500
Good night.

83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,940
Alright.

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
You should go back too.

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,840
If he does something to you,

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,640
punch him in the face.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Okay?

88
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,060
I’m going to bed then.

89
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,700
Thank you.

90
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,060
Mom, I’m back.

91
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,980
Don’t make that face.

92
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
I’m okay.

93
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,640
It's okay, son.

94
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,780
I’m right here.

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,180
Okay.

96
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,700
Hey, crybaby.

97
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,780
What are you guys doing here?

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
We’re here to console you,

99
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,160
our little shorty.

100
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,260
What the hell are you guys doing here again?

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,960
We come here to visit you.

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
We see each other every day.

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
I have to see you on weekend too?

104
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Ae.

105
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,880
It’s a blessing that you get to see my handsome face every day.

106
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
He's just nosy about your life.

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,780
And you just want to drink.

108
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,480
At least I’m better than you who doesn’t know the pleasure of drinking.

109
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,460
What’s wrong with you two?

110
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,940
You guys always fight.

111
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,380
I don’t know if it’s the right decision that I asked Mai to come.

112
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,400
Who will you ask instead?

113
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
Do you think other people can deal with Ae?

114
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,360
Even you can’t do that.

115
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,420
That hurts.

116
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,280
Enough, will you?

117
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,960
I’ll give you a punch.

118
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,600
If you dare.

119
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Why not?

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,340
I'll run away first.

121
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,620
Dude.

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,960
Ae is laughing now.

123
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,020
I want to cry.

124
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
This is his first laugh after many months.

125
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank God.

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,060
You’re overacting.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,440
Finally, he laughs.

128
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,380
You guys should keep your nose out of my business.

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,720
Hey.

130
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Our Ae is back.

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
That’s right.

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,360
We should take a photo.

133
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,680
Our old Ae finally comes back.

134
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,240
You’re overacting again.

135
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,820
Can’t you do that for me?

136
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,340
Fine.

137
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,200
Let’s take a photo.

138
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,200
One. Two. Three.

139
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,740
(My friends come to see me today.)

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,860
(I go back home today.)

141
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,840
(I have a quiz today.)

142
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
(I go back to practice football today.)

143
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,160
He posts it again.

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,780
He’s a very interesting guy.

145
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,140
Let me take a break.

146
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm out of energy.

147
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,400
(I’m waiting in front of the field.)

148
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,860
Tin, are you okay?

149
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
You brother didn’t hurt you, right?

150
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,500
Are you worried?

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course.

152
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,180
You're so sad last time when you came to see me.

153
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,520
I thought you'll be in trouble.

154
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,820
So, there’s nothing wrong

155
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,160
but you just want me to come out?

156
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,560
Why are you like this?

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,700
What did you just do?

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,920
Here.

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,460
Tin!

160
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,140
I told you.

161
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,920
Money can’t buy you.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,980
I know that.

163
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
I’m not giving it for free.

164
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,020
What are you doing?

165
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,280
You always like to kiss me.

166
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Since you won't give it for free,

167
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,260
then I'll let you kiss me wherever you like.

168
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,420
What are you doing?

169
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,360
You already paid me back.

170
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,940
Since when?

171
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,020
Remind me next time

172
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,740
that I shouldn’t do it when you’re sweating.

173
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,200
It’s salty.

174
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,180
I’ve got to go now. I have class.

175
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,740
I’ll call you later.

176
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,740
Don’t call me.

177
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
I won’t pick up.

178
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,340
You have to.

179
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,540
Why do I feel ticklish like I want to poop every time he does this?

180
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
Can, stop thinking.

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,020
Stop thinking.

182
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
This looks yummy.

183
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,860
Damn it.

184
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,020
The exam was freaking hard.

185
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,940
I couldn’t do it.

186
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,820
Can you do it?

187
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,500
Easy.

188
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,160
For me?

189
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,680
It’s my favorite.

190
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
I’ll eat it now.

191
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,200
This is for Techno not for you.

192
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,400
Do you have to come all the way here to his university?

193
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,020
Just give it to him before he goes to practice.

194
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,620
What do I get in return?

195
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,360
You have to cheer on me

196
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,420
and I’ll give you what you want.

197
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,300
Deal?

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,900
If you say so.

199
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,540
Just go.

200
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
If you say so.

201
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,660
Technic.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,340
Kengkla asked me to give you this.

204
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,560
He knows that you like to eat it.

205
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,840
So he bought it for you.

206
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:43,200
(I want to be your favorite like this Bento.)

207
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,760
You’re turning red.

208
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,340
I think this flavor must be very spicy.

209
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,420
Shut up, Technic.

210
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,100
You won’t eat it?

211
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
You come here just to give me this?

212
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,080
Why don’t you eat it now?

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,240
Why is your face so red?

214
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,180
You can leave now.

215
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,020
You already gave it to me.

216
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,900
I have to study.

217
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,960
You’ll give it to me for sure?

218
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,800
Of course. I’m a man of my word.

219
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,920
You have to help me just a little bit.

220
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,260
Tell me then.

221
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,940
You have to let me play the next match.

222
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,420
I want to show off.

223
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,460
You want to show that pretty nurse?

224
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,900
That’s right.

225
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,080
Fine.

226
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,040
Now, give me the movie tickets.

227
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,000
You’re awesome.

228
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,560
Here.

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,960
What the hell, Can?

230
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,900
Yeah. What's wrong with you?

231
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,500
Why are sneaking up on us?

232
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,080
What if I have a heart attack?

233
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,260
Where’s the ticket for me?

234
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,380
None for you.

235
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,860
Why not? Why you only gave it to Techno?

236
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,780
Fine! I’ll tell everyone that Techno is taking bribes.

237
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,560
He likes to take free stuff from others.

238
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,220
Shut up! Stop talking so loudly. Others will hear you.

239
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,420
Can!

240
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,880
Tin.

241
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,540
How come you’re here?

242
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,120
Come with me.

243
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,700
Stop pulling me. It hurts.

244
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,760
Are you the son of rickshaw puller?

245
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,220
What did I do?

246
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,800
Why did he look at me like he wants to kill me?

247
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,720
Do you know why?

248
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,320
How am I supposed to know?

249
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
I’m with you all the time.

250
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,760
Whatever.

251
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,420
As long as I have excuses to get out of the house,

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,600
then I've got nothing to worry about.

253
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,320
No need to worry about Can.

254
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,080
Wait.

255
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,820
Why do you have to run away from home?

256
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,340
Well…

257
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Why’s that?

258
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,160
I don’t think you have to know everything, Job.

259
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,540
What’s wrong with him?

260
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,440
Techno, wait for me!

261
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,540
The football field at night is so scary.

262
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,120
Tin, slow down.

263
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,600
Can’t you see that my legs and your legs have a different length?

264
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Why did you suddenly stop walking?

265
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,360
What’s wrong? Why are you so grumpy?

266
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,040
You should smile.

267
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,020
When you’re with me, you have to smile more.

268
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,380
I like to be with people who are in a good mood.

269
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,780
Does that mean you like that guy?

270
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,640
You mean Techno?

271
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,500
Of course.

272
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,660
I really like Techno.

273
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
He’s a nice person.

274
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
He always scolds me, but he still buys me food.

275
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,320
Anyway, I’m still angry at them.

276
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,920
Job asked Techno to the movies but he didn’t ask me.

277
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,140
Then you suddenly came in and interrupted us.

278
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,240
I almost got a free ticket.

279
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,740
Do you want to watch a movie at my house?

280
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,040
What do you say?

281
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,380
You’re actually rich.

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,560
So, have you decided what movie do you want to watch?

283
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
There’re so many movies that I want to watch.

284
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,500
I want to watch a zombie movie.

285
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,320
The new horror movie seems fun too.

286
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,020
But if I watch all of it,

287
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,580
then I don't think I can go back home.

288
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Don’t go back then.

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,380
I can’t.

290
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,560
My mom makes steamed rice noodle rolls today.

291
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,500
I already asked a chef to prepare a full course Italian dinner.

292
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,220
Italian…

293
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,800
Full course.

294
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Let me eat it too.

295
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,240
Good.

296
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,820
This sounds more like a date.

297
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,100
How can it be a date?

298
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
We’re just hanging out.

299
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,880
Watching movies then eating dinner.

300
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,860
Even the most stupid people know that it’s a date.

301
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,740
Movie.

302
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,540
Dinner.

303
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,200
Let’s go.

304
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,500
Let’s go on a date.

305
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,940
How can it be a date?

306
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,760
I really don’t like your brother.

307
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,700
Uncle Tin!

308
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,340
You’re home today.

309
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,000
You’ll stay home with me, right? I’m so lonely

310
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,380
Yes.

311
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,620
This is your brother’s son.

312
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,080
How are you?

313
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,800
Are you a bad person like your dad?

314
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,420
Don't insult my dad. He's a good person.

315
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,820
He has a great personality.

316
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,780
Are you sure?

317
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Maybe he's evil.

318
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,900
Uncle Tin.

319
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,880
He insulted dad.

320
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,600
He insulted my daddy.

321
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,140
Why are you looking at me like that?

322
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,740
It's not Phupha or his mom's fault.

323
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,240
If I want to take revenge,

324
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,200
it will be on my brother only.

325
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,540
Fine.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,960
Well…

327
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,780
Let’s make up.

328
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,000
You insulted my dad.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,040
I’m mad at you now.

330
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,060
Come on.

331
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,400
Are you a good kid?

332
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,520
If you are, you have to make up with me.

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,420
I’m a good kid.

334
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,500
You’re lonely, right?

335
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,540
I’ll play with you all day long.

336
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,780
Tin.

337
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,140
You already sent your nephew to bed?

338
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
I like you.

339
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,180
I know that.

340
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,700
I’m hitting on you.

341
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,600
So what?

342
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,760
I am hitting on you now.

343
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,300
I already know that.

344
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,900
Why do you keep saying that?

345
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,860
Just do whatever you want.

346
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,640
You can hit on me.

347
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,940
You can like me.

348
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,460
I just…

349
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I still don’t know.

350
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,180
I don’t know if I’m okay with you or not.

351
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,580
What are you doing?

352
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,540
Collecting interest.

353
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,660
What interest?

354
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,100
Interest from all the food you ate.

355
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,780
You’re going to kiss me again?

356
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,080
Fine.

357
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,960
Can.

358
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,200
Open your mouth.

359
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,040
No!

360
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,420
Open it.

361
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,360
I said no!

362
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,880
I like you.

363
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,920
What’s wrong with you?

364
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,740
You crazy!

365
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,760
Hey! Tum.

366
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,500
Why do you stop?

367
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
I’ll be right back.

368
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,460
What?

369
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,460
What’s wrong with him?

370
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,540
Do you know, Keen?

371
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,160
It’s probably about his brother.

372
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,120
I’ll be right back.

373
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,880
Okay.

374
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,900
Okay.

375
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Take care of yourself.

376
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,180
That’s all.

377
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,140
Okay.

378
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,400
Is your brother okay?

379
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,840
Did I tell you that it’s my brother?

380
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,300
No. I just guess it.

381
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,780
Nothing’s wrong.

382
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,240
He texted me that

383
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,340
he couldn’t contact mom.

384
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,260
I thought it was a big deal,

385
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
but nothing serious.

386
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,300
I must be crazy.

387
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,840
You’re not crazy.

388
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,840
You’re just worried about your brother.

389
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,540
There’s only you who understand me.

390
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,300
Well…

391
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,440
Do you want to understand me too?

392
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,480
What do you want me to understand?

393
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,720
Whatever.

394
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,980
About your inspiration.

395
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
I found this guy.

396
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
I think he’s quite interesting.

397
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,120
How?

398
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Hello, Tum.

399
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,940
Hello, Tar.

400
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,000
I have something to tell you.

401
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,320
What is it?

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,840
I have a long holiday and I’m planning to go back.

403
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,620
When?

404
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,880
I’m going back soon.

405
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,140
But I haven’t booked the ticket yet.

406
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,780
Will you be free to pick me up?

407
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,820
It’s okay if you’re not. I can go home by myself.

408
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
I’m a grown-up now.

409
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,920
I’m also much better than before.

410
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,480
How are you lately? Are you doing well?

411
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,740
Not too bad.

412
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,020
How about you?

413
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,600
I’m fine. No need to worry.

414
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,900
I have the same question for you.

415
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,980
What is it?

416
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,720
Do you want anything from here?

417
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,920
I have the same answer for you.

418
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,300
I don’t want anything.

419
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,640
I’ll ask our parents if they want anything.

420
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,120
Okay.

421
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,520
Anyway, I’ll let you know once I get a flight back home.

422
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,300
Sure.

423
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,200
Also, there will be a music festival in my university.

424
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,920
Let’s go together.

425
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,440
Of course. I’m free to go.

426
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,780
See you later then.

427
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,040
Okay.

428
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,420
Bye bye.

429
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
What’s up, my good boy?

430
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,920
Why are you still up?

431
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,040
I’m not sleepy yet. I'm the best.

432
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,880
My good boy, what did you do today?

433
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,760
I was fighting with Uncle Tin's friend and I won.

434
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,300
He said you're a bad person.

435
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,720
I couldn’t let him say that.

436
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm a good boy, right?

437
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,560
My son,

438
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,600
why don’t you tell me about uncle Tin’s friend?

439
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,700
Of course!

440
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,860
You can trust me on that.

441
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,980
Search about Tin's friend, Can, for me.

442
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,160
I want to know who is Tin's important person.

443
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,560
I hope you won't be angry.

444
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,700
Ae.

445
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,080
What is love?

446
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,880
Why are you asking me?

447
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,720
I’m just wondering.

448
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,540
Right now, I feel…

449
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,380
I feel that the food is not tasty.

450
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,620
I can’t sleep well at night.

451
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,720
I’m struggling to poop.

452
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,440
I’ve been thinking all the time if I like him or not.

453
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,940
That’s why I’m wondering what is love actually?

454
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,220
I don’t know what love means to others.

455
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,560
But for me.

456
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,220
It means Pete.

457
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,000
I’m sorry.

458
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,820
It’s okay.

459
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
I’m sorry that I can’t give you the right answer.

460
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,480
Try to think it over.

461
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,300
You can do it.

462
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,220
Why all I can see is pain?

463
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
I don’t want to be like you, Ae.

464
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,740
Cantaloupe.

465
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,720
I told you not to call me by my full name.

466
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,620
Call me Can. Just Can.

467
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,640
“Just Can.”

468
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,780
Are you messing with me?

469
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,360
Why are you smiling?

470
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,860
Why are you hiding from me?

471
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Who told you that?

472
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,180
I didn’t do that.

473
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,860
Who’s hiding from you?

474
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,860
You’re overthinking.

475
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,240
You do.

476
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
But I’m glad.

477
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,160
Why are you happy about that?

478
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,800
Are you crazy?

479
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,260
Because that means you’re actually thinking about me.

480
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,540
It’s all in your head.

481
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,980
I’m not thinking about you at all.

482
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,400
Where are you taking me?

483
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,580
Let's find somewhere quiet to talk.

484
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,640
I won’t go.

485
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,980
If you want to talk, let’s do it here.

486
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,060
What is it?

487
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,820

Calm down, Can.

495
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,020
Stop imagining things.

496
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,840

What’s wrong with Can?

498
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,300
He’s practicing very hard.

499
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,920
Does he want to win a world championship?

500
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,300
If you’re worried, why don’t you go in?

501
