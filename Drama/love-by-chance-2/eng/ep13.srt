Can I hug you one last time?

2
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:05,116
My brother and his wife got a divorce.

3
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:07,432
I've made up for all of my mistakes.

4
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:09,850
Good morning, Tul.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,879

What the hell?

9
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:23,572
You miss me, right?

10
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:29,348
And I can see that there's someone here
who's ready to walk forward with you.

11
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:30,536
Over there.

12
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,121
What are you filming?

13
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,789
The message I want to send to him.

14
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:12,734
Hello, I...

15
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,431
Never mind.

16
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,270

(6 months later.)

40
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:44,400
Hey, wake up, I'm gonna...

41
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,806
Why are you so handsome?

42
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,916
I've slept with you many times.

43
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,713
Why have I never noticed?

44
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,108
You just realized that?

45
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,413
That you've got an amazing boyfriend.

46
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,044
Where did you get all the confidence from?

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,195
It's true, isn't it?

48
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:14,155
Yeah, I won't argue with you.

49
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,525
You should get up now.

50
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:16,705
I have to go to university early.

51
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:19,059
There's a student orientation for our
soccer team and I'm already running late.

52
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,012
I was gonna go home yesterday,
but you kept whining for me to stay.

53
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:26,899
Me?

54
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,831
Are you sure I was the one whining?

55
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,126
Well I wanted to stay a bit, too.

56
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,701
Hurry up!

57
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,698
Okay, I'm up.

58
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,915
Give me a minute.

59
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,837
Hurry up, okay?
I'll make you some toast while I wait.

60
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:43,600
Hurry, get up!

61
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,786
Get up now!

62
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:08,954
Thanks for sending me off.

63
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,020
See you.

64
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:11,412
Cantaloupe.

65
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:14,975
You're always like this.

66
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,750
You always call me by my full name.

67
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,150
I won't get shy about it anymore.

68
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,834
Every time we sleep together,
you always call me by my full name.

69
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,123
Can you remember what day is next week?

70
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,994
Next week...?

71
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,129
Tuesday!

72
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,678
Today is Tuesday,
so in a week it will also be Tuesday.

73
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:39,234
You really can't remember?

74
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,795
Why...

75
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,316
Am I supposed to remember something?

76
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,468
Aren't you running late?

77
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:50,822
You should go.

78
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,229
Okay. See you.

79
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,817
Did I say something wrong?

80
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:05,686
I don't think so.

81
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:06,994
Whatever.

82
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,359
No. I won't talk to you.
I want to talk to my dad.

83
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:23,476
But today, Tul might come home late.

84
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,417
Can you tell me?

85
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:30,160
If I can't talk to my dad,
then I want to talk to Tin.

86
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,725
I want to talk to Can.

87
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,318
Then next time I will tell Can for you.

88
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,219
But today,

89
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,887
if you need anything, can you tell me?

90
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,373
No. I don't want to talk to you.

91
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:45,873
Why?

92
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:47,663
Because I don't like you.

93
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,721
Why don't you like me?

94
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,239
I don't know.

95
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,483
I don't care.

96
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:58,839
Phu.

97
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,426
Stop nagging me.

98
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,910
I already told you that
I don't want to talk to you.

99
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,106
Phu.

100
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:06,947
Speak to him nicely.

101
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,594
Dad is back!

102
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:20,477
I'm back.

103
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,993
But someone told me you're misbehaving.

104
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,980
I'm not misbehaving.

105
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:29,744
Then why are you not calling Hin "uncle"?

106
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,116
How can you call him "you"?

107
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,851
Because granny told me,

108
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,921
I could call anyone in this house
however I want.

109
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:41,044
But I've never taught you
to be impolite to others.

110
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,008
You even call granny Glin as granny.

111
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,032
Again.

112
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,113
What again?

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,695
You're siding with uncle Hin again.

114
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,344
You don't love me anymore.

115
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,058
I don't like uncle Hin.

116
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,836
Because you love him.

117
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,046
You have to love me.

118
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,311
Please don't love uncle Hin.

119
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,980
Phu.

120
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,990
Your dad loves you a lot.

121
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,602
He loves you more than anyone else.

122
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,322
He loves you the most in the whole world.

123
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,830
And not only your dad,

124
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,322
but everyone else in this house
also loves you a lot.

125
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:26,611
You too, uncle Hin?

126
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,418
Yes.

127
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,837
I also love you a lot.

128
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,886
Dad. I'm sleepy.

129
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,707
You stubborn child.

130
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,394
I'm going to put him to bed.

131
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,256
Come on.

132
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:43,513
Let's get you to bed.

133
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,252
Is Phu already asleep?

134
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:27,248
Hey.

135
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:28,956
I told you many times already...

136
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,316
that you don't need to use honorifics
when calling my son.

137
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:34,903
But he doesn't like me.

138
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:39,811
He doesn't like anyone
who gets too close to his mom or dad.

139
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:41,806
But I believe that someday,

140
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:45,503
he'll realize that you're
the most important person in my life.

141
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,016
The more you say things like this,
the more your son will hate me.

142
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:58,440
How many years did it take
for me to accept that I love you?

143
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,152
Twenty years.

144
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,930
My son and I
won't easily accept that we love someone.

145
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,831
But if we do,
then we'll love them with all our heart.

146
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,228
Wait.

147
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,130
You have documents
that you need to look over...

148
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,642
before the meeting tomorrow.

149
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:31,827
This is way past working hours,
Mr Secretary.

150
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,511
My free time
must be used for doing something else.

151
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:39,851
But the documents...

152
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,029
Tul!

153
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,070
Here, here. You hold it like this.

154
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,029
C.

155
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,376
-Like this?
-Yeah.

156
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,231
Okay, like that.

157
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,514
Another one, below.

158
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,629
Yeah.

159
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:02,399
Got it?

160
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:04,996
What are you guys doing?

161
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:10,012
You guys are sitting so close.

162
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,563
How is this close?

163
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,487
Then I'll head back first.

164
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,043
-Already?
-Yeah.

165
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,620
I have soccer practice with my friends.

166
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,986
Oh, okay.

167
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:31,156
-See you later.
-Yeah, okay.

168
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,486
-Bye.
-See you.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,142
Was he here for a long time already?

170
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,650
Yeah, a while already.

171
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,083
About an hour.

172
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,494
What's up?

173
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,094
You look kind of irritated.

174
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,705
Is it about Tar?

175
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,610
No.

176
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,075
It has nothing to do with Tar.

177
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:57,651
Then?

178
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:00,707
It's about you.

179
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,843
What?

180
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,165
Me?

181
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,320
It's nothing, Forget about it.

182
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,900
Tell me!

183
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,514
Tell me.

184
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,045
Please?

185
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:14,876
What's wrong?

186
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,409
Nothing.

187
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,757
Don't worry about it.

188
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:21,826
Okay.

189
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,456
Next week...

190
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,574
What day is so important next week?

191
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,400
The day mom makes Chicken Rice?

192
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,107
But Tin doesn't like Chicken Rice...

193
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,457
This is giving me a headache!
I have no idea what's happening next week.

194
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,172
What is it?

195
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,196
Can.

196
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,188
Can!

197
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,587
Techno!

198
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,937
What is wrong with you?

199
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:03,078
If I get a heart attack,
how are you going to take responsibility?

200
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,060
Wouldn't that be good?

201
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,506
The earth will have one less crazy person
like you.

202
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,779
Crazy stupid... Do you even love me?

203
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,697
I have to love you?

204
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,346
Whatever.

205
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,413
I don't want to hear it anymore.

206
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,933
Anyways, you graduated ages ago.

207
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:20,468
Why do you keep coming back here?

208
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:23,577
Seriously, don't you have any work to do?

209
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:26,026
Ouch!

210
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,079
Of course I have work to do.

211
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,193
I'm just here to visit the coach...

212
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,458
and ran into you by accident.

213
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:33,785
So, what's wrong?

214
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,320
It's Tin...

215
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,408
I don't know why he's angry at me.

216
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,418
I wouldn't know even if you ask me.

217
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,318
I knew it.

218
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,025
Talking to you is such a waste of time.

219
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,866
Even asking Ae
would be so much more helpful.

220
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,590
Such a waste of time.

221
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,786
Hey, Can!

222
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,266
Come back here!

223
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:01,981
Do you still think of me as your brother?

224
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,383
Can!

225
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm getting irritated, and
who the hell's texting me at this time?

226
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:30,926
Techno!

227
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,510
Have you finished talking to the coach?

228
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,207
Yeah, I'm done.

229
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,748
But really,
you didn't have to come pick me up.

230
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:39,524
Techno.

231
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:40,977
I really wanted to come pick you up.

232
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:42,316
Please let me come pick you up.

233
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,815
Okay, fine.

234
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,230
You can pick me up.

235
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,368
Really?

236
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,346
Too close, Kla, too close.

237
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,566
Move back a bit.

238
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,873
Since you said you wanted to make up
for your mistakes, I'll let you.

239
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:05,347
But you have to promise me
that from now on,

240
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:06,689
you won't lie to me again.

241
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,131
Of course!

242
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:10,403
I promise!

243
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:13,135
Your hand, Kla, your hand.

244
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,806
You're cute.

245
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,069
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

246
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:30,715
Hey.

247
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,614
Didn't you say you're here to pick me up?

248
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:33,855
Hurry up!

249
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,627
Okay!

250
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:06,639
Phu, do you want some ice cream?

251
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,685
No. I don't want to eat it.

252
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,719
Phu still hasn't warmed up to you yet?

253
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,673
Tin!

254
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:31,235
As soon as you came back,
you became my brother's secretary.

255
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,016
You've even completed
all projects you were given.

256
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,256
But with such a small child,

257
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,930
you still can't win him over?

258
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,789
What about you?

259
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:45,380
What's the matter?

260
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:48,089
I'm sulking because of my dad.

261
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,399
Why?

262
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:53,244
Dad doesn't listen to me.

263
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,364
Then...

264
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,075
Can you tell me?

265
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,917
I want to go to the beach!

266
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,325
With just your dad?

267
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,017
With my dad. With you. With Can.

268
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,710
With everyone!

269
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,334
What about Hin?

270
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,732
Hin can come too.

271
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,359
Really?

272
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,668
Who's talking to you?
I'm going to get some ice cream.

273
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,713
He's just a haughty kid.

274
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:47,320
Isn't that the same for everyone
in your family?

275
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,964
My mom wanted to know...

276
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,390
Since next week is your birthday,

277
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,631
is there anything in particular
that you wanted to eat?

278
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,407
I think I want to devour the person
who forgot my birthday.

279
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:14,648
Whatever.

280
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,075
I need to go take a shower
before having a talk with my dad.

281
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,820
He really acts
like the rest of his family.

282
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,731
You forgot Tin's birthday?

283
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,309
Can!

284
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,123
You pea-brain!

285
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,857
How can you forget Tin's birthday?

286
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:43,689
And you even had to ask me.

287
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,157
Lay.

288
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:48,505
How did you even remember Tin's birthday?

289
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,520
Because I have a stupid brother like you.

290
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,438
If I don't remember it,

291
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:54,973
you'll probably get dumped!

292
00:18:57,287 --> 00:19:00,392
I still want
to have a handsome brother like Tin.

293
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,586
So, what are you gonna do?

294
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:07,884
I really have no idea, damn it.

295
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,287
You have to help me, okay?

296
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,809
Please!

297
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,859
Otherwise, I'm probably gonna die!

298
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:16,092
My brain is going to fall out
from all this shaking.

299
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,114
Lay.

300
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:24,018
I really have no idea
what Tin sees in you.

301
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,230
When it was your birthday,

302
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,155
Tin gave you a really pretty bouquet
and took you to dinner.

303
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,042
Plus he gave you a huge present.

304
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,488
Oh, not to mention the condominium that
he bought for you guys to live together.

305
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,734
But you're always running away
and coming back home.

306
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,236
The more I think about it,
the more I'm angry at you.

307
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,262
This time you can find a way yourself.

308
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:46,597
No, no, please help me.
I'll do anything you want.

309
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,802
Anything?

310
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,180
Yes.

311
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:53,458
Then...

312
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:55,639
You need to start
with taking Tin to dinner.

313
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,377
Have you seen his meals?

314
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,797
I wouldn't be able to afford that.

315
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,225
Buy him something he likes.

316
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,426
Like a watch, or maybe some perfume.
The thing he uses.

317
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:05,825
That will cost more than the money
mom gives me for the whole month.

318
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,579
Go find a way yourself then!

319
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,239
No! I can't. You have to help me!

320
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,611
Please. Please. Please.

321
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,417
Fine.

322
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,934
There's still one method left.

323
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,018
But...

324
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:23,089
I have no money.

325
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,131
I know.

326
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:27,422
This method will not cost you any money.

327
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,449
And I know you can do it.

328
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:42,871
You're done for!

329
00:20:56,765 --> 00:21:02,899
(Tin, don't come back yet.)

330
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:05,097
(Why?)

331
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:08,242
(Please, I just need an hour.)

332
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,092
Fire! Fire! Shit! Shit!

333
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,324
Shit!

334
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,484
Can, what happened?

335
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,575
Tin.

336
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,062
Why are you here?

337
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,052
What are you looking at?

338
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,125
Stop staring.

339
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,458
What's this smell?

340
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:00,258
Dinner.

341
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:09,294
What are you doing?

342
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,226
Since it's my birthday,

343
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,660
I'm going to unwrap my present.

344
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,295
Wait a minute.

345
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,854
Wait for what?

346
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,220
Well...

347
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,667
Do you want to have dinner first?

348
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,409
Or maybe take a shower first?

349
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:38,534
Or...

350
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:40,824
Do you want to eat me first?

351
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,690
Lay told me...

352
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:49,656
that if I do this,
you'll probably like it.

353
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,242
Then I want to take my time...

354
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:07,799
unwrapping my present first.

491
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:11,385
Techno ditched me.

492
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:13,989
Told me he'd grab something to eat with me
but ended up ditching me.

493
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,541
Okay, wait a minute.

494
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:16,611

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,515

497
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,819
Hey. I know this show.

498
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah.
They're announcing the results soon.

499
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:40,092
And the contestant
who will pass onto the next round is...

500
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,111
B06! Alex Good!

501
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:44,467
What the hell.

502
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:47,411
This show is cheating.

503
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,056
B02 sings so much better.

504
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:50,762
B06 clearly has a privilege.

505
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:54,017
Man! I voted for B02 so much.
How did he lose?

506
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,072
Man!

507
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,920
I don't want to watch it anymore.

508
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:00,075
Why are you doing here?

509
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,110
Oh, Tin.

510
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:03,672
I'm his friend...

511
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,086
Job got stood up by Techno.

512
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,620
So he's here instead.

513
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,341
And what were you screaming about?

514
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,901
This show! They're cheating!

515
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:19,698
The one we voted for sung so much better.

516
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,068
We voted for him so much.
I don't understand how he lost.

517
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,039
The one who passed sucks.

518
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,376
Even I can sing better than him.

519
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:28,175
Really?

520
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,315
Yeah.

521
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,598
You're so into it?

522
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,042
And you know how to sing?

523
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:34,271
Tin.

524
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,345
I know how to sing.

525
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:37,669
And I'm definitely better than this guy.

526
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:39,203

00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:09,353
♪Oh, oh, I love you♪

550
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:11,161
How is it? Was it good?

551
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,480
At this level,
we don't need to watch this show anymore.

552
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,389
-Let's go and debut.
-Let's form a band!

553
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,568
We have three people.
Tin, do you want to join?

554
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,342
Just go ahead.

555
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:31,358
Sea, I'm here!

556
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,360
The sea comes with alcohol drinks!

557
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,037
Drinks, I'm here!

558
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:36,185
What the hell.

559
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:37,881
Are drinks the first thing
that comes to your mind?

560
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,726
-Are you not gonna drink?
-Of course I will!

561
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:41,212
That's the spirit!

562
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,737
I'll drink until the ocean is on fire!

563
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,261
I'll drink until I can float in the ocean!

564
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:47,287
I'll drink until I drown
and you'll have to come rescue me!

565
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,148
I'll drink until you die.

566
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:51,653
Okay. Then we'll both die together.

567
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,454
Wow.

568
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,967
I'm happy.

569
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,757
It's so pretty!

570
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:00,273
Tin. Are you done?

571
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:01,822
I want to go play already.

572
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,379
Can you calm down?

573
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,762
But we're at the beach!

574
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:09,582
Cantaloupe.

575
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,089
You need to start looking after yourself.

576
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,491
You need to start using sunscreen
when you're at the beach.

577
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:27,395
It's not just about your looks.

578
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,324
But you need to take care of your health.

579
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:33,582
Got it?

580
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:35,232
Yeah.

581
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,256
Here.

582
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:39,333
Done.

583
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:40,388
You can go now.

584
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,735
No, no, no.

585
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,437
I won't fall for your sexiness.

586
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,047
I want to play in the sea.

587
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:58,525
What are you talking about?

588
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:00,429
Go, then.

589
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:02,582
I'm waiting for...

590
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:03,998
Huh?

591
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:06,425
It's already dried?

592
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:07,814
And it's not sticky at all.

593
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:12,285
I always choose the best things for you.

594
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:15,055
Come here.

595
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:16,336
I'll put sunscreen on for you.

596
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:37,893
Tin.

597
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:42,462
Why is your heart beating so fast?

598
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,833
When I'm with you,

599
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:49,031
it will always beat this fast.

600
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,379
Yeah.

601
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:55,665
Same here.

602
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:06,313
Wow!

603
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,258
What's this?

604
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:10,188
Oh, it's a sand castle!

605
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,114
I build it myself.

606
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:13,333
Good job.

607
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,271
Stay with Hin first, okay?

608
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,134
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

609
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:40,602
Hin.

610
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:42,613
Yes?

611
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:44,517
Don't steal dad away from me.

612
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:48,839
Well then...

613
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:52,247
Can I stay and look after you
and your dad instead?

614
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:55,150
Look after me?

615
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:59,210
Yeah.
I'll stay and take care of you guys.

616
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,535
Only taking care of us, right?

617
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:06,154
If it's like that,
I can stay with you guys, right?

618
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:07,772
Why?

619
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,042
So I can look after both of you.

620
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:12,259
Let me think about it first.

621
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:16,480
Phupha.

622
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:19,471
Don't interrupt me. I need to think!

623
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:23,065
I know how to bake.

624
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,143
I can also play with you.

625
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,646
And I can protect you.

626
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,194
Can you hit Can?

627
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,317
What?

628
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:43,996
If you hit Can, will it hurt him?

629
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:46,570
Can always teases me.

630
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,308
If I hit him, of course it will hurt.

631
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:52,387
Then you can stay with us.

632
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:55,812
But you have to hit Can
really, really hard!

633
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,241
What are you guys talking about?

634
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:10,517
Dad, Hin said he will stay with me.

635
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:16,160
That's right.

636
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:18,048
We'll stay together.

637
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:22,936
Daddy! It's stuffy! It's hot!

638
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,077
Tin.

639
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:44,457
Peel the shrimps for me.

640
00:43:45,982 --> 00:43:47,155
Do it yourself.

641
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,296
I'm tired.

642
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:51,377
I just had a fight with Phu.

643
00:43:51,468 --> 00:43:54,008
The more he grows up,
the more precocious he gets.

644
00:43:54,594 --> 00:43:56,520
And both you and your brother
gives him whatever he wants.

645
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,451
If I'm not here,
he'll definitely become self-centered.

646
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:01,289
So peel the shrimps for me.

647
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:04,413
So what?

648
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,358
I'm not tired at all?

649
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:08,431
I just went to the States for work.

650
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:11,772
Right.

651
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,340
Lately you've probably been tired.

652
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:21,459
And Tul also likes leaving Phu
under your care.

653
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:24,500
Good thing Hin is nice,
unlike your brother.

654
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,865
That's why
I can think of Hin as my brother.

655
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:30,372
But you're probably so tired.

656
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,108
You have to study and work
at the same time.

657
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:33,598
You should find time to rest.

658
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:39,114
But when you get a holiday,
your brother ends up following you here.

659
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:41,180
He's so shameless.

660
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,334
But your friends are also here.

661
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:48,526
Because I accidentally told them.

662
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:50,273
Let's stop talking about my friends.

663
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,559
Let's eat. I'll feed you.

664
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:55,309
Here.

665
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,210
Is it tasty?

666
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:05,261
Yeah.

667
00:45:05,857 --> 00:45:07,834
If it's good then you have to eat a lot!

668
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:10,773
Because tonight,
I'll make you feel better.

669
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:11,822
Okay?

670
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:17,714
Can you do it now?

671
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,970
Do you want me to?

672
00:45:40,815 --> 00:45:41,984
I love you.

673
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,701
I love you, too.

674
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,124
Is it good?

675
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:35,045
We promised we'd come here together.

676
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,191
I still haven't fulfilled
that promise yet.

677
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:07,146
