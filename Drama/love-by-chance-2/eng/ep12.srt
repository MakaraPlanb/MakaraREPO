1
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:01,376
I beg you.

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,322
Please forgive your brother.

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:04,857
Okay.

4
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:06,666
I still haven't finished telling your dad
about your brother.

5
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:08,582
Whatever, I will take revenge for you!

6
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:11,554
Make me the happiest man alive on earth.

7
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,762
The kind of happiness
that my brother can never have.

8
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,065
That...

9
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,346
is the best kind of revenge.

10
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:20,390
Phupha means...

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,036
The love that I gave to someone.

12
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,253
Gonhin.

13
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:29,618

=A Chance To Love=

35
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,067
Your room is quite small.

36
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,304
Are you not getting good pay?

37
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:57,340
I live alone.

38
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,446
I don't need a big room.

39
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,752
And about my income...

40
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:07,532
The work that your father advised me to do
since I was in England,

41
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,386
allows me to live
without any difficulties.

42
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,750
You've lived here for many years now.

43
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,767
Aren't you interested in dating someone?

44
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,309
You came all the way here,
is there anything I can do for you?

45
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:34,911
You haven't answered my question.

46
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,724
You don't have to use polite speech
with me.

47
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,536
Please just talk to me like you would
back then.

48
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:46,935
No.

49
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,150
Things changed.

50
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:53,612
I don't think so.

51
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,057
A couple years ago,

52
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,539
when you came and ask me to help you.

53
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,855
I'm still the same as how I was back then.

54
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,619
How can you love someone like my brother?

55
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,779
At first I was surprised.

56
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,526
As soon as I came back to Thailand,

57
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,802
my father told me to come to you.

58
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,369
At first, I thought he wanted me
to ask you to become my assistant.

59
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,398
But now I know that that's not the case.

60
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,200
He wanted you to tell me the truth.

61
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,864
He told you that...?

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,800
Even if my father promised you...

63
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,104
that he wouldn't tell my brother
your address.

64
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:07,862
That doesn't include me.

65
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:17,367
What else did he tell you?

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,464
I want to know about Gonhin.

67
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,999
That's his address.

68
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,121
What do you want?

69
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,994
Why are you giving me his address?

70
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,587
I don't know.

71
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,928
If you didn't want Gonhin
to become my assistant...

72
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,348
You wanted me to know about Tul
and Gonhin's relationship?

73
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,557
I have no idea
what you think of my position.

74
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,155
Maybe I am the head of the family,

75
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,036
or maybe you view me
as a CEO of this company.

76
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:17,127
But I am just a stupid adult...

77
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:20,129
who doesn't know how to help my own son.

78
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,703
You, Tul,

79
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:27,857
or someone
that I've known since they were young...

80
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,113
like Gonhin.

81
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,258
I was never able to help anyone.

82
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:38,088
So you took a gamble...

83
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:40,380
and gave me Gonhin's address?

84
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,949
Like I've said multiple times,

85
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,887
you've always been a nice person, Tin.

86
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,947
So, you hoped that
a nice person like me...

87
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,415
could help those two
mend their relationship?

88
00:06:58,348 --> 00:06:59,336
No.

89
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,210
I'm just a selfish adult...

90
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:07,698
who wants to see my kids happy
while I'm still alive.

91
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,345
What do you mean?

92
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:16,547
Life is short, Tin.

93
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:23,060
I think I've just lost the love of my life
not long ago.

94
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,105
But in reality,

95
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:26,961
decades have passed.

96
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,789
I don't want...

97
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,657
you guys to waste your time like I did.

98
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,350
Don't get your hopes up.

99
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,793
Like you said so yourself,

100
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,789
you've never expected anything from me.

101
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,680
Just do what you want to do.

102
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:20,953
So you're here
because your father asked you to come.

103
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,249
I'm not here because of anyone.

104
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,547
I'm here because I wanted to come.

105
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,897
To atone for the mistakes I've made
in the past.

106
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,733
Do you want to know
about your brother's childhood?

107
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,010
That's why I'm here.

108
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,073
I've packed up all my stuff.

109
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,532
But I couldn't take all of them back yet.

110
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:16,037
Tomorrow, I will ask them
to come and get the remaining things.

111
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,066
Okay.

112
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,387
And anything else that I'll leave behind,

113
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,876
you can throw them away.

114
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:26,443
When are you leaving?

115
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,809
Next week.

116
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,195
Phu will miss you a lot.

117
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:40,482
You have to promise me
that you will take good care of Phu.

118
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:46,408
I'm such a bad person
for leaving my own son behind.

119
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:48,969
No.

120
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,258
I have to thank you...

121
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,959
for allowing Phupha to stay here with me.

122
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,274
I didn't want to leave my son here.

123
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,477
But I'm scared that...

124
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,641
Scared? Of what?

125
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,093
There's nothing to be scared of.

126
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:12,875
I'm scared that...

127
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:15,825
if Phu doesn't stay here with you,

128
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:19,594
then you wouldn't be able
to live on anymore.

129
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,021
I didn't say anything...

130
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,858
but that doesn't mean that I don't know.

131
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,282
All this time,

132
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,063
our son is the only reason
why you're staying with me.

133
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:40,854
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,704
There's nothing to be sorry about.

135
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,723
It's already in the past.

136
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,271
Up until now,

137
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:57,121
you've always taken good care of me.

138
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,886
But no one...

139
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:03,857
would be able to endure it...

140
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,823
if their partner never embraced them.

141
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,057
Never kissed them.

142
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,802
Never have any type
of skin-ship with them.

143
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:17,586
Like all the other couples do.

144
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:29,290
Can I hug you one last time?

145
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,162
I'm sorry for everything up until now.

146
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,748
Are you trying to tell me
that my brother was kidnapped before...

147
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,721
and my grandmother told the kidnappers
that they can kill my brother?

148
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,154
Yes.

149
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:14,549
Your grandmother hated your brother.

150
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,188
She hated his guts so much.

151
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,669
She didn't even want to be standing
on the same earth as him.

152
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:24,804
Tul was berated,

153
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:26,770
was chastised,

154
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,190
insulted and abused.

155
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,550
He was not accepted as a family member.

156
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:43,620
And it got worse...

157
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,476
the day you were born.

158
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,516
Because my mother happened to be
the one my grandma chose.

159
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:56,559
That's right.

160
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,747
She's always said that you're...

161
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,043
the real heir to the family.

162
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,381
And Tul...

163
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,786
Tul had it really bad.

164
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,117
All throughout his life.

165
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,765
So I got to be a happy child...

166
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,878
while my brother...

167
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:38,980
Got to be the one you despised.

168
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,780
I will not ask you
to forgive your brother.

169
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,091
Because there are no excuses
for things that he did either.

170
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,033
But your brother loves you.

171
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:58,120
He loves you and hates you
at the same time.

172
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,919
Because no matter what,
you're his only brother...

173
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,379
and the only person
who he thinks of as his family.

174
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,506
That person is not me.

175
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:22,792
It's you.

176
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,558
Do you know
what my brother named his son?

177
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,149
No.

178
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,727
I left before his son was born.

179
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,718
Phupha.

180
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,680
Don't you think it's strange?

181
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,662
His name is Tul.

182
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,761
His wife's name is Napavadee.

183
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,121
But their son is named Phupha.

184
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:01,651
And your name is,
coincidentally, Gonhin...

185
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,645
or Pattapee.

186
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,411
Phupha means a strong feeling of love...

187
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,872
that I gave to someone.

188
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,770
Who do you think said this?

189
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,231
My business here is finished.

190
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,667
I found out what I wanted to know.

191
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:37,396
Farewell.

192
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:46,504
I forgot to tell you one more thing.

193
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,350
My brother got a divorce.

194
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,424
I've made up for my mistakes,

195
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:09,600
but don't expect me to go back to being
my brother's obedient little brother.

196
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,430
I'll beat him.

197
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,419
Good luck.

198
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,826
Why are you sending me so many letters?

199
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,125
I didn't want these.

200
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,674
Techno, I know what I did was wrong.

201
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:50,895
I bribed Technic into letting me
meet you again and again.

202
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:55,487
But because we study at different places,
I had no excuses to come and see you.

203
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,916
I am cunning.

204
00:17:56,996 --> 00:17:58,418
I won't deny it.

205
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,671
But as cunning as I am,

206
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:02,804
you're the only one that I like.

207
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,581
The only one that I've got my eyes on.

208
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,756
I won't lie to you anymore.

209
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,751
Please give me another chance.

210
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,057
But even if you refuse,

211
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,839
I will still try.

212
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,292
You can still avoid me,
or ignore my calls,

213
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,061
but at least
let me write these letters to you.

214
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,410
I like your smile.

215
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:36,336
When you smile,
I find myself smiling as well.

216
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,681
I feel happy every time you smile at me.

217
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,132
Techno!

218
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,476
Who wrote these to you?
They're so cheesy!

219
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,879
Hey, Can!

220
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,093
Look at you!

221
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:49,641
Keeping secrets
from your favourite brother now, huh?

222
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:50,829
Don't come any closer.

223
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,542
-Let me...
-Stop, stop.

224
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:58,748
-Let me read!
-Don't come any closer.

225
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,951
If you do, I will cut you out
from being the main player.

226
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,096
Techno.

227
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:06,305
Did you forget
that you're not the captain anymore?

228
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,846
Then I'll buy you meals
for the whole week.

229
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,278
But don't tell anyone.

230
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:15,104
Okay.

231
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:16,775
I won't tell anyone.

232
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,471
I don't know anything.
I didn't see anything.

233
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:23,432
I didn't know that someone wrote you
the cheesiest letter I've ever seen.

234
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,768
I know nothing about it.

235
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,578
Oh, screw this.

236
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,786
So...

237
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,684
Who sent these to you?

238
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,236
Can.

239
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:37,886
A whole week's worth of food.

240
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:46,447
So...

241
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:48,541
Where's your friend?

242
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,982
I haven't seen him for a few days.

243
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,530
Don't mention him.

244
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,380
I already miss him loads.

245
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,355
He went to England
for a couple of days already.

246
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,199
You have no shame at all, huh.

247
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,978
Why?

248
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,484
I miss my boyfriend,
what's so weird about that?

249
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,074
See you!

250
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:20,391
Techno! Don't forget you owe me lunch!

251
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,231
Tin, when are you coming back?

252
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,380
Do you miss me?

253
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,634
Of course!

254
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,077
I miss all the souvenirs
you're gonna give me.

255
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,688
I heard you bought a lot of snacks.

256
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:44,525
Can.

257
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,188
Don't sound so scary.

258
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:48,684
When you come back
I will kiss your left cheek,

259
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:51,264
then your right cheek,
and then I'll kiss you like...

260
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,111
You don't miss me at all?

261
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,973
Are you crazy?

262
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,842
We haven't seen each other
for only a few days.

263
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,501
Don't act like a child.

264
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,251
Are you that attached to me?

265
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,285
Talk to you later. I have a headache.

266
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,098
Tin.

267
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:06,844
Tin!

268
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:08,470
How dare he hang up on me?

269
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,268
How can I tell him I miss him?

270
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,568
That's not cool at all.

271
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,167
Keep wanting to look cool
and he'll get bored of you.

272
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,478
A ghost!

273
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,242
What ghost? I'm Lay.

274
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:25,477
Lay.

275
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:28,087
Don't just barge in like that next time.

276
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,847
If your brother got a heart attack,
who's gonna take responsibility?

277
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,715
I gave you a heads up already
before coming in.

278
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:35,093
And you should be careful,

279
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,610
if Tin gets bored of you, I won't help.

280
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,448
Someone like me?
No way that's gonna happen.

281
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:44,530
And you should know that
Tin is crazy in love with me.

282
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:47,301
Whatever you say.

283
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,337
Bye.

284
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,040
Don't flatter yourself.

285
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,645
And if the day comes
when Tin really gets tired of you,

286
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,863
don't you dare come crying to me.

287
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,960
And if the day comes
when Tin really gets tired of you,

288
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,116
don't you...

289
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,757
I can see you!

290
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:08,773
How can she see me?

291
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:10,887
Does she have eyes
at the back of her head?

292
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,641
Or can she see through walls?

293
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,235
What the hell.

294
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,113
And Gucci's always barking.

295
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,860
When will you come back...

296
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:41,302
Hi.

297
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:44,295
Would you take a listen?

298
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,545
Other than Keen and the band,
I also want you to hear it.

299
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:49,965
Actually, you don't have to let me
listen to it as well.

300
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,403
I want you to.
Since I got inspiration from your story.

Thank you so much.

334
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:56,140
Why are you thanking me?

335
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:02,660
Thank you for making me realize
I never stopped loving him.

336
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:05,742
I've only been loving him more.

337
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:11,008
Then you have to come and listen
when my band goes on stage.

338
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:12,353
Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

339
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:21,855
Thank you.

340
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,710
Is Tin actually angry at me?

341
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,468
Can.

342
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,082
Can, hey! Hello?

343
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:57,864
Can!

344
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,314
What the hell?

345
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,668
What if I hit my head on the table
and become even more stupid?

346
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,860
Don't worry,
you're not getting any stupider than this.

347
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,198
You're already the stupidest
of the stupidest.

348
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:09,986
What's the matter?

349
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,353
You're staring at your phone like it's
gonna turn into a Godzilla or something.

350
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,503
You're even more stupid than me.

351
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,195
I think you watch too many movies.

352
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,916
How can a phone turn into something else?

353
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,242
It's just that...

354
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:29,387
Tin hasn't called me in a few days.

355
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,231
Then you can just call him.

356
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:33,613
I did.

357
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,653
But he didn't pick up.

358
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,332
Well, we all have things we have to do.

359
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,460
Students from English Program
are having a break right now, right?

360
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,044
Maybe he's on holiday with his family.

361
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:53,829
You really have no idea
about anything, do you?

362
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:56,307
I guess I'm the stupid one
for asking you for advice.

363
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,230
Next time,
don't come to me with your problems again.

364
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,382
Here. Take this.

365
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:12,632
I bought it for you.

366
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,495
Since you seem to like it.

367
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,660
Drink it and cheer up.

368
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,501
You're really giving it to me?

369
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:48,168
Daddy! I haven't seen you eat anything
in a while.

370
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:50,249
I want to share this snack with you!

371
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,524
Daddy! Dad, why are you crying?

372
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:02,154
What happened?

373
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,148
Who hurt you?

374
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,707
Did Can insult you?

375
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,837
I will be angry at Can and Tin.

376
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,390
Whoever hurt you,
I will be angry at all of them!

377
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,059
Don't be angry at anyone.

378
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:17,426
Daddy is fine.

379
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,451
If anyone is in the wrong here,
it's probably me.

380
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,336
No, my dad is not at fault.

381
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,913
My dad is the best in the world.

382
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:28,486
I love you, Phu.

383
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,541
I also love you the most!

384
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:45,489
Auntie!

385
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,201
Auntie!

386
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,323
Is anyone home?

387
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,352
Where is everyone?

388
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:00,576
Good morning, Tul.

389
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,414
You know...

390
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:14,534
that for the past years,

391
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,373
it's like I was dead
even if I'm still breathing.

392
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,476
Why do you want me to live?

393
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,307
To breathe?

394
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,953
I suffered so much, Hin.

395
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,736
I suffered so much.

396
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,393
You're so cruel.

397
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,941
Why did you tell me to live?

398
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:42,171
Why didn't you just kill me?

399
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,455
Why did you leave me
to continue living without you?

400
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:49,070
Why?

401
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,464
You're the air I breathe.

402
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:55,904
If I don't have you,

403
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,843
I won't have the strength
just to even breathe.

404
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,389
Don't leave me again.

405
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,407
I can't live without you.

406
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,409
I can't...

407
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,460
I've told you before...

408
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,088
that even if you have nobody left,

409
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,636
I will always be by your side.

410
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,814
I love you, Hin.

411
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,436
I love you.

412
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,203
I love you, too.

413
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
Can, look at the floor
when you're walking.

414
00:31:00,313 --> 00:31:01,446
Just let him be.

415
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:04,087
He's lonely
because his boyfriend's not here.

416
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,424
How did you know?

417
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:08,388
Can never told you.

418
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:10,384
How can I not know? Who am I?

419
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:11,649
I'm Pond!

420
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,209
Ae.

421
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:20,040
Do you think Tin is mad at me?

422
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:22,259
Well, did you do something wrong?

423
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:25,906
I don't know.

424
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,043
If you don't know
then leave it aside first.

425
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:31,926
Today is the university fair!

426
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:34,199
We should have some fun! Let's go!

427
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,730
I don't want to have fun with you.

428
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,748
Come on, let's go listen to some songs.

429
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:00,270
Everyone!

430
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,717
This song is inspired by a Junior
who loves unconditionally.

431
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:08,461
He would say "I love you"
to the same person everyday,

432
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:11,381
even if they are not together.

433
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,587
I hope to write this song
to pass the love to everyone.

434
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,069
I want to give this song
to everyone who is currently in love.

I'm gonna go grab something to eat.

469
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,531
There's so many people here.
It's making me hungry.

470
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,052
What's the number of people
got to do with you getting hungry?

471
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:34,967
It's got to do with everything.

472
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,856
Can, stop feeling irritated
and taking it out on other people.

473

Can!

Of course!

500
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,223
-It's my song.
-I also practiced...

501
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,303
Tum!

502
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,746
Oh, Tar!

503
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,069
When did you come back?

504
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,448
Mom didn't say anything.

505
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:30,459
I told mom not to tell you.

506
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,905
I wanted to surprise you.

507
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,771
And I also see that
you had a performance today!

508
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:37,443
I'm very surprised!

509
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,561
I know.

510
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,199
Tum!

511
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,394
Yeah?

512
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,910
Are you happy right now?

513
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:53,566
Yeah, why?

514
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,741
That's good.

515
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:57,823
I want you to be happy.

516
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:01,625
We both...

517
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:04,414
should continue to step forward, right?

518
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:09,025
You're right.

519
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,409
The past is long gone.

520
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:12,963
I should keep moving forward.

521
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,013
Right? My beloved brother.

522
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,601
And I'm also sensing...

523
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:22,933
that there's someone here
who's ready to go forward with you.

524
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,072
Over there.

525
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:39,267
Then once you've packed up,
let's go grab something to eat.

526
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:41,435
-Okay.
-I came in such a hurry.

527
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,186
Thank you.

528
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:45,350
Have I grown?

529
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,496
You've grown quite a lot.

530
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:49,311
I know how to bake now!

531
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:51,101
Do you want to try some?

532
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:52,455
My macaroon is very good.

533
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,291
I'll make some for you next time.

534
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:55,323
Sure.

535
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:56,914
Hurry and go pack up.

536
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:58,847
I'll be right back.

537
00:37:58,927 --> 00:37:59,847
Okay.

538
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,940
How's it coming along...

539
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:25,016
I miss you.

540
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:30,694
I miss you, too.

541
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:32,745
Don't disappear again.

542
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:36,414
Next time, just tell me directly
that you miss me.

543
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:42,783
Fine. I miss you, I miss you, I miss you.

544

I won't go anywhere.

548
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,854
I have to thank Tin, right?

549
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:48,423
At least, I want you to talk to him.

550
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,374
I will.

551
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,211
I'll do anything you tell me to.

After this?

554
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:02,053
