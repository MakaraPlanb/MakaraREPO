Go get the ball!

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,570
Let's go get it!

4
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,750
Techno!

5
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,550

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,570
Are you ready to get in the field?

8
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,970
But Techno…

9
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,210
You can do it!

10
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,230
Fight for the team!

11
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,190
Yes

12
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,730
Let's go

13
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,850
Why are you guys sad?

14
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,730
We didn’t win this time

15
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,950
Next year we can still win

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,650
Just shut up

17
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,510
Look! There’re so many cute girls in this university

18
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,070
If you guys are still sulking, you won’t get any girls

19
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,130
Can you shut your mouth first?

20
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,710
Ae!

21
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,950
Did you just scold at me?

22
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,790
We still have next year

23
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,710
But this is Techno’s last year

24
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,490
Look at you, little monkey

25
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,030
Are you worried?

26
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,770
It hurts just a bit

27
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,730
I will get better in a few days

28
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,530
Stop it guys

29
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,410
Don’t be sad

30
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,330
Let’s go back to our university

31
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,370
We will get scolded if we’re late

32
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,070
Let’s go back

33
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,530
Let’s do better next year

34
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,730
I’m sorry

35
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,430
Why are you saying sorry?

36
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,330
I will come back and play football with you

37
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,230
But right now

38
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,730
You should go back now

39
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,210
Do you understand, little monkey?

40
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,410
You can go first. I drank too much sports drinks

41
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,470

00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,330
Where’s Ae?

185
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,230
He doesn’t seem okay these days

186
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,290
Don’t ask him too much questions

187
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,910
Really?

188
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,930
Our friend is driving motorcycle now

189
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,650
He’s so cool

190
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,310
Why are you not talking to me?

191
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,210
Are you okay?

192
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,930
Ae

193
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,430
Where are you going?

194
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,050
Don't follow me

195
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,890
You’re not going to class?

196
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,590
Pond

197
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,110
Can you just leave me alone?

198
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,230
What the hell is wrong with him?

199
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,910
What's wrong with you, Pond?

200
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,130
You too, Ae!

201
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,910
You also, Pond!

202
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,830
I’m sure he’s the guy from the English program

203
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,730
What’s wrong with you?

204
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,710
Why are you whining?

205
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,070
I’m not whining

206
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,490
Do you know that I almost didn't come back in one piece?

207
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,550
I don't know who the hell cut off me

208
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,450
I survived because I prayed respect to the shrine

209
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,510
The shrine…

210
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,770
What are you talking about?

211
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,170
Are you going to listen to me or not?

212
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,850
I haven’t told you that I will listen to you

213
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,170
He just drove away

214
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,830
I was so unlucky this morning

215
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,450
I woke up late

216
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,290
I choked on a bread

217
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,850
I waited for so long for the motorcycle

218
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,450
And he drove too slowly

219
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,790
I had to run all the way to the university

220
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,170
And there was this inter guy who cut me off

221
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,690
Don’t get confused how I know that he’s an inter guy

222
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,870
He drove a luxury car

223
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,130
I’m not saying that people who drive luxury cars are bad people

224
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,970
But he was driving to the international college building

225
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,030
So, I’m pretty sure it’s the inter guy who hurt me

226
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,410
I guarantee you

227
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,370
Are you going to keep talking?

228
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,550
You said that you don’t mean every inter students

229
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,510
So, it’s just only him

230
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,090
Don’t lie to me

231
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,070
I don’t know

232
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,430
I hate him

233
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,870
Be careful

234
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,790
You will get what you hate

235
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,050
Are you serious?

236
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,730
Yes

237
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,450
I hate money then

238
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,550
Money, I hate you

239
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,230
I will get what I hate

240
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,190
Come to me money

241
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,390
Why there’s no money falling from the sky?

242
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,050
Type is not here to help me

243
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,690
How long are you going to do that?

244
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,410
Until you lose your mind

245
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,950
Until I lose my mind, right?

246
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,870
Fine

247
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,710
Come here

248
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,690
Go change your clothes now

249
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,830
Can, come here

250
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,390
Where do you think you’re going?

251
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,450
Come and practice

252
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,150
Where is Ae?

253
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,670
Ae?

254
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,950
Your friend’s over there

255
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,410
Ae seriously breaks up with Pete?

256
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,570
How am I supposed to know?

257
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,550
Why don’t you ask him yourself?

258
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,870
Who would dare to do that?

259
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,610
He might look calm but he’s so scary when he’s angry

260
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,070
Really?

261
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,190
Can you ask him for me?

262
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,370
Of course, not

263
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,530
I don’t want to die young

264
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,810
You should ask him if you want to know

265
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,990
You know what?

266
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,910
I think you should stop sticking your nose in other people’s business

267
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,730
Let’s go practice!

268
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,330
Everyone

269
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,610
Good job

270
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,090
That’s good

271
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,690
Why love is such a mess?

272
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,650
I don’t want to fall in love

273
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,110
I should find something to eat

274
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,970
Hey!

275
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,470
Can

276
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,210
Where are you going?

277
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,690
Come and practice first

278
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,390
Ae

279
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,550
Ae, stop being like this

280
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,430
Ae!

281
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,950
He’s not here with me

282
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,550
He’s not here with me anymore

283
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,670
That’s right

284
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,470
He’s not here with you

285
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,450
If he sees you become like this

286
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,910
Do you think he will be happy?

287
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,930
The reason that he breaks up with you

288
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,410
Because he wants to help you

289
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,650
But I don’t want him to do that

290
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,780
Do you understand?

291
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,810
Just leave me alone

292
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,410
Tin

293
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,490
I don’t know what to say

294
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,670
But I would like to ask a favor

295
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,190
I know that you hate students from Thai program

296
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,410
You don’t like Ae

297
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,870
But everyone is really nice

298
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,910
I want you to open your heart

299
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,710
But that’s not what I will ask of you

300
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,850
Tin

301
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,310
Can you take care of Ae for me?

302
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,070
I know that I’m troubling you

303
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,110
But you’re my only friend

304
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,170
The one that I trust

305
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,070
I’m not asking you to look after him all the time

306
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,050
But if he’s in trouble

307
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,210
Can you promise me that you will help him?

308
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,390
This is my last request

309
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,450
I don’t know if this will be my last e-mail to you or not

310
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,930
We might not meet each other again

311
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,990
Could you please be his friend for me?

312
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,130
That's right!

313
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,290
Damn it!

314
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,810
What's wrong?

315
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,330
Isn't it obvious?

316
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,330
My unfortunate life, my friend

317
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,210
My friend, Ae, is gone

318
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,090
I can never win the game. Damn it!

319
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,090
Game...

320
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,710
BnS Evolution?

321
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,630
Um

322
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,630
I'm playing it too

323
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,450
Eat this

324
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,070
Thanks

325
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,510
I won't get any item

326
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,390
But at least I get to eat this yummy snack

327
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,350
This is not just a snack

328
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,330
You can use it to get the item in the game

329
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,270
Really?

330
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,930
Yes

331
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,250
Awesome

332
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,210
Can I have it all?

333
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,150
This

334
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,010
Under the tray

335
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,070
Use the code to get the item

336
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,830
Really?

337
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,210
There's a code

338
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,050
Let me have it all

339
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,010
You said Ae is gone?

340
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,130
How is he doing?

341
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,190
Nothing much

342
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,870
Except...

343
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,530
What did you just eat?

344
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,350
Eat

345
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,650
Poop

346
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,970
Since when did you come?

347
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,910
It doesn't matter when I come

348
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,810
You should continue what you're saying

349
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,930
How's Ae? I want to know

350
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,330
You want to know?

351
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:36,930
Yes

352
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,610
I'm not talking anymore

353
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,310
Why?

354
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,430
I'm going to eat my snack

355
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,570
Why you're like this?

356
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,690
I might not know anything about Ae but at least I get to eat snack

357
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,650
It's yummy

358
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,890
Let me have it all

359
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,130
Bow!

360
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,270
It's mine!

361
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,550
Why is she like this?

362
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,050
How can I be friend with someone like this?

363
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,130
Exactly

364
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,070
I can’t stop being curious

365
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,850
Why did Ae and Pete break up?

366
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,710
They loved each other so much

367
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:28,950
You’re in the way

368
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,410
You mean who?

369
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,330
Get out

370
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,390
I’m going to walk

371
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,810
I won’t

372
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,330
There’s so much space for you to walk

373
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,530
Get out of the way

374
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,510
I want to walk

375
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,910
Then you have to wait

376
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,890
Because I won’t get out of the way

377
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,310
Why?

378
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,670
Is your dad the owner of the university?

379
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,910
You don’t know who my dad is?

380
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,290
Nope

381
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,870
Your dad is that important to be recorded in the history?

382
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,890
Even if he’s in the history

383
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,870
I still don’t know him

384
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,770
I failed history class

385
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,330
My surname is Medthanan

386
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,270
So?

387
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,390
Talking to a stupid person like you is such a waste of time

388
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,450
Why?

389
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,970
I admit that I’m stupid

390
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,710
Do you admit that your parents didn’t raise you well
that’s why you behave like this?

391
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,550
Are you done talking?

392
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,230
Let go of my hand

393
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,110
I don’t want to waste more time

394
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,150
What the hell did you just say?

395
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,590
Damn you! Come back here!

396
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,630
I get hungrier when I’m angry!

397
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,650
Let's go, Can. I'm hungry

398
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,490
Can!

399
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,710
What the hell is wrong with you?

400
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,130
I'm angry!

401
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,110
Who does he think he is? How dare he talked to me like that?

402
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,570
He called me stupid! I was in the way! So what?

403
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,410
My parents never talked to me like that

404
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,610
Did you eat too much or too less?

405
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,530
Why are you so crazy?

406
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,350
I'm not crazy!

407
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,950
A crazy person won't admit that he's crazy

408
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,290
You should go check

409
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,790
I will take you to the first aid room. Everyone is annoyed by you now

410
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,670
Job! You're my friend! You should be on my side

411
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,890
He said I was in the way and I was stupid

412
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,790
Just because I didn't know his dad

413
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,350
Everyone loves me. You can ask Techno, Champ and Type

414
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,350
I'm the most beloved member in the football team

415
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,670
Everyone is happy to be with me

416
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,490
Job, where are you going?

417
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,920
I don't know!

418
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,960
I'm hungry

419
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,650
I too tired to listen to you

420
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,190
I wanted to join the football team with you

421
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,330
But I change my mind now

422
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,450
You make me lose my mind

423
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,550
Wait for me!

424
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,450
Job, you're my friend!

425
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,410
Job

426
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,870
This weekend can I sleep over at your place, dad

427
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,650
About that

428
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,850
He's not ready yet

429
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,690
That's what I thought

430
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,090
It will turn out this way

431
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
You're walking out like this

432
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
That's not nice, Tin

433
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,000
What do you want?

434
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm just talking to my brother

435
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,400
Is that weird?

436
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,640
You should stop pretending

437
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,200
What do you want?

438
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,280
About your internship

439
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
I want to work at dad's company

440
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
You're just nineteen

441
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,520
When you were nineteen, you also worked there

442
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
As a messenger

443
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
You won't be able to do it

444
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,080
I can do it

445
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,040
You cannot

446
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,200
You're not raised to face the difficulty

447
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
You told dad

448
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,840
to not let me do it, right?

449
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
Why are you so negative towards your brother?

450
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,570
I told you to stop pretending

451
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:14,890
I want to puke

452
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,270
A nice brother, huh?

453
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,450
No one will believe you

454
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,610
Then you should know

455
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,210
No matter how hard you try until the day you die

456
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,170
You can't keep up with me

457
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,230
I'm not full yet

458
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,310
I will go ask Techno to buy me food

459
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,650
I'm sorry

460
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,170
How come you're here? Are you going to mess with me?

461
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,330
I'm ready to fight

462
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,130
I'm sorry. It was an accident

463
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,970
It won't go off? Let me help you

464
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,850
Don't bother me

465
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,370
It's my fault. I'm sorry. Let me help you

466
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:42,890
Let me

467
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,050
Can't you just leave me alone?

468
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,770
Get out

469
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,170
No

470
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,810
I told you to get out

471
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,210
Fine...

472
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,010
But...

473
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,890
I should be responsible for what I did

474
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,170
Come with me

475
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,610
Stay still

476
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,130
Don't you know that you have to clean it asap?

477
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,770
My mom taught me this

478
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,250
Because my shirt always gets dirty

479
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,890
Look

480
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,690
Dirty like this

481
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,570
Damn it

482
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,170
Don't worry

483
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,170
It will be clean for sure

484
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,690
Whatever

485
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,810
I will throw this shirt away anyway

486
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,930
Such a waste

487
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,130
My mom taught me to use money wisely

488
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,450
Especially the money that your parents earn

489
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,250
You shouldn't waste it

490
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,250
Also, my mom taught me to be responsible

491
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,370
I made your shirt dirty so I have to clean it

492
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,850
See?

493
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,610
It's clean already

494
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,290
You should address me properly

495
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,690
I don't know your name. What do you want me to call you?

496
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,650
Should I call you a bad person?

497
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,610
My name is Tin

498
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,050
Tin Medthanan

499
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,530
My name is Can

500
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,130
I didn't ask

501
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,970
How can you talk like that to a person
who just cleaned the shirt for you?

502
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,210
I didn't ask you to do it

503
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,490
You're a bad person! You ungrateful!

504
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,410
You're...

505
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,410
Whatever

506
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,770
Even though I didn't ask

507
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,770
You already cleaned my shirt

508
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,370
What do you want in return?

509
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,650
Dude!

510
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,890
The reason that I cleaned the shirt is because I made it dirty.
I'm responsible for the thing I caused

511
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,450
I don't want anything in return. I don't want your money!

512
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,330
You can't buy me with money!

513
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,370
Damn you, my tummy

514
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,170
I was so handsome just then

515
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,050
What are you laughing at?

516
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,210
Nothing

517
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,930
I can see that you're laughing

518
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,130
I said no

519
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,690
Yes, you are!

520
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,570
I have a candy

521
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,610
Maybe it can help

522
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,850
Remember that

523
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,010
My name is Tin

524
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,810
Who said I want to know you? I don't want to know

525
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,050
