(Final Episode)

4
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,633
Do you have an umbrella?

5
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:43,934
It's raining out.

6
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,243
What...

7
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,473
What's your deal?

8
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:58,324
I'm your hand holder.

9
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:48,604
I can't stop the rain anymore.

10
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,743
I have to use an umbrella like you people.

11
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:54,174
Because...

12
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,343
I've become like you people.

13
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,484
I can't get sick.

14
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:07,724
You'll be upset if I do.

15
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,664
I think I'll hate rainy days because it's cumbersome.

16
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,004
This isn't a dream, is it?

17
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,613
You're real, right?

18
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:37,553
I wanted to avoid getting wet. Oh well.

19
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,324
I'll make an exception today.

20
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,843
Stop staring. You'll burn a hole in me.

21
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,814
What happened?

22
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,223
Where have you been?

23
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,123
I took a trip to the fiery pit.

24
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,023
Stop joking.

25
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,004
That garden.

26
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,873
She sent you back?

27
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:07,543
No. She let me be born.

28
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:10,573
Thanks to you,

29
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,944
I grew up nicely and made her happy with me.

30
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,213
That's why I'm back.

31
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:18,353
What does that mean?

32
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,593
You saw those flowers there, right?

33
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,923
Those are all you.

34
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:29,264
She and I are caretakers of that garden.

35
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:31,804
To be more precise,

36
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,004
I was a butterfly for that garden.

37
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:39,244
- But? - But I bloomed...

38
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,473
because I died for you.

39
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,783
- Then you're... - I no longer bring doom.

40
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,754
I am...

41
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,124
just human like you.

42
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:56,624
Is that okay?

43
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:59,894
Even if I'm nothing now?

44
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:04,364
Even if I can't do anything for you?

45
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,403
I've missed you so much.

46
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,643
It was so hard without you.

47
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,004
How could you say that?

48
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,783
Okay. I guess so.

49
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:32,494
You must've spent many days...

50
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:35,694
thinking about me.

51
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,004
Sorry.

52
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:48,473
You're hungry, but this is all I have at home.

53
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,783
No. I'll go out and pick something up.

54
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:05,364
I would've gone grocery shopping had I known.

55
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,032
It's your first meal as a human.

56
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,364
You didn't know.

57
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,704
You didn't know we could even meet again.

58
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,804
You didn't know I'd be back as a human.

59
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,543
I thought it was really the end.

60
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:26,583
I can't believe it.

61
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,483
I'm hungry, so I'll have to eat.

62
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,853
I'll be sleepy, so I'll have to sleep.

63
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,324
I can see you.

64
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:39,824
I may get sick at times and recover.

65
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:43,663
I can live with you like that and die together with you.

66
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,403
Me too.

67
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:47,903
I can't believe it.

68
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:55,843
This is delicious.

69
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,054
This isn't a dream, is it?

70
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,493
No, it isn't.

71
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:15,233
It really isn't, right?

72
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,333
No.

73
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,874
It can't be a dream.

74
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:25,704
Don't disappear on me.

75
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:29,114
- Okay. - Ever.

76
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,184
Okay.

77
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,594
You're up.

78
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:20,964
You have to leave for work, right?

79
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,584
What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?

80
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,714
I thought you had left.

81
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,494
Why did you bring your boyfriend to work?

82
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,764
Well... He has no friends.

83
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:59,302
I can't leave him home alone.

84
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,474
Why not? He's an adult.

85
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,432
Well, his mental state...

86
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,473
His mental state is that of a child?

87
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,344
No, not a child. But...

88
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:09,144
I'm all he has right now.

89
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,374
Why?

90
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,644
Does he not get along with people?

91
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:15,453
No, he doesn't. How could he?

92
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:18,523
Since he wasn't...

93
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,553
He wasn't what?

94
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,693
Here... He wasn't from here.

95
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,263
You have a meeting with Dalgona today.

96
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:28,594
You won't take him with you, right?

97
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,093
I will.

98
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,932
Hey. You need to separate work from your personal life...

99
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,973
He has a car. He's a good driver too.

100
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,233
Your life becomes work and work becomes your life.

101
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,703
I like that attitude. You're like a real manager.

102
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:44,474
You look the most like a CEO at times like these.

103
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,213
And what times are those?

104
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,014
When you change your tune based on what's profitable.

105
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,052
I'm dependable, aren't I?

106
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,952
Like I'll build the company well and stuff, right?

107
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:55,922
I don't know about that, but I don't think it'll go bankrupt.

108
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:59,293
It won't go bankrupt if you go and get the contract signed.

109
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,073
I'll try.

110
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:15,443
Let's go.

111
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,714
If you don't like your CEO, should I kill him?

112
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,913
You can't kill people anymore.

113
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:25,422
That's right.

114
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,553
There's something else that you can do for me though.

115
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,224
Drive me around.

116
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,162
I'll see you later.

117
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,364
Don't come back. Go home from the meeting.

118
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:36,994
Got it.

119
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,163
Reunion?

120
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,402
What reunion?

121
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,874
How nice is it to meet up often like this?

122
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,543
This time, Eun Bi, Da Young, and Jung Hwa are really coming.

123
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,884
I let Ji Na know too, but she hasn't responded.

124
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:55,913
You'll come, right?

125
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:59,683
- I'll see. - Don't give me that. Come.

126
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:03,022
Hey, I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

127
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,153
Bye.

128
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,562
Why are you bringing that here?

129
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:09,233
It's clearly for a grand opening.

130
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,663
You should bring that to a newly opened business.

131
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:13,764
It came in your name.

132
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:15,703
Joo Ik sent it.

133
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:17,834
Think of it as me and raise it.

134
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:19,702
He says to raise it as him.

135
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,504
Shouldn't you raise it yourself?

136
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:23,244
That's why I brought it.

137
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,543
Seriously. I told him I needed him,

138
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:27,744
and he sent a plant with his name on it.

139
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,912
He must want me to pay him back for raising me.

140
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:30,913
Put it up there.

141
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,453
- There? - Yes.

142
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,104
Hi, sis.

143
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,104
Me? I'm at the first location. Why?

144
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,474
This is probably not the face that Sun Kyung knows.

145
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,714
Say you got a new boyfriend.

146
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,652
You punk. How will that make me look then?

147
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,484
Like a popular girl.

148
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,523
A girl who's popular only with guys with this car.

149
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:09,923
I didn't think about the car.

150
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,594
This is how detail-oriented I am.

151
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:26,104
Here. Right here. Come this way.

152
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:31,474
Hey. So... What happened was...

153
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:35,053
- He's... So... - Brother!

154
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,084
Brother!

155
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,922
Brother! Do you have any idea how much I've missed you?

156
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:46,124
I've missed you so much, Brother.

157
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,364
Me too.

158
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,094
This moving reunion is nice and all,

159
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:55,004
but look at him. Doesn't he look different?

160
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,272
No. He looks the same.

161
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,244
Even the mole right here.

162
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:03,573
He looks the same?

163
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,443
That can't be.

164
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,283
See? He looks the same.

165
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,624
No? Did he gain weight?

166
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,033
What... How is this...

167
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,234
No?

168
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,803
He looks the same.

169
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:35,313
(Kim Ji Eun)

170
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:42,683
I'm nice like that.

171
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,394
Ji Eun! Let's go!

172
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,864
Okay. Be right there!

173
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:05,703
What are you doing?

174
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,644
- What's this? - What?

175
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,343
Something new that I'm raising.

176
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:12,484
What is it?

177
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:15,283
I don't know. I won't know until it blooms.

178
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,682
You have to tell us once it does.

179
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,452
Let's go. The restaurant will close soon.

180
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:21,023
- Okay. - Let's go.

181
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:27,793
So...

182
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,133
She did it?

183
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,103
What else could explain it?

184
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,163
She did it.

185
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:36,604
It's amazing.

186
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,573
It's not that amazing.

187
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,313
Isn't my being with you amazing?

188
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,543
Of course, it is.

189
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,384
You don't seem that amazed.

190
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:50,884
You're always touching rather than amazing.

191
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:52,653
Wow.

192
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,022
Who knew you could be this sweet?

193
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:56,994
I could be even sweeter.

194
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:00,764
Anyway,

195
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,863
you said you had a meeting but you went to see your brother.

196
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:05,532
Is it okay to lie at work?

197
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,803
It's okay.

198
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,932
That jerk always says he's off to meetings...

199
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,933
and goes to Ji Na's place. I know everything.

200
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,043
I just turn a blind eye, that's all.

201
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:16,313
Also, I can just have the meeting now.

202
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,343
Now?

203
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,283
Let's test it one more time.

204
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,214
Where to?

205
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:25,553
Where to?

206
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,124
You haven't broken up with him yet?

207
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:33,893
Even he recognizes me.

208
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,563
What do you mean? Do you think I'm an idiot?

209
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:37,834
Sir.

210
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:40,663
Take a close look. Doesn't he...

211
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,303
seem different?

212
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:49,344
- He's the same. - What's the same?

213
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,614
You're still an annoying jerk.

214
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:55,553
I ought to...

215
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:57,952
Why won't you answer my question?

216
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:59,223
Are you still going out with him?

217
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,883
We won't break up until we die.

218
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:02,793
I wasn't asking you.

219
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:06,724
Seriously.

220
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,793
May I hit him?

221
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:12,464
No.

222
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:16,973
I'll go pick up our drinks and dessert,

223
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:18,743
so please calm down, both of you.

224
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,682
You may be happy now,

225
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,712
but you never know what life may bring.

226
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:29,814
We're getting married.

227
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,722
You never know until you walk down the aisle.

228
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:34,982
It isn't over till it's over.

229
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:38,094
We'll probably walk down the aisle before you turn 20.

230
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:40,824
- How did you know? - What?

231
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,334
That you like her?

232
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:44,893
How did you know?

233
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:45,933
How could I not?

234
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,403
I knew from the first time I saw you at the tteokbokki place.

235
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,232
Did... Did you tell her?

236
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,172
- Should I? - Don't you dare.

237
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:53,274
Why not?

238
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:57,413
In case she thinks I'm cute.

239
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,054
I'm speechless.

240
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,124
Do you think you're cute?

241
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,124
Okay.

242
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:18,902
I'm busy, so I have to go. Goodbye.

243
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,462
I just got our drinks.

244
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,304
Let him go. I guess he needs to run away.

245
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,144
Anyway, call me later.

246
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,443
Sir.

247
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,114
I'll let you go, but can you do something for me first?

248
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,054
I'm begging you.

249
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,253
Please.

250
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,524
What is it? Make it quick.

251
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:52,604
Hold on.

252
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:56,673
Hello. You can come in...

253
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,604
Hi.

254
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,274
It's Park Young.

255
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:06,983
Let's have a one-on-one fan meeting.

256
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:10,213
Just 30 minutes. No. 20 minutes. Please?

257
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,384
What?

258
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,263
You didn't say we were meeting her.

259
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:28,003
I didn't say we weren't either.

260
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,333
It was a great opportunity.

261
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,873
I can test it and do my work.

262
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:33,044
Two birds, one stone.

263
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,173
Thanks to that, I got Dalgona to sign the contract...

264
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,343
and repay her.

265
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,913
This is also two birds, one stone.

266
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,723
I still hate him.

267
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:48,283
Why do you hate him so much?

268
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:49,394
Don't you?

269
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:51,692
Why? He's cute.

270
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,564
Don't you think that's the problem?

271
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,223
Did you see how his face changed?

272
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,253
That's how he is.

273
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,763
He did that to me first.

274
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,093
What choice do we have?

275
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,733
He's our best author.

276
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,172
It isn't midnight yet.

277
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:39,804
We have a lot of time left.

278
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,913
We don't have a contract like that anymore.

279
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,374
That's right. We don't.

280
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:48,584
We can hold hands for no reason whatsoever.

281
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:50,753
You're so right.

282
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,953
But seriously... That kid...

283
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:02,193
- Hey. - I'm back.

284
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,564
Hi, Brother-in-law.

285
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,634
Go on. Say hi.

286
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:19,683
I'm back.

287
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,124
Thank you.

288
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:29,554
Hello.

289
00:20:38,564 --> 00:20:39,604
Hi.

290
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,804
Hey. Are you here to get your hair done?

291
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:44,874
Yes.

292
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,073
Right.

293
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:49,413
It's a salon. Why else would you be here?

294
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:52,114
I heard Da Young worked here.

295
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,942
She's good.

296
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,713
I come here often because of her.

297
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,923
Did you get your hair done? It looks nice.

298
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:00,653
Thanks.

299
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,193
I heard...

300
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,564
that your friend that you mentioned recovered.

301
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:10,462
How did you hear that?

302
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:11,963
Sun Kyung told me.

303
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,864
About how he knows you too.

304
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:15,933
That's right. Sun Kyung.

305
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:20,604
Yes, she got better. She's healthy now.

306
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,774
I'm glad. I was worried.

307
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,213
Thanks.

308
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:28,443
I hear we're having a reunion.

309
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,614
Yes, I heard.

310
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:32,884
Are you going?

311
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,024
No.

312
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,824
Okay. Bye.

313
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,663
Thus, I am no longer a café worker.

314
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,364
I am the manager of the second store.

315
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:17,963
That's all.

316
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:21,104
- Really? - I'm so proud of you.

317
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:24,033
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

318
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:25,742
Soo Ah and Jong Won...

319
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,242
are finally pulling their weight from above.

320
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,972
They're finally pulling their weight.

321
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,044
- Sun Kyung, that's great. - Great.

322
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,512
Your dream is finally coming true.

323
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:36,183
Is it your 49th?

324
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:37,884
48th?

325
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,053
Is it the 49th?

326
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,053
What does it matter what number it is?

327
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:44,094
What matters is that he's doing something.

328
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,293
You're eating well today.

329
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:51,263
You barely ate in the past.

330
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:54,533
He must've missed Korean food like crazy.

331
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,673
- Isn't that right? - Yes.

332
00:22:58,874 --> 00:22:59,973
I missed everything.

333
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:03,713
Gosh... Goodness, Brother.

334
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,083
You're embarrassing me.

335
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,314
What is wrong with this kid?

336
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,182
When are you going to move in here?

337
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,354
What?

338
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:16,123
Well, so... I've thought it over.

339
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:19,023
My job is closer from there...

340
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,064
No.

341
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:22,992
Move in. I want to live with you...

342
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:24,492
until you get married.

343
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,433
Come on. You're so dense.

344
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:30,172
It's because she won't be able to spend time alone with him.

345
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:31,203
Hey.

346
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:34,173
We can just go to my place then.

347
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:37,173
I have a lot of rooms.

348
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:40,614
I see. You have your own place?

349
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,243
You have a lot of rooms?

350
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:44,953
Yes. It's quite big.

351
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,824
I see. Okay, then.

352
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:50,653
Are you done with everything in the US?

353
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,993
So you told them I was in the US.

354
00:23:58,294 --> 00:23:59,304
Wasn't he?

355
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,334
- I was. - Okay.

356
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,502
What do you plan to do...

357
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:09,213
to make a living in Korea now?

358
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,114
I plan to continue doing the same job as before.

359
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:24,124
(Ambulance)

360
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,804
(Rescue)

361
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,274
- This way. - Please make way.

362
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,284
Excuse me.

363
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:53,223
(Kim Human)

364
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:00,294
She was in a car accident.

365
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,162
There aren't any external injuries,

366
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:03,262
but she's pregnant.

367
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:05,294
She had stomach pain and fainted.

368
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:06,633
Call OBGYN...

369
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:07,903
and Pediatrics just in case.

370
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:08,963
Yes, doctor.

371
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,003
Excuse me.

372
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,913
Do you hear me?

373
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,183
My baby...

374
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,814
Please save my baby.

375
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:26,683
How far along are you?

376
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:29,124
- Hello? - Her BP is dropping.

377
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:31,252
I called OBGYN.

378
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,762
- Someone will be here in 10. - She looks bad.

379
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:34,962
She may have a brain hemorrhage.

380
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:36,433
Bring her to an OR right away.

381
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:37,633
Call Anesthesiology...

382
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,063
and tell OBGYN and Pediatrics to come there.

383
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,064
Yes, doctor.

384
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:48,403
I'm so very happy for you. Congratulations.

385
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:52,314
Here's a little gift.

386
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:54,683
What are you congratulating me for?

387
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:56,713
I hear you're having a baby.

388
00:25:58,054 --> 00:25:59,283
How did you know?

389
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:02,053
Well. People at the hospital are always talking.

390
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:03,653
I heard a little rumour.

391
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:05,823
I'll go to the first birthday party.

392
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:09,024
There's no need. You came to our wedding too.

393
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,462
Thank you.

394
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:12,804
Sure. And...

395
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,604
This is the new contract I mentioned before.

396
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,373
What? Out of the blue?

397
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:20,873
The document describes the detailed terms,

398
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,773
so please read it thoroughly.

399
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,472
I'm sure you're busy with your main job,

400
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,182
but please review the terms.

401
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:28,144
I hope for a positive response.

402
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:31,314
Be honest with me.

403
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:33,524
This was why you really came, isn't it? Not to congratulate me.

404
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:37,124
Well... It was for both.

405
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,123
What is there to think about?

406
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:41,793
Of course, I'll sign.

407
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:44,133
Still, you should review the terms...

408
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,393
and call me afterwards.

409
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,233
We're very confident...

410
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:53,003
(Human)

411
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:55,703
We're confident...

412
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:58,443
Excuse me.

413
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,314
I'm almost done.

414
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:03,814
Yes, I'm coming now. Okay.

415
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:06,324
Sorry about that.

416
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,084
He has the worst timing.

417
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,953
Who...

418
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:12,563
My boyfriend.

419
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,722
That boyfriend who went far away.

420
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,134
Is he finally back?

421
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:20,003
Yes.

422
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,604
My gosh, doctor.

423
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,274
You look as handsome as ever.

424
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:32,113
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:35,183
Yes. I'm going on a date with my girlfriend.

426
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:38,953
It's nice out. It's perfect for a date.

427
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,653
Hello.

428
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:46,363
It seems like just yesterday when you were fretting...

429
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,024
about whether or not you'll get married.

430
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,834
But now, you're completely healed too.

431
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,762
Life is unpredictable.

432
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:56,834
Back then, none of us knew he'd end up working here.

433
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:58,903
Right.

434
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:01,044
But when are you two getting married?

435
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,644
Well, we haven't decided yet.

436
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,113
We'll be off now.

437
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:11,284
I hope you two also recover so you can go home.

438
00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:13,553
Don't worry about us.

439
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:14,983
We're very healthy.

440
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:17,953
Goodness, we stayed for too long, didn't we?

441
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,993
We'll leave so you two can spend time together.

442
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:30,273
By the way, you haven't mentioned anything...

443
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,103
about that ghost these days.

444
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:33,503
I haven't heard any stories lately.

445
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:38,874
I think he went over there.

446
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,044
Do you think so?

447
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:46,384
I hope he got there safely.

448
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,054
Hey, wait for me.

449
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:53,824
I can't believe you actually became a doctor.

450
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:56,693
I didn't live that long for nothing.

451
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:58,894
Do you think it suits you? Is it okay?

452
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:01,003
No, obviously not. It's not something I used to do.

453
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:03,973
But you're doing awfully good.

454
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:05,804
It's because I've always wanted...

455
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:07,604
to do something that saves lives.

456
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:10,613
What are you going to do about your name?

457
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,374
Are you really going to live as Kim Human?

458
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:14,784
I like it. You gave me this name.

459
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:17,884
Gosh, what do you like about it? It came from the top of my head.

460
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:20,422
You named me from the top of your head?

461
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,824
Yes, I did.

462
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:25,192
But now that I think about it, I'm starting to think...

463
00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:26,263
it all happened for a reason.

464
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,094
I really am learning things as I live.

465
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,202
If I knew this was going to happen,

466
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:38,703
I would've given you a cooler name.

467
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:41,203
I can't believe I named you Human.

468
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:50,284
When do you want to get married?

469
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,354
Gosh, we don't need to get married.

470
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:55,124
Has your love faded?

471
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:57,524
Do you not like me anymore because I'm average?

472
00:29:58,094 --> 00:30:00,723
Why? Do you not like me because I'm average?

473
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:04,534
You were never average.

474
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:07,834
From the first time we met up until this very moment,

475
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:09,374
you were always special to me.

476
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,304
I know that was a line, but my heart skipped a beat.

477
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,213
It wasn't a line. I really meant it.

478
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:21,243
Are you getting used to this?

479
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:22,814
Yes.

480
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,124
The only uncomfortable thing is that I can't read minds.

481
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:29,693
But at the same time, it's also kind of nice.

482
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:34,364
Because I'm unsure, I find myself making an effort.

483
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,334
You're really human now.

484
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:39,064
Fate doesn't change.

485
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,833
When I knew how things were going to end,

486
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,604
I never reached out to them.

487
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:48,344
But now that I can't see that, I end up trying my best.

488
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:52,173
Sometimes, I feel like it's going to end,

489
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,443
but that becomes a new beginning.

490
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:59,524
I guess that's how you guys are able to live eternally.

491
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:03,354
All humans are terminally ill.

492
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,423
They live forever only when they're not aware of that.

493
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,094
Isn't this what you said a long time ago?

494
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,894
When I was immortal, it felt like I was terminally ill.

495
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:13,933
But now that I've become mortal,

496
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,574
it somehow feels like I can live forever.

497
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,173
Let's live together forever.

498
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:20,644
Is that a proposal?

499
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:22,913
No, it's not.

500
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,993
Standing here with you like this reminds me of that day.

501
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,763
The day we went to a world where no one else existed but us...

502
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:45,663
and watched the sunset together.

503
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:49,703
I couldn't forget the look you had on your face...

504
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,733
for a very long time.

505
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:57,544
How do I look now?

506
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,044
You look comfortable.

507
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:03,614
You don't look lonely.

508
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:06,183
Right.

509
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:08,683
I'm not lonely.

510
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:13,024
Now I know which direction to walk to.

511
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,034
And that's you.

512
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:24,003
You talk so well for someone who couldn't even send a text.

513
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,743
What do you mean I couldn't send a text?

514
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,113
Back when you were gone,

515
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,773
I found your cell phone at your place.

516
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,913
And I saw that you wrote a text but never sent it.

517
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,683
You sent a lot of texts.

518
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:40,483
You read them all? Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,483
- I'm telling you now. - No, I mean...

520
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:47,223
But I must say, it's weird. How did your cell phone...

521
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:50,894
manage to stay turned on for three whole months?

522
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:58,973
It was probably her.

523
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,203
I see.

524
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,743
I wonder how she's doing.

525
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,354
Wherever she is,

526
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,784
I bet she's doing well...

527
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:17,394
and still has a lot of love for humans.

528
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:24,564
In the past, I didn't understand why she loved humans so much.

529
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,973
I didn't know why she said love derives from hate.

530
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,604
She also probably hated humans at first.

531
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:38,644
Then she probably forgave them.

532
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:40,984
And one day,

533
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:44,013
I bet she felt grateful that they created her.

534
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:50,124
I finally get it now because I also felt the same way.

535
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,734
It's cold. Let's go. We'll catch a cold.

536
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:05,404
Hey.

537
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:10,674
How's life?

538
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:14,783
It's nice.

539
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,004
My gosh.

540
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:39,334
Did you see that I made it into the top 10?

541
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,104
This is my first time.

542
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:43,673
Congratulations.

543
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,044
This is amazing.

544
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:48,444
See? I told you romance wasn't my genre.

545
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,083
Okay, fine.

546
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,213
("The Demon Landlord")

547
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:54,124
By the way, isn't the main character based on me?

548
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:57,694
Well, yes.

549
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:00,822
But I added my imagination to it.

550
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,863
Do I seem like a demon to you?

551
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:04,662
Why is he a demon?

552
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:05,932
That part isn't important.

553
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,863
You need to focus on the fact that he's a landlord.

554
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:09,802
What? So are you offended?

555
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,234
Devils and demons are very sexy, you know.

556
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,413
- You think I'm sexy? - Yes.

557
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,612
- No. - I'm not?

558
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:19,644
What?

559
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,283
Yes. No.

560
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:25,814
Did you cut your hair?

561
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:29,794
Yes, a little.

562
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:32,294
How did you know? I only cut off a little bit.

563
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:34,194
To go to a school reunion?

564
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,493
No, because...

565
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:41,533
you told me you were coming.

566
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,113
What's that look in your eyes?

567
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:00,283
What's your hand doing there?

568
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:05,493
I mean, it was all too sudden.

569
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:12,663
Would you like to go for a drink?

570
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,004
A drink?

571
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:16,604
- Why? - Let's drink.

572
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,703
I want to drink today.

573
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:25,613
I've always wondered how it'd feel to be on the top of the list.

574
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:28,444
I finally get how it feels to be in the top 10.

575
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:31,853
It's burdening and scary.

576
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,183
But I'm also on cloud nine.

577
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:34,453
I'm so excited.

578
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,222
In the next episode,

579
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:38,322
the demon is going to bribe all the modern ghosts...

580
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,493
and send them to the building next door.

581
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:43,394
He's going to make the price drop and use that chance to buy it...

582
00:36:56,513 --> 00:37:00,413
So he's going to... What was I saying?

583
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:04,183
He's going to make the price drop and use that chance to buy it,

584
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,924
- then put it up for sale again... - You don't seem surprised.

585
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:11,024
Well, to be honest,

586
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:14,993
I kind of expected it.

587
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,963
- Really? - Yes.

588
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:19,133
I used to write romance novels.

589
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:47,993
You didn't expect this one, did you?

590
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:53,533
Well, I kind of did.

591
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,573
Then I'll just continue to meet your expectations.

592
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:05,374
So have you made up your mind?

593
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:07,444
About what?

594
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:10,654
Are you going to be my girlfriend or not?

595
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,553
What if I choose not to be?

596
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,223
I'm going to cry.

597
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,592
Will you just ignore me if you see me cry?

598
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,693
No, I'll even hold an umbrella above your head for you.

599
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:25,294
Why would you say that?

600
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:27,433
You shouldn't make me cry in the first place.

601
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:30,504
Okay, fine. I won't.

602
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,803
You just said so yourself that you won't make me cry.

603
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:34,444
Okay, I won't make you cry.

604
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:40,343
- What do you do tomorrow? - Why?

605
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:42,913
So we can hang out for a bit longer if it's your day off.

606
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:45,782
Are you normally like this?

607
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,854
I don't really get what you mean by that,

608
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,593
but I have to tell you that I'm not entirely sane.

609
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,963
I'm not free tomorrow. I have plans.

610
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:57,862
What do you need to do? Let's do it together.

611
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:00,163
You want to do it together? Are you sure?

612
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,303
Yes. What is it?

613
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,044
Put it down there.

614
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:14,783
Auntie, why are you suddenly making kimchi?

615
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:16,753
I moved back to Korea,

616
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,483
so I should make kimchi to commemorate.

617
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:20,853
Auntie, your kimchi tastes amazing.

618
00:39:20,854 --> 00:39:23,053
I can easily finish a bowl of rice with your kimchi.

619
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,923
But this is way too much.

620
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:27,463
How are we going to make this all on our own?

621
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,093
We're expecting more people.

622
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:30,363
Who?

623
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,194
- Hey, I'm here. - What?

624
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:35,303
I bought makgeolli too.

625
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,274
It just happened.

626
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:39,834
- Hello. - Hello.

627
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:43,202
I heard a lot about you. You're Ji Na's boyfriend, right?

628
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,213
Yes.

629
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:47,714
He's also my boss.

630
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,013
What?

631
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:51,953
- Hey, Joo Ik. - What?

632
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:53,882
How do you know him?

633
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,182
Well, Joo Ik and I...

634
00:39:56,183 --> 00:40:00,394
share a really big secret.

635
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:03,064
- Right, Joo Ik? - Yes, right.

636
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:05,762
He came to help out.

637
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,104
The more the merrier.

638
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:11,404
If he bothers you, should I just kill...

639
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:25,452
Put it in here. You guys can put it in here.

640
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:26,453
- Okay. - Okay.

641
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:27,524
Good job, you guys.

642
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:30,024
Why would you even come here?

643
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,894
- Well, you're here too. - I'm family.

644
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:36,424
- Are you married? - No, but we're going to soon.

645
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:39,032
- Oh, sure. - "Oh, sure"?

646
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,803
You never know whether or not you'll get married until you do.

647
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,803
Why do so many people keep saying that to me?

648
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:49,203
No man's ever done what I've done.

649
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:53,242
Brother, come on. Rub in the sauce properly.

650
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,283
- Who are you talking to? - Who are you talking to?

651
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:56,282
I'm talking to my brother-in-law.

652
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:57,553
- Which one? - Which one?

653
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:02,953
Dong Kyung, this is exhausting.

654
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:18,504
Auntie, Uncle, your glasses are empty.

655
00:41:18,774 --> 00:41:20,242
Let me pour you guys a glass each.

656
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,242
- Okay, go ahead. - A glass for my uncle.

657
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:23,303
Here you go.

658
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:25,743
You too, Auntie.

659
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:29,913
Goodness, thank you.

660
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,814
Brother, are you not going to drink?

661
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,424
No, I quit drinking.

662
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:39,323
It's bad for your body.

663
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,663
I want to live a long life.

664
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:46,733
I see. It's for your health, right? Being healthy is great.

665
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:48,163
Yes, you should be healthy.

666
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,734
Okay. I hope you and my sister grow old together.

667
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,473
Here you go.

668
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:56,544
Nice.

669
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:02,044
Joo Ik, aren't you going to have any alcohol?

670
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:04,553
I had enough yesterday.

671
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:06,484
Then what does that make me?

672
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:10,754
What's going on? Did you two drink together?

673
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:13,463
I thought you kept things professional with writers.

674
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,822
But you told me to approach her as a woman, not a writer.

675
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,123
When did I say that?

676
00:42:16,124 --> 00:42:17,563
You have a way of misinterpreting things.

677
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:18,963
I told you to get her as both a woman and a writer.

678
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:20,362
When did I ever tell you to drink with her?

679
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,833
You also got drunk and got me hooked on you.

680
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:22,834
Hey, zip it.

681
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:26,033
So are we finally going to hear how you guys first met?

682
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:29,004
Did my sister get drunk and ask for your number?

683
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:30,613
I guess you could say that.

684
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:32,673
Are you kidding me?

685
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:35,044
You were the one who barged into my house.

686
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:37,484
Dong Kyung.

687
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:40,623
No, Auntie. That's not it.

688
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,953
You're seriously...

689
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:46,493
Never mind. I guess it runs in the family.

690
00:42:48,163 --> 00:42:50,862
So tell me. When did you two start dating?

691
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,793
Ji Na, why didn't you tell me...

692
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,702
that you guys officially started dating?

693
00:42:54,703 --> 00:42:56,973
- No, it's not what you think... - Today's our second day.

694
00:42:58,274 --> 00:42:59,472
My gosh.

695
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:01,643
Then invite me to your 100th day anniversary party.

696
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,773
Who celebrates their 100th day? We're not in high school anymore.

697
00:43:03,774 --> 00:43:04,874
Oh, right.

698
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,044
What's with that smile?

699
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:09,214
I think it's cute.

700
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:11,653
Who's cute? Joo Ik?

701
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:12,714
No, of course not.

702
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,053
I think it's cute that it's only your second day.

703
00:43:19,294 --> 00:43:20,762
How long have you guys been dating?

704
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:22,992
Who cares how long we've been dating?

705
00:43:22,993 --> 00:43:24,293
What matters is...

706
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:26,464
how much you had to overcome for the other person.

707
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:28,763
It wasn't easy for us either.

708
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:32,473
We even bet our lives and fate for each other.

709
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:37,413
It's a pity I can't show you guys anything to prove it.

710
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:39,743
You don't need to show us anything. We've seen enough.

711
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:43,084
You guys went through a lot to protect each other.

712
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:45,214
It was really touching.

713
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:47,883
Why are you suddenly being so serious?

714
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,124
What does that make me?

715
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:52,953
I'll also bet those things on you starting from now.

716
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,524
Stop talking nonsense.

717
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:56,993
My gosh.

718
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,733
You must've really lost it now that you're dating.

719
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:01,564
I've never seen him like that.

720
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:06,032
I think you've all gone mad.

721
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:07,674
My goodness.

722
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:11,774
Listen, kids. I get that your love's all grand.

723
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:15,412
But let's be honest. Kevin and I went through the most.

724
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:18,012
We overcame race, language, culture,

725
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:19,814
and so many other things with our love.

726
00:44:20,113 --> 00:44:22,024
- I love you, Soo. - Me too.

727
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,524
Me too. I love you.

728
00:44:25,254 --> 00:44:26,592
My gosh, seriously.

729
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:29,093
I can't be here anymore. Why am I the only one who's single?

730
00:44:29,323 --> 00:44:31,563
- Where are you going? - To buy more alcohol.

731
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:33,463
You can't go outside on your own. It's too late.

732
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:35,733
I'll just call Sang Geun on my way to the store.

733
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:38,004
It's like he's dating Sang Geun.

734
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:40,444
A love that overcomes gender.

735
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:42,944
That's true love right there.

736
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:45,143
Are you going to write that? Should I help?

737
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:46,913
Nice. Should we give it a try?

738
00:44:47,314 --> 00:44:48,483
By the way, Auntie.

739
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:51,153
Ji Na's new novel became a mega hit.

740
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:53,214
Oh, really? Did you start writing a new novel, Ji Na?

741
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:54,653
What is it about?

742
00:44:54,654 --> 00:44:57,424
Well, it's called "The Demon Landlord".

743
00:44:57,794 --> 00:44:59,492
These days, fantasy novels are very popular.

744
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:00,662
Demon or devil?

745
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:02,163
- "Devil". - "Devil"?

746
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:04,063
- Okay. - You know those evil guys.

747
00:45:04,064 --> 00:45:05,592
- Yes. - I used to write romance novels.

748
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:07,762
- Human, follow me. - So the demon...

749
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:09,762
bribes the ghosts...

750
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:11,202
and makes the price of the building go down.

751
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:12,802
- He makes the price go down? - Then he buys that again.

752
00:45:12,803 --> 00:45:15,302
That's the overall storyline. I'm still thinking about it.

753
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,314
You're really bad at explaining.

754
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:19,973
I'm still brainstorming.

755
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:23,084
I called you out here because I had something to say to you.

756
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,754
Are you... Are you going to marry Dong Kyung?

757
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:28,553
Am I going to marry her?

758
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:32,894
- Yes. - Then we're family now.

759
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:35,493
I'm really glad you joined the family.

760
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:38,193
- Family? - Yes, family.

761
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,363
We're family.

762
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,263
Family.

763
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,773
That word really doesn't suit me.

764
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,104
So you and I have to be responsible for our families.

765
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:51,473
For the happiness of Soo Ja, Sun Kyung, and Dong Kyung.

766
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:53,913
Of course, I'll live for your happiness as well.

767
00:45:54,913 --> 00:45:56,183
Because we're family.

768
00:45:58,314 --> 00:46:00,553
- Me too. - Do you swear?

769
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:04,424
- I can even bet my life on them. - Your life?

770
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,124
You're a true man.

771
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:11,334
I'm sure. You know I've liked you since I first saw you?

772
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:15,064
That's not true. I heard your thoughts that day.

773
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,674
Yes. I'm glad you're back.

774
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:20,944
Otherwise, Soo would've found you and killed you.

775
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:24,413
That doesn't sound like a joke.

776
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:28,944
My gosh, you really are amazing, Brother.

777
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,182
Is it because you lived in the States?

778
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:32,382
You can actually talk to him a bit.

779
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:34,053
Gosh, I'm so impressed.

780
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:40,863
Uncle. Brother.

781
00:46:41,124 --> 00:46:42,564
I love you guys.

782
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:48,633
So I have to start living my life for him too?

783
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:51,073
Yes.

784
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:53,944
Yes! Of course!

785
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,104
Brother.

786
00:47:03,984 --> 00:47:05,513
You're really weird.

787
00:47:06,254 --> 00:47:08,053
Me? Why did you say that?

788
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,123
Why did you bring me to make kimchi there?

789
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,354
Wasn't it fun? We got kimchi too.

790
00:47:12,723 --> 00:47:14,024
Do you not like kimchi?

791
00:47:15,593 --> 00:47:16,793
I do.

792
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:18,533
See? I knew you'd like it.

793
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:20,133
No.

794
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:23,234
I even like your quirky quality.

795
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,004
Stop saying stuff like that.

796
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:28,604
Why not? Do you not like it?

797
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:30,444
No, I really like it.

798
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:32,774
It makes my heart pound.

799
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:36,743
You wrote lines like that a lot in your novel.

800
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:38,953
This is real life, not a story.

801
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:40,783
Why is it any different?

802
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:48,194
By the way,

803
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:51,993
do you remember your first love?

804
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:55,604
I do.

805
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,073
You're my first love.

806
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:04,613
Liar.

807
00:48:12,913 --> 00:48:14,924
You don't have to be the first woman I loved to be my first love.

808
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:18,424
When you start loving someone, it's new and feels like first love.

809
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:22,263
Love comes in different shapes every time when you're in love.

810
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:25,964
Well, in that sense, you are my first love.

811
00:48:32,674 --> 00:48:34,004
You don't seem to believe me.

812
00:48:34,774 --> 00:48:37,144
If you don't believe me, I'll teach it to you.

813
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:38,714
I'm a good teacher.

814
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,283
But do lines like that make your heart pound?

815
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:44,883
Like crazy.

816
00:48:45,013 --> 00:48:46,052
I should say them often.

817
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:47,323
No, stop it.

818
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,323
That makes me want to do it even more.

819
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:52,254
- Gosh, your personality... - What? Is it weird?

820
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:54,823
It can't be weirder than yours.

821
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,563
I'm very ordinary.

822
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:59,133
Weird people think they are ordinary.

823
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:01,203
So you don't like me?

824
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:06,334
That's why I like you.

825
00:49:13,113 --> 00:49:14,383
I don't want to go home.

826
00:49:15,144 --> 00:49:17,044
You should still go.

827
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:20,253
Come with me.

828
00:49:20,254 --> 00:49:22,782
I have work tomorrow. I can't.

829
00:49:22,783 --> 00:49:24,123
I'll drive you to work.

830
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:25,693
You're busy too.

831
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:27,863
You're way busier than me.

832
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:32,394
I think I picked the wrong profession.

833
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:34,703
That's funny.

834
00:49:35,734 --> 00:49:38,433
Funny? Then, smile for me.

835
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:41,404
You did.

836
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:45,113
Go. Drive safely.

837
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:52,714
I want it here...

838
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:57,894
You should go.

839
00:49:58,194 --> 00:49:59,394
Okay. Bye.

840
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:01,663
Bye.

841
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:14,202
- I'll get going. - Okay.

842
00:50:14,203 --> 00:50:16,202
- You should go upstairs. - Bye.

843
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:17,913
I'll go after I see you go up.

844
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:22,283
Drive safely. And call me when you get home.

845
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:23,783
Okay.

846
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:25,214
I'll watch you go.

847
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:50,143
Hello?

848
00:50:50,144 --> 00:50:51,843
I just got home.

849
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,113
What?

850
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:56,314
You told me to call you when I got home.

851
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,182
You did what I asked.

852
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:03,053
Then, call me after you wash up and are ready to sleep.

853
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,243
(Human)

854
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:34,183
I washed up.

855
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:36,024
Are you ready to go to bed?

856
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:40,663
Yes. I am.

857
00:51:44,194 --> 00:51:45,263
I'm lying down now.

858
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:46,734
Good.

859
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:49,033
What were you doing?

860
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,803
- I wasn't doing anything. - What?

861
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:54,144
What does that mean?

862
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,274
Well...

863
00:51:57,374 --> 00:52:00,073
Not doing much...

864
00:52:00,814 --> 00:52:02,783
You'll figure it out as you live your life.

865
00:52:03,613 --> 00:52:06,383
By the way, I need your help now.

866
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:07,683
Now?

867
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:09,924
Should I head over?

868
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:11,822
No. You don't have to come.

869
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,953
You can help me with the phone call.

870
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:16,763
What is it?

871
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:21,932
Remember that day when we saw each other at the hospital?

872
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:24,473
What made you hug me?

873
00:52:26,904 --> 00:52:28,104
Oh, that day.

874
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,604
Tak Dong Kyung.

875
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:39,854
I couldn't hold myself back.

876
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:45,424
I didn't know why I was overwhelmed and what I was feeling.

877
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:48,663
So I just did.

878
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:55,763
I knew it. You loved me back then as well.

879
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:57,674
I did.

880
00:52:58,604 --> 00:52:59,703
Then,

881
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:03,472
Remember when you suddenly came to me and said...

882
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,572
you loved me for the first time?

883
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:07,113
Why did you do it then?

884
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:13,683
I love you.

885
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:16,424
Well,

886
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:19,354
I realized for the first time...

887
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:23,124
that I wouldn't be able to see you after I dissipate.

888
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,294
And that scared me like crazy.

889
00:53:32,073 --> 00:53:33,104
I see.

890
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,044
That's how you were feeling.

891
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:39,173
Not being able to see me...

892
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,984
scared you more than dissipating?

893
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,584
I felt the same way.

894
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:50,624
At some point, not being able to see you started to scare me a lot...

895
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:52,854
more than dying.

896
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:54,564
Isn't that funny?

897
00:53:58,694 --> 00:53:59,763
Are you there?

898
00:54:02,803 --> 00:54:03,933
Hello?

899
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:07,774
Are you...

900
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:09,644
sleeping?

901
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,814
Hey. Are you sleeping?

902
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,254
You really are human now.

903
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:22,124
Goodnight, Kim Human.

904
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:39,833
This feeling of inability to stop myself...

905
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:41,803
What should I call it?

906
00:54:42,774 --> 00:54:44,274
I do not know the answer to that.

907
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:48,584
So the only thing I could do is call it you.

908
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,883
Dissipating didn't scare me.

909
00:54:54,383 --> 00:54:58,624
But not being able to see you scared me.

910
00:55:17,404 --> 00:55:18,573
It's been a while.

911
00:55:23,343 --> 00:55:24,713
This place...

912
00:55:24,714 --> 00:55:26,613
Don't worry. I'm in your dream.

913
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:28,953
I secretly sneaked in.

914
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:30,924
I thought you would want to see me.

915
00:55:33,593 --> 00:55:35,964
You were curious what would grow in this flower pot.

916
00:55:38,593 --> 00:55:39,734
It's a cosmos.

917
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:41,734
Isn't it perfect for him?

918
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:43,734
How beautiful.

919
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,604
What about me? What do you think?

920
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:49,342
I wanted to show off my school uniform,

921
00:55:49,343 --> 00:55:51,513
but I had no one to show it.

922
00:55:53,013 --> 00:55:54,044
You look beautiful.

923
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:55,843
Thank you.

924
00:55:56,613 --> 00:55:57,714
Thank you...

925
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:01,254
for everything you did for me.

926
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:04,593
I don't know why you chose me.

927
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:07,294
I knew everything...

928
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:11,394
that you would overcome all the hardships.

929
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:15,763
- You know, - Yes?

930
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:19,633
when you know how it would end, why do you let us go through it?

931
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:21,674
I was always curious.

932
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:30,983
At times, the deity lets you experience it...

933
00:56:30,984 --> 00:56:32,783
even knowing the end.

934
00:56:34,053 --> 00:56:37,754
Even when we know the flower will bloom, the sun will rise,

935
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,993
and you will smile...

936
00:56:40,493 --> 00:56:42,124
because we always want to see it.

937
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:46,694
Yes. That's it.

938
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:48,663
I wanted to see that smile.

939
00:56:51,104 --> 00:56:53,573
That's all I need. That's enough.

940
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:55,843
Go, Dong Kyung.

941
00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:58,473
Your story isn't over yet.

942
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:07,383
Her story had just begun.

943
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:13,124
Doctor.

944
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,964
I'm the husband of the pregnant woman who was in a car accident.

945
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:21,004
- Okay. - You were her doctor, right?

946
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,233
Before she lost her consciousness,

947
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,104
she saw your name on your coat.

948
00:57:25,473 --> 00:57:27,174
It's a unique name.

949
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:28,973
(Kim Human)

950
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:30,644
Is there a problem?

951
00:57:30,944 --> 00:57:31,973
No.

952
00:57:32,473 --> 00:57:35,513
Thanks to you, my wife and our baby are all okay.

953
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:38,754
My wife wanted to thank you.

954
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:41,183
I'm glad to hear that.

955
00:57:43,453 --> 00:57:45,953
Thank you. Thank you so much.

956
00:57:50,294 --> 00:57:51,334
Don't mention it.

957
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:56,303
I want to thank them for staying alive.

958
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:12,113
Gosh. I'm so sleepy.

959
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:18,823
Aren't you Ms. Tak's boyfriend?

960
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:20,553
Hello.

961
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,433
I didn't know you were a doctor here.

962
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:26,234
How come I didn't know that?

963
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:28,933
Right. This hospital is really big.

964
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:33,104
But then, why did you look so young that day?

965
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:35,774
Is it because you didn't have your coat on?

966
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:39,944
Did you know?

967
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:42,242
This hospital is haunted.

968
00:58:42,243 --> 00:58:43,742
I saw a ghost here.

969
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:45,053
Have you seen a ghost?

970
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:46,883
No.

971
00:58:49,254 --> 00:58:52,223
Actually, you sort of resemble that ghost I saw.

972
00:58:53,424 --> 00:58:54,593
Are you a ghost?

973
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:01,334
Gosh. I was just joking.

974
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:03,004
Why? Are you scared?

975
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:05,802
Don't be scared. You look nothing like that ghost.

976
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:07,374
It was a joke.

977
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:09,643
Do you smoke?

978
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:13,473
No. I don't. It's not healthy.

979
00:59:14,174 --> 00:59:17,243
Right. It's not healthy. It does more harm than good.

980
00:59:19,453 --> 00:59:21,322
I was going to drink two cups as I was sleepy.

981
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:22,424
It's your lucky day.

982
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:32,663
What's your specialty?

983
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:35,303
Emergency Medicine.

984
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,773
You must be super-busy.

985
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:40,874
Yes, sort of.

986
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,214
Ms. Tak, did you read that?

987
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:47,882
It's been getting some traction.

988
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:49,682
- It's... - Which one's getting traction?

989
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,512
Well, a lot of novels are getting traction nowadays.

990
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:52,984
The one with the long title.

991
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:55,654
- The pen name is Harubang. - What?

992
00:59:56,883 --> 00:59:58,524
Was it "Doom..."

993
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:01,263
"at Your Service"? Something like that.

994
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:03,394
It's pretty good. Did you read that?

995
01:00:04,663 --> 01:00:07,663
Well, I did come across it.

996
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,303
- What did you think? - What? What do you mean?

997
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:13,404
Why are you acting so surprised? Did you write that?

998
01:00:13,973 --> 01:00:17,674
No. I mean, it doesn't get a lot of views.

999
01:00:18,644 --> 01:00:20,113
That's why I want to sign the writer.

1000
01:00:20,513 --> 01:00:22,512
Don't you know that my specialty is helping writers...

1001
01:00:22,513 --> 01:00:24,214
who has potential become successful?

1002
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,013
Forget it.

1003
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:28,124
- I didn't ask you. - What?

1004
01:00:28,323 --> 01:00:29,722
- What? - What?

1005
01:00:29,723 --> 01:00:30,754
What?

1006
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,894
I'm going home.

1007
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:40,663
Ms. Tak.

1008
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:47,234
Yes?

1009
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:49,904
How about a team dinner to build our teamwork?

1010
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:52,044
I have plans.

1011
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:54,044
I see. Okay.

1012
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:01,883
Bye.

1013
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,323
Kids these days. Seriously.

1014
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,763
Thank you. Please wait.

1015
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:11,763
Yes, I just walked in.

1016
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,133
Okay. I'll wait.

1017
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,504
Okay.

1018
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,373
Are you ready to order?

1019
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,802
One iced Americano, please.

1020
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,544
One iced Americano.

1021
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:24,404
It's four dollars.

1022
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:32,453
Why are you staring at me?

1023
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,883
You have a nice smile.

1024
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:38,823
I get that a lot.

1025
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:45,993
- What? - You're handsome.

1026
01:01:46,294 --> 01:01:48,004
I get that a lot too.

1027
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:50,303
Mr. Lee!

1028
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:53,933
What? Brother!

1029
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:56,703
- Cute. - Cute.

1030
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:03,214
What?

1031
01:02:04,584 --> 01:02:06,283
Are you guys friends or something?

1032
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,883
This is my boyfriend.

1033
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:13,323
And they are my forever colleagues.

1034
01:02:14,624 --> 01:02:17,064
He doesn't have any friends. I want him to make some friends.

1035
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:19,993
No.

1036
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:22,633
I just made a friend.

1037
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:36,214
See? I told you he was tall.

1038
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:38,214
Right.

1039
01:02:39,113 --> 01:02:40,154
He looks young.

1040
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,383
Why did I think he was old that day?

1041
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:50,593
Gosh. You always feed me when there are people around.

1042
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,492
My boyfriend does that too.

1043
01:02:52,493 --> 01:02:54,033
He feeds me when there are people around.

1044
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,633
I'm sorry about the other day.

1045
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:00,874
Pardon? When...

1046
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,984
Gosh. What's this?

1047
01:03:14,453 --> 01:03:16,124
Did she really manipulate their memories?

1048
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:18,024
That's fascinating.

1049
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:21,424
To be honest, I was a bit worried about today.

1050
01:03:21,794 --> 01:03:26,093
But how could she leave only the essential parts?

1051
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:29,004
She's very detailed.

1052
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:30,964
Look at me.

1053
01:03:31,163 --> 01:03:32,632
She made me look so handsome,

1054
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:34,073
so you would fall in love with me.

1055
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:36,973
What are you saying? Gosh, you're ridiculous.

1056
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:40,544
When you first saw me, you thought I was handsome.

1057
01:03:40,913 --> 01:03:42,013
I didn't.

1058
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:47,953
Sleep over tonight.

1059
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:51,453
- Dream on. - Is this a dream?

1060
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:54,794
No, it's not.

1061
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:01,904
Hey. Hey! Make a wish.

1062
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:18,354
Did you make a wish?

1063
01:04:19,354 --> 01:04:21,424
- Yes. - What did you wish for?

1064
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:24,953
I won't tell you.

1065
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:27,452
Why not? Tell me.

1066
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:28,663
I won't tell you.

1067
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:30,763
Gosh, you're so petty.

1068
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,234
What did you wish for?

1069
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:36,163
I won't tell you.

1070
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:38,533
So petty of you to copy that.

1071
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,473
You started it first.

1072
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:45,512
(What is the wish of your life?)

1073
01:04:45,513 --> 01:04:46,674
Let's get married quickly.

1074
01:04:47,243 --> 01:04:50,843
What? Why are you bringing up marriage again?

1075
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:18,444
(Doom at Your Service)
