(Final Episode)

4
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:40,433
Do you have an umbrella?

5
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:42,734
It's raining out.

6
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,043
What...

7
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,273
What's your deal?

8
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,124
I'm your hand holder.

9
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:47,404
I can't stop the rain anymore.

10
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,543
I have to use an umbrella like you people.

11
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:52,974
Because...

12
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,143
I've become like you people.

13
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,284
I can't get sick.

14
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,524
You'll be upset if I do.

15
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,464
I think I'll hate rainy days because it's cumbersome.

16
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,804
This isn't a dream, is it?

17
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,413
You're real, right?

18
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:36,353
I wanted to avoid getting wet. Oh well.

19
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,124
I'll make an exception today.

20
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,643
Stop staring. You'll burn a hole in me.

21
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,614
What happened?

22
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,023
Where have you been?

23
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:50,923
I took a trip to the fiery pit.

24
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,823
Stop joking.

25
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:58,804
That garden.

26
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,673
She sent you back?

27
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,343
No. She let me be born.

28
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,373
Thanks to you,

29
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,744
I grew up nicely and made her happy with me.

30
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,013
That's why I'm back.

31
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,153
What does that mean?

32
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,393
You saw those flowers there, right?

33
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,723
Those are all you.

34
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:28,064
She and I are caretakers of that garden.

35
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,604
To be more precise,

36
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,804
I was a butterfly for that garden.

37
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:38,044
- But? - But I bloomed...

38
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,273
because I died for you.

39
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,583
- Then you're... - I no longer bring doom.

40
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:48,554
I am...

41
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,924
just human like you.

42
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:55,424
Is that okay?

43
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,694
Even if I'm nothing now?

44
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:03,164
Even if I can't do anything for you?

45
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,203
I've missed you so much.

46
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,443
It was so hard without you.

47
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:12,804
How could you say that?

48
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:18,583
Okay. I guess so.

49
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:31,294
You must've spent many days...

50
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,494
thinking about me.

51
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,804
Sorry.

52
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,273
You're hungry, but this is all I have at home.

53
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,583
No. I'll go out and pick something up.

54
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:04,164
I would've gone grocery shopping had I known.

55
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,832
It's your first meal as a human.

56
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,164
You didn't know.

57
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,504
You didn't know we could even meet again.

58
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,604
You didn't know I'd be back as a human.

59
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,343
I thought it was really the end.

60
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,383
I can't believe it.

61
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:29,283
I'm hungry, so I'll have to eat.

62
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,653
I'll be sleepy, so I'll have to sleep.

63
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,124
I can see you.

64
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,624
I may get sick at times and recover.

65
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:42,463
I can live with you like that and die together with you.

66
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:44,203
Me too.

67
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:46,703
I can't believe it.

68
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,643
This is delicious.

69
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,854
This isn't a dream, is it?

70
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,293
No, it isn't.

71
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,033
It really isn't, right?

72
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:18,133
No.

73
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,674
It can't be a dream.

74
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:24,504
Don't disappear on me.

75
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,914
- Okay. - Ever.

76
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:30,984
Okay.

77
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,394
You're up.

78
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:19,764
You have to leave for work, right?

79
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:38,384
What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?

80
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,514
I thought you had left.

81
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:50,294
Why did you bring your boyfriend to work?

82
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:55,564
Well... He has no friends.

83
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:58,102
I can't leave him home alone.

84
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:00,274
Why not? He's an adult.

85
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:02,232
Well, his mental state...

86
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,273
His mental state is that of a child?

87
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,144
No, not a child. But...

88
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,944
I'm all he has right now.

89
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,174
Why?

90
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,444
Does he not get along with people?

91
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:14,253
No, he doesn't. How could he?

92
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,323
Since he wasn't...

93
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,353
He wasn't what?

94
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:22,493
Here... He wasn't from here.

95
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:26,063
You have a meeting with Dalgona today.

96
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,394
You won't take him with you, right?

97
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,893
I will.

98
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,732
Hey. You need to separate work from your personal life...

99
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,773
He has a car. He's a good driver too.

100
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,033
Your life becomes work and work becomes your life.

101
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,503
I like that attitude. You're like a real manager.

102
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:43,274
You look the most like a CEO at times like these.

103
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,013
And what times are those?

104
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,814
When you change your tune based on what's profitable.

105
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,852
I'm dependable, aren't I?

106
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,752
Like I'll build the company well and stuff, right?

107
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:54,722
I don't know about that, but I don't think it'll go bankrupt.

108
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:58,093
It won't go bankrupt if you go and get the contract signed.

109
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:08,873
I'll try.

110
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,243
Let's go.

111
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,514
If you don't like your CEO, should I kill him?

112
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,713
You can't kill people anymore.

113
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,222
That's right.

114
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:26,353
There's something else that you can do for me though.

115
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:29,024
Drive me around.

116
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,962
I'll see you later.

117
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:34,164
Don't come back. Go home from the meeting.

118
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:35,794
Got it.

119
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:39,963
Reunion?

120
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:42,202
What reunion?

121
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,674
How nice is it to meet up often like this?

122
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:48,343
This time, Eun Bi, Da Young, and Jung Hwa are really coming.

123
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,684
I let Ji Na know too, but she hasn't responded.

124
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,713
You'll come, right?

125
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:58,483
- I'll see. - Don't give me that. Come.

126
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:01,822
Hey, I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

127
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:02,953
Bye.

128
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:06,362
Why are you bringing that here?

129
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,033
It's clearly for a grand opening.

130
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:10,463
You should bring that to a newly opened business.

131
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:12,564
It came in your name.

132
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,503
Joo Ik sent it.

133
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,634
Think of it as me and raise it.

134
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,502
He says to raise it as him.

135
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,304
Shouldn't you raise it yourself?

136
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,044
That's why I brought it.

137
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:24,343
Seriously. I told him I needed him,

138
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,544
and he sent a plant with his name on it.

139
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:28,712
He must want me to pay him back for raising me.

140
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:29,713
Put it up there.

141
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,253
- There? - Yes.

142
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:46,904
Hi, sis.

143
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,904
Me? I'm at the first location. Why?

144
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,274
This is probably not the face that Sun Kyung knows.

145
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,514
Say you got a new boyfriend.

146
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,452
You punk. How will that make me look then?

147
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,284
Like a popular girl.

148
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,323
A girl who's popular only with guys with this car.

149
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,723
I didn't think about the car.

150
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,394
This is how detail-oriented I am.

151
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:24,904
Here. Right here. Come this way.

152
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:30,274
Hey. So... What happened was...

153
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,853
- He's... So... - Brother!

154
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:37,884
Brother!

155
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,722
Brother! Do you have any idea how much I've missed you?

156
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:44,924
I've missed you so much, Brother.

157
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,164
Me too.

158
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,894
This moving reunion is nice and all,

159
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,804
but look at him. Doesn't he look different?

160
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,072
No. He looks the same.

161
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,044
Even the mole right here.

162
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:02,373
He looks the same?

163
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,243
That can't be.

164
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,083
See? He looks the same.

165
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,424
No? Did he gain weight?

166
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:21,833
What... How is this...

167
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:24,034
No?

168
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:28,603
He looks the same.

169
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:34,113
(Kim Ji Eun)

170
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,483
I'm nice like that.

171
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,194
Ji Eun! Let's go!

172
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,664
Okay. Be right there!

173
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,503
What are you doing?

174
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,444
- What's this? - What?

175
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,143
Something new that I'm raising.

176
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,284
What is it?

177
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:14,083
I don't know. I won't know until it blooms.

178
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,482
You have to tell us once it does.

179
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,252
Let's go. The restaurant will close soon.

180
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,823
- Okay. - Let's go.

181
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,593
So...

182
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:29,933
She did it?

183
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,903
What else could explain it?

184
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:32,963
She did it.

185
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,404
It's amazing.

186
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,373
It's not that amazing.

187
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,113
Isn't my being with you amazing?

188
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,343
Of course, it is.

189
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,184
You don't seem that amazed.

190
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,684
You're always touching rather than amazing.

191
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:51,453
Wow.

192
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,822
Who knew you could be this sweet?

193
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:55,794
I could be even sweeter.

194
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,564
Anyway,

195
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,663
you said you had a meeting but you went to see your brother.

196
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,332
Is it okay to lie at work?

197
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,603
It's okay.

198
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,732
That jerk always says he's off to meetings...

199
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,733
and goes to Ji Na's place. I know everything.

200
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,843
I just turn a blind eye, that's all.

201
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:15,113
Also, I can just have the meeting now.

202
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,143
Now?

203
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,083
Let's test it one more time.

204
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,014
Where to?

205
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,353
Where to?

206
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,924
You haven't broken up with him yet?

207
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:32,693
Even he recognizes me.

208
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,363
What do you mean? Do you think I'm an idiot?

209
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:36,634
Sir.

210
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,463
Take a close look. Doesn't he...

211
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,103
seem different?

212
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,144
- He's the same. - What's the same?

213
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,414
You're still an annoying jerk.

214
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,353
I ought to...

215
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,752
Why won't you answer my question?

216
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,023
Are you still going out with him?

217
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,683
We won't break up until we die.

218
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,593
I wasn't asking you.

219
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,524
Seriously.

220
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,593
May I hit him?

221
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,264
No.

222
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:15,773
I'll go pick up our drinks and dessert,

223
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:17,543
so please calm down, both of you.

224
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,482
You may be happy now,

225
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,512
but you never know what life may bring.

226
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,614
We're getting married.

227
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,522
You never know until you walk down the aisle.

228
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:33,782
It isn't over till it's over.

229
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,894
We'll probably walk down the aisle before you turn 20.

230
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,624
- How did you know? - What?

231
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,134
That you like her?

232
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,693
How did you know?

233
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:44,733
How could I not?

234
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,203
I knew from the first time I saw you at the tteokbokki place.

235
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,032
Did... Did you tell her?

236
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,972
- Should I? - Don't you dare.

237
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:52,074
Why not?

238
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,213
In case she thinks I'm cute.

239
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,854
I'm speechless.

240
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,924
Do you think you're cute?

241
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:13,924
Okay.

242
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:17,702
I'm busy, so I have to go. Goodbye.

243
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,262
I just got our drinks.

244
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,104
Let him go. I guess he needs to run away.

245
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,944
Anyway, call me later.

246
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,243
Sir.

247
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:33,914
I'll let you go, but can you do something for me first?

248
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:38,854
I'm begging you.

249
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:42,053
Please.

250
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,324
What is it? Make it quick.

251
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,404
Hold on.

252
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:55,473
Hello. You can come in...

253
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,404
Hi.

254
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,074
It's Park Young.

255
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:05,783
Let's have a one-on-one fan meeting.

256
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,013
Just 30 minutes. No. 20 minutes. Please?

257
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,184
What?

258
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,063
You didn't say we were meeting her.

259
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,803
I didn't say we weren't either.

260
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,133
It was a great opportunity.

261
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,673
I can test it and do my work.

262
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,844
Two birds, one stone.

263
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:36,973
Thanks to that, I got Dalgona to sign the contract...

264
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,143
and repay her.

265
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,713
This is also two birds, one stone.

266
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,523
I still hate him.

267
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,083
Why do you hate him so much?

268
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,194
Don't you?

269
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,492
Why? He's cute.

270
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,364
Don't you think that's the problem?

271
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,023
Did you see how his face changed?

272
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:24,053
That's how he is.

273
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:26,563
He did that to me first.

274
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,893
What choice do we have?

275
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,533
He's our best author.

276
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,972
It isn't midnight yet.

277
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,604
We have a lot of time left.

278
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,713
We don't have a contract like that anymore.

279
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:44,174
That's right. We don't.

280
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:47,384
We can hold hands for no reason whatsoever.

281
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,553
You're so right.

282
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:53,753
But seriously... That kid...

283
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,993
- Hey. - I'm back.

284
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,364
Hi, Brother-in-law.

285
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:07,434
Go on. Say hi.

286
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:18,483
I'm back.

287
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:26,924
Thank you.

288
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,354
Hello.

289
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,404
Hi.

290
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:41,604
Hey. Are you here to get your hair done?

291
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:43,674
Yes.

292
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:45,873
Right.

293
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,213
It's a salon. Why else would you be here?

294
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,914
I heard Da Young worked here.

295
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,742
She's good.

296
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,513
I come here often because of her.

297
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,723
Did you get your hair done? It looks nice.

298
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,453
Thanks.

299
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:04,993
I heard...

300
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,364
that your friend that you mentioned recovered.

301
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:09,262
How did you hear that?

302
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:10,763
Sun Kyung told me.

303
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,664
About how he knows you too.

304
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,733
That's right. Sun Kyung.

305
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:19,404
Yes, she got better. She's healthy now.

306
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:22,574
I'm glad. I was worried.

307
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:24,013
Thanks.

308
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,243
I hear we're having a reunion.

309
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:29,414
Yes, I heard.

310
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:31,684
Are you going?

311
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:33,824
No.

312
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:37,624
Okay. Bye.

313
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:11,463
Thus, I am no longer a café worker.

314
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,164
I am the manager of the second store.

315
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,763
That's all.

316
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,904
- Really? - I'm so proud of you.

317
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,833
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

318
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,542
Soo Ah and Jong Won...

319
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:26,042
are finally pulling their weight from above.

320
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,772
They're finally pulling their weight.

321
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,844
- Sun Kyung, that's great. - Great.

322
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:33,312
Your dream is finally coming true.

323
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:34,983
Is it your 49th?

324
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:36,684
48th?

325
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:38,853
Is it the 49th?

326
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:40,853
What does it matter what number it is?

327
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,894
What matters is that he's doing something.

328
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,093
You're eating well today.

329
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,063
You barely ate in the past.

330
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:53,333
He must've missed Korean food like crazy.

331
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,473
- Isn't that right? - Yes.

332
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:58,773
I missed everything.

333
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,513
Gosh... Goodness, Brother.

334
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:04,883
You're embarrassing me.

335
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:07,114
What is wrong with this kid?

336
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,982
When are you going to move in here?

337
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,154
What?

338
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:14,923
Well, so... I've thought it over.

339
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:17,823
My job is closer from there...

340
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:18,864
No.

341
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,792
Move in. I want to live with you...

342
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,292
until you get married.

343
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:25,233
Come on. You're so dense.

344
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,972
It's because she won't be able to spend time alone with him.

345
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:30,003
Hey.

346
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:32,973
We can just go to my place then.

347
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:35,973
I have a lot of rooms.

348
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:39,414
I see. You have your own place?

349
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,043
You have a lot of rooms?

350
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,753
Yes. It's quite big.

351
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,624
I see. Okay, then.

352
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:49,453
Are you done with everything in the US?

353
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,793
So you told them I was in the US.

354
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,104
Wasn't he?

355
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,134
- I was. - Okay.

356
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:05,302
What do you plan to do...

357
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,013
to make a living in Korea now?

358
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:14,914
I plan to continue doing the same job as before.

359
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:22,924
(Ambulance)

360
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:33,604
(Rescue)

361
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,074
- This way. - Please make way.

362
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,084
Excuse me.

363
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:52,023
(Kim Human)

364
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,094
She was in a car accident.

365
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,962
There aren't any external injuries,

366
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,062
but she's pregnant.

367
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:04,094
She had stomach pain and fainted.

368
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,433
Call OBGYN...

369
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:06,703
and Pediatrics just in case.

370
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:07,763
Yes, doctor.

371
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,803
Excuse me.

372
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:15,713
Do you hear me?

373
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:18,983
My baby...

374
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,614
Please save my baby.

375
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:25,483
How far along are you?

376
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,924
- Hello? - Her BP is dropping.

377
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,052
I called OBGYN.

378
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,562
- Someone will be here in 10. - She looks bad.

379
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:33,762
She may have a brain hemorrhage.

380
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:35,233
Bring her to an OR right away.

381
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:36,433
Call Anesthesiology...

382
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,863
and tell OBGYN and Pediatrics to come there.

383
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:38,864
Yes, doctor.

384
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:47,203
I'm so very happy for you. Congratulations.

385
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,114
Here's a little gift.

386
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,483
What are you congratulating me for?

387
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:55,513
I hear you're having a baby.

388
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:58,083
How did you know?

389
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,853
Well. People at the hospital are always talking.

390
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,453
I heard a little rumour.

391
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,623
I'll go to the first birthday party.

392
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,824
There's no need. You came to our wedding too.

393
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,262
Thank you.

394
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:11,604
Sure. And...

395
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:15,404
This is the new contract I mentioned before.

396
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,173
What? Out of the blue?

397
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,673
The document describes the detailed terms,

398
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:21,573
so please read it thoroughly.

399
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,272
I'm sure you're busy with your main job,

400
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:24,982
but please review the terms.

401
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:26,944
I hope for a positive response.

402
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,114
Be honest with me.

403
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,324
This was why you really came, isn't it? Not to congratulate me.

404
00:27:32,924 --> 00:27:35,924
Well... It was for both.

405
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,923
What is there to think about?

406
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,593
Of course, I'll sign.

407
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,933
Still, you should review the terms...

408
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,193
and call me afterwards.

409
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,033
We're very confident...

410
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,803
(Human)

411
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:54,503
We're confident...

412
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,243
Excuse me.

413
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:00,114
I'm almost done.

414
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,614
Yes, I'm coming now. Okay.

415
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,124
Sorry about that.

416
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,884
He has the worst timing.

417
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,753
Who...

418
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,363
My boyfriend.

419
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:13,522
That boyfriend who went far away.

420
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:14,934
Is he finally back?

421
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:18,803
Yes.

422
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,404
My gosh, doctor.

423
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:29,074
You look as handsome as ever.

424
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,913
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:33,983
Yes. I'm going on a date with my girlfriend.

426
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:37,753
It's nice out. It's perfect for a date.

427
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,453
Hello.

428
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:45,163
It seems like just yesterday when you were fretting...

429
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:46,824
about whether or not you'll get married.

430
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,634
But now, you're completely healed too.

431
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,562
Life is unpredictable.

432
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,634
Back then, none of us knew he'd end up working here.

433
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,703
Right.

434
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,844
But when are you two getting married?

435
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,444
Well, we haven't decided yet.

436
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:07,913
We'll be off now.

437
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,084
I hope you two also recover so you can go home.

438
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:12,353
Don't worry about us.

439
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:13,783
We're very healthy.

440
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:16,753
Goodness, we stayed for too long, didn't we?

441
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,793
We'll leave so you two can spend time together.

442
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:29,073
By the way, you haven't mentioned anything...

443
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:30,903
about that ghost these days.

444
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:32,303
I haven't heard any stories lately.

445
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:37,674
I think he went over there.

446
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,844
Do you think so?

447
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:45,184
I hope he got there safely.

448
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,854
Hey, wait for me.

449
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:52,624
I can't believe you actually became a doctor.

450
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:55,493
I didn't live that long for nothing.

451
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,694
Do you think it suits you? Is it okay?

452
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,803
No, obviously not. It's not something I used to do.

453
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,773
But you're doing awfully good.

454
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,604
It's because I've always wanted...

455
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:06,404
to do something that saves lives.

456
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,413
What are you going to do about your name?

457
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:11,174
Are you really going to live as Kim Human?

458
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:13,584
I like it. You gave me this name.

459
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,684
Gosh, what do you like about it? It came from the top of my head.

460
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,222
You named me from the top of your head?

461
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,624
Yes, I did.

462
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,992
But now that I think about it, I'm starting to think...

463
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:25,063
it all happened for a reason.

464
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,894
I really am learning things as I live.

465
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,002
If I knew this was going to happen,

466
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:37,503
I would've given you a cooler name.

467
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,003
I can't believe I named you Human.

468
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,084
When do you want to get married?

469
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,154
Gosh, we don't need to get married.

470
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:53,924
Has your love faded?

471
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:56,324
Do you not like me anymore because I'm average?

472
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:59,523
Why? Do you not like me because I'm average?

473
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:03,334
You were never average.

474
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,634
From the first time we met up until this very moment,

475
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,174
you were always special to me.

476
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:14,104
I know that was a line, but my heart skipped a beat.

477
00:31:15,444 --> 00:31:17,013
It wasn't a line. I really meant it.

478
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:20,043
Are you getting used to this?

479
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:21,614
Yes.

480
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:24,924
The only uncomfortable thing is that I can't read minds.

481
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:28,493
But at the same time, it's also kind of nice.

482
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:33,164
Because I'm unsure, I find myself making an effort.

483
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:35,134
You're really human now.

484
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:37,864
Fate doesn't change.

485
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,633
When I knew how things were going to end,

486
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,404
I never reached out to them.

487
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:47,144
But now that I can't see that, I end up trying my best.

488
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,973
Sometimes, I feel like it's going to end,

489
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:53,243
but that becomes a new beginning.

490
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:58,324
I guess that's how you guys are able to live eternally.

491
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,154
All humans are terminally ill.

492
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,223
They live forever only when they're not aware of that.

493
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:05,894
Isn't this what you said a long time ago?

494
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,694
When I was immortal, it felt like I was terminally ill.

495
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:12,733
But now that I've become mortal,

496
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:15,374
it somehow feels like I can live forever.

497
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:17,973
Let's live together forever.

498
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,444
Is that a proposal?

499
00:32:20,543 --> 00:32:21,713
No, it's not.

500
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:37,793
Standing here with you like this reminds me of that day.

501
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:42,563
The day we went to a world where no one else existed but us...

502
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,463
and watched the sunset together.

503
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:48,503
I couldn't forget the look you had on your face...

504
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,533
for a very long time.

505
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,344
How do I look now?

506
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,844
You look comfortable.

507
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:02,414
You don't look lonely.

508
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:04,983
Right.

509
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,483
I'm not lonely.

510
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:11,824
Now I know which direction to walk to.

511
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,834
And that's you.

512
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:22,803
You talk so well for someone who couldn't even send a text.

513
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,543
What do you mean I couldn't send a text?

514
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,913
Back when you were gone,

515
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:30,573
I found your cell phone at your place.

516
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,713
And I saw that you wrote a text but never sent it.

517
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,483
You sent a lot of texts.

518
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:39,283
You read them all? Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:41,283
- I'm telling you now. - No, I mean...

520
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:46,023
But I must say, it's weird. How did your cell phone...

521
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:49,694
manage to stay turned on for three whole months?

522
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,773
It was probably her.

523
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,003
I see.

524
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,543
I wonder how she's doing.

525
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:11,154
Wherever she is,

526
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,584
I bet she's doing well...

527
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,194
and still has a lot of love for humans.

528
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:23,364
In the past, I didn't understand why she loved humans so much.

529
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:28,773
I didn't know why she said love derives from hate.

530
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:34,404
She also probably hated humans at first.

531
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,444
Then she probably forgave them.

532
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,784
And one day,

533
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,813
I bet she felt grateful that they created her.

534
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,924
I finally get it now because I also felt the same way.

535
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,534
It's cold. Let's go. We'll catch a cold.

536
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:04,204
Hey.

537
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,474
How's life?

538
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,583
It's nice.

539
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:34,804
My gosh.

540
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:38,134
Did you see that I made it into the top 10?

541
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:39,904
This is my first time.

542
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:42,473
Congratulations.

543
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,844
This is amazing.

544
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:47,244
See? I told you romance wasn't my genre.

545
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:49,883
Okay, fine.

546
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,013
("The Demon Landlord")

547
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,924
By the way, isn't the main character based on me?

548
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:56,494
Well, yes.

549
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:59,622
But I added my imagination to it.

550
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,663
Do I seem like a demon to you?

551
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,462
Why is he a demon?

552
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:04,732
That part isn't important.

553
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,663
You need to focus on the fact that he's a landlord.

554
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:08,602
What? So are you offended?

555
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,034
Devils and demons are very sexy, you know.

556
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:15,213
- You think I'm sexy? - Yes.

557
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,412
- No. - I'm not?

558
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:18,444
What?

559
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:21,083
Yes. No.

560
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,614
Did you cut your hair?

561
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,594
Yes, a little.

562
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:31,094
How did you know? I only cut off a little bit.

563
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:32,994
To go to a school reunion?

564
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,293
No, because...

565
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,333
you told me you were coming.

566
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,913
What's that look in your eyes?

567
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,083
What's your hand doing there?

568
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:04,293
I mean, it was all too sudden.

569
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,463
Would you like to go for a drink?

570
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,804
A drink?

571
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,404
- Why? - Let's drink.

572
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:17,503
I want to drink today.

573
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:24,413
I've always wondered how it'd feel to be on the top of the list.

574
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:27,244
I finally get how it feels to be in the top 10.

575
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:30,653
It's burdening and scary.

576
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:31,983
But I'm also on cloud nine.

577
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,253
I'm so excited.

578
00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:35,022
In the next episode,

579
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:37,122
the demon is going to bribe all the modern ghosts...

580
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:39,293
and send them to the building next door.

581
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:42,194
He's going to make the price drop and use that chance to buy it...

582
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:59,213
So he's going to... What was I saying?

583
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,983
He's going to make the price drop and use that chance to buy it,

584
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,724
- then put it up for sale again... - You don't seem surprised.

585
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:09,824
Well, to be honest,

586
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,793
I kind of expected it.

587
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:15,763
- Really? - Yes.

588
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:17,933
I used to write romance novels.

589
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:46,793
You didn't expect this one, did you?

590
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:52,333
Well, I kind of did.

591
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:55,373
Then I'll just continue to meet your expectations.

592
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,174
So have you made up your mind?

593
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:06,244
About what?

594
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,454
Are you going to be my girlfriend or not?

595
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,353
What if I choose not to be?

596
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,023
I'm going to cry.

597
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,392
Will you just ignore me if you see me cry?

598
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,493
No, I'll even hold an umbrella above your head for you.

599
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,094
Why would you say that?

600
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,233
You shouldn't make me cry in the first place.

601
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,304
Okay, fine. I won't.

602
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,603
You just said so yourself that you won't make me cry.

603
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,244
Okay, I won't make you cry.

604
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,143
- What do you do tomorrow? - Why?

605
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,713
So we can hang out for a bit longer if it's your day off.

606
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:44,582
Are you normally like this?

607
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,654
I don't really get what you mean by that,

608
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,393
but I have to tell you that I'm not entirely sane.

609
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,763
I'm not free tomorrow. I have plans.

610
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,662
What do you need to do? Let's do it together.

611
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:58,963
You want to do it together? Are you sure?

612
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:01,103
Yes. What is it?

613
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:08,844
Put it down there.

614
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:13,583
Auntie, why are you suddenly making kimchi?

615
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,553
I moved back to Korea,

616
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:17,283
so I should make kimchi to commemorate.

617
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:19,653
Auntie, your kimchi tastes amazing.

618
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:21,853
I can easily finish a bowl of rice with your kimchi.

619
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:24,723
But this is way too much.

620
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:26,263
How are we going to make this all on our own?

621
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:27,893
We're expecting more people.

622
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:29,163
Who?

623
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,994
- Hey, I'm here. - What?

624
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,103
I bought makgeolli too.

625
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,074
It just happened.

626
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,634
- Hello. - Hello.

627
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:42,002
I heard a lot about you. You're Ji Na's boyfriend, right?

628
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:43,013
Yes.

629
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:46,514
He's also my boss.

630
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:47,813
What?

631
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,753
- Hey, Joo Ik. - What?

632
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:52,682
How do you know him?

633
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,982
Well, Joo Ik and I...

634
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:59,194
share a really big secret.

635
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:01,864
- Right, Joo Ik? - Yes, right.

636
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:04,562
He came to help out.

637
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:05,904
The more the merrier.

638
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:10,204
If he bothers you, should I just kill...

639
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:24,252
Put it in here. You guys can put it in here.

640
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:25,253
- Okay. - Okay.

641
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,324
Good job, you guys.

642
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:28,824
Why would you even come here?

643
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,694
- Well, you're here too. - I'm family.

644
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,224
- Are you married? - No, but we're going to soon.

645
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,832
- Oh, sure. - "Oh, sure"?

646
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,603
You never know whether or not you'll get married until you do.

647
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:45,603
Why do so many people keep saying that to me?

648
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:48,003
No man's ever done what I've done.

649
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:52,042
Brother, come on. Rub in the sauce properly.

650
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,083
- Who are you talking to? - Who are you talking to?

651
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,082
I'm talking to my brother-in-law.

652
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,353
- Which one? - Which one?

653
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,753
Dong Kyung, this is exhausting.

654
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:17,304
Auntie, Uncle, your glasses are empty.

655
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:19,042
Let me pour you guys a glass each.

656
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:21,042
- Okay, go ahead. - A glass for my uncle.

657
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:22,103
Here you go.

658
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:24,543
You too, Auntie.

659
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,713
Goodness, thank you.

660
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:31,614
Brother, are you not going to drink?

661
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:35,224
No, I quit drinking.

662
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:38,123
It's bad for your body.

663
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:40,463
I want to live a long life.

664
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,533
I see. It's for your health, right? Being healthy is great.

665
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:46,963
Yes, you should be healthy.

666
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,534
Okay. I hope you and my sister grow old together.

667
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,273
Here you go.

668
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:55,344
Nice.

669
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,844
Joo Ik, aren't you going to have any alcohol?

670
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:03,353
I had enough yesterday.

671
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:05,284
Then what does that make me?

672
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,554
What's going on? Did you two drink together?

673
00:43:10,494 --> 00:43:12,263
I thought you kept things professional with writers.

674
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:13,622
But you told me to approach her as a woman, not a writer.

675
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:14,923
When did I say that?

676
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:16,363
You have a way of misinterpreting things.

677
00:43:16,364 --> 00:43:17,763
I told you to get her as both a woman and a writer.

678
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:19,162
When did I ever tell you to drink with her?

679
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,633
You also got drunk and got me hooked on you.

680
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:21,634
Hey, zip it.

681
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:24,833
So are we finally going to hear how you guys first met?

682
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:27,804
Did my sister get drunk and ask for your number?

683
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:29,413
I guess you could say that.

684
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:31,473
Are you kidding me?

685
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:33,844
You were the one who barged into my house.

686
00:43:35,183 --> 00:43:36,284
Dong Kyung.

687
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,423
No, Auntie. That's not it.

688
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,753
You're seriously...

689
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:45,293
Never mind. I guess it runs in the family.

690
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:49,662
So tell me. When did you two start dating?

691
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:51,593
Ji Na, why didn't you tell me...

692
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:53,502
that you guys officially started dating?

693
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:55,773
- No, it's not what you think... - Today's our second day.

694
00:43:57,074 --> 00:43:58,272
My gosh.

695
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:00,443
Then invite me to your 100th day anniversary party.

696
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:02,573
Who celebrates their 100th day? We're not in high school anymore.

697
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:03,674
Oh, right.

698
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:05,844
What's with that smile?

699
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:08,014
I think it's cute.

700
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,453
Who's cute? Joo Ik?

701
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:11,514
No, of course not.

702
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,853
I think it's cute that it's only your second day.

703
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:19,562
How long have you guys been dating?

704
00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:21,792
Who cares how long we've been dating?

705
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,093
What matters is...

706
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,264
how much you had to overcome for the other person.

707
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:27,563
It wasn't easy for us either.

708
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,273
We even bet our lives and fate for each other.

709
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:36,213
It's a pity I can't show you guys anything to prove it.

710
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,543
You don't need to show us anything. We've seen enough.

711
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:41,884
You guys went through a lot to protect each other.

712
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,014
It was really touching.

713
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,683
Why are you suddenly being so serious?

714
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:48,924
What does that make me?

715
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,753
I'll also bet those things on you starting from now.

716
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:54,324
Stop talking nonsense.

717
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:55,793
My gosh.

718
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,533
You must've really lost it now that you're dating.

719
00:44:58,534 --> 00:45:00,364
I've never seen him like that.

720
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,832
I think you've all gone mad.

721
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,474
My goodness.

722
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:10,574
Listen, kids. I get that your love's all grand.

723
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:14,212
But let's be honest. Kevin and I went through the most.

724
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:16,812
We overcame race, language, culture,

725
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,614
and so many other things with our love.

726
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:20,824
- I love you, Soo. - Me too.

727
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,324
Me too. I love you.

728
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,392
My gosh, seriously.

729
00:45:25,393 --> 00:45:27,893
I can't be here anymore. Why am I the only one who's single?

730
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:30,363
- Where are you going? - To buy more alcohol.

731
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:32,263
You can't go outside on your own. It's too late.

732
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,533
I'll just call Sang Geun on my way to the store.

733
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:36,804
It's like he's dating Sang Geun.

734
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:39,244
A love that overcomes gender.

735
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:41,744
That's true love right there.

736
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:43,943
Are you going to write that? Should I help?

737
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,713
Nice. Should we give it a try?

738
00:45:46,114 --> 00:45:47,283
By the way, Auntie.

739
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:49,953
Ji Na's new novel became a mega hit.

740
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:52,014
Oh, really? Did you start writing a new novel, Ji Na?

741
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:53,453
What is it about?

742
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:56,224
Well, it's called "The Demon Landlord".

743
00:45:56,594 --> 00:45:58,292
These days, fantasy novels are very popular.

744
00:45:58,293 --> 00:45:59,462
Demon or devil?

745
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:00,963
- "Devil". - "Devil"?

746
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:02,863
- Okay. - You know those evil guys.

747
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:04,392
- Yes. - I used to write romance novels.

748
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:06,562
- Human, follow me. - So the demon...

749
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,562
bribes the ghosts...

750
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:10,002
and makes the price of the building go down.

751
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,602
- He makes the price go down? - Then he buys that again.

752
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,102
That's the overall storyline. I'm still thinking about it.

753
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,114
You're really bad at explaining.

754
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,773
I'm still brainstorming.

755
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:21,884
I called you out here because I had something to say to you.

756
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:25,554
Are you... Are you going to marry Dong Kyung?

757
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,353
Am I going to marry her?

758
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:31,694
- Yes. - Then we're family now.

759
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:34,293
I'm really glad you joined the family.

760
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:36,993
- Family? - Yes, family.

761
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,163
We're family.

762
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:40,063
Family.

763
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,573
That word really doesn't suit me.

764
00:46:42,574 --> 00:46:45,904
So you and I have to be responsible for our families.

765
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:50,273
For the happiness of Soo Ja, Sun Kyung, and Dong Kyung.

766
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:52,713
Of course, I'll live for your happiness as well.

767
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:54,983
Because we're family.

768
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,353
- Me too. - Do you swear?

769
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:03,224
- I can even bet my life on them. - Your life?

770
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:05,924
You're a true man.

771
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:10,134
I'm sure. You know I've liked you since I first saw you?

772
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:13,864
That's not true. I heard your thoughts that day.

773
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,474
Yes. I'm glad you're back.

774
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:19,744
Otherwise, Soo would've found you and killed you.

775
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:23,213
That doesn't sound like a joke.

776
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:27,744
My gosh, you really are amazing, Brother.

777
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,982
Is it because you lived in the States?

778
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,182
You can actually talk to him a bit.

779
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:32,853
Gosh, I'm so impressed.

780
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:39,663
Uncle. Brother.

781
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:41,364
I love you guys.

782
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,433
So I have to start living my life for him too?

783
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:49,873
Yes.

784
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:52,744
Yes! Of course!

785
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,904
Brother.

786
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:04,313
You're really weird.

787
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:06,853
Me? Why did you say that?

788
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:08,923
Why did you bring me to make kimchi there?

789
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:11,154
Wasn't it fun? We got kimchi too.

790
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:12,824
Do you not like kimchi?

791
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:15,593
I do.

792
00:48:15,594 --> 00:48:17,333
See? I knew you'd like it.

793
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:18,933
No.

794
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,034
I even like your quirky quality.

795
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:24,804
Stop saying stuff like that.

796
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,404
Why not? Do you not like it?

797
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,244
No, I really like it.

798
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:31,574
It makes my heart pound.

799
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:35,543
You wrote lines like that a lot in your novel.

800
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,753
This is real life, not a story.

801
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:39,583
Why is it any different?

802
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:46,994
By the way,

803
00:48:49,264 --> 00:48:50,793
do you remember your first love?

804
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,404
I do.

805
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,873
You're my first love.

806
00:49:02,344 --> 00:49:03,413
Liar.

807
00:49:11,713 --> 00:49:13,724
You don't have to be the first woman I loved to be my first love.

808
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:17,224
When you start loving someone, it's new and feels like first love.

809
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:21,063
Love comes in different shapes every time when you're in love.

810
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:24,764
Well, in that sense, you are my first love.

811
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:32,804
You don't seem to believe me.

812
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,944
If you don't believe me, I'll teach it to you.

813
00:49:36,313 --> 00:49:37,514
I'm a good teacher.

814
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:42,083
But do lines like that make your heart pound?

815
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,683
Like crazy.

816
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:44,852
I should say them often.

817
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:46,123
No, stop it.

818
00:49:46,424 --> 00:49:48,123
That makes me want to do it even more.

819
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:51,054
- Gosh, your personality... - What? Is it weird?

820
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:53,623
It can't be weirder than yours.

821
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,363
I'm very ordinary.

822
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:57,933
Weird people think they are ordinary.

823
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:00,003
So you don't like me?

824
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:05,134
That's why I like you.

825
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:13,183
I don't want to go home.

826
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,844
You should still go.

827
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,053
Come with me.

828
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:21,582
I have work tomorrow. I can't.

829
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,923
I'll drive you to work.

830
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:24,493
You're busy too.

831
00:50:24,494 --> 00:50:26,663
You're way busier than me.

832
00:50:29,123 --> 00:50:31,194
I think I picked the wrong profession.

833
00:50:32,293 --> 00:50:33,503
That's funny.

834
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:37,233
Funny? Then, smile for me.

835
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:40,204
You did.

836
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:43,913
Go. Drive safely.

837
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:51,514
I want it here...

838
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,694
You should go.

839
00:50:56,994 --> 00:50:58,194
Okay. Bye.

840
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:00,463
Bye.

841
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,002
- I'll get going. - Okay.

842
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,002
- You should go upstairs. - Bye.

843
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,713
I'll go after I see you go up.

844
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:21,083
Drive safely. And call me when you get home.

845
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,583
Okay.

846
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:24,014
I'll watch you go.

847
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:48,943
Hello?

848
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:50,643
I just got home.

849
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:52,913
What?

850
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,114
You told me to call you when I got home.

851
00:51:57,253 --> 00:51:58,982
You did what I asked.

852
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,853
Then, call me after you wash up and are ready to sleep.

853
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,043
(Human)

854
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:32,983
I washed up.

855
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:34,824
Are you ready to go to bed?

856
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,463
Yes. I am.

857
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,063
I'm lying down now.

858
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,534
Good.

859
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:47,833
What were you doing?

860
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,603
- I wasn't doing anything. - What?

861
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,944
What does that mean?

862
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:55,074
Well...

863
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,873
Not doing much...

864
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,583
You'll figure it out as you live your life.

865
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,183
By the way, I need your help now.

866
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:06,483
Now?

867
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:08,724
Should I head over?

868
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:10,622
No. You don't have to come.

869
00:53:10,623 --> 00:53:12,753
You can help me with the phone call.

870
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:15,563
What is it?

871
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:20,732
Remember that day when we saw each other at the hospital?

872
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:23,273
What made you hug me?

873
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:26,904
Oh, that day.

874
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:29,404
Tak Dong Kyung.

875
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:38,654
I couldn't hold myself back.

876
00:53:40,154 --> 00:53:44,224
I didn't know why I was overwhelmed and what I was feeling.

877
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:47,463
So I just did.

878
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:54,563
I knew it. You loved me back then as well.

879
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,474
I did.

880
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,503
Then,

881
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,272
Remember when you suddenly came to me and said...

882
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,372
you loved me for the first time?

883
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:05,913
Why did you do it then?

884
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:12,483
I love you.

885
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:15,224
Well,

886
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,154
I realized for the first time...

887
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:21,924
that I wouldn't be able to see you after I dissipate.

888
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,094
And that scared me like crazy.

889
00:54:30,873 --> 00:54:31,904
I see.

890
00:54:32,974 --> 00:54:34,844
That's how you were feeling.

891
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:37,973
Not being able to see me...

892
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,784
scared you more than dissipating?

893
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:44,384
I felt the same way.

894
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:49,424
At some point, not being able to see you started to scare me a lot...

895
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:51,654
more than dying.

896
00:54:52,253 --> 00:54:53,364
Isn't that funny?

897
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,563
Are you there?

898
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:02,733
Hello?

899
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:06,574
Are you...

900
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,444
sleeping?

901
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:11,614
Hey. Are you sleeping?

902
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,054
You really are human now.

903
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,924
Goodnight, Kim Human.

904
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:38,633
This feeling of inability to stop myself...

905
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:40,603
What should I call it?

906
00:55:41,574 --> 00:55:43,074
I do not know the answer to that.

907
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:47,384
So the only thing I could do is call it you.

908
00:55:50,154 --> 00:55:52,683
Dissipating didn't scare me.

909
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,424
But not being able to see you scared me.

910
00:56:16,204 --> 00:56:17,373
It's been a while.

911
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:23,513
This place...

912
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,413
Don't worry. I'm in your dream.

913
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,753
I secretly sneaked in.

914
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,724
I thought you would want to see me.

915
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:34,764
You were curious what would grow in this flower pot.

916
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,534
It's a cosmos.

917
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:40,534
Isn't it perfect for him?

918
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:42,534
How beautiful.

919
00:56:43,674 --> 00:56:45,404
What about me? What do you think?

920
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:48,142
I wanted to show off my school uniform,

921
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:50,313
but I had no one to show it.

922
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:52,844
You look beautiful.

923
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:54,643
Thank you.

924
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:56,514
Thank you...

925
00:56:57,654 --> 00:57:00,054
for everything you did for me.

926
00:57:01,424 --> 00:57:03,393
I don't know why you chose me.

927
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:06,094
I knew everything...

928
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:10,194
that you would overcome all the hardships.

929
00:57:12,194 --> 00:57:14,563
- You know, - Yes?

930
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:18,433
when you know how it would end, why do you let us go through it?

931
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,474
I was always curious.

932
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,783
At times, the deity lets you experience it...

933
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:31,583
even knowing the end.

934
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:36,554
Even when we know the flower will bloom, the sun will rise,

935
00:57:37,094 --> 00:57:38,793
and you will smile...

936
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,924
because we always want to see it.

937
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:45,494
Yes. That's it.

938
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,463
I wanted to see that smile.

939
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,373
That's all I need. That's enough.

940
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:54,643
Go, Dong Kyung.

941
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:57,273
Your story isn't over yet.

942
00:58:03,284 --> 00:58:06,183
Her story had just begun.

943
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:11,924
Doctor.

944
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:16,764
I'm the husband of the pregnant woman who was in a car accident.

945
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:19,804
- Okay. - You were her doctor, right?

946
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:22,033
Before she lost her consciousness,

947
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:23,904
she saw your name on your coat.

948
00:58:24,273 --> 00:58:25,974
It's a unique name.

949
00:58:26,773 --> 00:58:27,773
(Kim Human)

950
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:29,444
Is there a problem?

951
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:30,773
No.

952
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:34,313
Thanks to you, my wife and our baby are all okay.

953
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,554
My wife wanted to thank you.

954
00:58:38,913 --> 00:58:39,983
I'm glad to hear that.

955
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,753
Thank you. Thank you so much.

956
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:50,134
Don't mention it.

957
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:55,103
I want to thank them for staying alive.

958
00:59:08,884 --> 00:59:10,913
Gosh. I'm so sleepy.

959
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:17,623
Aren't you Ms. Tak's boyfriend?

960
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:19,353
Hello.

961
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,233
I didn't know you were a doctor here.

962
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,034
How come I didn't know that?

963
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:27,733
Right. This hospital is really big.

964
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:31,904
But then, why did you look so young that day?

965
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,574
Is it because you didn't have your coat on?

966
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:38,744
Did you know?

967
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:41,042
This hospital is haunted.

968
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:42,542
I saw a ghost here.

969
00:59:42,543 --> 00:59:43,853
Have you seen a ghost?

970
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:45,683
No.

971
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:51,023
Actually, you sort of resemble that ghost I saw.

972
00:59:52,224 --> 00:59:53,393
Are you a ghost?

973
00:59:57,893 --> 01:00:00,134
Gosh. I was just joking.

974
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:01,804
Why? Are you scared?

975
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:04,602
Don't be scared. You look nothing like that ghost.

976
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:06,174
It was a joke.

977
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:08,443
Do you smoke?

978
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:12,273
No. I don't. It's not healthy.

979
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:16,043
Right. It's not healthy. It does more harm than good.

980
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:20,122
I was going to drink two cups as I was sleepy.

981
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:21,224
It's your lucky day.

982
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,463
What's your specialty?

983
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,103
Emergency Medicine.

984
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:38,573
You must be super-busy.

985
01:00:38,574 --> 01:00:39,674
Yes, sort of.

986
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,014
Ms. Tak, did you read that?

987
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:46,682
It's been getting some traction.

988
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:48,482
- It's... - Which one's getting traction?

989
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,312
Well, a lot of novels are getting traction nowadays.

990
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,784
The one with the long title.

991
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:54,454
- The pen name is Harubang. - What?

992
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:57,324
Was it "Doom..."

993
01:00:58,194 --> 01:01:00,063
"at Your Service"? Something like that.

994
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:02,194
It's pretty good. Did you read that?

995
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:06,463
Well, I did come across it.

996
01:01:06,634 --> 01:01:09,103
- What did you think? - What? What do you mean?

997
01:01:09,704 --> 01:01:12,204
Why are you acting so surprised? Did you write that?

998
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:16,474
No. I mean, it doesn't get a lot of views.

999
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:18,913
That's why I want to sign the writer.

1000
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:21,312
Don't you know that my specialty is helping writers...

1001
01:01:21,313 --> 01:01:23,014
who has potential become successful?

1002
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,813
Forget it.

1003
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,924
- I didn't ask you. - What?

1004
01:01:27,123 --> 01:01:28,522
- What? - What?

1005
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:29,554
What?

1006
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,694
I'm going home.

1007
01:01:38,364 --> 01:01:39,463
Ms. Tak.

1008
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:46,034
Yes?

1009
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,704
How about a team dinner to build our teamwork?

1010
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:50,844
I have plans.

1011
01:01:51,614 --> 01:01:52,844
I see. Okay.

1012
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:00,683
Bye.

1013
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:05,123
Kids these days. Seriously.

1014
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,563
Thank you. Please wait.

1015
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:10,563
Yes, I just walked in.

1016
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:13,933
Okay. I'll wait.

1017
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:15,304
Okay.

1018
01:02:15,764 --> 01:02:17,173
Are you ready to order?

1019
01:02:17,174 --> 01:02:19,602
One iced Americano, please.

1020
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:21,344
One iced Americano.

1021
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:23,204
It's four dollars.

1022
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:31,253
Why are you staring at me?

1023
01:02:33,424 --> 01:02:34,683
You have a nice smile.

1024
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:37,623
I get that a lot.

1025
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:44,793
- What? - You're handsome.

1026
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,804
I get that a lot too.

1027
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:49,103
Mr. Lee!

1028
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:52,733
What? Brother!

1029
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:55,503
- Cute. - Cute.

1030
01:03:00,913 --> 01:03:02,014
What?

1031
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:05,083
Are you guys friends or something?

1032
01:03:06,924 --> 01:03:08,683
This is my boyfriend.

1033
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:12,123
And they are my forever colleagues.

1034
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:15,864
He doesn't have any friends. I want him to make some friends.

1035
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:18,793
No.

1036
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,433
I just made a friend.

1037
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:35,014
See? I told you he was tall.

1038
01:03:35,884 --> 01:03:37,014
Right.

1039
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:38,954
He looks young.

1040
01:03:39,413 --> 01:03:41,183
Why did I think he was old that day?

1041
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,393
Gosh. You always feed me when there are people around.

1042
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:51,292
My boyfriend does that too.

1043
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:52,833
He feeds me when there are people around.

1044
01:03:53,904 --> 01:03:56,433
I'm sorry about the other day.

1045
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:59,674
Pardon? When...

1046
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:12,784
Gosh. What's this?

1047
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:14,924
Did she really manipulate their memories?

1048
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,824
That's fascinating.

1049
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:20,224
To be honest, I was a bit worried about today.

1050
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:24,893
But how could she leave only the essential parts?

1051
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:27,804
She's very detailed.

1052
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:29,764
Look at me.

1053
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:31,432
She made me look so handsome,

1054
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:32,873
so you would fall in love with me.

1055
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:35,773
What are you saying? Gosh, you're ridiculous.

1056
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,344
When you first saw me, you thought I was handsome.

1057
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:40,813
I didn't.

1058
01:04:45,483 --> 01:04:46,753
Sleep over tonight.

1059
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:50,253
- Dream on. - Is this a dream?

1060
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,594
No, it's not.

1061
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:00,704
Hey. Hey! Make a wish.

1062
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:17,154
Did you make a wish?

1063
01:05:18,154 --> 01:05:20,224
- Yes. - What did you wish for?

1064
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:23,753
I won't tell you.

1065
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,252
Why not? Tell me.

1066
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:27,463
I won't tell you.

1067
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:29,563
Gosh, you're so petty.

1068
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,034
What did you wish for?

1069
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:34,963
I won't tell you.

1070
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,333
So petty of you to copy that.

1071
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:40,273
You started it first.

1072
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,312
(What is the wish of your life?)

1073
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:45,474
Let's get married quickly.

1074
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:49,643
What? Why are you bringing up marriage again?

1075
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:17,244
(Doom at Your Service)
