4
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:44,606
Tak Dong Kyung.

5
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,975
How do you know my name?

6
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,375
Who are you?

7
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:51,485
Then, who are you?

8
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,794
It's cold tonight.

9
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:02,595
Why did she leave? She could catch a cold. Goodness.

10
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:03,726
Tak Dong Kyung.

11
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,294
First floor. The doors are closing.

12
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,565
Going down.

13
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,475
- What was that about? - My aunt.

14
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,144
If she sees us, things will get complicated.

15
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,975
If we want to talk, I can't let her catch us.

16
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,106
Talk about what?

17
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,545
Aren't you here because you needed to talk to me?

18
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,314
I doubt that you came back because you missed me...

19
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,616
since we just saw each other.

20
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,485
Why did you ask me who I was?

21
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,385
You even know my name.

22
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,595
Then, what about your question?

23
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:37,295
I explained to you who I am and what I do.

24
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,166
I don't know.

25
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,966
Something feels weird.

26
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:48,205
Second basement floor.

27
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:52,705
- Where are we going? - To the parking lot.

28
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,446
This will be a long conversation.

29
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:03,655
(Episode 13)

30
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,936
I need to ask you something.

31
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,906
It's cold out here. Let's talk inside.

32
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,076
I can't do that inside.

33
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,205
I'll lose there...

34
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,675
because it's your turf.

35
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,446
- Then, this place works for you? - No.

36
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,555
There isn't such a place.

37
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,786
I picked this place...

38
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:39,925
because it'd be easier to run away if I wanted.

39
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,566
Let's stop skirting around it now.

40
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,946
- Joo Ik. - Yes.

41
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,615
Did you kiss her?

42
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:03,715
Did you...

43
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:07,916
kiss her 10 years ago?

44
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,286
- Yes. - Why?

45
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:12,786
To get her out of there.

46
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:15,395
So you two wouldn't get back together.

47
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,265
Why?

48
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,265
She cried there every single day.

49
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,305
If I didn't make her leave that day,

50
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:31,106
she would have cried, sitting on that step for days and months.

51
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,916
I didn't want her...

52
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,715
to come back again, sit there, and cry.

53
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,786
- That's why I did it. - Did you think about me?

54
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,485
- Did you? - I did.

55
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:47,656
All the more reason why I did it.

56
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,525
You knew that she was waiting for you.

57
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,165
You knew, but you never went out to see her...

58
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,365
because you were embarrassed.

59
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,234
You left Korea as if you were never going to come back,

60
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,305
but you came back only after a few months because it was tough.

61
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,305
You didn't want her to find out.

62
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:08,446
Say something.

63
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,085
Curse me out if you want. I'll handle it.

64
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,816
I won't run away.

65
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,156
Why are you brutally honest?

66
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:17,256
You could have avoided answering it,

67
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:19,855
apologized, and moved on.

68
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,296
You have a way with words too.

69
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,436
Why are you brutally honest with me?

70
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,636
Because I like you.

71
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:34,876
You are...

72
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,446
one of a few people I actually like.

73
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,546
I don't want to be a coward in front of you.

74
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,715
I've hidden it for too long.

75
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,056
And all these years,

76
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,025
it had been bothering me too.

77
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,066
This is so annoying.

78
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:08,636
You still make me feel worthless even in this moment.

79
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,546
You're so annoying.

80
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,446
Where are you going?

81
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,285
- To the cafe. - Why?

82
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,285
I don't think I can sleep in the same house with you tonight.

83
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,296
I regret every moment of it.

84
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,996
Running away, taking too long,

85
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,705
and asking you.

86
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,006
Everything.

87
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,155
I was crying.

88
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:04,394
I looked in the mirror after I came back.

89
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:05,725
And I was crying.

90
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:08,595
But I didn't even know I was crying.

91
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:12,636
When I looked in the mirror, I was crying.

92
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,446
Why was I crying?

93
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,715
Get in.

94
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,925
Where are we going?

95
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:33,525
You'll be safe. Get in.

96
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:41,436
Have you seen...

97
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:45,464
a girl who's about this tall and has hair coming up to here?

98
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,806
Have you?

99
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,245
A girl who's about this tall and has hair coming up to here?

100
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:52,305
That description fits so many girls.

101
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,446
Have you met someone like her at the hospital?

102
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:58,415
- Are you talking about her? - Have you met her?

103
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:00,455
What did she do to you?

104
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,415
She didn't do anything. I did something for her.

105
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,585
I opened a bottle for her.

106
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:06,455
What else?

107
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,225
What else?

108
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:13,594
After that, she thanked me and told me to go to the rooftop.

109
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:14,835
She said the view there was nice.

110
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,035
- Anything else other than that? - No.

111
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:22,306
Think again. I'm sure she did something to you.

112
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:24,445
What did she do?

113
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:26,446
That's what I don't know. So think again.

114
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,785
I don't know.

115
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,055
What do you know then?

116
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,426
What does she have to do with us?

117
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:42,796
Does she know me?

118
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,224
I can't remember her either?

119
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,065
Perhaps, your brain has just gone bad, not sick.

120
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,496
No need to talk about yourself now.

121
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,465
Right. I'm not exactly kind.

122
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:57,145
All good, right? It's my turn now.

123
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,915
You weren't crying?

124
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,845
Why won't you answer my question?

125
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,655
I asked if you weren't crying. Was I the only one who cried?

126
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,955
I'm not done with my questions yet.

127
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,296
Who were you calling earlier?

128
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,196
Exactly. That's really weird.

129
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:21,936
I was crying.

130
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,136
But I couldn't get that thought out of my head.

131
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:27,736
"I must call you."

132
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,741
- "You"? - But...

133
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,511
I don't know who that person is.

134
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,250
That person's number is saved on my cell phone.

135
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,820
But I have no idea who it is.

136
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,290
Call that number again.

139
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:04,081
Whoever it is isn't picking up. Whose number is this?

140
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:09,680
"Human". Who's "Human"?

141
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,550
Who knows? At least I know it's not me.

142
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:15,091
I should go now.

143
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,790
What about me?

144
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
What?

145
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,230
Aren't you going to drive me back?

146
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:21,330
It's nearby.

147
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,831
Walk back. It's only five minutes by foot.

148
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:28,930
Gosh, if he were human I would've taught him a lesson.

149
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,940
Who could it be?

150
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,910
"Human".

151
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,280
Why do you fall so easily?

152
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,390
Watch where you're going.

153
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,750
I thought you were leaving.

154
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:51,020
Yes, I was on my way.

155
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,800
My gosh. Seriously.

156
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,160

Oh, hey. Gosh.

You're here.

170
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,299
Did you sleep here?

171
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,201
- Yes. - Why?

172
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,530
Did you fight with your friend?

173

No.

174
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,711
Then what?

175
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,640
We're still fighting.

Did you fight with Hyun Kyu?

What are you talking about? Does it look like I fought with him?

I guess you guys didn't have a fistfight yet.

I'm not going to fight him. Plus, I'd win anyway.

182
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,170
Is that so? You think you'll win? Are you sure about that?

183
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,481
So you lost.

- We haven't fought yet. - Then go ahead and fight.

185
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:03,451
You won't know who will win until you actually fight him.

186
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,081
Do you want me to go around fighting people?

187
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:09,150
Do you know why I adore Hyun Kyu so much?

188
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,190
Maybe it's because he grew up as an athlete,

189
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:16,060
but behind that smile of his, I can tell he's very competitive.

190
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,201
I really like that about him.

191
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,100
Whatever.

192
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,601
You're nothing like him.

193
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:24,500
When he's in for a competition,

194
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:27,140
he does everything he can to win, but look at you.

195
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,471
You always just yield as if it doesn't even matter.

196
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,240
I bet he's pretty irritated though.

197
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,650
You always let him win without even putting up a fight.

198
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,420
Things are a bit different this time.

199
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,451
How so?

200
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,621
We're not fighting.

201
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,721
But I need to take something from him.

202
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,761
Really?

203
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,731
Then I guess you'll win this time.

204
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,269
I've never seen you fail to get what you want.

205
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,471
And the same goes with this.

206
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:02,371
I'm looking forward to it.

207
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,710
If you lose but refuse to admit to it,

208
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,210
that would make you a bad mentor.

209
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,350
But if he loses and doesn't back off,

210
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,721
that would mean you didn't teach him well.

211
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:16,621
So whatever happens, it's all on me.

212
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:19,120
If you're going to be the bad guy no matter the result,

213
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,631
you should at least win.

214
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,511
You did this, didn't you?

215
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,081
What exactly is my relationship with her?

216
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,920
You're not going to tell me?

217
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,760
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

218
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:56,591
I'll figure it out myself.

219
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,001
I didn't think you'd tell me anyway.

220
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,971
Instead, don't resent me even if something happens.

221
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,900
You kept going on about ghosts,

222
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,670
and now you're even watching ghost dramas?

223
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,799
What? What did you say?

224
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,169
You're awfully energetic for someone who's fasting.

225
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,110
Why are you starting the day watching such a scary drama?

226
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:47,680
Aunt, I'm not watching this for fun.

227
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,351
I'm studying right now.

228
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,091
I need to study ghosts in order to... Wait a minute.

229
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:56,920
What? Why does this situation feel so familiar?

230
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,221
- My goodness. - Is it a deja vu?

231
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,170
What? What are you doing here?

232
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,769
Hey, watch it. Why are you talking that way to your doctor?

233
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,871
"Doctor"? Who? Him?

234
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,410
I'm sorry. She's still half-asleep.

235
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,011
It's okay.

236
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,380
She's not very healthy right now.

237
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,149
So that could cause her to become hysterical and rude.

238
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,679
What? "Rude"?

239
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,991
Let me check your condition.

240
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,060
Hey, wait. Wait.

241
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,660
Everything seems fine.

242
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,390
Oh, gosh. Wait a minute.

243
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:37,501
And that's fine too.

244
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,231
Goodness, thank you, sir.

245
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,769
Aunt, am I the only one who finds this weird? Really?

246
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,770
Am I being strange right now?

247
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,770
Yes, you're acting strange.

248
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,270
We just need to take a few basic tests.

249
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,810
Bye then.

250
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,111
Unbelievable.

251
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:56,810
What's with you?

252
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,420
But he...

253
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,161
You again?

254
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,730
Stop chatting and sit.

255
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:12,060
I can't believe this. Why do you keep following me around?

256
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,300
- Hey. - Stay still. Don't move.

257
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,309
Do you even know how to work this thing?

258
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,471
Stop talking.

259
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,680
Seriously, why are you doing this...

260
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:31,820
Hold your breath.

261
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,691
Good girl.

262
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,570
How many jobs do you have?

263
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,170
Why are you doing this to me?

264
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,510
I'm here to save your life.

265
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,840
What are you talking about?

266
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,651
My gosh.

267
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,050
If you go in there with this, you'll die.

268
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,119
Do you know how expensive it is to fix this thing?

269
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,261
I saved your life.

270
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,629
So you're worried about the machine, not me?

271
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,029
- Lie down. - Hey.

272
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,130
Stop talking.

273
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:21,100
Why does he keep telling me to stop talking?

274
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,210
Hey. The more I think about it,

275
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,779
I really don't know why I need to take this from you...

276
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,019
Oh my gosh.

277
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,920
Hey. Stop right there. I'm talking to you.

278
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,789
- Hey! - Tak Dong Kyung?

279
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,661
- Yes? - Let's go take your blood sample.

280
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:23,130
Okay.

281
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,001
Darn it.

282
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,560
Ms. Tak!

283
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,869
(Get well soon.)

284
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,539
You need to bring fruit to someone in a hospital,

285
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,941
so I picked out this and that.

286
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,769
Can you even eat?

287
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,911
- My fasting just ended. - What good timing.

288
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,941
Is the hospital starving you?

289
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,079
You need to eat well when you're sick.

290
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,480
Eat. Eat everything.

291
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:44,920
Say the word. I'll get it for you.

292
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm on standby 24 hours a day.

293
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,691
I'll send you the pictures of hot guys that I collected.

294
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,859
You must be bored here.

295
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,129
I ask because I don't know.

296
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,661
Does it make you less bored if you look at hot guys?

297
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,830
Yes, it makes life enjoyable.

298
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,370
They've gotten close.

299
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,670
I know, right?

300
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,099
I'm so proud. So proud.

301
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,641
- We're not close. - We're not close.

302
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,632
Didn't you bring anything?

303
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,572
You're the building owner's son.

304
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,441
What? Come on.

305
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,642
I'm sure he prepared at least a line.

306
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:20,043
How have you been?

307
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,652
Not that.

308
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:30,381
Well... Tell me if you need cash.

309
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:31,752
- Awesome. - Awesome.

310
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:32,823
He's so cool.

311
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,362
How is that cool?

312
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,263
Anyways, do you want to try this?

313
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,641
Let's have some fruit.

314
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,712
- Don't open it yet. - Eat with me.

315
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,971
You eat it all. They're expensive.

316
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:53,983
They are?

317
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:57,982
I need to go. Something urgent came up.

318
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,313
- What? So suddenly? - Sorry. I'll call you.

319
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,093
I'm going drinking with Hyun Kyu.

320
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,303
Go ahead.

321
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,672
Shouldn't you stop me? You say you like me.

322
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,671
What if I do something bad?

323
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,702
Like what?

324
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:24,871
Do it.

325
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:26,513
It won't change my feelings.

326
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,712
I wouldn't have told you how I felt if it were that flippant.

327
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,323
Do you really like me?

328
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,353
- Since when? - Since the beginning.

329
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,152
When was that?

330
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:42,823
Since the beginning.

331
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,702
You're insane.

332
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:54,402
How could someone like you make such a stupid decision?

333
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,073
I know.

334
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,243
But losing what I want is what's truly stupid.

335
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,283
Losing what you want is stupid, Ms. Na.

336
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,483
Don't call me stupid.

337
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,853
I thought about it for a long time.

338
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:15,323
Why did I kiss someone I don't know?

339
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:18,192
Why did it bother me so much...

340
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,033
to see someone I don't know cry?

341
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:25,003
The answer was there from the beginning.

342
00:23:26,402 --> 00:23:28,303
I told myself it was wrong, that's all.

343
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,412
Does Hyun Kyu know too?

344
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,813
What?

345
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:40,452
That we kissed?

346
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:42,753
Or...

347
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:46,323
that I like you?

348
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:53,233
He knows everything. He knew everything.

349
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:57,103
That's why I can't back down.

350
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,743
What do you think?

351
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:04,112
Can I win?

352
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,142
I don't know.

353
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:08,783
Why don't you know anything?

354
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,253
- Like you know? - I do.

355
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:29,333
Spill it.

356
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:34,743
I don't know. I'm going crazy.

357
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,243
How did I become the bad girl?

358
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:40,612
You're no bad girl.

359
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,313
You're finally being rewarded.

360
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:44,582
- I'm being rewarded? - No, it's an award.

361
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,381
Mr. Cha is an award.

362
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:47,382
Whatever.

363
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,023
You always complained about him.

364
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,921
I always thought...

365
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,993
that jerk was a real pain,

366
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,122
but he isn't a bad person.

367
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:59,093
He doesn't give his heart that easily.

368
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,262
That's why he still hasn't opened his heart to me.

369
00:25:01,263 --> 00:25:02,462
That annoying jerk.

370
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:08,602
It's the end of Ji Na's tearjerker love stories.

371
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:10,442
Finally, you met a good guy.

372
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,042
That's right. You don't know, do you?

373
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:14,043
What?

374
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,813
He's...

375
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,467
- mad loaded. - Really?

376
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,936
No, no. It doesn't matter.

377
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,436
Why doesn't it matter?

378
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,477
To be honest, he's pretty good-looking.

379
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,547
And this is a secret.

380
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,517
I never said it in case he'd think I like him.

381
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:31,886
To be honest,

382
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,787
he's really funny at times.

383
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:37,585
He really is funny.

384
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,426
I bet he'll make you laugh every day if you go out with him.

385
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,026
I don't know. Should I see a fortune-teller?

386
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:46,497
A fortune-teller? Should we go together?

387
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:49,197
- You too? Why? - Some freak...

388
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:50,565
No, a doctor...

389
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:53,006
No, no. I don't know how to describe this.

390
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,306
What is it? Is a doctor hitting on you?

391
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,606
Yes. He keeps saying let's end the world together.

392
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,206
Oh my gosh. He says...

393
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:00,007
he'll love only you even if the world ends?

394
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:01,876
When did I say that?

395
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:04,316
- That's not it... - Awesome.

396
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:07,085
A hot doctor falls for a patient at first sight...

397
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:08,616
and begs for her love.

398
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:11,056
What an amazing hospital romance.

399
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:12,326
It is not!

400
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:14,126
Hey.

401
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:16,957
Forget it. Just forget it.

402
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,548
- Sir. - Yes?

403
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:24,118
Why did you open a cafe?

404
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,388
You were a swimmer.

405
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:28,987
You even studied abroad.

406
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:30,858
Why do you ask?

407
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,969
I sincerely like working at a cafe.

408
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:39,456
You look like you were born to own a cafe.

409
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:41,926
But I'm not sure about myself.

410
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:44,426
Well...

411
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:47,195
After I got injured while studying abroad,

412
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:48,897
I was completely lost.

413
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:51,167
I suddenly missed Korea like crazy.

414
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,506
So I stopped by a cafe...

415
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:57,436
and that was when I realized...

416
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,006
that coffee was the same there or in Korea.

417
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:03,647
Is that how you fell in love with coffee?

418
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:05,216
No, that's a lie.

419
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:09,516
It looks cool to own a cafe.

420
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:13,015
Don't wait for destiny.

421
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:15,557
It won't hit you on the head saying it's fate.

422
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:18,327
I never knew I'd run a cafe either.

423
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:21,097
If you like it, do it.

424
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,597
Don't make plans and make a big deal out of it.

425
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,367
Just do it.

426
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:27,966
You'll become good at it eventually.

427
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:31,206
Then you'll think you were meant for it.

428
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:36,847
You're good. You're doing well.

429
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:45,587
Don't you think it was a waste?

430
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,087
What can I do though?

431
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:50,156
I wasn't good enough to make the national team.

432
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,827
Not that. Your first love.

433
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:58,035
If you knew you were meant to run a cafe,

434
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:59,397
you wouldn't have left to study abroad.

435
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:02,206
Then you may have stayed together.

436
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,936
And you wouldn't be hurt like this.

437
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,647
She's the one...

438
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,077
who was hurt, not I.

439
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:14,087
I just...

440
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,256
I just kept running away.

441
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,226
It's okay.

442
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,526
Just don't run away anymore.

443
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,827
What? Do I look like a fool to you?

444
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:32,367
A bit.

445
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:34,006
You punk.

446
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:36,215
My gosh. Who put away the beans like that?

447
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:39,614
It was me. Gosh. I'm so stupid. I'm such a fool!

448
00:28:56,295 --> 00:29:01,705
(Ji Na)

449
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:10,985
Hello?

450
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:13,414
Drink with me tonight.

451
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,394
Sure. Let's do that.

452
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:33,265
Mr. Lee, what do I do with the expired beans...

453
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,874
Let me go and get changed.

454
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:48,485
You were working at this cafe?

455
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:52,255
Yes. This is the cafe. But why are you...

456
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,495
Athlete, swimmer, and running away...

457
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:01,593
I sort of figured it out.

458
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:03,464
But let me ask just one question to confirm it.

459
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:04,505
What?

460
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:07,074
Is my boss number 1 or 2?

461
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,134
What?

462
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:12,344
You told me you wanted to kill two guys. Which one is he?

463
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,344
- Number one. - Gosh. Mr. Lee.

464
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:20,015
Lock up for me. Thanks.

465
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:21,555
- Let's go. - Okay.

466
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,354
- I... - Shut it.

467
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,684
Bye.

468
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,674
Slow down.

469
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,505
You might do something you'll regret.

470
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:53,485
Sure. Do whatever you want. I'll forget about it.

471
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,055
I guess that's easy for you.

472
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:07,364
You said you came back to Korea and attended the reunion to see me.

473
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:09,964
Yes.

474
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,035
Same here.

475
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:13,674
I went to the reunion to see you every year.

476
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:19,045
- Let's drink. Drink up. - Okay.

477
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,344
"What if he doesn't come?"

478
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,515
"But what if he really came?" That's all I thought about.

479
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:29,484
I was disappointed every time,

480
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,654
anticipating seeing you as I sat there.

481
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:35,594
That's not all.

482
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,994
I couldn't go to your house.

483
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:41,164
So I roamed around your neighborhood.

484
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:45,265
I sat at a cafe near your house too.

485
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:48,704
(Danger, No Entry)

486
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:50,474
I used to get off at a subway station...

487
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,005
near your house and sit on the bench.

488
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:01,683
Whenever the doors opened, just in case you got off,

489
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:04,424
I was nervous and tense.

490
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:08,324
In case I ran into you by chance,

491
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,955
I kept roaming around your streets.

492
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,164
- I didn't know. - I don't resent you.

493
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,604
Don't look so guilty.

494
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,775
I just wanted to tell you...

495
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:24,344
that I had been loving you for a very long time by myself.

496
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,015
In my head,

497
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:31,785
I had always loved you by myself.

498
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:35,584
But...

499
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,084
seeing you again lately made me wonder...

500
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,894
if the person I loved...

501
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,465
was truly you.

502
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:48,735
What do you mean?

503
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,934
I don't know anything about you.

504
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:54,604
I realized it when I started to see you again.

505
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,344
I had been in love with...

506
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:00,374
the 18-year-old you.

507
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,815
I had been waiting for you on the same spot...

508
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,955
when you had walked away.

509
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:12,525
It's the same with me.

510
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:16,894
I don't know anything about you either.

511
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:20,364
- Yes. That's why... - But I don't care.

512
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:22,594
I won't run away now.

513
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,765
- Our relationship ended long ago. - It ended?

514
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,674
I had been a swimmer for over 10 years.

515
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:33,344
Going back to the starting line isn't that hard for me.

516
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,614
I can go back over and over again.

517
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,153
Cha Joo Ik and I kissed.

518
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,555
I know. I don't care.

519
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,325
I care.

520
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,735
I think...

521
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,975
it matters to me.

522
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,884
Na Ji Na.

523
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,024
You're horrible.

524
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:33,305
You're crying again.

525
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:35,904
Why...

526
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:38,605
are you here?

527
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:40,205
I don't know.

528
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,344
How long have you been waiting here?

529
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,245
I don't know.

530
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,254
What if I didn't show up?

531
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:51,254
I don't know that either.

532
00:34:54,654 --> 00:34:55,694
Seriously.

533
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:57,994
You're ridiculous.

534
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,424
I get that a lot.

535
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:02,535
You never disappoint me with your unexpected behaviors.

536
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,605
You confuse me.

537
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,004
I confuse you?

538
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,575
I don't think so.

539
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:20,484
Don't be confused.

540
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,225
I came here because I wanted to see you and I like you.

541
00:35:58,884 --> 00:35:59,955
What was that?

542
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,694
I didn't want to drink because if I did,

543
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,234
I might do something that I would regret.

544
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:14,475
Ms. Na.

545
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:17,544
Ms. Na.

546
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:22,004
Limit your regrets only to me.

547
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:25,004
Your regrettable action...

548
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,245
could destroy me.

549
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:01,844
You crazy wench, Na Ji Na!

550
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:04,884
Gosh. Come on.

551
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:11,085
- What? My hair? - Yes.

552
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,324
You'll be going through chemo and radiation therapy.

553
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,524
Your hair will fall out quickly.

554
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:17,825
You've seen it on TV, right?

555
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:19,693
You might cope better...

556
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:21,265
if you take care of your hair beforehand.

557
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,564
And that's what I recommend too.

558
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:27,427
Seeing your hair falling out...

559
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,626
could be harder to watch.

560
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:46,276
Ever since you were young, you had a nice shaped head.

561
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,116
So whenever I gave you a short haircut,

562
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:51,347
all the elders in the neighborhood...

563
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:55,557
would say you look like a cute chestnut...

564
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,856
and give you tons of compliments.

565
00:38:58,557 --> 00:38:59,727
You remember that, right?

566
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,227
Yes, I remember.

567
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:03,796
Your hair...

568
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:07,537
will grow.

569
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:10,267
It'll grow back really fast.

570
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,736
They also sell shampoos that help your hair grow faster.

571
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:15,435
Right.

572
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,307
Should I also get a haircut?

573
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:21,177
We can make Sun Kyung shave his head too.

574
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:26,815
Don't you remember he did that when he went to the army?

575
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:28,517
He was really ugly.

576
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,227
He looks decent thanks to his hair, so he can't shave his head.

577
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:36,096
Shaving my head is already enough. Let's not do it to anyone else.

578
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:37,126
Okay, Auntie?

579
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,267
Gosh, you charming girl. You're such a good girl.

580
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,807
I should go and buy you some hats.

581
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,835
I'll get you pretty ones.

582
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:53,576
Don't bother. I have a lot of hats.

583
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,246
You even bought me one last time.

584
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:57,016
Gosh, that's too big.

585
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:58,716
You have a tiny head.

586
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,157
Let me take a look.

587
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,720
It's about this big.

588
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:08,396
I'll be right back.

589
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:42,986
(Absolute rest)

590
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:55,097
How should I style your hair?

591
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,006
Well...

592
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:03,307
I want to look like a celebrity.

593
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:05,246
- Pardon? - Something that celebrities do.

594
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:09,016
I want a perm that looks really extravagant.

595
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:10,046
Just like that.

596
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:12,347
Miss.

597
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:15,216
That was done with a curling iron.

598
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:18,356
I want that hairstyle.

599
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:24,566
There. You're all done.

600
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:30,497
To be honest, I was a little worried because you came in a patient gown.

601
00:42:31,307 --> 00:42:33,807
We get a few patients from the hospital nearby,

602
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:35,606
and they come to shave their heads.

603
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,876
This hair looks great on you.

604
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,747
Can we take a photo and upload it on our website?

605
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:46,287
Your face won't show. It'll just be your hair.

606
00:42:46,747 --> 00:42:48,816
- Just your hair. - Okay.

607
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:52,026
The curls came out great.

608
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:00,366
- Are you done? - Wait. Just one more.

609
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:01,367
I'll take it from here.

610
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:04,707
It looks so pretty.

611
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:06,966
You're all done now.

612
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:08,836
Okay then.

613
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:11,247
You can shave my head now.

614
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:13,747
What?

615
00:43:16,447 --> 00:43:18,747
Just shave everything off my head.

616
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:24,356
I'm sorry. I know you put in a lot of effort to do this for me.

617
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:27,796
But I wanted to try it one last time.

618
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,566
It won't be your last time. You should come again.

619
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:33,496
I'll do this for you again.

620
00:43:33,497 --> 00:43:35,236
I'll make sure it comes out even better than today.

621
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:39,966
Actually, I bet you'll look good with short hair too.

622
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:43,505
Now that I think of it, it wasn't the hair that came out nice.

623
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:45,646
You're just pretty to begin with.

624
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,216
Will you be okay?

625
00:43:54,086 --> 00:43:55,086
Yes.

626
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:07,166
I'll cut it now.

627
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:10,936
Okay.

628
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,077
- Your nose is bleeding. - My goodness.

629
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:17,493
- Are you okay? - Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

630
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:18,633
- Get her a tissue. - I'm fine.

631
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:20,434
Just a second. Get her a tissue.

632
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:02,569
Don't cry.

633
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:08,748
Don't cry.

634
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,478
Don't cry.

635
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,728
Please don't cry.

636
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:31,695
I'm sorry.

637
00:47:33,765 --> 00:47:35,265
I'm so sorry.

638
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,195
What's going on?

639
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:16,535
Where am I?

640
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:18,364
My house.

641
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:20,365
Why am I in your house?

642
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,435
Was I kidnapped?

643
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:25,506
Something like that.

644
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:28,546
Since I dragged you into this dream without your consent.

645
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,746
Dream?

646
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:41,456
This is a dream?

647
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:47,365
What... Wow.

648
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,365
It feels so real.

649
00:49:50,936 --> 00:49:51,936
That's right.

650
00:50:00,305 --> 00:50:01,305
What?

651
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:14,055
(Les Miserables)

652
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,526
You're giving me a headache.

653
00:50:25,865 --> 00:50:27,106
Is this jail?

654
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:29,338
Did you lock me up?

655
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,405
Is that all you can say to the person who saved your life?

656
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:34,251
What?

657
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:36,376
You saved me?

658
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:38,546
Wasn't that a dream?

659
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,686
No, it wasn't.

660
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:45,356
Then that dream... No.

661
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,154
That was a dream. It was definitely a dream.

662
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:50,555
It was a dream. So why...

663
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:52,265
That dream?

664
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:56,095
You were crying in my dream earlier.

665
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:57,836
It was a dream.

666
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:00,805
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

667
00:51:01,365 --> 00:51:04,776
I died and you came to my funeral.

668
00:51:05,675 --> 00:51:09,476
You looked at my picture and cried...

669
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:24,425
I'm not sad.

670
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:31,765
I'm not sad no matter how much I look at you.

671
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,506
Hey. You startled me.

672
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:38,875
- Smile. - What?

673
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:40,505
Smile at me.

674
00:51:40,506 --> 00:51:41,574
Why should I?

675
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:43,776
I need to know who and what you are.

676
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,186
Will you know if I smile?

677
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,796
Smile again.

678
00:52:09,336 --> 00:52:10,376
I have no idea.

679
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,345
Where are you going?

680
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,275
Where are you going?

681
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:18,345
Outside.

682
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:21,086
We need to go somewhere open. It's too dangerous here.

683
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:24,825
Gosh. Why? Do you think I'll do something to you?

684
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:29,055
No. I'm afraid I'll do something to you.

685
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,895
Like what?

686
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:34,996
Who knows? Since I don't know who you are.

687
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:37,495
Run away if I do.

688
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:39,006
Run as hard as you can.

689
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:42,706
Are you sure it's safer outside?

690
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:48,646
There's nothing dangerous...

691
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:51,945
since nothing there is alive.

692
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:09,566
- What is this place? - My subconscious.

693
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:11,566
Subconscious?

694
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:13,606
It's like your ocean.

695
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:36,825
- That was why. - What?

696
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:39,195
You say this is like my ocean.

697
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:42,265
So this was how you felt.

698
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:46,006
That was why you were so prickly.

699
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:49,035
Don't talk gibberish. Just remember.

700
00:53:49,735 --> 00:53:51,844
Do you really not know me?

701
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,146
No, I don't.

702
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:55,944
Think before you speak.

703
00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:57,915
Why do I need to think about something like that?

704
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,086
I just know.

705
00:54:04,515 --> 00:54:06,885
I don't need to think to know that you're pretty.

706
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,066
Hey.

707
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:16,865
Have you been here before?

708
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,336
Obviously, not.

709
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:20,235
You should think before you talk.

710
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:23,336
Why? Do you remember seeing me here?

711
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:32,646
You really must have seen me before.

712
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:34,586
I have not.

713
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:37,686
- Then why... - I don't know.

714
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:42,896
Seriously. You need to learn how to speak again.

715
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:48,535
You need to make sense. Talk in longer sentences.

716
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,864
What's the use in reading books all the time?

717
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,405
Hey. Be honest with me.

718
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:56,376
You don't read, do you? You just hold them, don't you?

719
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:01,106
There's a line that the author wrote.

720
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:03,646
"Dying is nothing."

721
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,246
"What is frightening is not living to the fullest."

722
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,185
Are you saying that to me?

723
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,086
No. To myself.

724
00:55:13,086 --> 00:55:14,526
Because I'm nothing.

725
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:17,526
Because I'm not alive.

726
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:25,106
There's another famous quote by that author.

727
00:55:26,305 --> 00:55:29,106
"The reduction of the universe to one person,"

728
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:31,535
"and the expansion of one person to a deity."

729
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,675
"That is love."

730
00:55:37,945 --> 00:55:40,646
Remember beautiful things from now on.

731
00:55:41,215 --> 00:55:44,385
Then this place may become...

732
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,555
a little nicer.

733
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:34,235
Why...

734
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:38,135
What is this...

735
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,615
Will you choose to do that?

736
00:56:51,316 --> 00:56:52,726
There's not much time.

737
00:56:53,756 --> 00:56:55,226
You need to make a choice.

738
00:57:21,746 --> 00:57:22,916
I'll do it.

739
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:29,296
I'll do it.

740
00:57:53,546 --> 00:57:55,416
(Ask the world to end before dying.)

741
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,856
(Doom, person I love the most)

742
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:05,526
(Doom, person I love the most)

743
00:59:41,586 --> 00:59:43,226
Oh, no.

744
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:49,195
I must be going crazy.

745
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:52,066
I must be really sick.

746
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,575
(Ms. Soo Ja)

747
01:01:13,015 --> 01:01:15,455
- Auntie. - Where are you?

748
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:17,385
I left something at my house.

749
01:01:17,856 --> 01:01:18,925
I'll be there soon.

750
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:20,655
Okay.

751
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:36,035
(Human)

752
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,956
Hello?

753
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:32,865
You...

754
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,095
How could you...

755
01:02:39,106 --> 01:02:42,206
How could you forget about me?

756
01:02:42,706 --> 01:02:43,905
Right back at you.

757
01:02:44,476 --> 01:02:46,746
Even if I made that decision,

758
01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:48,845
you should have recognized me right away.

759
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:51,675
You should have remembered me.

760
01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:53,646
That's my fault?

761
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:55,956
Who told you to make that decision?

762
01:02:57,385 --> 01:03:00,554
You did whatever you wanted without talking to me.

763
01:03:00,555 --> 01:03:02,995
You know what? Even when you lost your memory,

764
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:04,856
your nasty temper didn't go away.

765
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:07,496
Did you find me handsome even when you lost your memory?

766
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:27,175
(Doom at Your Service)

767
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,208
We can't escape...

768
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:32,328
our fate, right?

769
01:04:34,646 --> 01:04:37,115
So we should accept it now.

770
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:39,756
Will it hurt a lot when I die?

771
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:44,226
You knew that I would be making this decision, right?

772
01:04:45,095 --> 01:04:48,695
I don't know what I will decide.

773
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,265
We should go.

774
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:53,035
Bye.

775
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:55,805
I didn't give up yet.

776
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:58,675
- Help us. - Accept it.

777
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:00,998
I love you.

778
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:03,615
Thank you for loving me.
