<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Episode 27</i>

4
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,000
♫ In my sadness, I hallucinate ♫

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,780
♫ Let it be, I'm once again
close to tears ♫

6
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,240
♫ An unfamiliar street,
a cruel heartbeat ♫

7
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,099
♫ Time stops, tears are meaningless
in this moment ♫

8
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,910
♫ All I want is a hug ♫

9
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,190
♫ Drunk on your lips ♫

10
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,300
♫ It's the trickery played by hormones ♫

11
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,130
His spine is a little crooked.

12
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,140
When he carried me down
the stairs yesterday,

13
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,570
I felt it.

14
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,650
To be frank,

15
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,880
after I turned 14,

16
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,250
I haven't seen much of him.

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,210
It's highly unlikely that I had caused

18
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,720
his back to be crooked.

19
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,130
In my memory,

20
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,650
I remember how he would carry me

21
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,830
me on his shoulders when I was a kid

22
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,940
and held me high up.

23
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,610
Now,

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,240
how did his spine become crooked?

25
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,060
Perhaps it's lack of calcium.

26
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,680
I know about those scientific

27
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,810
What I wish to say is,

28
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,729
just because this man

29
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,770
wears a police uniform,

30
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,500
I had believed that

31
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,290
he was invincible.

32
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,290
Who knew he'd get exhausted too?

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,370
Maybe other people don't see it.

34
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,080
He himself doesn't see it.

35
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,550
But I can.

36
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,160
His back is crooked.

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm heartbroken.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,030
Just like you said,

39
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,710
I still hate him.

40
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,070
Still, I wish I could do
something for him.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,050
But I'm just a lunatic.

42
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,800
You're not.

43
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,770
You know what I said to him yesterday?

44
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,419
I said,

45
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,160
"Stay away from me."

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,489
"I hate you."

47
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,290
If he doesn't wake up,

48
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:44,370
that would be the last thing

49
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,720
I ever said to him.

50
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,880
That would be

51
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,480
our farewell.

52
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,290
Perhaps this is a hint from God.

53
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,490
Only that

54
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,570
it was done in a more dangerous way.

55
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,210
Right.

56
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,430
A huge hint this is.

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,270
<i>Blood connection</i>

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,940
<i>is stronger than you think.</i>

59
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,680
<i>Xiao Xue.</i>

60
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,420
<i>Just because he doesn't
convey his emotions</i>

61
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,650
<i>wilfully like you</i>

62
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,410
<i>doesn't mean he doesn't care.</i>

63
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,690
Daddy, I feel sick.

64
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,510
I want to go home.

65
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:48,820
I'll take you home
once you finish the drip.

66
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,660
Be good.

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,860
Please.

68
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,660
I want to go home now.

69
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,090
Be good, Tian Tian.

70
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,530
I'll buy you delicious snacks
when you finish the drip,

71
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,650
okay?

72
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,030
You mean it, right?

73
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,010
Promise me you'll stay with me too.

74
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,340
You mustn't leave.

75
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,620
I promise you,

76
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,460
I'll stay by your side.

77
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,260
Okay.

78
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,650
Pinky promise.

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,010
Pinky promise binds you

80
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,860
to the word for 100 years.

81
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,770
If you break it, you'll become a dog.

82
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,490
Good girl.

83
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,470
Do you have pen and paper?

84
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,010
I'll get some.

85
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,420
What's this?

86
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,520
I modified it using
the unit's bulletproof vest.

87
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,950
I use it when I'm dressed
in civilian clothing.

88
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,730
I want you to have it.

89
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,420
What for?

90
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,280
To keep you safe.

91
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,340
I'm wearing a bra.

92
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,850
How am I supposed to wear this?

93
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,780
Maybe go back and try to...

94
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,790
Try to find a way.

95
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,460
Such a straight guy.

96
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,540
Put away the heart protector.

97
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,290
I don't want to catch sight of it.

98
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,770
Why?

99
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,190
It's ugly.

100
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,730
Isn't is obvious?

101
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,500
I don't want to see it.

102
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,610
Is it ugly?

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,420
You still donated blood
despite your injury?

104
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,250
Worry about yourself first, Dr Xia.

105
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,610
I'm doing good.

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,570
Good?

107
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,390
That parcel was sent to you.

108
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,660
If you got blown up by it,

109
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,890
would you still be good?

110
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,510
Were you worried about me?

111
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,820
Of course.

112
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,260
Who was the sender?

113
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,690
The police is still investigating.

114
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,950
My coffee.

115
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,830
Don't move.

116
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,930
Come here.

117
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,990
What are you doing?

118
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,170
What are you doing? Hey.

119
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,250
Sit down.

120
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,380
Relax.

121
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,340
Relax.

122
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,140
Relax.

123
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,000
Enjoy this moment.

124
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,730
How is it?

125
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,960
Left. The left side.

126
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,190
Yes, that's the spot.

127
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,360
Liang Mu Ze.

128
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,490
With your skills,

129
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,710
you'll be able to run a massage shop.

130
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,650
I'm sure you'll have returning customers.

131
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,370
This is my family's ancestral skill.

132
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,680
However,

133
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,500
this skill of ours

134
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,420
is reserved

135
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,130
for only one person this whole life.

136
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,060
Xia Chu.

137
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,690
Do think it over again.

138
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,530
Come to the unit.

139
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,130
Where?

140
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,800
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

141
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,050
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

142
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,790
♫ To relive the moment
my heart skipped a beat ♫

143
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,930
See?

144
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,410
We don't have answers to many questions.

145
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,770
But there's one answer

146
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,050
that I'm sure of.

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,380
What is it?

148
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,730
The moon tonight

149
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,280
is lovely.

150
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,060
Yes, it is.

151
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,340
Alright, Captain Liang.

152
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,020
Thank you.

153
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,610
I feel rejuvenated now.

154
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,290
I can return to my work.

155
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,190
Hope your hand recovers well.

156
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,190
Do you still remember the tips

157
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,880
I taught you about staying safe?

158
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,020
Don't travel alone.

159
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,210
Do not stay in the hotel alone.

160
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,220
Set the speed dial

161
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,500
to call the police.

162
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,480
Shut the doors and windows
when alone at home.

163
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,220
Do not put down the home address
for deliveries.

164
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,500
Take note of the location

165
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,690
of lifts, stairs and alarms.

166
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,700
Aside from that,

167
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,170
no matter how fast a lift goes,

168
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,020
a person running

169
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,220
can catch up to it

170
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,340
within three floors.

171
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,540
So during emergencies,

172
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,780
in order to ditch pursuers,

173
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,910
choose to go further than three floors.

174
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,940
Press more floors if needed

175
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,430
to confuse the pursuer.

176
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,380
Anything around me

177
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,940
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

178
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,380
If I really can't get away,

179
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,360
then go to somewhere with people
and call for help.

180
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,160
Captain Liang.

181
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,900
What you've told me,

182
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,080
I have them etched in my mind.

183
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,700
I won't forget it.

184
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,310
Not bad.

185
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm off.

186
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,670
Dr Zhang.

187
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,690
Doctor.

188
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,810
Why are you here?

189
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,470
This is Ke Wei's grandmother.

190
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,790
We just came from the
Public Security Bureau.

191
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
We were told Ke Wei was sent here.

192
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,590
How is he?

193
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,850
Doctor.

194
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,570
He's badly injured.

195
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,110
What's most life-threatening is that

196
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,910
the foreign object pierced
through the right atrium

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,190
penetrating the heart

198
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,510
and right chest,

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,970
straight up the right side of the neck.

200
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,440
In addition,

201
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,900
the cut in the right atrium

202
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,760
is very close to the coronary artery.

203
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,490
We haven't been able to determine

204
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,680
if the aorta is damaged.

205
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,860
We can only

206
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,740
find out during the operation.

207
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,410
Doctor, please, I'm begging you.

208
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,980
You have to save him.

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,260
He is

210
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,650
the only heir of the family.

211
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Madam.

212
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,370
Please calm down.

213
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,450
Tell me.

214
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,100
Does he have any criminal record

215
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,800
or history of mental illness?

216
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,490
No, none.

217
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,880
My grandson has always been good.

218
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,490
He's a good kid.

219
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Doctor,

220
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,210
this man is very important
in our following investigation.

221
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,900
Please do your best to save him.

222
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,900
Don't worry.

223
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,460
As a doctor,

224
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,620
we'll do everything in our power.

225
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,300
Thank you.

226
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,210
If there are no problems,

227
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,970
please sign this consent form.

228
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,130
I can't believe you agreed
to do the operation.

229
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,560
What to do.

230
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,760
Director Chen is overseas.

231
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,130
Dr Lu is sick.

232
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,660
I'm the only one with experience
treating foreign matter penetration.

233
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,930
Who else is going to do it?

234
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,560
He blew up several people today.

235
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,090
That's why we need to save him,

236
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,690
so that he can be interrogated.

237
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,350
Putting aside his injuries,

238
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,300
the incident today is a huge deal.

239
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,460
Have you considered the risks
of saving him?

240
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,890
The police will be monitoring.

241
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,290
Our media department will be
recording the whole process.

242
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,230
Besides,

243
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,130
if something did happen,

244
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,390
I could only blame it on bad luck.

245
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,730
You can just ignore it.

246
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,490
You should at least wait
for the results

247
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,680
to his infectious diseases check

248
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,110
before performing the operation.

249
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,580
There's no time.

250
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,570
He may die at any moment.

251
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,810
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

252
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,580
You're unbelievable.

253
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,060
You always think you're right.

254
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,980
Be it at work

255
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,370
or in relationships.

256
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,940
You and Chen Meng Zhen

257
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,480
are not compatible at all.

258
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,770
You and I are compatible.

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,650
We're both smart and cautious.

260
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,840
How did that end up?

261
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,570
Dr Zhang,

262
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,120
the patient's blood pressure is falling.

263
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,980
What's the situation?

264
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,290
He's spazzing non-stop.

265
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,140
Begin anaesthesia.

266
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,110
Okay.

267
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,140
Ke Wei,

268
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,090
it doesn't matter what happened before.

269
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,020
Right now, you're my patient.

270
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,710
I'm trying to save you.

271
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,030
I hope to get your cooperation.

272
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,380
At least, let your family

273
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,810
see you again, all right?

274
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,870
Ready to open the chest.

275
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,650
<i>Steady.</i>

276
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,220
<i>Let's finish it in one go.</i>

277
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,390
<i>Ready.</i>

278
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,940
<i>One, two.</i>

279
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,960
Apply pressure.

280
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,170
Use the hemostatic forceps.

281
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,440
Over here.

282
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,810
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

283
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,470
It's okay.

284
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,690
Stop the bleeding with gauze.

285
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,350
I'm going to change my gloves.

286
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
Okay.

287
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,960
The blood pressure continues to drop.

288
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,670
The pulmonary artery is badly damaged.

289
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,010
Quick, hasten the blood transfusion.

290
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,290
Increase noradrenaline. Quickly!

291
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,450
Move it!

292
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,970
<i>In operation</i>

293
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,600
Doctor...

294
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,340
How is my grandson?

295
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,280
Say... Say something.

296
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,690
Say something.

297
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,170
It will be okay.

299
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,840
My grandson.

300
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,660
Mi Gu.

301
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,320
Xia Chu.

302
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,660
I've been looking for you.

303
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,010
Wait for me at the ER night shift room.

304
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,640
I'll be right there.

305
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,510
This sentence

306
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,010
lacks punch.

307
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,320
But I can't come up

308
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,750
with a better expression.

309
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,810
Highlight it.

310
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,580
We'll go over it again during editing.

311
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,210
Okay.

312
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,290
This is everything.

313
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,450
I'll take a copy with me.

314
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,770
Xiao Xiao.

315
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,520
Have you ever thought about

316
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,200
changing your job?

317
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,890
Why do you ask?

318
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,810
Just curious.

319
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,940
Say for instance

320
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,280
you're dating a very busy man

321
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,790
who is abroad.

322
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,460
You two love each other.

323
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,240
Are you willing to change your job

324
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,290
for the sake of your future

325
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,830
and move to be with him?

326
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,150
Why am I the one to switch jobs?

327
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,380
Why can't he?

328
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,520
His profession is a little special.

329
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,540
It's not up to him

330
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,250
to decide whether he can leave.

331
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,290
You're talking about Liang Mu Ze, right?

332
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,590
It doesn't matter who it is.

333
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,230
I just want to know,

334
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,660
if you were in their shoes...

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,630
I won't.

336
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,630
You're so sure?

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,850
Do you know

338
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,980
what the words I heard the most

339
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,170
since young are?

340
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,860
In primary school,

341
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,510
I got first place.

342
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,680
The elders and teachers would say,

343
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,900
"A girl"

344
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,440
"only performs well in primary school."

345
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,680
When I was in middle school,
I got first again.

346
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,680
Once again, the elders and teachers said,

347
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,590
"The boys haven't shown
their true power."

348
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,720
I got into the Science Experimental Class
in high school.

349
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,940
The Math teacher's favourite phrase was,

350
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,590
"I don't expect anything much
from girls on this question."

351
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,030
"But if the boys got this wrong,"

352
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,470
"they will be caned."

353
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,560
It didn't matter I could answer all of it.

354
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,090
When I got into
the Military Medical University,

355
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,840
at the start of my internship,

356
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,410
my supervisor would say,

357
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,470
"Females are strong in theory."

358
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,640
"But when it comes to actual practice,"

359
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,110
"men are still better."

360
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,890
In today's medical environment,

361
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,090
doctors are not allowed to make mistakes.

362
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,150
Especially female doctors.

363
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,030
One mistake

364
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,610
and that might destroy any hope
of holding a surgery knife.

365
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,780
So,

366
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,290
I've endured 27 years

367
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,670
of hardship.

368
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,650
There's no way I could give up
my career

369
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,370
over a man.

370
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,040
However,

371
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,820
I've given it serious thought.

372
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,750
To be like Professor Lin Qiao Zhi,

373
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,340
remain single my whole life.

374
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,210
I'll only live for myself.

375
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,830
A lifetime is long, Xiao Xiao.

376
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,620
Don't you find

377
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,740
such nonchalance boring?

378
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,910
But it's the kind of boredom I chose.

379
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,090
Done.

380
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,610
I've seen the proposal.

381
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,620
I think

382
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,770
the topic is still somewhat vague.

383
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,730
Let's work on it some more.

384
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,170
Also,

385
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,330
confirm next week's guest
soonest possible.

386
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,670
The styling?

387
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,240
We'll decide when I get back.

388
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,040
Bye-bye.

389
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,030
Done with work?

390
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,840
Where is the granny?

391
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,040
The village chief is waiting
in the car with her.

392
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,310
Why did you want to see me?

393
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,380
She's Ke Wei's grandmother.

394
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,050
Who?

395
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,100
Ke Wei.

396
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,140
The delivery guy who sent you the parcel.

397
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,090
How did you know them?

398
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,400
I met them while working on

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,540
the 'left-behind children' project.

400
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,070
We've kept in touch.

401
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,090
So,

402
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,600
do you know him well?

403
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,300
Was he like this before?

404
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,550
Did he have aggressive tendencies?

405
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,780
The young man seemed honest.

406
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,800
Aside from being a little quiet,

407
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,780
I didn't find anything wrong
with his personality.

408
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,560
Then why would he...

409
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,090
I'm not sure.

410
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,520
Maybe

411
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,270
it has something

412
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,820
to do with the things he'd
been reading on the Internet.

413
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,560
What's that?

414
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,570
I found this photo

415
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,320
on his computer.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,900
Why would he have a photo like that?

417
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,130
Did you report it?

418
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,870
Because I called the police,

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,290
that's how I found out
what happened

420
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,610
and hurried here.

421
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,050
His grandma is devastated.

422
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,500
She's lived her whole life
in the countryside,

423
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,460
a good, honest life.

424
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,110
Now, suddenly

425
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,330
She's dumb-struck.

426
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,400
She kept asking

427
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,270
if she could visit the officer
who was injured.

428
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,210
I understand.

429
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,120
At this point in time,

430
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
an apology is meaningless.

431
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,310
But it is the grandma's
sincere wish after all.

432
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,110
Could you

433
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,570
pull some strings?

434
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,540
How about this?

435
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,420
When the patient has stabilized

436
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,590
and the family has calmed down,
we'll discuss it.

437
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,850
There's one more thing.

438
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,600
What is it?

439
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,070
Zhuo Ran and I are together.

440
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,910
Does that upset you?

441
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,260
No.

442
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,380
But I want to tell you this.

443
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,810
Treat him like a stranger

444
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,250
and get to know him once more.

445
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,810
Keep yourself safe.

446
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,720
Don't fall too hard, too quickly.

447
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,950
Also,

448
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,390
between you and him,

449
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,940
I'm forever your friend.

450
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,170
Let's have dinner tomorrow night.

451
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,260
I have a lot I want to tell you.

452
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,730
Sure.

453
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,420
<i>On the 25th of December, 2009,</i>

454
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,690

455
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,070

459

I can't have dinner with you tonight.

460
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,100
An injured that was sent in

461
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,020
is not doing well.

462
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,210
I need to check on him.

463
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,760
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

464
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,440
Can you sign for Bed 14's patient?

465
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,600
Okay.

466
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,120
What is it?

467
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,120
Thanks, Dr Xia.

468
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,050
<i>What did Zhuo Ran's
parents do in the past?</i>

469
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,690
I only know that

470
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,530
his mother's health is not good.

471
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,300
As for his father,

472
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,580
I don't think he ever spoke about him.

473
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,450
<i>Why did you suddenly ask?</i>

474
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,680
I'm currently

475
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,750
sorting out tapes in the resource room.

476
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,470
I came across this drug dealer's son.

477
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,370
He looked so much like Zhuo Ran.

478
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,900
Dr Xia.

479
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,120
I'll talk to you later. I have to go.

480
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,770
Dr Xia!

481
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,870
Dr Xia.

482
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,970
I'm Li Lei's wife.

483
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,010
Could you please play this for him?

484
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,960
I'm sure he'd wake up after hearing this.

485
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,540
Please help.

486
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,830
The patient's condition is serious.

487
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,030
We need six pints of blood.

488
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,410
Please hurry up.

489
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,390
The patient just became a parent.

490
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,590
Okay, thanks.

491
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,190
Is the condition very bad?

492
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,500
Severe septic shock.

493
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,900
The coagulation index is a mess.

494
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,050
The drugs have failed to stabilize
his brood pressure.

495
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,140
Administer more drugs.

496
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,620
Transfuse the blood once it arrives.

497
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,650
Got it.

498
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,650
Hang in there.

499
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,650
Bear it with a bit more.

500
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,850
Once this is over,

501
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,330
you'll be able to see your family.

502
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,750
Hi, can you please hasten
the delivery of plasma?

503
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,290
The patient in ER needs it urgently.

504
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,450
Thank you.

505
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,660
<i>Emergency Department</i>

506
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,210
The blood pressure is stabilizing.

507
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,500
So,

508
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,330
did he say anything in the end?

509
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,690
He was put under general anaesthesia.

510
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,740
He was unconscious.

511
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,500
How about before that?

512
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,510
During your attempt to save him,

513
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,300
had he mentioned any names?

514
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,260
He had been in shock.

515
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,880
When he was on the operation table,

516
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,120
he started having spasms.

517
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,140
Okay, that will do for now.

518
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,410
Thanks for your help, Dr Zhang.

519
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,480
Don't mention it.

520
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,380
Thanks.

521
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,350
Thank you.

522
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,180
The heartbeat is abnormal.

523
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,210
Ready the defibrillator.

524
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,140
200 joules. Get ready.

525
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
I'm sorry.

526

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,900
I'm off work.

529
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,650
What about going for a movie?

530
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,330
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

531
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,570
<i>I'm not free.</i>

532
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,540
Wait.

533
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,440
About what happened,

534
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,200
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

535
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,160
I'd like to explain to you in person.

536
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
<i>I can't right now.</i>

537
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,830
<i>I have customers at the shop.</i>

538
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,110
I can go and help.

539
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,270
<i>It's okay.</i>

540
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,580
<i>Talk again next time.</i>

541
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,130
Have tea, aunty.

542
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,760
Thank you.

543
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,830
You're welcome.

544
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,650
Just now,

545
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,530
I took a look around your shop.

546
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,310
The furnishings

547
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,100
aren't what I expected.

548
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,190
It's quite Westernised.

549
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,730
Thanks.

550
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,820
Independent book stores like this

551
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,500
are commonly found elsewhere too.

552
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,930
If you're free,

553
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,190
you should check them out.

554
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,950
Most people buy books online now.

555
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,650
Hardly anyone visits book stores.

556
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,600
Buying books online
is a form of consumerism.

557
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,630
Visiting book stores is a lifestyle.

558
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,650
Each has pros and cons.

559
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,840
They do not overlap.

560
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,720
Does Yi Chi

561
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,710
know I came to see you?

562
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,800
Thank you.

563
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,140
My visit today

564
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,660
is a little sudden.

565
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,030
Since I met you the other day,

566
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,890
I haven't been able

567
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,600
to sleep the past days.

568
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,170
Yi Chi's dad told me

569
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,760
to be more open-minded

570
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,170
about you and him.

571
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,500
Honestly,

572
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,460
I am unable to do so.

573
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,170
I know my son well.

574
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,930
These past years,

575
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,240
he's had a few girlfriends.

576
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,190
They didn't last long.

577
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,380
As for the ones he brought home,

578
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,340
it was only perfunctory.

579
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,990
But, there's a good saying.

580
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,590
Dating and marriage

581
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,050
are two different things.

582
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:34,950
If you two

583
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,470
were still youngsters in your 20s,

584
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,320
dating and spending a few years together

585
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,680
wouldn't have required me to butt in.

586
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,570
But the fact is,

587
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,700
both of you are no longer young.

588
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,720
Especially you.

589
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,440
Chen.

590
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,099
It is not easy for you

591
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,530
to raise a child alone.

592
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,309
Compared to

593
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,590
a romantic

594
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,460
but improbable relationship,

595
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,690
I think

596
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,620
a stable marriage

597
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,190
is what you need.

598
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,690
Clearly,

599
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,350
my son

600
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,340
isn't the suitable marriage candidate
for you.

601
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,040
I worry that he's wasting your time.

602
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,730
What do you think, Chen?

603
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,650
Chen?

604
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,780
Aunty.

605
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,260
Don't be anxious.

606
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,190
Before he can waste my time,

607
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,810
I first have to allow him to.

608
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,880
I never said I'd let him.

609
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,330
So there's no reason

610
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,890
to say he's wasting anyone's time.

611
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,090
Miss Zhen, we're here.

612
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,840
Give me a minute.

613
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,850
We'll wait for you inside then. Be quick.

614
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,960
Okay.

615
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,640
Sorry, aunty.

616
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,180
I have an appointment with clients.

617
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,840
I have to go now.

618
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,150
See you.

619
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,210
From the CT scan,

620
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,020
the foreign object is still some ways

621
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,610
away from the aorta.

622
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,050
As such,

623
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,530
the fact that a huge tear occurred

624
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,640
shows that

625
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,410
the patient's spasms
on the operating table...

626
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,830
Excuse me.

627
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,650
<i>Xiao Wen of Diagnostic Lab</i>

628
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,980
Where was I?

629
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,940
Spasms.

630
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,010
Spasms.

631
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,110
So,

632
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,030
in future,

633
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,470
when we administer anaesthesia,

634
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,830
we have to be mindful

635
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,830
of the right timing.

636
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,590
Understood?

637
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,410
Stop staring and jot it down.

638
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,690
Steady does it.

639
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,180
Let's finish it in one go.

640
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,980
Here.

641
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,210
Over here.

642
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,430
Sorry, sir.

643
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,220
It's fine.

644
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,490
<i>Stop the bleeding with gauze.</i>

645
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Hello, Xiao Xiao.

646
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,480
<i>Dr Zhang, you haven't left I hope.</i>

647
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,450
Not yet.

648
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,720
What's the matter?

649
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,460
<i>The lab just called to say</i>

650
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,530
<i>that the perpetrator for the explosion
who just tied, Ke Wei,</i>

651
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,180
<i>showed three positives for
the Hepatitis B marker.</i>

652
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,150
<i>All medical personnel who took part
in the operation</i>

653
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,160
<i>Treatment Room</i>

654
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,450
<i>need to get Hepatitis B
immunoglobulin injection</i>

655
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,650
Dr Zhang, you're actually scared of pain?

656
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,290
I haven't had an injection in years.

657
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,530
By the way,

658
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,490
What is the window period?

659
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,500
One month.

660
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,580
Alright then.

661
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,050
After one month,

662
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,880
I'll do a blood test.

663
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,670
Make sure you rest more
during this period.

664
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,840
-Okay.
-Don't stretch yourself thin.

665
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,900
Thanks.

666
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,370
Dr Zhang.

667
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,500
Thanks.

668
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,900
Please don't, Dr Zhang.

669
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,570
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,710
I kept trying to call you just now.

672
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,000
But you didn't answer.

673
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,950
I thought something had happened to you.

674
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,770
No such thing.

675
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,700
I don't have my phone on me, is all.

676
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,460
Right now, in my life,

677
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,610
aside from Xiao Jun,

678
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,760
there's nothing else
that is worth mentioning.

679
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,990
What about me?

680
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,840
You...

681
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,400
were never a part of my life.

682
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,310
Chen Meng Zhen!

683
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,150
Didn't you tell me

684
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,610
to think our relationship through?

685
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,600
That is why I'm here today.

686
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,720
I've thought about it long ago.

687
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,730
You are Xiao Jun's mother.

688
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,330
In your heart,

689
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,010
no one can replace him.

690
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,450
When my father asked me

691
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,170
if I was ready

692
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,490
to accept him,

693
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,370
the reason I did not answer

694
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,970
wasn't because I was unsure,

695
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,040
but because to me,

696
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,040
this wasn't something
I had to think about at all.

697
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,450
I even thought that

698
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,470
we won't have
our own children in the future.

699
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,510
He alone is enough.

700
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,680
That's what I thought.

701
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,450
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell them.

702
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,300
In that situation,

703
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,010
I wouldn't want to tell you either.

704
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,360
I thought maybe I was being hasty.

705
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,880
That you wouldn't believe me.

706
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,250
Why me?

707
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,530
Maybe it's fate.

708
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,550
The whys don't matter.

709
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,900
I just know we get along.

710
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,610
From the moment I met you.

711
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,520
Get along?

712
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,780
So my credentials don't matter.

713
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,040
Even if I'm not the best,

714
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,010
right?

715
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,770
Right.

716
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,880
But it matters to me.

717
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,940
The man I want to marry

718
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,810
has to see me as the best.

719
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,130
My family and career,

720
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,990
everything I've gone through

721
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,740
has created the best version of me today.

722
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,270
He would marry me

723
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,980
because he knows he's making
the best choice,

724
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,130
not because he's making a huge sacrifice.

725
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,570
I care about that.

726
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,220
I don't see the difference!

727
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,010
It's just semantics!

728
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,570
There is,

729
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,660
Dr Zhang.

730
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,250
Maybe you're used to having
everything go your way.

731
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,540
You've never seen

732
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,450
the other road that is full of potholes

733
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,070
and covered in mud.

734
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,260
Sacrifice is a momentary satisfaction.

735
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,780
It has to be sincere acceptance

736
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,650
for two to

737
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,720
This is what my late husband said

738
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,360
when he proposed to me.

739
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,130
I still remember now that he's gone.

740
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,200
He wasn't as polished as you.

741
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,090
He was a brute military man.

742
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,470
I was his biggest pride.

743
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,980
Am I yours?

744
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,180
We are from two different worlds.

745
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,770
The closer we get,

746
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,480
the harder it becomes.

747
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,650
<i>Do you know why we asked you to come?</i>

748
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,450
There was an explosion

749
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,740
at the neighbourhood Xia Chu lives.

750
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,360
<i>Who did it?</i>

751
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,750
<i>According to the news,</i>

752
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,180
it was a delivery guy.

753
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,560
We have tested

754
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,980
the traces of the explosive

755
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,850
found at the scene.

756
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,770
The deliveryman had used
a very professional variety

757
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,430
of the C-4 bomb.

758
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,540
Previously,

759
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,940
the composition bomb that was used

760
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,220
in the Isaia incident

761
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,260
was very similar

762
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,570
the the one used this time.

763
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,880
Should I say this is T4's

764
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,180
signature?

765
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,300
When Old Master's goods

766
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,330
were confiscated at the border,

767
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,880
he mentioned this to me.

768
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,760
That he'd get revenge
in Ningjiang.

769
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,390
Why didn't you say anything?

770
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,510
I thought he wouldn't dare.

771
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,420
You thought?

772
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,620
Because of your assumption,

773
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,680
Officer Rao and Officer Li

774
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:18,900
are hospitalized.

775
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,720
My mother is in his hands.

776
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,480
Her life is at stake.

777
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,640
How

778
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,450
did he get in touch with the deliveryman?

779
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,340
City of Desire.

780
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,610
Scary Pirate.

781
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,610
Scary Pirate?

782
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,370
That's Old Master?

783
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,130
Scary Pirate is just an ID.

784
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,390
Is it not?

785
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,090
If Old Master wants it,

786
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,600
anyone

787
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,660
can be the person using the ID.

788
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,400
Ask him what Old Master's goal is.

789
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,780
Why did Old Master

790
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,690
do this?

791
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,080
Maybe it's for revenge.

792
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,990
Listen carefully.

793
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,550
If you wish to save your mother,

794
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,130
you better buckle up.

795
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,290
We expect your full cooperation
in the investigation

796
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,330
and subsequent operation.

797
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,240
Thank you for watching my stream.

798
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,440
If you enjoyed it,

799
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,760
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.,

800
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,990
I'll be here waiting for you all
at Room 2924.

801
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,550
Love you!

802
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,430
<i>Zhuo Ran</i>

803
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,990
Hello.

804
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,500
<i>Nice song.</i>

805
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,690
<i>2924.</i>

806
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,300
<i>You watched my live stream?</i>

807
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,330
It was more interesting than I thought.

808
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,780
Thanks for the compliment.

809
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,710
You have no idea

810
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,250
the amount of preparation I have to do

811
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,970
for the 2-hour stream every night.

812
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,410
<i>What about your work?</i>

813
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,970
I still do it. This is extra income.

814
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,480
It doesn't affect my main job.

815
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,730
<i>Later, I still have
to update my website.</i>

816
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,070
So hardworking.

817
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,410
Aren't you tired?

818
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,410
I am.

819
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,650
How could I not be tired?

820
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,740
But no matter how tired,

821
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,480
I just have to sit by the full-height
window of my house

822
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,940
and I'll feel like my energy

823
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,710
has been

824
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,600
recharged.

825
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,380
<i>Zhuo Ran.</i>

826
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,590
<i>Back then,</i>

827
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,470
<i>why did you leave
without saying goodbye?</i>

828
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,680
Did Xia Chu ask you to ask me?

829
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,650
No.

830
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,690
I'm the one who wants to know.

831
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,100
<i>Is it because of your father?</i>

832
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,780
Why did you suddenly bring him up?

833
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:39,804
