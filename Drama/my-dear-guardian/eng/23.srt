My Dear Guardian

3
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,520
Episode 23

4
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,400
Where were you?

5
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,150
Dong'an.

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,320
Liang Mu Ze found the tapping device.

7
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,780
Okay.

8
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,100
"Okay"?

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,990
We need to retreat right away.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,670
If we go back empty-handed,

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,340
do you have a good explanation
for Old Master?

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,630
Old Master.

13
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
Old Master.

14
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,260
The money Gui accepted for the goods,

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,630
I've received it.

16
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,780
The transaction went smoothly?

17
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,670
Yes.

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,420
Any progress with Xia Guang Yuan?

19
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
His assistant, Tang Lin,

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,860
has accepted the 100,000 I offered.

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,890
She also agreed

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,780
to provide us with more research data.

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,920
Good.

24
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,960
Make full use of this opportunity.

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,080
On a side note,

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,820
in a few days,

27
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm going to release more goods.

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,990
For this batch,

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,540
you'll still be in charge
of the transaction,

30
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,300
from start to end.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,110
Old Master.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,150
Any problem?

33
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,350
Old Master,

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,820
didn't you say that

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,229
once you get the formula for the sedative,

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,390
you'll be able to come back

37
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,760
with Xia Guang Yuan in tow?

38
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,150
There have been some changes.

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
The Chinese market had previously been

40
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,220
under the control of Sang Kun and Gui.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,950
Now, we finally found a way in.

42
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,860
I want you guys to expand
on the network there,

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,150
find new business channels.

44
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,190
Particularly the youth in China.

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,020
Knowing what they like
and their preferences

46
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,860
is key to securing future markets.

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,070
This is T4's real opportunity.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,600
Understood, Old Master.

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,900
And you, Zhuo Ran?

50
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,490
Understood.

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,229
But as for my mother's transplant...

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,900
Zhuo Ran.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,120
Zhuo Ran.

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,510
Old Master has never intended
to treat your mother.

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,900
He's only using her to control you.

56
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,540
Old Master isn't going to save my mother.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,640
Is he?

58
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,820
When will we ever be able
to obtain all the data?

59
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,620
The police would've probably
found us by then.

60
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,240
Not probably,

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,940
but definitely.

62
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,280
Since the medical forum,

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,470
they've already been keeping an eye on us.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
So what now?

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
What do you think?

66
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,230
I think

67
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,020
we should just take the man away.

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,720
If we can't have Xia Guang Yuan,

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,210
at least we can get the daughter.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,110
You're right.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,310
Doing things step by step like this
is too slow.

72
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,810
Some things

73
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,330
need to be wrapped up.

74
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,500
I'll leave Xia Chu to you.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,260
I'll sort out

76
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,660
the production.

77
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,120
In two days,

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,870
we'll meet at the same place.

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,430
Commander Dong,

80
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,970
Based on the comprehensive clues
we've gathered,

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,550
the prime suspect

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,030
should be Xia Chu's first boyfriend,

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,100
Zhuo Ran.

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
That man

85
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,790
has had numerous altercations with Mu Ze.

86
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,059
It looks like

87
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,020
he still hasn't gotten over Xia Chu.

88
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:56,320
So you think he has a clear motive?

89
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,300
That's right.

90
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,830
I've sent men

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,090
to conduct surveillance on him.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,150
If this case

93
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,670
is indeed related to him,

94
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,500
he should've known

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,020
that the tapping device was discovered.

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,100
We're expecting him to take action.

97
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,390
Long Yi

98
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,500
I've arrived at her neighbourhood.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,220
We'll act in one hour.

100
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,780
What's happening, Lei?

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,070
You may go in, mister.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,160
Call the captain.

103
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,120
Okay.

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,460
I got the picture now.

105
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,250
What do you want our unit to do?

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,980
The two people living at Mu Ze's house

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,060
are the witness of the case, Xia Chu,

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,440
and

109
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,910
Mu Ze's cousin, Liang Shao Xue.

110
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,880
I propose that before things
are sorted out,

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,790
they be moved

112
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,100
to somewhere more secure.

113
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,130
No problem.

114
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,160
The Special Forces Brigade

115
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,140
can provide shelter and security.

116
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,910
Mu Ze.

117
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,510
Any other concerns?

118
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,060
-Let me take this call.
-Okay.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,740
Where?

120
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,530
Okay.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,140
Got it. I'll be right there.

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,059
Zhuo Ran turned himself in.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,580
Yes.

124
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,260
I installed the tapping device.

125
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,830
Why did you do it?

126
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,180
Because I wish to get Xia Chu back.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
I wanted to know

128
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,670
what she's doing at home

129
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,270
every moment of the day.

130
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,870
I want to know everything about her.

131
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,070
To make up for the eight years

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,380
that I wasn't with her.

133
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,170
Do you know who that house belongs to?

134
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,630
I didn't know at first.

135
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,070
The day I installed the device,

136
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,140
I almost ran into him.

137
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,830
Meaning to say,

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,829
through the tapping device,

139
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,980
you learned that Xia Chu wanted
to give Liang Mu Ze tranquillisers.

140
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,350
So you purposely switched it.

141
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,020
Right?

142
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,510
Yes, it was overheard on the device.

143
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,740
But I wasn't the one who heard it.

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,940
It was Long Yi.

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,180
He's my assistant.

146
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,240
He was the one who switched the pills.

147
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,750
Why would he do that?

148
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,520
Because Old Master told him to.

149
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,750
"Old Master"?

150
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,530
He's the founder of T4.

151
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,910
The terrorist attack

152
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,430
that happened at the medical
headquarters in Isaia,

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,070
that was T4's doing?

154
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,780
Back then,

155
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,280
he smuggled into Willick from China.

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,340
Under the code name T4,

157
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,090
he set up his own army of mercenaries.

158
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,080
On the surface, he operated
under the pretence of trade investment,

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,660
but in actual fact,

160
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,760
the things he did were illegal.

161
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,730
What is his real name?

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,930
I don't know.

163
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,850
From the first time I met him,

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,180
I've been calling him Old Master.

165
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,040
As for his history in China,

166
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,910
I do not know either.

167
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,410
How did you two meet?

168
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,720
In my final year of high school,

169
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,650
a distant relative

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,020
had arranged for my mother
to be treated in Willick.

171
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,870
We ended up at an illegal factory.

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,940
There,

173
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,640
we endured a very dark time.

174
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,790
We finally managed to escape.

175
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,270
But we ended up almost starving
to death on the streets.

176
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,520
It was Old Master that saved us.

177
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,320
He gave us a place to feel safe.

178
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,120
He even paid for my education.

179
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,610
So in the beginning,

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,420
I was very grateful towards him.

181
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,380
You could say

182
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,950
I relied on him.

183
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,630
Until...

184
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,980
Until what?

185
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,150
Until I graduated university,

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,030
he started to let me

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,230
take over some accounts of the company.

188
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,900
That's when I realised

189
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,570
the ugly truth behind
his so-called company.

190
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,980
I didn't want to help him.

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,040
I tried to make him stop.

192
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,350
But why would he listen to me?

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,620
If you are against his ways,

194
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,260
why do you still work for him?

195
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,900
He has my mother.

196
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,780
I have no choice.

197
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,080
He's been trying to groom me

198
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,460
as his right-hand man.

199
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,680
I've done all I could

200
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,430
to not get involved in matters
outside of the finances.

201
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,410
But knowing that
my mother's safety is at risk,

202
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,540
I'm not sure how much more I can take.

203
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,470
So you came to Ningjiang

204
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,620
because Old Master told you to?

205
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

206
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,710
He wants me to find Sang Kun's
younger brother, Gui.

207
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,700
Then he sent his underling, Long Yi,

208
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,750
to become my assistant

209
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,880
in order to monitor me.

210
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,480
So have you found Gui?

211
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,950
We have.

212
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,130
But I only found out later

213
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,640
that Long Yi had killed Gui

214
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,380
behind my back.

215
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,780
And on the day itself,

216
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,060
he almost went head to head
with you people.

217
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,940
He downloaded a program online

218
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,220
and printed a 3D gun.

219
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,150
And then,

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,860
he sneaked Gui out of the hospital,

221
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,050
shot him

222
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,280
and set up the crime scene.

223
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,260
What about you?

224
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,220
What was your role

225
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,550
in all of this?

226
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm a victim.

227
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,550
I'm bearing the risks of being found out

228
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,730
and losing my mother

229
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,340
by coming here to tell you guys this.

230
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,030
You have to ensure my safety.

231
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,500
I no longer want to live like a dog.

232
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,070
This isn't the kind of life I want.

233
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,540
I've had enough.

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,440
Even in my dreams, I tried
to escape from the shackles he put on me,

235
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,700
but I couldn't.

236
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,560
Everything I do

237
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,860
gets reported to Old Master.

238
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,540
My mother's life may be in danger.

239
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,910
And Xia Chu.

240
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,790
What about Xia Chu?

241
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,150
He knows

242
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,990
how much Xia Chu means to me.

243
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Just like how he's using
my mother to control me,

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,500
he wants to do the same with Xia Chu.

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,150
Use her to force me

246
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,060
to establish drug trafficking
channels in China,

247
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,710
to be his accomplice in crime.

248
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,990
I can only try my best

249
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,430
to buy time.

250
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,900
But with me...

251
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,200
By myself,

252
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,230
there's no way for me to stop him.

253
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,110
For the sake of the two most
important women in my life,

254
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm begging you.

255
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm willing to cooperate with the police

256
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,110
to bring Old Master to justice.

257
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,900
Officer Rao.

258
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,780
I know you must be dubious

259
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,900
about what I just said.

260
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,810
It's fine.

261
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,560
You can verify it later.

262
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,900
But right now,

263
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,330
you need to send men
to Liang Mu Ze's house.

264
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,390
Because Old Master has given the order

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,430
for Long Yi to take care of Xia Chu.

266
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,420
Is there no electricity?

267
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,880
I don't know. I was watching a drama

268
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,190
and the Internet suddenly stopped.

269
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,730
Hello.

270
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,960
Hi, Ms Xia.

271
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,680
Please come to the building
management office.

272
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,420
What's the matter?

273
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,450
There's a problem
with your house's electricity meter.

274
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,450
We need to check with you

275
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,840
before we can fix the problem.

276
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,270
What's the problem?

277
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,660
What's up?

278
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,840
Something is wrong with
the electricity meter.

279
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,160
No wonder the hair dryer
suddenly stopped working.

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm going to the management office.

281
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,350
Stay here and be good.

282
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
Alright.

283
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,110
"Ms Xia"?

284
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,130
Liang Mu Ze!

285
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,220
No matter how fast the lift is,

286
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,400
within three storeys,

287
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,310
a human running can easily
catch up to it.

288
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,240
So if there's an emergency

289
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,750
and you have to take the lift,

290
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,360
make sure it goes
more than three storeys.

291
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,590
If needed,

292
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
press a few more floors
to confuse the pursuer.

293
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,430
Anything you find around you

294
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,490
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

295
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
If you can't get away,

296
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,140
try your best to go somewhere
with people

297
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,600
and call for help.

298
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,880
Fire! Fire!

299
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,030
Evacuate!

300
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,820
-Fire!
-Forget about the things!

301
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,540
Are you okay?

302
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,550
Someone's after me.

303
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,650
I didn't see his face.

304
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,239
He addressed me as Ms Xia on the phone.

305
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,840
But I never registered with
the building management.

306
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,630
So I'm pretty sure he came for me.

307
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,300
I was reaching the basement.

308
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,870
I turned and ran just like you taught me.

309
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,140
I pressed several floors in the lift.

310
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,640
I got off halfway

311
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,710
because I thought someone
might be waiting there.

312
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,390
You did good.

313
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,240
It's okay now.

314
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm here.

315
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,700
When the incident occurred,

316
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,460
it happened to be the change of shifts.

317
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,650
There was no one
in the night shift office.

318
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,890
Rao Zhi.

319
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,250
Anything?

320
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,740
Li Lei and the rest are
at the basement car park.

321
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,180
The management staff and I

322
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,820
have checked the floors of the building.

323
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,200
We didn't find anyone suspicious.

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,110
The culprit probably sneaked out

325
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,810
in the minutes following the alarm.

326
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,090
We'd like to check the CCTVs.

327
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,400
Sure, come with me.

328
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,630
Alright, guys. Follow me.

329
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
Okay, pay attention.

330
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,140
Thank you, everyone.

331
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,640
Please wait here for a bit.

332
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,290
Go with him.

333
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,260
Okay.

334
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,400
We're sorting it out.

335
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,230
Please remain calm.

336
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,200
Xue.

337
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,180
Do you have time?

338
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,950
I'd like to talk to you.

339
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,230
Thank you for your cooperation.
Please wait here.

340
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,070
Yes, I'm at home.

341
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,040
Okay, got it.

342
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,180
Okay.

343
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,740
Xue is with her dad.

344
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,790
That's good.

345
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,600
Did the police catch the culprit?

346
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,330
Who is he?

347
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,680
Why did he come after me?

348
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,780
Don't ask.

349
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,660
Is that confidential?

350
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,810
Yes.

351
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,260
Alright.

352
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,480
Xia Chu.

353
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,500
I have to return to the unit
before lights-out.

354
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,360
Your break is over?

355
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,150
Come along with me.

356
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,380
I don't mean anything else.

357
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,420
It's much safer at the unit.

358
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,080
It will be the same as last time.

359
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,390
You'll stay at the guest lodging.

360
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,500
I'll be at the barracks.

361
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,470
Commander Dong has spoken to the chief.

362
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,390
You're welcome any time.

363
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,380
Thank you, guys.

364
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,340
I understand.

365
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,790
You're doing this for my own good.

366
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,990
Including your timely appearance today.

367
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,550
I'm very grateful.

368
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,690
Get to the point.

369
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,590
But I can't go.

370
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,200
At least not now.

371
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,730
The ER is short-handed.

372
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,280
If I leave without notice,

373
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,910
it will only cause more stress

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,420
to my colleagues.

375
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,450
Besides,

376
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,340
the patients I'm currently
looking after in ER

377
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,790
haven't been released to normal care.

378
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,150
I have to follow up
when I get back to work.

379
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,670
As for my personal safety,

380
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,790
don't you worry.

381
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,810
I'll protect myself well.

382
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,610
I'll carry pepper spray with me.

383
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,540
I won't take dark alleys,

384
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,600
won't go to secluded places,

385
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,750
won't simply open the door.

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,790
I won't give any chances

387
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,420
to the bad guys to get close.

388
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,700
Is that

389
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,170
okay with you?

390
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,890
Alright.

391
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,820
I have to go to the hospital.

392
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,810
I'll take you.

393
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,130
Okay.

394
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,030
Sun Xiao Mo,

395
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,520
you and Li Lei will split up.

396
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,260
You'll continue to locate Long Yi.

397
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,210
Ask Li Lei to send two men
to the hospital.

398
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,800
Before we find Long Yi,

399
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,330
he's in charge of Dr Xia's safety.

400
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,030
Alright?

401
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,440
Notify me if anything.

402
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,550
Get down here.

403
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,530
Leaning out like that is dangerous!

404
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,690
What if you fell?

405
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,280
I'm already 21.

406
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,920
I've come across countless
dangerous situations.

407
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,820
Since when have you come to my rescue?

408
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,330
Speak. What's the matter?

409
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,860
What do you mean?

410
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,520
Didn't you tell Mu Ze

411
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,150
that you'd only speak in front of me?

412
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,340
You escorted me to the police station
so early in the day

413
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,140
and disappeared with my bag.

414
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,960
I waited an hour here for you

415
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,260
and this is what it's about?

416
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,140
You could very well be a witness.

417
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,400
I have someone I like.

418
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,050
I'm not asking about that.

419
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,330
But I want to talk about it.

420
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,650
Two nights ago,

421
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,200
you went to Yunshan Tunnel, right?

422
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,530
Why should I tell you?

423
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,510
What time did you go?

424
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,510
Did you see anyone there?

425
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,480
Take a guess.

426
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,710
Guess.

427
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,990
Xue.

428
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,250
This is very important.

429
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,500
I don't care a lick.

430
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,530
Mind your tone.

431
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm not one of your suspects.

432
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,010
I don't have to be interrogated.

433
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,800
You want to talk to me? Sure.

434
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,640
Resign from this stupid job

435
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,970
and come to the US with me.

436
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,530
We'll have a meal with Mum.

437
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,530
While eating,

438
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,130
I'll be glad to chat with you.

439
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,530
But here,

440
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm not saying one word.

441
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,650
Xue.

442
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,450
Xue!

443
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,130
Who is the guy you like?

444
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,910
Liu Ran.

445
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,470
How do you feel?

446
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,150
Miss Xia Chu.

447
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,350
The doctor said my numbers

448
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,780
have returned to normal.

449
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,100
Am I going to be discharged soon?

450
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,740
That will depend on your overall recovery.

451
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,710
Dr Zhang will decide when you do.

452
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,160
What's on your mind?

453
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,400
If...

454
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,080
If my dad could see how

455
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,860
I overcame this,

456
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,830
he would be proud, wouldn't he?

457
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,840
From now on,

458
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,270
I will

459
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,110
do as you said.

460
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,630
I will live

461
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,510
for his sake as well.

462
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,220
You can cry.

463
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,100
Cry all you want.

464
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,740
You'll feel better after.

465
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,860
Dr Xia.

466
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,710
I want to make a police report.

467
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,240
Are you

468
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,210
sure?

469
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,760
This is the hospital's

470
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,350
first successful case of saving

471
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,550
a patient poisoned by paraquat

472
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,470
with supplementary therapy using ECMO.

473
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,020
How long was ECMO

474
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,740
installed on the patient?

475
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,910
Including the waiting time
for the organ,

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,720
seven days.

477
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,960
I see. Seven days.

478
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,930
Okay.

479
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,160
Try to utilise ECMO outside
of the operating room

480
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,150
and into

481
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,110
the emergency care of severe cases.

482
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,350
It will be beneficial

483
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,350
to the establishment of the hospital's

484
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,100
emergency response system.

485
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,060
Xia Chu.

486
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,090
Mr Zhang.

487
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,720
Sir.

488
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,230
Let me introduce to you

489
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,280
Xia Chu.

490
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,830
A top student
from the Military Medical University.

491
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,450
She obtained her Physician's License
two years after graduating.

492
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,330
She's completed the regulatory training

493
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,760
and was previously stationed at
Cardiac Surgery Department.

494
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,660
Her performance has been outstanding.

495
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,830
Right, Dr Chen?

496
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,070
Now at ER,

497
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,670
she played a part in rescuing Liu Ran.

498
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,530
I know her.

499
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,010
For the past two months,

500
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,910
I've been conducting
experiential research

501
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,470
on the various departments
at the hospital.

502
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,140
I bumped into one time.

503
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,880
That day,

504
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,510
she was totally drenched.

505
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,200
She was pulling a cooler box

506
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,280
containing an organ for transplant,

507
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,790
running towards the operating room.

508
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,020
Do you remember?

509
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
So that was you.

510
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,660
That's right.

511
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,350
This young lady looks gentle and meek,

512
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,510
but when carrying out her duty,

513
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,830
she's full of vigour.

514
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,520
You know how things are at this hospital.

515
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,430
Over here,

516
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,720
women are treated like men,

517
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,270
men are treated like livestock.

518
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,540
You joke.

519
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,930
She's always the one going the distance.

520
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,570
Sir, you're exaggerating.

521
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,880
I am just carrying out my duty, is all.

522
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,840
Yes, good.

523
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,470
Let's go and check on the patients.

524
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,920
Okay. See you.

525
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,890
See you.

526
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,860
During lunch break,

527
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,580
come to see me in my office.

528
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,450
You're still here.

529
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,120
Yeah.

530
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,210
If the 4S shop calls,

531
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,600
go and get the car.

532
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,910
You're asking me to drive?

533
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,730
You need practice.

534
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,740
It's a necessary life skill.

535
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,370
Next time, you can run faster.

536
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay.

537
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,690
I'm off then.

538
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,780
Liang Mu Ze.

539
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,020
From a professional standpoint,

540
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,500
I am considered half your comrade.

541
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,600
I know the meaning

542
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,310
of the military uniform to you.

543
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,540
In one's life,

544
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,970
how much they earn,

545
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,480
what kind of house they own,

546
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,990
what car they drive,

547
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,970
those are all done for others.

548
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,220
There's only one thing,

549
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,570
what kind of person you wish to become,

550
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,160
is done for yourself.

551
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,930
Staying true to oneself is hard.

552
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,930
Perhaps it's a life-long lesson
we continue to master.

553
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,910
I am still a newbie.

554
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,940
So I'm sorry.

555
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,290
I can't give you better advice.

556
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,640
But I'd like you to know

557
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,560
that your decisions
are always right, Captain Liang.

558
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,740
I believe...

559
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,460
Liang Mu Ze, this is the hospital.

560
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,380
You asked me before

561
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,650
if anyone's habit

562
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,200
is found in my life.

563
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,490
You said no.

564
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,630
Not at that time.

565
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,540
But now, I'm telling you

566
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm learning to eat durian.

567
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,170
I'm learning to omit the salt
when cooking soup.

568
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,070
I've gotten used to your taste buds.

569
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,260
I remember what you said about

570
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,160
the heart being on top of the stomach.

571
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,990
I no longer want to be
even with you, Dr Xia.

572
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,820
If you insist on getting even,

573
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,710
the next time we meet,

574
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,100
you can ask for it then.

575
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,060
Are you confessing
your feelings right now?

576
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,060
Will you say yes?

577
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,040
I have work to do.

578
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,500
I need to get back to it.

00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,310
If the incident made you realise
my importance...

581
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,500
You're important.

582
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,940
But not because of the incident.

583
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,440
This is what I've been
wanting to tell you.

584
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,550
I like you too, Liang Mu Ze.

585
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,700
Although you're proud and snarky,

586
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,790
always wanting to win,

587
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,070
your intelligence and honesty
make me feel safe.

588
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,510
But most importantly,

589
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,720
you've got a good looking face.

590
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,330
Thanks.

591
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,580
Especially when you smile.

592
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,600
It's like the desserts you make.

593
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,760
It's rare,

594
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,930
but every time it's filled with warmth.

595
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,380
Living under the same roof
with such a guy,

596
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,730
after some time,

597
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,980
pink bubbles naturally emerge
in my heart.

598
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,150
I feel like I'm the female lead
in an idol drama.

599
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,800
I've even fantasised many times

600
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,190
about the moment when the two of us
took things off the screen.

601
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
You did?

602
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,860
Yes.

603
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,800
Especially yesterday.

604
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,290
You kissed me for the first time.

605
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,150
It was the climax of all my fantasies.

606
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,540
If you had professed your love to me then,

607
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,370
I would've agreed without thinking.

608
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,260
But now...

609
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,320
I know you're getting transferred.

610
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,760
To be honest,

611
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,690
I hate goodbyes.

612
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't like being left behind.

613
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,790
Because when the distance is too large,

614
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,510
you'll lose sight of it forever.

615
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
You may think my worries

616
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,100
are ambivalent,

617
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,670
but they are my honest thoughts

618
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,950
at this moment.

619
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,540
I need time, Liang Mu Ze.

620
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,170
I need to think this through,

621
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,070
whether or not I have the courage

622
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,760
to be in such a relationship.

623
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,090
Can I?

624
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,860
Take your time.

625
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,140
I'll wait.

626
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,370
♫ Exchanging everything, we'll become
each other's destiny ♫

627
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:29,100
♫ I'll make your heart my kingdom ♫

628
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,470
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

629
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:45,530
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

630
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,850
No way.

631
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,880
Listen.

632
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,440
I've seen too many long-distance marriages

633
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,830
that most often ended up broken.

634
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,160
A long-distance relationship

635
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,030
not only puts a strain on time
and money,

636
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,510
more importantly, it tests
one's character and dedication.

637
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,870
We are already stretched thin at work.

638
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,950
So why choose

639
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,910
Hard Mode in our relationships?

640
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,800
A companion.

641
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,960
It's not a companion
if they can't keep you company.

642
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,350
Spiritual companionship counts, right?

643
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,300
Spiritual?

644
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,140
Do you raise the next generation
with your spirit?

645
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,320
This scene needs voice-over.
Note it down.

646
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,290
Okay.

647
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,180
Don't be silly, girl.

648
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,470
If marriage is the grave of love,

649
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,860
then becoming a widow
is the abyss of hell.

650
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,140
Either he stays or you resign.

651
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,880
Otherwise, be prepared

652
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,400
to eat and shop alone,

653
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,810
celebrate festivals alone,

654
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,530
go for prenatal check-ups
and give birth alone,

655
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,780
handle both parents alone,

656
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,230
and endure a pitiful life
with no one to share your ups and downs.

657
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,580
I don't think it's as bad
as having to use "pitiful".

658
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,630
Of course it is.

659
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,100
Think about it.

660
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,920
Your "love rival" is our beloved nation.

661
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,930
Is your land bigger?

662
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,930
Do you have more people?

663
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,270
How can you compare?

664
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,110
Right.

665
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,310
What you said is true.

666
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,900
It's an undeniable fact.

667
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,670
But when he brought it up,

668
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,670
I couldn't turn him down.

669
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,680
Not only did you not turn him down,

670
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:16,200
you went ahead and divulged

671
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,020
your innermost thoughts, didn't you?

672
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,960
I'm dumb, aren't I?

673
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,150
Dumb and naive.

674
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,340
Would you have done that?

675
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:28,670
Me?

676
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,309
I'm even more dumb.

677
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,660
Because of Zhuo Ran?

678
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,430
Aren't things going well with you two?

679
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,550
Go and transfer yesterday's
B-rolls into here.

680
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,520
Okay.

681
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,700
Two days ago, we were supposed
to go and watch a movie.

682
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,340
But he said he was busy.

683
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,470
Where did he go?

684
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,740
Supposedly for work.

685
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,730
Anyway, the date was cancelled.

686
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,059
I haven't heard from him since.

687
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,260
Work?

688
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,300
What is it?

689
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,460
Nothing.

690
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,890
Yeah, it's nothing.

691
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,940
In a relationship,

692
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,540
it's either mutually showing love

693
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,590
or mutually giving or getting hurt.

694
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,700
We're adults,

695
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,400
not some young kid.

696
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,290
I'm fine with any outcome.

697
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,190
Anyway,

698
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,490
it's not like I have no suitors.

699
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,670
It doesn't have to be him, right?

700
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,670
If it really came down to...

701
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,480
If I really had to let go,

702
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,620
promise me you'd drink with me then.

703
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,740
Drink until we puke.

704
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,240
Drink until we pass out cold.

705
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,260
All right?

706
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,410
Mi Gu.

707
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,000
The fact that I'm living
at Liang Mu Ze's house,

708
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,910
did you ever mention it to Zhuo Ran?

709
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,080
No, I didn't.

710
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,440
Why do you ask?

711
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,920
Xia Chu.

712
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,180
You're living with that kind of man.

713
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,160
Aren't you afraid?

714
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,320
How did you know?

715
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,510
Mi Gu.

716
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,940
She told me.

717
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,620
Hello?

718
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,510
It's nothing. I'll leave you be.

719
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,540
Bye-bye.

720
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,600
Miss Gu, the producer wanted me

721
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,350
to remind you of the requests.

722
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,980
Liu Song

723
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,680
At the hallway today,

724
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,480
Mr Zhang specifically

725
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,510
introduced her to the visiting head of
the inspection.

726
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,760
That's right.

727
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,490
Director Chen didn't look too amused.

728
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,240
Mr Zhang did a splendid job
during the operation,

729
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,990
so Director Chen couldn't say anything.

730
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,920
Seems like Xia Chu was the most beautiful.

731
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,820
She even charmed Mr Zhang's soul away.

732
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,580
She deserves it.

733
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,260
Doesn't she?

734
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,860
Sorry, guys.

735
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,320
Mr Zhang asked me to come.

736
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,650
I overheard your discussion just now.

737
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,030
Sounded like I was the main star.

738
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,660
It was probably not the first time,

739
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,620
nor will it be the last.

740
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,520
Firstly, I'm thankful that you all
approve of my looks.

741
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,950
I know,

742
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,320
I am quite the looker.

743
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,870
No doubt about that.

744
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,340
Secondly,

745
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,380
Mr Zhang introduced me to the head

746
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,550
not because I am pretty.

747
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,580
It's because

748
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,700
I was involved with Liu Ran's treatment
from start to end.

749
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,400
I was the one who convinced her uncle

750
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,720
to install the ECMO.

751
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,640
I was also the one

752
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,470
who delivered the lung for transplant

753
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,500
from the airport to the operating room.

754
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,880
While you guys are busy chit-chatting,

755
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,720
I was in the EICU,

756
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,790
staying by the patient's side
through nights on end,

757
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,810
up until today when the ECMO was removed.

758
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,910
My effort should be remembered.

759
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,430
Lastly,

760
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'd like to share my favourite motto

761
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,390
with you all as an encouragement.

762
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,670
Being professional and reliable

763
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,110
is the most cost-effective form
of socialising.

764
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,750
Let's work hard together.

765
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,040
Alright.

766
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,300
I should head back to the ER.

767
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,200
By the way,

768
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,000
please inform Dr Zhang when he's here

769
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,090
that I dropped by.

770
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,350
Next,

771
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,100
let's welcome the President
of Ningjiang's Hospital Association,

772
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,120
who was also our former dean,

773
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,880
Mr Zhang Li Fu, to brief us on his work.

774
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,900
Let's welcome him.

775
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,410
I'm glad to be here.

776
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,920
During the inspection,

777
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,490
I've seen a lot

778
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,000
and heard a lot.

779
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,770
But the thing that impressed me
the most is

780
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,860
that resident doctor

781
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,620
named Xia Chu.

782
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:35,810
Take a look.

783
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,230
This is a photo I took by chance

784
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,940
of her back.

785
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,440
In this photo,

786
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,880
I can see the most invaluable character

787
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,780
a young doctor should have.

788
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,180
Simple.

789
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,620
Pure.

790
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,380
You could say that she's bordering

791
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,780
on naivety.

792
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,000
But I believe

793
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,640
that it's the same naivety
that has allowed her

794
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,970
to bravely speak her mind.

795
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,580
To fight for the patient

796
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,310
with good reason

797
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,750
She refused to become a vassal
for the more senior doctors.

798
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,830
Amidst the challenging
medical ethics environment,

799
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,920
she abided by
a doctor's code of conduct.

800
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,580
Such a cute heart.

801
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,470
All better.

802
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,450
We

803
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,240
often talk about

804
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,320
good hospitals

805
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,480
and good doctors.

806
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,430
What does "good" entail?

807
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,790
Aside from having the best
medical technology,

808
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,930
most advanced equipment

809
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,840
and a huge number of case samples,

810
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,070
I think a good hospital...

811
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:38,920
Get ready 200 joules

812
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,060
is not solely defined by
the responsibility and care for patients,

813
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,100
but more so

814
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,710
the way we treat the young doctors.

815
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,840
The bigger the hospital,

816
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,860
the more it should provide space
for young doctors to grow

817
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,400
and opportunities to improve.

818
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,110
Please remember this.

819
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,360
An industry without young blood

820
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,420
is one without prospects.

821
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,420
That is the reason why I decided

822
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,120
to share this photo with everyone today.

823
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,110
So, being straightforward

824
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,830
and not having to compromise

825
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,070
feels pretty good.

826
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,900
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

827
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:45,280
♫ It could be the destiny
but it is not practical ♫

828
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,090
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

829
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:59,670
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

830
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,500
Still reminiscing about my confession?

831
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,440
You're thinking too much.

832
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,500
♫ Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you ♫

833
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,110
Drive safe. No need to reply.

834
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,130
♫ If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

835
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:15,620
♫ I can't remember when
I fell in love with you ♫

836
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:22,850
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

837
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:29,650
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

838
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:36,610
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

839
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:44,810
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

840
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,030
Is Xia Chu okay?

841
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,930
Have you had lunch?

842
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,040
Where's the coffee?

843
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,780
Just make do with that.

844
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,180
She being fine doesn't mean you're fine.

845
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,200
Worry about yourself instead.

846
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,810
Regarding the tapping device,

847
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,550
I'm willing to bear the responsibility.

848
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,140
And the rest?

849
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,280
The rest?

850
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,650
Rest of what?

851
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,210
Why did Long Yi target Xia Chu?

852
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,450
That's Old Master's order.

853
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,730
Why did Old Master give that order?

854
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,680
I don't know.

855
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,460
What exactly is your relationship
with Old Master?

856
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,620
I've told you everything.

857
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,900
In spite of the threats
from the evildoers,

858
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,630
I've come clean about my mistake.

859
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,740
I turned myself in

860
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,250
and am cooperating with you.

861
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,710
I'm not hoping for any recognition.

862
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,510
I just want to be reunited with my mother.

863
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,420
If you don't believe me,

864
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,180
go ahead and verify it.

865
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,960
But you better do it quickly.

866
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,490
Time is ticking.

867
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,580
Of course we'll verify it
as soon as possible.

868
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,730
Since you

869
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,710
are so willing to cooperate with us

870
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,470
and have provided us with important clues,

871
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,600
we will ensure your personal safety.

872
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,190
So,

873
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,760
I hope you don't mind

874
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,150
spending the night
at the detention centre.

875
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,960
Certainly, Officer Rao.

876
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,500
What are you doing here?

877
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,940
I came to visit the parrot.

878
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,520
Get in.

879
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,640
You get off.

880
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,390
Roger that.

881
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,020
Everyone, ready to deploy parachutes.

882
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,510
Stand up. Clip on the snap hook.

883
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:05,920
I don't understand.

884
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,220
Why is his job more important
to him than family?

885
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,010
Catching criminals is more important
than his daughter's happiness.

886
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,450
He's trying to destroy my confidence

887
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,250
towards men, love and marriage.

888
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,670
He hasn't had a wink of sleep
in three days, Xue.

889
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,940
Why is that my problem?

890
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,150
I don't care.

891
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,670
He asked for it himself.

892
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,510
He's forgotten that he's a husband
first and foremost,

893
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,920
and a father next,

894
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,550
and a police officer last.

895
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,100
Tell me then.

896
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,120
What about the way

897
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,680
you express your feelings
so heatedly and aggressively?

898
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:36,750
I did not.

899
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:40,990
Xue.

900
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,620
He is your birth father.

901
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,840
Right?

902
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,480
Just because he doesn't show

903
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,800
his emotions as openly as you,

904
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,550
doesn't mean you're not important.

905
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,020
I'm not important.

906
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,830
He's just cold-blooded.

907
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,930
Are you alright?

908
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,150
Tian Yong!

909
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:11,710
Are you okay?

910
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,560
Yeah.

911
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,320
You should be ashamed.

912
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,300
You're an experienced paratrooper
but still got caught in a tree?

913
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,490
It's not his fault.

914
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,910
He was trying to help the new recruit
open the parachute.

915
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,670
That's why he drifted off course.

916
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,920
Are you okay?

917
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,150
Reporting, sir!

918
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,130
I can still jump!

919
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,130
Still jump?

920
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,420
Look at the state you're in!

921
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,910
I'm fine.

922
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,670
Help him. Quick!

923
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,220
Get him to the infirmary.

924
00:46:36,164 --> 00:47:06,164
