<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,470
<i>Episode 26</i>

4
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,590
Are you here looking
for someone of your same kind?

5
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,550
Are you?

6
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,040
What do you think?

7
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,200
Zhuo Ran.

8
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you love me?

9
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,710
I understand
your restlessness and loneliness,

10
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,990
as much as I understand myself.

11
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,550
To me, love

12
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,430
isn't that difficult.

13
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,610
It's just like...

14
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,760
Like what?

15
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,900
Dad.

16
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,250
Mum.

17
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,890
Meng Zhen.

18
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's eat.

19
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,520
I want to drink it.

20
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,840
Xiao Jun, eat up.

21
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,310
It's okay, he can have it.

22
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,000
It helps in digestion.

23
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,130
Here.

24
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,770
Take it.

25
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,390
Try it to see if it's delicious.

26
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,910
I don't like eggplant.

27
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,590
Xiao Jun, don't be rude.

28
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,720
Zhang Yi Chi loves eggplant.

29
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,970
When I was hospitalised,

30
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,160
I saw him ordering
braised eggplant with rice.

31
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,840
Xiao Jun

32
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,030
has good memories.

33
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,550
It's not good to be a picky eater.

34
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,400
Here, let's dig in.

35
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,210
Here.

36
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,170
Okay.

37
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,330
Here.

38
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,790
Okay.

39
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,510
Well...

40
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,930
Meng Zhen.

41
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,760
What do you do for a living?

42
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,220
I own a bookstore.

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,050
I also sell clothes
that I design on my own

44
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,430
and some stationary.

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,560
You're self-employed.

46
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,970
Back in the university,

47
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,680
which course did you major in?

48
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,390
I majored in Dramatic Literature.

49
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,720
After graduating from the university,

50
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,150
I went back to my hometown and
joined an opera troupe as a screenwriter.

51
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,680
I think it's fate.

52
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,190
I decided to stay in Ningjiang.

53
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,309
In the end, I set up the bookstore

54
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,640
and met my late husband.

55
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,990
Your late husband?

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,790
He's a military officer.

57
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,190
He sacrificed in a battle eight years ago.

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,620
It's not easy to be you.

59
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,440
It's all right.

60
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,850
Dad.

61
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,930
Meng Zhen

62
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,910
is the most talented

63
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,850
among my female friends.

64
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,810
Furthermore,

65
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,430
she knows how to live a good life.

66
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,680
I bet you live under stress.

67
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,880
Everyone lives under stress these days.

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,760
For example, in the hospital,

69
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,520
those residents who work under me

70
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,450
usually resign within three years.

71
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,630
Do you know why?

72
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,710
Their job is tiring and worse,
they don't make much from it.

73
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,590
Their income
is not as much as self-employed.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,280
If the job is so terrible,

75
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,000
why don't you change jobs

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,390
and become a bookseller too?

77
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,830
You don't say.

78
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,710
It's crossed my mind before.

79
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,809
Meng Zhen.

80
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,750
Are you hiring?

81
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,790
Stop joking.

82
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,040
You're a cardiac surgeon.

83
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,330
Don't put yourself on a job
unworthy of your talents.

84
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,750
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,370
To be frank,

86
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,870
everyone can be a master
in their own special field.

87
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,190
There is

88
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,000
neither lowliness nor nobleness
in careers.

89
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,480
Be it a doctor

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,670
or a self-employed bookstore owner,

91
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,560
I think

92
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,310
it's just a job anyway.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
Am I right, dad?

94
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,730
Here.

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,360
Try the braised eggplant.

96
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,810
Try it.

97
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,780
Here.

98
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,130
It's your son's favourite.

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,640
Here, try it.

100
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,150
Mum, I need to use the washroom.

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,120
Sure, let me show you the way.

102
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,410
I can show him the way.

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,070
It's okay. I know the way.

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
Sit down.

105
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,950
Even if you don't want
to date someone of the same profession,

106
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,240
you can find someone
from another profession.

107
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,530
She could be a banker,

108
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,360
a teacher,

109
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,350
or a government servant.

110
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,670
We have introduced so many ladies to you.

111
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,230
Any of them is a good catch.

112
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,880
How aren't you fond of them?

113
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,040
Look at you.

114
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,960
You're after a lady
who got married before.

115
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,040
She has a son too.

116
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,010
What's wrong with
a lady who got married before?

117
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,430
What's wrong with that?

118
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,070
Mum, what's wrong with you?

119
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,190
Are you here to mess things up?

120
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,580
Mum.

121
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,160
Have you washed your hands?

122
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,890
Yes.

123
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,860
Let's go.

124
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,370
Mum.

125
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,280
I shouldn't have come with you, right?

126
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,390
No.

127
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,080
Why do you think so?

128
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,050
I can feel that

129
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,350
the old lady doesn't like me.

130
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,550
What makes you feel so?

131
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,040
She said that I'm not good.

132
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,760
You've misunderstood.

133
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,680
She doesn't mean that.

134
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,550
She thinks that it's not good
to be a picky eater.

135
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,760
Look, you're still young, right?

136
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,760
You're growing.

137
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,870
How do you grow up
if you are fussy about food?

138
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,030
She said that out of concern.

139
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,040
I criticise you at times too, right?

140
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,640
However, I'll always love you.

141
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,600
Am I right?

142
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,120
Stop thinking too much. Let's go.

143
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,440
If only I was not born.

144
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,860
Xiao Jun.

145
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,070
Listen carefully.

146
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,870
To me,

147
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,270
you're the most important.

148
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,200
I don't mind losing everything

149
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,790
but I can't afford to lose you.

150
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,950
Do you get it?

151
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,970
Yes.

152
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,610
That's great.

153
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,690
Be happy.

154
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,910
Be happy.

155
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,090
Let's go.

156
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,640
Listen.

157
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,950
For example, in the hospital,

158
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,000
the best surgeon

159
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,790
is not necessarily the most popular.

160
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,030
The person who suits me the best

161
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,230
is not necessarily a catch.

162
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,880
You're paranoid

163
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,760
because I don't have a girlfriend.

164
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,000
When I finally date someone,
you're being fussy.

165
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,550
I'm already 38 years old.

166
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,770
Of course.

167
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,530
I'm not compromising

168
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,510
because I'm getting old.

169
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,490
That's because Meng Zhen is outstanding.

170
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:49,449
She's really outstanding.

171
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,190
You haven't discovered that side of her.

172
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,760
It's destiny.

173
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,960
I accept my fate.

174
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,440
In that case,

175
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,910
you're ready to be a stepfather.

176
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,750
Xiao Jun is a good boy.

177
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,290
That's irrelevant.

178
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,260
Moving forward,

179
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,560
if you marry his mum,

180
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,880
you'll have a son all of a sudden.

181
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,550
It's not about living together
for a short period of time.

182
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,430
You'll have to live together
day in and day out.

183
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,610
It could be a few years

184
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,470
or a few decades.

185
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,520
Both of you are not blood related.

186
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,230
Are you sure

187
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,430
you can be responsible to him

188
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,310
as a stepfather?

189
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,090
Also,

190
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,520
moving forward,

191
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,120
you will have your own child.

192
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,640
You will have two children in total.

193
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,910
Are you sure when the time comes,

194
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,600
you can

195
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,800
be fair to both of them?

196
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,830
Xiao Jun.

197
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,550
You're back.

198
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,600
Xiao Jun has to go to school tomorrow.
He can't stay up.

199
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,760
I'm bringing him home.

200
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,800
Enjoy the food.

201
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,320
Let me send you.

202
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,910
It's okay. We can go back on our own.

203
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,850
Let's go.

204
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,840
Xiao Chi!

205
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,590
I'm full.

206
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,660
You!

207
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,640
Meng Zhen.

208
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,040
Let me send you.

209
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,450
It's okay.

210
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,760
We can go back on our own.

211
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,800
By the way,

212
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,800
I've transferred the money
for the present to you.

213
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,650
Thank you

214
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,920
for preparing the present
on behalf of me.

215
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,150
What is going on?

216
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,810
Let's go.

217
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,810
Let me send you.

218
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,790
It's okay.

219
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,110
It'll be difficult to drop the habit
once it becomes one.

220
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,750
Then, I'll just keep the habit.

221
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,000
When your dad asked you the question,

222
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,290
you hesitated,

223
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,470
didn't you?

224
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm a mother with a son.

225
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,850
Hence, I can understand
your parent's feelings.

226
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,760
They just want to protect their son

227
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,480
and give what's best to their son.

228
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,190
It's understandable.

229
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,560
Therefore,
please understand my feelings too.

230
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,150
As for our relationship,

231
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,280
please give it some thought.

232
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,760
Both of us should give it some thought.

233
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,070
What do you think?

234
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,350
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Yi Chi.

235
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,350
Goodbye.

236
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,290
We're leaving.

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,550
Are you hungry?

238
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,850
Here.

239
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,230
It's time to eat.

240
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,980
Eat up.

241
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,950
What's wrong?

242
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,570
Give me a shave.

243
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,830
Didn't you complain that it's prickly?

244
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,690
Give you a shave?

245
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,230
Can't you do it on your own?

246
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,670
I can't do it.

247
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,120
Why?

248
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm injured.

249
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,360
Where did you hurt yourself?

250
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,630
It's over here.

251
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,270
Let me see.

252
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,920
Is it painful?

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,510
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

254
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,710
Give me a shave.

255
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,960
Okay.

256
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,110
I'll do it for you.

257
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,750
You're quite good at shaving.

258
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,950
Have you done it before?

259
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,660
For who?

260
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,070
Zhuo Ran?

261
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,670
I did it for patients.

262
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,910
When I worked at
the general surgery department,

263
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,520
I was in charge of skin preparation
before surgery was conducted.

264
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,870
It lasted for a month.

265
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,520
Making you shave
is a waste of your talents.

266
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,830
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

267
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,800
What for?

268
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,760
Thank you for carrying me back home.

269
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,640
I didn't know that
you've injured yourself.

270
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,400
I chose to carry you on my back.

271
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,430
I hit you too.

272
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,360
Is it painful?

273
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,510
Yes.

274
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,030
What should I do?

275
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,770
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

276
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,510
You've hit me anyway.
What's the point of telling you?

277
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,390
Well...

278
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,830
How should I make up to you?

279
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,530
You are already making up to me.

280
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,990
It would be better
if you could take it more seriously.

281
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,520
No matter what,

282
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,080
I still want to thank you.

283
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,770
If you didn't appear today,

284
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,480
I would be put through
a more awkward situation.

285
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,480
Are you sure you're only awkward today?

286
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,590
You can say whatever you want.

287
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,080
It's done, Captain Liang.

288
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,400
Are you happy with it?

289
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,600
Not bad, at least you didn't injure me.

290
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,000
Perhaps you're right.

291
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,960
There is nevertheless
a gap of eight years.

292
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,280
Many things have changed.

293
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,750
Example?

294
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,510
Zhuo Ran admitted that
he installed the tapping device.

295
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,430
I knew it from the beginning.

296
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,920
You knew it?

297
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,720
My understanding of Zhuo Ran

298
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,390
is beyond your imagination.

299
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,150
You won, Liang Mu Ze.

300
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,990
Like I said, I don't care about winning.

301
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,950
I care about the people.

302
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,040
It's for you.

303
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,800
What a cute keychain.

304
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,910
Where did you get it?

305
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,310
I made it.

306
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,310
You?

307
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,070
You know how to make this?

308
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,560
Do you like it?

309
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,880
I like anything that comes from you.

310
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,050
If that's the case, keep it properly.

311
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't lose it.

312
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,070
Got it?

313
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,800
Sure.

314
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,830
Xia Chu.

315
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,170
The person who attempted to kidnap you

316
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,990
has been arrested by the police.

317
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,520
However, you have to be careful.

318
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,030
Stay vigilant.

319
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,520
Especially...

320
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,600
What?

321
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,440
Don't meet up with Zhuo Ran alone.

322
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,120
It's for your own good.

323
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,750
Got it.

324
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,080
I instructed my secretary

325
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,320
to get you a set of lingerie
based on your size.

326
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,950
She will send it here later.

327
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,720
Do you mind?

328
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,190
She's your secretary.

329
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,080
It's okay so long as you don't mind.

330
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,430
What are you doing?

331
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,000
I've set up a public account

332
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,710
and it's ready to be published.

333
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,030
I didn't know that
you have a public account.

334
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,499
It's done.

335
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm going to blow dry my hair.

336
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,150
The hair dryer...

337
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,440
I want to read your article.

338
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,950
I'm giving you access.

339
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,410
From now on,

340
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,880
you're the co-admin of my public account.

341
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,080
If I don't have the time,

342
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,430
you may publish posts on my behalf.

343
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,560
Aren't you worried that
I may mess things up?

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,270
No.

345
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,530
To you,

346
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,160
I've never been on my guard.

347
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,790
How about you?

348
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,980
Zhuo Ran.

349
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,640
Rao Zhi.

350
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,520
Long Yi's lawyer is here

351
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,760
demanding him to be released right away.

352
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,890
Rao Zhi!

353
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,090
Call the ambulance!

354
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,120
I'm here. Don't be scared.

355
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,130
I'm here.

356
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,290
I'm here.

357
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,490
I'm here.

358
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,510
I'm here.

359
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,730
Rao Zhi.

360
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,590
The test result is out.

361
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,240
Long Yi is the suspect,

362
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,220
Xiao Yang.

363
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,420
He underwent plastic surgeries.

364
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,470
Rao Zhi!

365
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,720
Please calm down.

366
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,050
Rao Zhi!

367
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,250
Stop Rao Zhi!

368
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't let him go into
the interrogation chamber!

369
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Rao Zhi!

370
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,390
Rao Zhi!

371
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,870
Rao Zhi!

372
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,230
Rao Zhi!

373
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,390
Rao Zhi!

374
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,000
Rao Zhi!

375
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,910
Rao Zhi!

376
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,850
Lock up the investigation chamber!

377
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,160
Rao Zhi!

378
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,670
-Rao Zhi!
-Calm down, Rao Zhi!

379
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,310
Stay aside!

381
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,830
Rao Feng.

382
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,590
You're a veteran police officer.

383
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,120
I don't have to tell you everything

384
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,960
because you should have known it.

385
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,230
You are not allowed to touch him.

386
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,550
Why?

387
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,150
Why?

388
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,760
Now, the only evidence in our hands

389
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,640
is the testimony

390
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,430
given by Zhuo Ran against him.

391
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,850
However,

392
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,590
the credibility of the testimony

393
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,680
is uncertain.

394
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,040
He's the legal representative
of the 3D Printing Company.

395
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,510
We found a 3D printed mask

396
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,000
near the black maple forest.

397
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,510
Soon after,

398
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,150
he followed Xia Chu
in an attempt to kidnap her.

399
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,120
He also appeared

400
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,680
in the jungle along the border
where drug dealers meet.

401
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,250
The 3D printed mask was broken.

402
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,490
We were unable

403
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,070
to retrieve his fingerprints
from the mask.

404
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,330
As such,

405
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,430
everything that you said

406
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,560
is only our assumptions.

407
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,440
It can't be considered as evidence.

408
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,840
Furthermore,

409
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,270
the real culprit
has not fallen into the trap.

410
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,760
How about my daughter?

411
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,590
That scum has destroyed my family!

412
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,030
Ever since Xiao Xue met with that
mishap at the age of 13,

413
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,040
every day,

414
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,650
I woke up in fear

415
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,230
from the nightmare. Do you know that?

416
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,850
I've stopped drinking beer.

417
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,840
I don't have the guts to drink anymore.

418
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,510
Do you know why?

419
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,480
That's because when I see the bottles,

420
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,970
I would be reminded

421
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,400
of how the bottles
were stuck in my daughter's body!

422
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,800
She was only 13 years old.

423
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,160
The doctor said that
the injury would never recover.

424
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,280
It would never recover
for the rest of her life.

425
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,920
My wife...

426
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,120
No, I mean my ex-wife.

427
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,270
She divorced me because of that.

428
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,350
She said she wished she'd never met me.

429
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,230
My daughter...

430
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,960
I could have taken good care of them.

431
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,080
But I couldn't do that!

432
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,690
I could only send them far away from me.

433
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,280
They have to stay away from me.

434
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,990
My daughter called me cold-blooded.

435
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,410
She said that I'm an irresponsible father.

436
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,530
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

437
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,830
Am I?

438
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,180
I know.

439
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm a police officer.

440
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,600
As I'm wearing the uniform,

441
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,630
I have to be a role model.

442
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,480
I deserve to be punished

443
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,960
when I violate the rules and regulations.

444
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,730
I acknowledge that. I accept that.

445
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,240
However, Xiao Xue is my daughter!

446
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,600
I would risk my life to protect her!

447
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,610
Do you know that, Director?

448
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Ever since Xiao Xue and her mum left,

449
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,360
I've officially died inside.

450
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,090
The only motivation that keeps me living

451
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,120
is to arrest that scum!

452
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,610
No matter how far I have to go,

453
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,320
I have to ensure that
I rope him up and wheel him to justice!

454
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm not going to forgive him.

455
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,910
I'm not going to be generous!

456
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,450
Only by doing so

457
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,520
can I continue living. Do you know that?

458
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,320
Now, the person
who harmed my daughter is back.

459
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,610
He's just right in front of me.

460
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,910
His hands are full of my daughter's blood.

461
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,790
Yet, you told me not to touch him?

462
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,550
You even want me to let go of him?

463
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,070
I can't do it!

464
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,320
Officer 052326.

465
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,640
The detention period of Rao Feng,
Captain of the Criminal Investigation

466
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,920
Division of the Public Security Bureau
is up.

467
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,390
Let him go.

468
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,240
Yes.

469
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,920
I don't want to leave! I want
to see Tian Yong undergoing training!

470
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,990
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

471
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,830
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

472
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,320
Stop it!

473
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,800
Listen.

474
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,110
You have two choices.

475
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,670
It's either you stay at home

476
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,920
or you will be sent back
with the army truck.

477
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,400
Why can't I watch the training?

478
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,760
It's not confidential.

479
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,400
I just want

480
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,680
to see how iron men are trained.

481
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,240
No way.

482
00:29:59,330 --> 00:29:59,850
Why?

483
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,650
You're affecting Tian Yong's performance.

484
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,620
I...

485
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,590
Are you still in a cold war with your dad?

486
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,200
It's none of your business.

487
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,880
Stop calling me, will you?

488
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,450
Delivery?

489
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm not at home at the moment.

490
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,230
I gave you the address?

491
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,010
Will you please place it in the cabinet?

492
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,830
I'll get the parcel when I'm back.

493
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,320
All right, thank you.
Sorry for the trouble.

494
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,040
Well...

495
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,370
Can I go home now?

496
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,200
Have you thought it through?

497
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,510
I need to get my parcel.

498
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,520
When did she leave?

499
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,360
I think it's almost time.

500
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,630
I think I could run into her
if I go there now.

501
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,370
Sure.

502
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,760
Thanks, Mu Ze.

503
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,870
Are we heading to Cambridge Bay?

504
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,440
When is your wife's baby due?

505
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,870
When is the expected date?

506
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,600
It's been a few days late.

507
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,520
My mother-in-law told me

508
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,810
when she's pregnant with my wife,

509
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,150
she got into labour a few days late too.

510
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,790
When my wife gave birth to Xiao Xue,

511
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,160
she got into labour late too.

512
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,790
I think it's normal
when the baby is a girl.

513
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,410
Does that mean those
who are pregnant with a baby boy

514
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,310
will deliver earlier than expected?

515
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,840
I mean, my ex wife.

516
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,950
Listen,

517
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,910
when you have become a dad,

518
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,230
you must prioritise your wife and child.

519
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,750
Keep them company whenever you have time.

520
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,610
I know that.

521
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,760
Knowing it isn't sufficient.
You need to do it.

522
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,530
Listen.

523
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,200
Children grow up in a blink of an eye.

524
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,400
When you're ready to keep them company,

525
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,000
they've already grown up.

526
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,010
It's too late by then.

527
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,630
Especially when you have a daughter...

528
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,120
Rao Zhi.

529
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,910
When you reach there,

530
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,850
spend time with your daughter.

531
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,040
Don't think about other things.

532
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,570
I'll be waiting for you at the entrance.

533
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,390
Just give me a call if anything.
I'll be there anytime.

534
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,160
Is it nice?

535
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,470
Liang Shao Xue.

536
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,600
You have such a great taste.

537
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,810
Hello.

538
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,400
Hello, I have a parcel for Xia Chu.

539
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,470
Please pick up the parcel
at the pick up point now.

540
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,670
Are you going out?

541
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,280
I'm going to collect a parcel.

542
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,880
Are you going to
the pick up point at the entrance?

543
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,810
Li Lei is there.

544
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,950
I'll get him
to collect the parcel for you.

545
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,630
Hold on, Xiao Xue.

546
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,690
Li Lei.

547
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,000
Please collect a parcel for me...

548
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,230
Did I say I wanted someone
to collect it for me?

549
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,790
Did you ask me first?

550
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,850
No.

551
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,050
Xiao Xue, I thought...

552
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,760
You thought...

553
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,520
You always do everything on your own will.

554
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,560
You've never cared about my opinion.

555
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,680
Xiao Xue, let's go together.

556
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,770
Stop following me!

557
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,840
You're so irritating!

558
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,830
It must be Liang Mu Ze again.

559
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,240
It's nothing to do with him.

560
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,030
Even if he didn't tell me,

561
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,410
I could trace you too.

562
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,520
Stop looking for me!

563
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,720
It's pointless.

564
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,000
I won't tell you

565
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,800
what happened in the tunnel the other day.

566
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,630
It's okay.

567
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,880
However, you must protect yourself.

568
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,350
In the future, avoid going to

569
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,040
places like Yunshan Tunnel.

570
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,870
Don't tell anyone

571
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,360
you went there on that night.

572
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,240
Don't tell others that I'm your dad.

573
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,650
Leave this place
when you have had your fun.

574
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,829
Go back to your mum.

575
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,570
Okay?

576
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,539
No!

577
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,200
You refuse to acknowledge me.

578
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:22,869
Why should I listen to you?

579
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,150
Why should I?

580
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,000
Xiao Xue!

581
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,710
Will you stop following me?

582
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,030
I really hate you.

583
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,560
Hello, I'm here
to collect Xia Chu's parcel.

584
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,440
Are you Xia Chu?

585
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,920
No.

586
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,470
I'm her housemate.

587
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,950
You called me earlier.

588
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,590
Is this seafood?

589
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,710
Yes.

590
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,280
Please show me the inside.

591
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,440
Hurry up.

592
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,550
Fine.

593
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,230
I'll examine it when I reach home.

594
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,040
What are you doing?

595
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,160
Wake up.

596
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,760
Please don't just lie on the ground.

597
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,270
Wake up!

598
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,870
Help!

599
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,640
Village Chief.

600
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,920
Okay, I'll be there soon.

601
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,930
<i>Rescue Room</i>

602
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,280
Why are you rescuing him?

603
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:40,930
Please calm down.

604
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,840
Let him die!

605
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,640
Why did you do that to my dad?

606
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,990
-You're such a scum!
-Please calm down.

607
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,230
Scum!

608
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,880
Why did you do that to my dad?

609
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,510
Return my dad to me!

610
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,150
Xiao Xue, calm down please.

611
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,830
Why are you rescuing a murderer?

612
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,870
He is now a witness!

613
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,230
Teng.

614
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,960
Give it to me, Teng.

615
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,800
Give it to me, Teng.

616
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,120
When can we meet again?

617
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,960
Way to go, Xiang Yang.

618
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,670
You're engaged in online dating.

619
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,130
Take it.

620
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,630
Let me do it on my own.

621
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,890
<i>We're bringing you breaking news.</i>

622
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,770
<i>A serious explosion took place</i>

623
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,770
<i>at Cambridge Bay in the morning.</i>

624
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,330
<i>The casualties are pending confirmation.</i>

625
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,920
<i>According to the residents,</i>

626
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,440
<i>the explosion gave forth
a tremendous sound.</i>

627
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,370
<i>At the moment, police officers,
firemen and medical officers</i>

628
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,370
<i>have rushed to the scene.</i>

629
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,520
<i>The number of casualties
will be ascertained later.</i>

630
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,440
Attention!

631
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,590
I saw the news.

632
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,630
The Public Security Bureau
just gave me a call.

633
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,410
Liang Mu Ze.

634
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,170
Yes!

635
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,560
Go to the hospital
to check on the situation.

636
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,610
Yes!

637
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,160
Tian Yong.

638
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:02,600
Yes!

639
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,260
You should tag along.

640
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,230
Yes!

641
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,670
Ms Gu!

642
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,680
Village Chief.

643
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,990
Director Mi.

644
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,130
Have you found Ke Wei?

645
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,090
Not yet.

646
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,570
We tried to reach him through phone.

647
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,970
A few days ago, there were still signals.

648
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,840
Now, we couldn't reach him at all.

649
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,000
Before he left,

650
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,930
did he say anything

651
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,970
or mention any place?

652
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,870
My grandson is a good boy.

653
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,210
He seldom talks.

654
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,760
Did he behave abnormally?

655
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:10,850
No.

656
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,880
He did.

657
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,640
He refused to sleep.

658
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,560
It's like this.

659
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,550
Lately,

660
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,120
he's obsessed with computer games.

661
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,480
Qian Rong,

662
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,680
who is his mum,

663
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,720
paid him a visit a few days ago.

664
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,130
She gave him a laptop.

665
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,090
He's so excited.

666
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,330
He couldn't stop playing on the laptop.

667
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,240
Where is the laptop?

668
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,310
Please show it to me.

669
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,680
Well...

670
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,450
Well...

671
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,330
This lady...

672
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,300
Who is she?

673
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,550
Report to the police.

674
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,280
I've pasted

675
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,760
the documents for you.

676
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,240
Thank you.

677
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,510
This is another set of documents.

678
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,200
I need Professor Tang's help

679
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,200
to improvise it.

680
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,840
Your main goal

681
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,650
in asking me to do all these

682
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,200
is not to build a factory in Dong'an.

683
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,640
Your main goal

684
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,000
is to obtain project information

685
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,850
for the other companies, right?

686
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,120
Is there any difference?

687
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,840
I just want to focus on research.

688
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,560
I don't want to be a commercial spy.

689
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,400
Your salary for the month

690
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,310
has been transferred to your bank account.

691
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,010
Where did you get the particulars?

692
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,320
I have a way to obtain it.

693
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,590
Professor Xia, good day.

694
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,760
I'm Zhuo Ran.

695
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,000
I saw on the news that

696
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,990
an explosion took place
in Xia Chu's neighbourhood.

697
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,680
Did she contact you?

698
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,360
Is she okay?

699
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,400
Lan Zi Yu!

700
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,700
What's wrong?

701
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,920
Is Xia Chu living at Cambridge Bay?

702
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,720
You mean Ningjiang?

703
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,030
Yes, her house in Ningjiang.

704
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,400
Yes, what's wrong?

705
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,880
Is she staying together

706
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,110
with Liang Mu Ze?

707
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,270
She rented a room at his place.

708
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,840
Furthermore, Liang Mu Ze

709
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:25,840
usually stays in the military camp.

710
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,230
Why are you shouting?

711
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,430
Just how many things
are you hiding from me?

712
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,790
Will he die?

713
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,430
I can't give you any confirmation on that

714
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,150
but please trust us.

715
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,230
Xiao Xue!
