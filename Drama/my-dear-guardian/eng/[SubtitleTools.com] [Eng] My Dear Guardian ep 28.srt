<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Episode 28</i>

4
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,930
<i>He's the drug dealer's son.</i>

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,760
<i>I saw him when I was compiling
the materials.</i>

6
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,920
<i>He resembles you.</i>

7
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,170
<i>You told me</i>

8
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>you had no siblings.</i>

9
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,300
<i>But as you know,</i>

10
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:56,879
<i>we journalists</i>

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,050
<i>have wide open minds.</i>

12
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,960
<i>For the whole afternoon,
I asked myself,</i>

13
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,970
<i>who was the man?</i>

14
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>How is he related to you?</i>

15
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,130
<i>Perhaps</i>

16
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,410
<i>he was the reason you left
without a word.</i>

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,960
<i>Or perhaps</i>

18
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>it was merely a coincidence.</i>

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,480
So it is you.

20
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,560
Zhuo Ran.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,960
Uncle Rao.

22
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,050
You're awake.

23
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,120
Where's Xiao Xue?

24
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,290
She went to grab some breakfast.

25
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,360
Is Li Lei alright?

26
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,460
He's fine.

27
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,600
You may see him once you recover.

28
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,960
And the suspect?

29
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,640
Dead.

30
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,930
Take it easy.

31
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,290
You need rest.

32
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,560
Just lie down.

33
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,360
Dr Xia.

34
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,640
When can I get discharged?

35
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,170
You've suffered a serious concussion.

36
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,650
You need time to recuperate.

37
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,780
When you're ready to be discharged,

38
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,250
we'll let you know.

39
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,440
Be patient.

40
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,210
I have to go now.

41
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll see you again.

42
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,600
Xiao Xue.

43
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,880
Rao's team has suffered
no serious injuries.

44
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,840
But you should remind him
to get more rest.

45
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,590
Got it.

46
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,160
One more thing.

47
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,559
What is it?

48
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,680
Ke Wei's family

49
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,720
would like to visit the injured policemen.

50
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,480
That's not necessary.

51
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,730
I know it's a lot to ask

52
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,690
at a time like this.

53
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,730
But I have a feeling

54
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,320
the explosion

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,800
wasn't simply the act of a youngster.

56
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,680
Perhaps

57
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,040
there's a deeper reason behind it.

58
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,520
What reason?

59
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,540
Ke Wei's screensaver

60
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,360
is a picture of a suicide victim

61
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,480
with the words, "The City of Desire."

62
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,890
The City of Desire?

63
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,360
Are you sure?

64
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,360
I've seen that picture.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,410
Does "The City of Desire"

66
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,760
bear any significance?

67
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,040
Do you remember the assassin

68
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,530
who went after us last time?

69
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,559
His smartphone

70
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,720
had a picture of a dead body, too.

71
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,010
And the words, "The City of Desire."

72
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,920
The City of Desire is

73
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,800
a dark and unfathomable world.

74
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,809
How did you know?

75
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,040
Does your wound

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,800
have something to do with him?

77
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,210
Maybe.

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,720
Is it done?

79
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,200
Does it happen very often?

80
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,410
Not too often.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,770
About as often as violence
against doctors.

82
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,680
Given our predicaments,

83
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,040
it'd be difficult

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,840
for us to be together.

85
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,840
We'll only know if we try.

86
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,780
Have you said that

87
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,850
to your language instructor?

88
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,820
No.

89
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,400
What about the nurses at Isaia?

90
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm going to see Rao Zhi.

91
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
It's not just the two of them, is it?

92
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,920
I only say that to you, Da Miao.

93
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,240
Dr Xia...

94
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,170
Dad?

95
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,560
What brings you here?

96
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,120
Hi, Mr Xia.

97
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,080
What's the matter?

98
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,840
Can't I visit you?

99
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,400
No.

100
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,400
I'd like to speak with my daughter.

101
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,400
Go right ahead. I was
just about to leave.

102
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,600
Are you going to just stand there?

103
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm worried you might not
want to see me.

104
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,530
Come here.

105
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,240
What did you get?

106
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,610
Sweet soy milk,

107
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,850
vegetarian noodles,

108
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,160
chicken potstickers,

109
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,480
and cold shredded potato.

110
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,360
That's a lot of food.

111
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,920
They're all your favourites.

112
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,760
You remembered.

113
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,800
I didn't.

114
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,160
I asked my mum.

115
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,640
She knows I'm injured?

116
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,680
Good.

117
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean "good?"

118
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,080
It's not good at all.

119
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,040
I told my mum

120
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,330
I was getting all these goodies

121
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,980
to fatten you up

122
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,610
like a pig.

123
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,200
So you can't be a cop anymore.

124
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,330
That's so mean.

125
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,960
But

126
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,240
after I told that lie,

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,680
I realised something.

128
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,920
What did you realise?

129
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,040
I realised

130
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,200
why you wouldn't let me be with you.

131
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,490
Why you always tried to get rid of me

132
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,320
and told people I wasn't your daughter.

133
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,680
But it seems

134
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,320
you don't hate me all that much.

135
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,440
So are you going to listen
to me this time?

136
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,280
Never.

137
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,720
Xiao Xue.

138
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,990
By the way,

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,930
I finished the portrait

140
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,320
and gave it to your colleague.

141
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,180
That night,

142
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,090
I walked along the highway
by the coast.

143
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,490
When I entered the tunnel,

144
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,680
I saw a man driving past.

145
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,320
Did he see you?

146
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,820
No.

147
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,280
The tunnel was pitch black.

148
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,120
What happened next?

149
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,800
Then I fell asleep.

150
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,380
When I woke up, I was already
in the ER.

151
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,770
A man named Zhuo Ran
brought me there.

152
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,140
He's Xia Chu's first boyfriend.

153
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,450
You know that, don't you?

154
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,930
As for what happened between

155
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,240
the tunnel and the ER,

156
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,120
I haven't the slightest impression.

157
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,810
Around what time was it?

158
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,020
I mean

159
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
when you saw the man in the tunnel.

160
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,650
Nine.

161
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,200
I was listening to a music station.

162
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,490
There was a time announcement.

163
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,080
Nine o'clock.

164
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,440
A man.

165
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,080
Zhuo Ran.

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,090
The suspect

167
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,480
has a history of substance abuse
in the public.

168
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,760
During his rehabilitation,

169
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,410
he would often

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,880
log in to the City of Desire,

171
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,960
exposing himself to the temptation
of drugs.

172
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
He received

173
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,660
a list of instructions for a game.

174
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,740
The instructions

175
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,300
are linked to the explosion.

176
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,610
The man who gave the instructions

177
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,890
is none other than the elusive

178
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,820
Scary Pirate.

179
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,840
The only person

180
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,220
who may have had dealings

181
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,860
with the Scary Pirate

182
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,860
is the drug dealer

183
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,260
who transacted with him
in Yunshan Tunnel.

184
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,400
According to the sketch
provided by witnesses,

185
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,800
we've ascertained

186
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,800
the suspect's identity.

187
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,940
Well?

188
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,080
I am

189
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,370
of some use to you, aren't I?

190
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,880
To me,

191
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,120
you're more than just a useful companion.

192
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,600
Xiao Xue,

193
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,680
go back to the US.

194
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,440
I don't want to.

195
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,800
I want to stay by your side

196
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,160
at least until you've fully recovered.

197
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,080
What are you writing?

198
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,240
How's your dad?

199
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,200
He's fine.

200
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,440
Good.

201
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you

202
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,600
writing a love letter for me?

203
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,980
No.

204
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,840
Liang Mu Ze.

205
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,960
Where did you get this?

206
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,370
I met a woman,

207
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,820
an ex-accountant

208
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,240
who is now a transplant coordinator.

209
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,810
She was talking about

210
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,200
the importance of organ donation.

211
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,960
So I got a copy from her.

212
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,690
Are you going to donate your organs?

213
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,690
Ever since my near-fatal experience

214
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,960
with the gunshot wound,

215
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,080
I've been thinking about it.

216
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,370
You were shot before?

217
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,500
Here.

218
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,190
Xiao Xue.

219
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,640
Xiao Xue.

220
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,200
Xiao Xue.

221
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,330
Xiao Xue, don't...

222
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,960
Let me hear

223
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,760
what your heart

224
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,480
has to say.

225
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,480
People are looking.

226
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,280
This is embarrassing.

227
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,880
I get it now.

228
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,800
Your heart told me everything.

229
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,080
It knows you're accustomed to being alone

230
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,640
and watching "Aberdeen"

231
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,600
and it's all for it.

232
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,690
Send me to the subway station.

233
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,080
The Captain isn't around.

234
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,960
I can't leave my post.

235
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,370
Sorry.

236
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,760
You may go.

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,450
Captain.

238
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,730
Don't go home.

239
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,160
Come to the guest house

240
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,680
and have a good night's sleep.

241
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,880
Send her to the subway.

242
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,560
Okay.

243
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,090
Go on.

244
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,160
Thanks, Captain.

245
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,170
You came here just for this?

246
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,640
Do you think it's a small matter?

247
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,850
It's no big deal, really.

248
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,540
See?

249
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,090
I'm still alive and well.

250
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,520
Rest assured.

251
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,200
I can't.

252
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,440
The explosion incident aside,

253
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,160
you should count your lucky stars
that you're still alive.

254
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,810
When I heard you were

255
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,090
fooling around with that military guy,

256
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,320
a hundred fears came to my mind.

257
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,660
Dad,

258
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,060
how can you say that?

259
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,760
What do you mean "fooling around?"

260
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,970
Liang Mu Ze is

261
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,290
an upright soldier.

262
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,100
During my stay at his house,

263
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,420
he treated me with the utmost respect.

264
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,730
And we're getting along happily.

265
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,250
Honey,

266
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,720
that's just a man's trick.

267
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,300
If he doesn't throw you a bone,

268
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,520
how can he trick you
into becoming his girlfriend?

269
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,650
We've been over this.

270
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,730
I only pretended to be his girlfriend

271
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,260
to appease his mother.

272
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,230
Wait...

273
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,250
That's even more absurd.

274
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,450
Why is he using my daughter

275
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,970
to appease his mother?

276
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,720
You call that respect?

277
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,040
Happily, you say?

278
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,380
I think,

279
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,140
just like me,

280
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,840
you've let all the studying
mess you up.

281
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,090
I can't speak for you,

282
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,760
but I'm sure I'm not messed up.

283
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,580
I know better than anyone

284
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,240
what kind of person Liang Mu Ze is.

285
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,170
I admit I've mishandled

286
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,610
the whole girlfriend charade.

287
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,450
But

288
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,370
now,

289
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,530
I'm seriously considering

290
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,240
becoming his girlfriend for real.

291
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,500
Do you dare?

292
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,580
We're both single adults.
What's there to be afraid of?

293
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,800
You...

294
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,360
Change careers.

295
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,160
What?

296
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:19,600
I want you to change careers
and come back to Dong'an with me.

297
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,900
Is this a joke?

298
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,210
I'm not joking.

299
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,979
You encouraged me to study medicine.

300
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,370
You encouraged me to come
to Ningjiang.

301
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,380
You encouraged me

302
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,620
to see the world.

303
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,729
Now look what happened.

304
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,530
The daughter I worked so hard to raise

305
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,170
is going to become a wife
of a soldier

306
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,890
and a slave to his lifestyle.

307
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,050
I won't.

308
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,300
If you choose Liang Mu Ze,

309
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,530
that will be your future.

310
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,320
You'll be wasting your life!

311
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,170
Then

312
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,580
why can't I be selfish

313
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,040
and keep you by my side?

314
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,660
At least I can

315
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,170
give you a peaceful life

316
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,640
and you won't have to live in fear
with him.

317
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,240
I have work to do.

318
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,630
Dad,

319
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,930
let's talk

320
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,490
later.

321
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm off.

322
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,050
Goodbye.

323
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,200
Can't you send me to the camp?

324
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,450
The Captain only let me send you
to the subway station.

325
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,800
It's not like he'll know.

326
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,680
But I do.

327
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,160
Can't you pretend you don't know?

328
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,760
I can't.

329
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,680
Bullheaded fool.

330
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,650
What did you say?

331
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,610
I said you're bullheaded.

332
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,280
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,680
The Captain said I could send
you to the subway station.

334
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,640
But he didn't say whether
it's the starting station

335
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,080
or the destination station.

336
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,840
What are you, my chauffeur?

337
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,350
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

338
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,840
♫ I learn to face the music

339

♫ Every minute, every second,

345

You gave me an hourglass,

349
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,640
so I'm giving you a watch.

350
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,930
This way, we'll

351
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,400
live in each other's pockets.

352
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,280

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,660
Right here?

364
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,930
Yes.

♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

366
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,890

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,520
That's not I mean. I...

368
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,380
I mean, isn't it

369
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,620
a little crowded here?

370
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,850
You're too self-conscious.

371
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,020
Everyone's looking at their phones.

372
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,400

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,290
Do a blood test first.

378
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,820
Come back to me

379
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,000
once you have the results.

380
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,730
Thanks, doctor.

381
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,700
You're welcome.

382
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,240
Next.

383
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,320
What seems to be the problem?

384
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,330
I have a heart ache.

385
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,730
What are you doing here?

386
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,480
What do you mean?

387
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,210
I got a number.

388
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,730
I can't see my daughter

389
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,560
and I can't see a doctor?

390
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,090
After such a dire experience,

391
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,220
if he really loves you,

392
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,930
he should

393
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,880
try to get recalled.

394
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,770
Instead of making you

395
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,240
endure danger here.

396
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,210
I'm not staying here

397
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,450
because of him

398
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,140
but for my job.

399
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,410
Think,

400
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,780
what has he ever done for you

401
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,130
while you were together?

402
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,120
What about you?

403
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,810
You've been married to mum
for so many years.

404
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,490
What have you done for her?

405
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,730
If women were rational,

406
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,520
all men would be single forever.

407
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,720
I treat your mum just fine.

408
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,360
This is the EICU. No entry.

409
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:37,080
<i>Emergency Intensive Care Unit</i>

410
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,850
Honey.

411
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,010
Honey.

413
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,250
I'll send you the photo
once I've cleaned it up.

414
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,120
No need to.

415
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,330
All I did was kiss you.

416
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,760
Don't be mad.

417
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm not mad.

418
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,530
Then I'll kiss you again and see.

419
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,440
Xiao Xue.

420
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,280
Knock it off.

421
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,570
I'm just pulling your leg. Come on.

422
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,800
Do you remember the way home?

423
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,800
Sure.

424
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,640
Get off at the third bus stop,
take a rickshaw,

425
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,330
walk for around ten minutes,

426
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,080
and I should be there by sundown.

427
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,400
Why don't I give you a ride?

428
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,000
Lieutenant, you're the best!

429
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,240
Let's go.

430
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,620
You walk in front.

431
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll follow behind you.

432
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,160
Okay.

433
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,170
♫ All I need ♫

434
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,260
♫ Is a plain old hug ♫

435
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,270
♫ But I am too shy ♫

436
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,380
♫ I hide behind formalities ♫

437
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,770
♫ Politely greeting you in my soft voice ♫

438
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,180
♫ I wave goodbye, trying to run away ♫

439
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,380
♫ I can't avoid it, it wraps around me
like the wind ♫

440
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,890
I have a gift for you.

441
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,880
A gift? What kind of gift?

442
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,970
But I'm afraid you might
scoff at it.

443
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,100
Fret not, I'll definitely scoff at it.

444
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,480
So just let me see it.

445
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,840
What's this?

446
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,840
Last time, you said the heart protector
was too ugly.

447
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,140
I got some Dyneema

448
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,810
from an old army friend

449
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,660
who works at a defence manufacturer

450
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,840
and made a bulletproof vest for you.

451
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,410
Is the look

452
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,840
acceptable for you?

453
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,880
No.

454
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,290
Xiao Xue.

455
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,010
This is made from the most advanced
bulletproof material in the world.

456
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,200
It's incredibly light

457
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,570
and soft.

458
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,220
Of course, on such short notice,

459
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,040
the workmanship may be a little sloppy.

460
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,880
But I hope you'll accept it.

461
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,810
Stop laughing.

462
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,040
You must wear it when you go out.

463
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,320
Promise me

464
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,080
you'll wear it when you go out, okay?

465
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,440
That way,

466
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,520
Officer Rao can have peace of mind.

467
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,600
Is that the only reason?

468
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,880
Don't move!

469
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,970
What's that sound?

470
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,090
Stay here.

471
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,280
Tian Yong!

472
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,630
Don't move!

473
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,520
Stand right there!

474
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,240
Tian Yong!

475
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,480
What happened to you?

476
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,960
Wake up, Tian Yong.

477
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,920
Wake up, wake up.

478
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm okay.

479
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,770
You gave me such a fright.

480
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,320
I wasn't lying.

481
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,330
It is handy.

482
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,760
But it's so ugly.

483
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,530
It's alright.

484
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,960
Just relax.

485
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,600
Relax, take a deep breath.

486
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,360
Come on, breathe in.

487
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,800
Relax. Everything's alright.

488
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,650
What's the situation?

489
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,840
The pregnant lady is having a severe
haemorrhage due to trauma.

490
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,970
She had five years of substance abuse,

491
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,730
one ectopic pregnancy,

492
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,570
two successful labours.

493
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
This is her third pregnancy,

494
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,440
but we've lost the baby's heartbeat.

495
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,130
Ask the anaesthesiologist and the
Neonatology Department

496
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,330
to prepare for surgery.

497
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,010
Leave it to me.

498
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,980
Okay.

499
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,520
Dr Xia.

500
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,640
Coming through! Please move aside.

501
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,730
Can you hear me?

502
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,610
If you can,

503
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,840
grab my hand.

504
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,490
Set up the blood transfusion.

505
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,810
Ask Orthopaedics, General Surgery,

506
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,810
and ICU for a treatment plan.

507
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,980
And call Dr Song.

508
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,950
Okay.

509
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,330
Ye Feng's family?

510
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,640
That's us.

511
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,080
Foot the bill.

512
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,570
Doctor,

513
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,440
how's his condition?

514
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,530
Don't worry,

515
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,160
we'll do our best to save him.

516
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,040
Captain.

517
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,520
Are you okay?

518
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,160
I'm okay.

519
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,540
Xiao Xue is back at the camp.

520
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,370
I know.

521
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,760
She phoned me.

522
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,690
What about Boss?

523
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,080
He's inside.

524
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,890
What are they discussing?

525
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,320
I don't know.

526
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,480
Liang Mu Ze

527
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,050
comes from a long line
of soldiers.

528
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,960
He certainly has the discipline
of a military man.

529
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,780
Not only was he trained

530
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,840
in the Hunter Military School in Isaia,

531
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,040
he was

532
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,880
one of the top scorers among the fourteen

533
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,240
who graduated.

534
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,130
As Commandos Team Thunder's captain,

535
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,410
he has extensive experience

536
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,650
on the battlefield.

537
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,600
To be honest,

538
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,050
I'd like to have

539
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,680
someone who's as capable
as him

540
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,410
but less conspicuous.

541
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,210
This officer named Tian Yong,

542
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,180
why are his place of birth
and family details

543
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,370
unspecified?

544
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,160
He's an orphan.

545
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,650
He'll be discharged this year.

546
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,240
The paperwork is underway.

547
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,080
What happened to the pregnant woman?

548
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,280
She's in the ER.

549
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,970
She's well into her term.

550
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,080
Tian Yong.

551
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,520
I...

552
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,480
I feel I could've stopped her...

553
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,530
She was bleeding badly.

554
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,080
What if

555
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,880
she gives birth prematurely?

556
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,040
She's a drug dealer.

557
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,800
She shot at you.

558
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,780
You did nothing wrong.

559
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,970
If it weren't for you,

560
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,980
it'd be Xiao Xue

561
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,170
who's in the operating room
right now.

562
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,840
I understand.

563
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm just worried about her baby.

564
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,280
Whether it'll

565
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,440
see its mother

566
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,160
when it comes out.

567
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,480
I can't take it.

568
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,560
Lieutenant Tian.

569
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,290
Here.

570
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,260
Please come in.

571
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,400
Yes.

572
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,930
<i>General Conference Room</i>

573
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,800
Chief.

574
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,849
That was a good showing today.

575
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,650
Sir,

576
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,059
I was merely helping
a fellow law enforcer

577
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,240
on the arrest.

578
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,320
Do you know who you arrested?

579
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,730
His name is Li Zhi Peng.

580
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,660
In name,

581
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,860
he's the owner of a youth hostel.

582
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,740
But behind the curtain,

583
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,809
he's a drug dealer.

584
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,720
Do you still remember

585
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,930
the mission at the bar?

586
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,900
I do.

587
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,570
Both parties did not show up
for the deal

588
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,680
and the mission was called off.

589
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,880
Wrong.

590
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,059
They completed their transaction

591
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,250
in Yunshan Tunnel instead.

592
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:55,680
One of the parties was Li Zhi Peng.

593
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,920
The other party, whom he had
contacted online,

594
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,360
goes by the online ID

595
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,119
of Scary Pirate.

596
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,690
Ever heard of the City of Desire?

597
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,250
It's the biggest

598
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,880
online drug trading platform.

599
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,460
Director,

600
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,730
Tian Yong seldom uses the internet,

601
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,160
let alone the dark web.

602
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,800
So are you familiar with
the Old Master?

603
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,520
Who is that?

604
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,320
Remember the villagers

605
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,210
you captured at the border

606
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,970
with the Border Armed Police?

607
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,480
According to them,

608
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,090
they were coerced into
drug trafficking

609
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,250
by someone

610
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,640
called Old Master.

611
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,780
I don't know him.

612
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,040
Nobody knows who he is.

613
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,130
The man

614
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,600
is highly elusive.

615
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,440
His power spreads across
Southeast Asia.

616
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,570
He's now

617
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,140
the true leader of the

618
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,850
international mercenary group, T4.

619
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,820
Explosives.

620
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,860
Drugs.

621
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,850
Human

622
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,000
and organ trafficking.

623
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,330
If there's money in it,

624
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,440
they'd do it.

625
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,450
They've become a cancer

626
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,760
upon the border.

627
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,020
Three months ago,

628
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,610
we arrested a drug dealer.

629
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,210
His name was Liu Zheng Min.

630
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,560
And it's all

631
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,410
related to the Scary Pirate?

632
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,380
That's right.

633
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,890
We've been

634
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,530
having trouble figuring out

635
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,720
the Scary Pirate's real identity.

636
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,320
But recently,

637
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,860
one of the Old Master's henchmen

638
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,760
approached the police

639
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,720
and offered to become an informant.

640
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,560
Is Old Master the Scary Pirate?

641
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,760
We're still verifying it.

642
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,090
We're going to use

643
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,380
Li Zhi Peng, whom we've captured today,

644
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,920
to contact the Scary Pirate

645
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,260
through the City of Desire,

646
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,400
and tell him

647
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,130
we have a huge amount of cash

648
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,880
that we need moving.

649
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,420
Then?

650
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,500
Then once the target takes the bait,

651
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,720
you'll be their point of contact.

652
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,890
Me?

653
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,880
Yes.

654
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,360
They need someone

655
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,500
with the single combat skills
and field experience

656
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,730
of a special forces soldier

657
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,130
yet do not belong

658
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,400
to the police force.

659
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,120
And my mission is?

660
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,090
Your mission is

661
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,680
to find evidence

662
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,040
that can prove the Scary Pirate's
real identity.

663
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,780
At the same time,

664
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,080
find out the Old Master's whereabouts.

665
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,080
Tian Yong,

666
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,650
any questions?

667
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,890
Feel free to ask.

668
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,380
Chief,

669
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,020
are they the culprits

670
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,160
behind today's incident?

671
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,040
In a certain way,

672
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,300
yes.

673
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,400
I have no other questions.

674
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,840
You must not fail!

675
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,880
Captain,

676
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,850
has Rao Feng come to?

677
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,660
He has.

678
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,160
Take me to him.

679
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,320
What about Tian Yong?

680
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,970
Tian Yong stays here.

681
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,250
He has a new mission.

682
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,600
Alright.

683
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,120
Why did they release me?

684
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,300
They don't have

685
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,200
solid evidence of your crime.

686
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,040
Besides, you're a foreign citizen.

687
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,330
Did you think they were

688
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,720
going to keep you for the New Year?

689
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,050
Even though I'm free,

690
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,720
it doesn't mean I'm safe.

691
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,760
I'm guessing

692
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,840
they'll be watching me 24-7.

693
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,250
We've received the order

694
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,040
to form

695
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,440
a joint task force with
your police department.

696
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,040
The idea

697
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,000
is to cast a wide net,

698
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,640
so we can catch him and the mastermind

699
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,090
in one go.

700
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,600
I'll ask my informants

701
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,560
to give their full support.

702
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,920
Good.

703
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,400
Relax.

704
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,770
We've been under their surveillance

705
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,320
for a couple of days now

706
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,920
and we're perfectly fine.

707
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,000
Any news from Old Master?

708
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,010
Do you know

709
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,600
what happened while you were in

710
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,040
the Public Security Bureau?

711
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,240
Somebody blew up

712
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,680
Liang Mu Ze's neighbourhood.

713
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,640
The Old Master ordered it

714
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,200
despite knowing you were there.

715
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,320
What are you getting at?

716
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,770
Of course, he did it

717
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,920
to get back at the police
for taking his goods.

718
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,290
He doesn't need to care

719
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,720
about the consequences

720
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,320
of ruffling the police's feathers.

721
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,040
After all,

722
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,280
he's abroad.

723
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,570
And to him,

724
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,360
your life

725
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,680
isn't worth a penny.

726
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,300
Guess

727
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,840
what the police

728
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,130
are going to do next?

729
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,720
I'm not going to guess.

730
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,250
And you can stop

731
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,960
trying to turn me against Old Master.

732
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,800
Do you think I'm stupid?

733
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,170
When I joined Old Master,

734
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,800
you were just a little baby.

735
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,680
Let me tell you,

736
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,740
if Old Master finds out

737
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,520
what you're doing behind his back,

738
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,800
you're dead meat.

739
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,790
<i>Rescue Room</i>

740
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,410
Why don't I book a flight

741
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,120
back to Dong'an for you?

742
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,640
No.

743
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,850
Are you okay with

744
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,850
leaving Miss Lan alone at home?

745
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,560
Your grandma and grandpa
are there.

746
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,810
They'll keep her company.

747
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,200
Listen here,

748
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,330
you can't come to Ningjiang
and ruin my day

749
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,080
just to avoid Grandpa, can you?

750
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,660
Why would I avoid him?

751
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,970
It's my house.

752
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,880
Sure, it's your house.

753
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,400
What about your department?

754
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,920
And your project?

755
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,140
You're always here with me.

756
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,050
Don't you have work?

757
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,650
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

758
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,500
Look,

759
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,690
this is about you.

760
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,200
Don't talk about me.

761
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,330
Let me tell you,

762
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,600
ever since you were little,

763
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,810
I've fulfilled every promise

764
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,540
I've made to you, haven't I?

765
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,000
So today, you must promise

766
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,740
to quit right now and move back

767
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,650
to Dong'an.

768
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,120
I will not allow you to see
Liang Mu Ze.

769
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,600
Hey,

770
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,140
what's gotten into you?

771
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,880
Are you having difficulties?

772
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,370
Why are you so stubborn?

773
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,060
Because we're old

774
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,760
and we can't have anything happen to you!

775
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,240
I'll go back to the hotel.

776
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,520
We'll talk when you're off work.

777
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,880
Dad...

778
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,440
Dr Zhang.

779
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,480
Xia Chu.

780
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,850
What happened to the pregnant woman

781
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,970
who lost her baby's pulse yesterday?

782
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,760
The caesarean caused too much bleeding.

783
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,090
The mother passed away,

784
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,720
leaving behind a pair of twins.

785
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,040
Twins?

786
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,980
Yes.

787
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,200
And they're adorable.

788
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,940
But they're showing signs

789
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,410
of neonatal withdrawal syndrome.

790
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,650
We're keeping them in an incubator

791
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,290
and giving them intensive care

792
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,440
and withdrawal treatment.

793
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,410
You may visit them when you're free.

794
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,540
Alright.

795
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,120
I know.

796
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,530
Don't worry.

797
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,760
I've taken the immunoglobulin shot.

798
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,600
Once the results are out,

799
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,040
I'll let you know.

800
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,120
I have work to do.

801
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,840
I'll talk to you later.

802
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,120
Bye.

803
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,720
Xia Chu?

804
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,280
What happened?

805
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,660
The other day

806
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,370
we were operating on Ke Wei.

807
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,280
Turned out

808
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,000
that he had Hepatitis B.

809
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,050
He was writhing about during the surgery,

810
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,080
so we went up and held him down.

811
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,330
His blood was everywhere

812
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,000
and we were close to his body.

813
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,840
Did you get tested?

814
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,160
I had my blood taken.

815
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,300
But the doctor at the
Pathology Department said

816
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,420
even if it turns out negative,

817
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,000
we can't be 100 percent sure.

818
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,600
I have to get tested a few more times.

819
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,000
I was on the phone with my parents.

820
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,570
I couldn't hold it anymore

821
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,290
and told them everything.

822
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,690
But after I did,

823
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,240
I really wish I hadn't.

824
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,290
Ever since I went to university,

825
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,960
I haven't done a thing for my family.

826
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,290
If I'm infected,

827
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,050
what will become of them?

828
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,120
Actually, it could be worse.

829
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,970
After all, during the surgery,

830
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,890
I didn't contact the wound directly.

831
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,010
It's mainly psychological damage.

832
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,960
But poor Dr Zhang,

833
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,800
he was the one who conducted
the surgery.

834
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,890
And

835
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,170
I think he pricked his fingers
with the haemostatic forceps.

836
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,760
What happened to him?

837
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,600
Nothing serious.

838
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,800
But he's always in the operating room
or by the patient's bed.

839
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,920
He's been seeing more patients
than usual.

840
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,500
We're really worried

841
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,960
that he might break down.

842
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:54,984
