<i>My Dear Guardian</i>

3
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Episode 25</i>

4
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,740
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

5
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,960
<i>What are you doing?</i>

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,159
I'm in the store.

7
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,189
What's up?

8
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,680
<i>Nothing much.</i>

9
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,560
<i>I just got off from work</i>

10
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,830
<i>and thought I'd call you.</i>

11
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,840
Miss, how much for these books?

12
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,810
Hang on.

13
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,330
Are you a member?

14
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:04,840
Yes.

15
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,440
<i>We have a four for eighty
promotion right now.</i>

16
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,590
<i>We accept digital payment.</i>

17
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,910
Please come again.

18
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,349
How's business?

19
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,200
<i>Pretty good.</i>

20
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,970
By the way,

21
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,560
I organised a reading session
at the store

22
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,120
based on movies.

23
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,400
We had a pretty huge crowd.

24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,680
<i>The reception was fantastic.</i>

25
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,890
<i>The zodiac bookmarks</i>

26
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,750
I designed sold pretty well, too.

27
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm thinking of doing

28
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,600
zodiac themed

29
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,040
hats, socks, t-shirts, and the like.

30
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,190
<i>What's your zodiac?</i>

31
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,229
<i>Wait, let me guess.</i>

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,840
It's...

33
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,110
<i>Meng Zhen.</i>

34
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,040
Let's have a meal this weekend.

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,350
I'll come and fetch you and Xiao Jun.

36
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,960
What's the occasion?

37
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,430
I'd like to introduce you and Xiao Jun

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,550
to my parents.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,190
I want to announce to them

40
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,670
<i>that you're my lover.</i>

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,750
Sure.

42
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,770
Alright.

43
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,110
See you this weekend.

44
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,310
Xiao Jun.

45
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,450
Time for your medicine.

46
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,490
All done?

47
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,910
Mum.

48
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,720
Yes?

49
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,510
Actually, Zhang Yi Chi is alright.

50
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,000
Why are you telling me this?

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,310
He may not be athletic,

52
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,229
but he has a brilliant mind.

53
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,280
A woman should find a clever husband.

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,590
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

55
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,560
What told you that?

56
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,670
It's true.

57
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,870
That's what Xuan Xuan said.

58
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,950
For her sake,

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,790
I must work hard and become
a smart person.

60
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,870
Good. You have my support.

61
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,280
So

62
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,549
it doesn't have to be Daddy Liang?

63
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,410
Liang Mu Ze is my father.

64
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:26,150
Zhang Yi Chi is your husband.

65
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,049
There's no conflict.

66
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,170
What do you mean "husband?"

67
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,630
We're not even past first base.

68
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,070
What are you thinking with that
little head of yours?

69
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,790
About your happiness.

70
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,620
Okay.

71
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,350
I'll try my best to lead a happy life.

72
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,320
Alright?

73
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,290
Alright.

74
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,550
Good boy.

75
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,150
<i>Dr Xia,</i>

76
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,760
<i>I don't know if I'll</i>

77
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,870
<i>survive the infection.</i>

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,950
<i>But there's something</i>

79
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,630
<i>I must tell you.</i>

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,830
<i>The truth is,</i>

81
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,990
<i>I regretted my decision</i>

82
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,720
<i>the moment I swallowed the pesticide.</i>

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,230
<i>I thought I would die for sure.</i>

84
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,630
<i>Thank you for not giving up.</i>

85
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,270
<i>You've prolonged my life.</i>

86
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,350
<i>I never was a brave person.</i>

87
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,670
<i>But my father's passing reminded me</i>

88
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,350
<i>that I must live on.</i>

89
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,510
<i>Not just for myself,</i>

90
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,390
<i>but for the sacrifices he made
for me.</i>

91
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,600
<i>This ordeal at the age of 18
was too painful.</i>

92
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,470
<i>Luckily, I was given a second chance.</i>

93
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,670
<i>The gentle breeze.</i>

94
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,790
<i>The warm sunlight.</i>

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,530
<i>The scent of foliage.</i>

96
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,360
<i>Even the most</i>

97
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,790
<i>minute speckle of dust makes
me feel alive.</i>

98
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,190
<i>If even for one day.</i>

99
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,120
<i>One day is enough.</i>

100
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,880
<i>Dr Xia,</i>

101
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,430
<i>thank you.</i>

102
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,070
<i>Besides "thank you,"</i>

103
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,390
<i>I don't know what else to say.</i>

104
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,150
<i>Thank you.</i>

105
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,270
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,310
<i>Every patient steps into a hospital</i>

107
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,390
<i>with the hopes of getting better.</i>

108
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,559
<i>And every doctor puts on her white coat</i>

109
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,350
<i>with the belief that it is her duty
to cure them.</i>

110
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,550
<i>In the brutal struggle
between life and death,</i>

111
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,990
<i>the patient may be fragile,</i>

112
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>but the doctor must be strong.</i>

113
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,830
<i>We fight against a common enemy,</i>

114
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,030
<i>licking our bleeding wounds</i>

115
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,710
<i>in our respective ways.</i>

116
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,510
<i>We seek victory,</i>

117
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,390
<i>but the possibility of defeat</i>

118
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,030
<i>is ever-present.</i>

119
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,830
<i>Life is full of vicissitudes.</i>

120
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,470
<i>In the face of the light,</i>

121
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,510
<i>what is victory?</i>

122
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,270
<i>One must keep living.</i>

123
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,150
<i>With courage</i>

124
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,510
<i>and passion.</i>

125
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,230
<i>Liu Ran passed away.</i>

126
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,030
Have you met Old Master?

127
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,270
Does he know about the merchandise?

128
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,950
He knew the moment it happened.

129
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,190
And he didn't suspect you?

130
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,110
If I had done it,

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,590
I wouldn't have had the nerve
to see him.

132
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,910
That's what he probably thought.

133
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,670
What's his next move?

134
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,850
He'll let me know

135
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:38,990
when the time comes.

136
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,370
At least

137
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,550
he hasn't shut me off.

138
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,040
That risky move,

139
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,230
whether for you or for me,

140
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,750
was the right move.

141
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:49,950
Whether it's the right move
doesn't depend on what you say

142
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,030
but what you do.

143
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,000
I get it.

144
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,360
I'll cooperate with the cops

145
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,910
from here on out.

146
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,150
As long as I can save my mother.

147
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,750
Good.

148
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,110
How's your arm?

149
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,270
Commander,

150
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,990
it's still weak.

151
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,710
Further check-up is required.

152
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,710
Is that what the doctor said?

153
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,710
I feel I should get it checked.

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,130
Right.

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,290
Go in the afternoon.

156
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,310
Yes, sir!

157
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,290
The rest of you, go back
and recalibrate.

158
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,960
Then assemble at the canteen
for dinner.

159
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,930
Thank you, Commander.

160
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,420
Dismissed.

161
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,140
Tian Yong!

162
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,890
Tian Yong!

163
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,700
Tian Yong!

164
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,980
I knew it,

165
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,170
you're back!

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,540
How did you know Tian Yong
was back?

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,970
Tarot cards.

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,350
You can tell the future
with tarot cards?

169
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,390
Of course.

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,150
Look.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,470
I have four cards here.

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,250
Each represents a question.

173
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,010
Where is Tian Yong?

174
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,330
What is Tian Yong doing?

175
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,290
When is Tian Yong coming back?

176
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,870
That's only three questions.

177
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,830
What's the last one?

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,110
Three and four are pretty
much the same.

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,940
How are they the same?

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,460
They're both single digits.

181
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,670
Okay.

182
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,230
Fine.

183
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,430
Let me ask you,

184
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,930
how did you know Tian Yong was
coming back today?

185
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,330
Well,

186
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,430
I held my breath,

187
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,470
closed my eyes,

188
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,660
and put my hands together.

189
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,110
Focusing my gaze on the card,

190
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,930
I asked my question.

191
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,430
The thoughts in my mind

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,570
coalesce in a confusion of magnetic waves.

193
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,060
Then suddenly,

194
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,630
I heard your wife

195
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,580
coming downstairs with a soldier's wife.

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,420
They said you were coming
back today.

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,460
After all that hocus pocus,

198
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,580
turns out you got it from someone else?

199
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,910
What does it have to do with tarot cards?

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,050
Nothing.

201
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,860
Then why did you bring out
the tarot cards?

202
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,030
Foreshadowing.

203
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,510
It's a performance device
in ancient oral literature.

204
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,270
The tarot cards are meant to
arouse the audience's interest

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,660
and serve as a prelude to
the main message.

206
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,810
You scared me.

207
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,820
Commander.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Quit talking nonsense.

209
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,660
What's it to you?

210
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,110
Easy there.

211
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,300
Are you injured?

212
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,300
Keep an eye on her.

213
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,270
Yes.

214
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,660
How did my brother get injured?

215
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,980
What do you think of my
foreshadowing?

216
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,580
Don't hit your brother so hard next time.

217
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,900
Let's go.

218
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,330
Commander, I'll send her home
right now.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,790
Is it just me

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,420
or am I getting old?

221
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,670
I couldn't understand a word

222
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,300
your cousin was saying.

223
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,890
Oh no. I don't get her, either.

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,410
Neither does the rest of my family.

225
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
Really?

226
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,930
You said Tian Yong

227
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,490
is not compatible with your cousin.

228
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,860
Indeed,

229
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,140
Tang Yong is an ancient literature buff.

230
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,290
If the two of them get together,

231
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,410
they'd have trouble communicating.

232
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,490
They're not right for each other.

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,340
Not necessarily, Commander.

234
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,860
Of all the ways youngsters
communicate today,

235
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,090
language is the least significant.

236
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,630
Really?

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,260
Isn't that a good thing?

238
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,660
Yeah.

239
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,700
I still don't get it.

240
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,490
Why are you still here?

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,180
To keep you company.

242
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,410
Don't you find the camp boring?

243
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,580
It is boring.

244
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,460
So why don't you go?

245
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,900
Because I want to keep
you company.

246
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,290
This mission

247
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,780
is very dangerous, isn't it?

248
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,610
No.

249
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,860
You're lying.

250
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,170
My brother hasn't had
an injury in ages.

251
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,720
Did you guys

252
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,770
kill?

253
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,730
What did it feel like?

254
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,560
"A hundred battles have worn
my armour down."

255
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,440
"Yet I won't return until
the enemy is defeated."

256
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,010
Wang Chang Ling's

257
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,850
"Conquering the Distant City,"

258
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,530
poem four of seven?

259
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,250
That's right.

260
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,340
You know something?

261
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,850
While you were gone,

262
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,130
I've been poring over that book
you gave me.

263
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,460
For a girl of 21,

264
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,370
memorising 300 Tang poems

265
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,050
is a great feat.

266
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,930
You've worked hard.

267
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,250
Then there's my AMBD.

268
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,500
What's that?

269
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,680
You know ADHD?

270
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,070
Yes.

271
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,330
If left untreated

272
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,280
until adolescence,

273
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,130
it'll become what's known as

274
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,920
autoimmune mucocutaneous
blistering disease.

275
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,730
You mean

276
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,370
something's wrong with your brain?

277
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,840
Can't you tell?

278
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,800
I think you're very smart.

279
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,880
I think so, too.

280
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,160
But

281
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,780
I can't concentrate

282
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,530
for more than five minutes.

283
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,320
I'm always getting lost.

284
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,140
I'd talk to you one second

285
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,080
and fall asleep the next.

286
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,930
But despite the difficulties,

287
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,650
I still memorised the poems for you.

288
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,360
Do you know

289
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,690
what this means?

290
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,960
Wait here.

291
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,680
Tian Yong!

292
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,730
Where are you going?

293
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,860
For me?

294
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,700
Yes.

295
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,370
Why an hourglass?

296
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,780
Since you can only concentrate

297
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,120
for five minutes at a time,

298
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,730
it means

299
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,080
you should raise your

300
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,080
memorising efficiency
within a five-minute duration.

301
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,600
The hourglass empties in five minutes.

302
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,890
You can use it to time yourself.

303
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,680
Set yourself little targets.

304
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,890
Such as...

305
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,330
I said those things to you

306
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,130
not because I wanted to discuss
how to study poetry.

307
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,090
Yes.

308
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,120
That's right. Not just poetry.

309
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,460
It can also help you

310
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,500
keep track

311
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,840
of your life.

312
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,360
And make you more aware.

313
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,850
What's the matter?

314
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:13,850
I'm thinking.

315
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,960
About what?

316
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,530
Whether you'll kiss me in the
next five minutes.

317
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,570
I won't.

318
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,210
I swear on my code of conduct,

319
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,410
not just in the camp,

320
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,940
but even the remote wilderness,

321
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,120
that I will not.

322
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,130
You can trust me 100 percent.

323
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,300
Really,

324
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,600
it's a matter of principles.

325
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,090
Then do you...

326
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,810
Do you

327
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,890
want

328
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,880
to taste

329
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,250
my lipstick?

330
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,730
It contains lead.

331
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll get poisoned.

332
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,860
Tian Yong!

333
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,830
Here!

334
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,580
Does your phone have any romantic songs?

335
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,730
Play them.

336
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,780
Now?

337
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes.

338
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,130
Are you sure?

339
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,330
You'd better hurry.

340
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,000
Look into my eyes.

341
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,560
What do you see

342
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,320
in my eyes?

343
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,690
Mum...

344
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,290
Mum...

345
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,040
Reporting in!

346
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,940
Captain,

347
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,060
Captain Rao Zhi of the
City Security Bureau

348
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,370
wants you to have this.

349
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,380
Thanks.

Friend, are you done crying?

353
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,050
Sorry.

354
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,200
Thanks.

355
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,570
I can't stand that song.

356
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,970
So why did you play it?

357
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,490
It's the only song in my phone.

358
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,570
You were asking for it, then.

359
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm an orphan.

360
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,090
I grew up in a children's home.

361
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,040
I was adopted once.

362
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,290
But because I wouldn't speak,

363
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,010
I was sent back.

364
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,480
After that,

365
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,920
I joined the army at 18.

366
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,490
At first, I just wanted to
make a living.

367
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,890
But after I came here,

368
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,730
I never wanted to leave.

369
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,200
What about your parents?

370
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,000
I have no idea.

371
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,050
This hourglass

372
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,860
and the "300 Tang Poems"

373
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,120
I gave you

374
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,690
are the only pieces of memory
I have left of them.

375
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,880
Do you hate them?

376
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,930
I do.

377
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,370
How could I not?

378
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,160
A part of me hates them,

379
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,570
but a part of me wishes to see them

380
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,730
in my dreams.

381
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,130
Although in my dreams,

382
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,520
I never get to see their faces clearly,

383
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,450
they're always leaving me

384
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,850
or passing away.

385
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,010
Every time, it ends with me

386
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,650
waking up in tears.

387
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,560
If only I can see them in a dream one day,

388
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,530
I'd be

389
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,960
content.

390
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,450
Actually, I'm the same as you.

391
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,740
You?

392
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,330
Although I'm not an orphan,

393
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,970
nor did I grow up
in a children's home,

394
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,240
I seldom get to see my parents.

395
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,810
They're always busy.

396
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,080
Or

397
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,130
they just don't want to see me.

398
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,360
Why wouldn't they?

399
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you know why I adopted the parrot?

400
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,370
I was sexually assaulted.

401
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,650
I was 13.

402
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,050
I went to a doctor, did the examinations.

403
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,810
Then my mum brought me to the US.

404
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,050
Perhaps in my parent's eyes

405
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm like a tumour,

406
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,880
constantly reminding them of their
failure as parents.

407
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,050
I destroyed their marriage.

408
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,770
I made them feel insecure
and frustrated.

409
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,170
That's why I like to wear quirky outfits

410
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,250
and put on quirky makeups.

411
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,130
I want them to hate me.

412
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,090
To hate me so much
that they can't ignore me.

413
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,170
My brother says I'm dumb.

414
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,520
What do you think?

415
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,850
It seems I am kind of dumb.

416
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,200
So dumb that I can only
make friends with a parrot.

417
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,600
I talk to it every day.

418
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,770
When I cuss at someone,
it'd cuss at that person, too.

419
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,500
It never questions me,

420
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,930
nor does it know right from wrong.

421
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,010
It's always on my side.

422
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,530
Ever since I had it,

423
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,250
I realised

424
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,330
I can face this miserable world

425
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,680
with a smile.

426
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,730
Yes, it's dumb.

427
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,760
But it's also useful.

428
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,040
Isn't that right?

429
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,040
Xiao Xue.

430
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,020
I wanted

431
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,300
to tell you this

432
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,970
after our kiss.

433
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,090
But then you played that song

434
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,920
and told a story that's sadder
than mine.

435
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,890
I couldn't take it.

436
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Do you know

437
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,800
why I'm giving you the parrot?

438
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,760
Because your kindness

439
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,320
will make it forget its anger

440
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,720
and become a better version of itself.

441
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,440
Tian Yong.

442
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,490
All those poems must've messed
with your head.

443
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,410
You don't understand anything.

444
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,770
I do.

445
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,020
<i>Not only will kidnapping Xia Chu</i>

446
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,580
<i>teach Liang Mu Ze a lesson,</i>

447
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,570
it'll also force Xia Guang Yuan
to cooperate.

448
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,200
<i>Given the groundwork you've laid
with the girl and her father,</i>

449
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,080
<i>this should be a cinch.</i>

450
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,200
Xia Chu, it's me.

451
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,980
What's up?

452
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,300
<i>Let's meet up.</i>

453
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,680
Sorry.

454
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,950
<i>At the Japanese restaurant
opposite your hospital.</i>

455
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,710
I booked a private room.

456
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,220
See you there.

457
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,740
Zhuo Ran...

458
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,160
<i>Rao</i>

459
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,030
<i>Did you ask Xia Chu out?</i>

460
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,490
Yes.

461
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,910
What do you want?

462
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,630
Don't you know how I feel about Xia Chu?

463
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,780
I'll send someone to protect her.

464
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,940
Don't try anything funny.

465
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,020
Li Lei, come here for second.

466
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,250
Dr Zhang.

467
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,280
You're here.

468
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,660
Where is Xia Chu?

469
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,180
She's on leave today.

470
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,430
What's the hurry?

471
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,300
Can you give me a ride
after work?

472
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,860
I'd like to visit Xiao Jun.

473
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,710
You want me to give you a ride?

474
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,350
It's a little out of the way.

475
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,230
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Meng Zhen

476
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,540
and Xiao Jun tonight.

477
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,860
I'm going to introduce them
to my parents.

478
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
Your parents...

479
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,750
There's no need to worry.

480
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,780
I know what you're thinking.

481
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,440
Relax.

482
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,870
I know what kind of women

483
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,430
I should get involved with

484
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,460
and what kind of women
I shouldn't.

485
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,560
Since I got involved with Meng Zhen,

486
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,760
I'll go all the way.

487
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,250
Trust me.

488
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,370
Take good care of them.

489
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,000
Zhuo Ran.

490
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,990
Zhuo Ran.

491
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,720
Zhuo Ran.

492
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,320
What do you see?

493
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,540
Zhuo Ran.

494
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,900
That's right.

495
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,400
It's our past.

496
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,010
Let go of me, Zhuo Ran.

497
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,600
And our future.

498
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,560
Let go.

499
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,400
How have you been?

500
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,320
Pretty good.

501
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,540
And you?

502
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,020
I'm

503
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,160
doing okay myself.

504
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,700
Everything

505
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,680
is coming together as I planned.

506
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,730
My predicament will soon be over.

507
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,640
When it's finally over,

508
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,010
will you

509
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,080
give me another chance?

510
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,440
Did you ask me out

511
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,010
just to give me

512
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,600
this ridiculous speech?

513
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,000
Did you?

514
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,680
I want to make up

515
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,280
for what the old Zhuo Ran did.

516
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,260
When he saw the environment
you grew up in,

517
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,960
he shrank.

518
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,600
He couldn't confront the pain
of loss

519
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,000
and chose to run away.

520
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,960
He was a fool.

521
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,810
So I came back.

522
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,640
I want to show him

523
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,600
that I can do

524
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,440
what he couldn't.

525
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,370
I can fit in with your family.

526
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,920
I can give you the life you want.

527
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,140
Xia Chu.

528
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,000
The past eight years have not
been in vain.

529
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,320
Finally, I can do this.

530
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,480
But I can't.

531
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,880
You planted the listening device

532
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,560
in Liang Mu Ze's house, didn't you?

533
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,720
Mi Gu never told you

534
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,560
that I stayed in Liang Mu Ze's house.

535
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,730
You lied to me.

536
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,740
Yes.

537
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,680
I stalked you.

538
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,800
And not just once.

539
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,200
I know I'm being ridiculous

540
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,260
but I can't help myself

541
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,480
but to know everything about you.

542
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,120
To make up for the eight years
that we've lost.

543
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,410
Xia Chu.

544
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,960
The stalking,

545
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,690
the listening device,

546
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,329
it was all me.

547
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,360
But I won't apologise.

548
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,750
<i>Braised Egg</i>

549
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,559
What are you doing?

550
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,880
Liang Mu Ze.

551
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,240
Where are you?

552
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,930
In the Japanese restaurant
opposite the hospital.

553
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,889
I'm just kidding.

554
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,559
It's not funny at all.

555
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,680
Are you worried whether he's mad?

556
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:00,720
Don't bring him into this.

557
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,650
Zhuo Ran, you disrespected me.

558
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,890
I did?

559
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,420
Yeah, who do you think you are?

560
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,240
Who let you answer my call?

561
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,200
How do you think Liang Mu Ze
will react?

562
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,170
I don't want to think about it.

563
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,810
How he reacts has nothing
to do with you.

564
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,520
But you do.

565
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,330
If he could hang up on you

566
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,130
at the sound of my voice,

567
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,130
is he any different

568
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,260
from the Zhuo Ran who
abandoned you eight years ago?

569
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,610
Do you want to make the
same mistake again?

570
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,720
Enough!

571
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,810
Let me send you home.

572
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,050
No, I'll walk.

573
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,200
Calm down.

574
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,050
I'm very calm right now.

575
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,060
It's you who's too presumptuous.

576
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,040
Look,

577
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
when you left,

578
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,970
I was a little fazed

579
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,370
by the loss

580
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,730
of an old friend at first

581
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,860
and went through a rough patch.

582
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,400
But later, I enrolled
in the Military Medical University

583
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,170
and made many new friends.

584
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Studying, dating,

585
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,210
extracurriculars,

586
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
I did it all.

587
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,290
I got by just fine.

588
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,850
I wasn't as pathetic as you thought.

589
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,930
I'm not some lovesick damsel

590
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,180
waiting for your rescue.

591
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,740
I won't give up

592
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,440
just because my first relationship failed.

593
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,330
Not in the past,

594
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,140
not now,

595
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,360
not ever.

596
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,080
As for Liang Mu Ze,

597
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,410
I love him.

598
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,410
If he takes your "hi"

599
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,450
the wrong way,

600
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,610
and things don't work out,

601
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,680
it doesn't mean you and I
will go back to the way we were.

602
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,640
The past is in the past.

603
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,530
I've moved on from my
18-year-old life.

604
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,370
Even if it wasn't perfect,

605
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,960
I don't want to live it again.

606
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,420
I live for the present

607
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,680
and the future.

608
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,200
My relationships

609
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,620
should be decided by me,

610
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,370
not you.

611
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,600
The reason I came here

612
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,170
is to make myself clear

613
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,960
to you once and for all.

614
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,880
Do you understand?

615
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,600
Liang... Liang Mu Ze.

616
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,120
What are you doing here?

617
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,360
I'm here to fetch you.

618
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,760
Let's go.

619
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,120
But we haven't gotten
to the eel rice yet.

620
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,650
It's your favourite, Xia Chu.

621
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,320
I no longer like eel rice.

622
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,440
Please let go of me.

623
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,840
In that case,

624
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,720
we'll go back to our normal lives.

625
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,400
When did you come back?

626
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,640
Did you see my message?

627
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,200
Can you slow down, Liang Mu Ze?

628
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,160
Liang Mu Ze.

629
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,240
I know you're mad at me.

630
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,240
You didn't like me meeting up
with Zhuo Ran, did you?

631
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,020
Don't deny it.

632
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,680
I know that's what you're thinking.

633
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,480
You're hurting my hand.

634
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,320
I met up with him

635
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,120
not because I couldn't
get over him

636
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,970
but because I did.

637
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,370
I wanted to set the record straight

638
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,840
so he would let go, too.

639
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,200
In any case,

640
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,600
I loved him before.

641
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,560
Since we came together on good terms,

642
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,320
we should part ways on good terms.

643
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,880
Because we may never
see each other again.

644
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,240
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

645
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,410
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

646
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,660
Why don't we go to this restaurant?

647
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,340
Sure.

648
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,360
Why is she on the ground?

649
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,440
Are they having a fight?

650
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,640
Don't mind them.

651
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,000
Get up.

652
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,960
I can't walk. I don't want to walk.

653
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,480
Liu Ran passed away, do you know that?

654
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,680
The lung transplant was a success,

655
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,400
but the infection got to her.

656
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,160
All the doctors

657
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,450
stood by and watched her
drift into sleep.

658
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,650
There was nothing they could do.

659
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,160
Nothing.

660
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,320
It was totally hopeless.

661
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,330
Don't cry.

662
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Have you any idea

663
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,000
what I've been through
the last few days?

664
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,820
I was so sleepy

665
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,020
but I couldn't sleep.

666
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,360
I kept seeing her in my dreams.

667
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,130
She even thanked me,

668
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,570
as if I deserved it.

669
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,090
I couldn't help her.

670
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,680
I couldn't do a thing.

671
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,780
Being a doctor is so hard.

672
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,660
Everything is one big confusion.

673
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,090
It's so tiresome.

674
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,960
There, there.

675
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,130
Come.

676
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,320
Get up.

677
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,500
Why?

678
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,610
You said you couldn't walk.

679
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,960
I'll carry you on my back.

680
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,080
Are you sure?

681
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,240
Come on.

682
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,360
Is something wrong?

683
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,600
Nothing. You're a little heavy,
that's all.

684
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,640
Just kidding. Hold tight.

685
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,290
Hold tight.

686
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,650
You have a stubble.

687
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,160
It's time to shave.

688
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,800
I'll do it when I get back.

689
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,000
Your ears are red.

690
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,200
They're freezing.

691
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,240
Let me blow on them.

692
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,520
That's enough.

693
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,090
I see so many documentaries

694
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,340
of this calibre every year.

695
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,050
They're all

696
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,300
too dramatic.

697
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,640
There's no subtlety.

698
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,640
What do you think?

699
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,280
<i>Zhuo Ran</i>

700
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,400
Perhaps the closer I am
to their lives,

701
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,400
the hardest it is for me to take
an objective view.

702
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,130
Amateur.

703
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,440
What did you say?

704
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,840
She said you're very honest.

705
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,200
That's right.

706
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,800
<i>Zhuo Ran</i>

707
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,520
Excuse me, I have to
take a call.

708
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,050
Zhuo Ran, listen here.

709
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,380
I'm having a gathering with my friends.

710
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,570
I have my own life and career.

711
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,170
I can't be at your beck and call

712
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,100
24-7.

713
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,290
I'm not some maid

714
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,850
that you can order around at will.

715
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,880
I detest this kind of relationship.

716
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,760
Say something.

717
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,760
<i>Every saint has a past.</i>

718
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,000
<i>Every sinner has a future.</i>

719
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,970
<i>Isn't that right,</i>

720
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,940
<i>Mi Gu?</i>

721
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,360
What's with you?

722
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,900
Why are you telling me this?

723
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,040
<i>I'm in the hotel.</i>

724
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,100
<i>Are you coming?</i>

725
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,440
No.

726
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,890
My party has just started.

727
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,120
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

728
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,720
Had your phone call?

729
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,040
Yes.

730
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,440
By the way, we just broke out
a bottle of wine.

731
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,680
It's pretty good.

732
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,640
Shall we go inside and taste it?

733
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,960
Come on.

734
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,490
No, thanks.

735
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,570
You guys go ahead.

736
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,050
You came.

737
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,360
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

738
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,920
I don't feel like it.

739
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,720
What's wrong?

740
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,280
Why are you drinking so heavily?

741
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,940
I thought I had to wait all night for you.

742
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,180
Was the party fun?

743
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,260
Sure.

744
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,340
A group of beautiful, intelligent
men and women,

745
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,220
sipping their
ten-thousand-dollar-a-bottle wine,

746
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,620
musing over

747
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,140
topics of social justice

748
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,020
and equality.

749
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,780
They pretend to stand up
for the underprivileged.

750
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,420
But I assure you,

751
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,180
those people

752
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,470
haven't the slightest clue

753
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,500
what life is really like.

754
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,430
Not once have they

755
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,220
considered stepping out of

756
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,020
the extravagant,

757
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:35,860
highly intellectual,

758
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,230
cultural elitist,

759
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,020
and socially superior little bubble.

760
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,820
I watched them

761
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,220
descend into their own
self-indulgent world,

762
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,740
their faces immaculate and pompous.

763
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,580
Do you think it was fun?

764
00:47:56,464 --> 00:48:26,464
