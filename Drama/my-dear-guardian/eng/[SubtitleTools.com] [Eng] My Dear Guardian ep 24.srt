3
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,470
<i>Episode 24</i>

4
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,170
A good young man is wooing.

5
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:51,810
A fair maiden he loves.

6
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,330
Who am I?

7
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,370
Who am I?

8
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,190
Xue.

9
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,040
Fortunately, you didn't bump your head.

10
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,960
Why are you here?

11
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
You're here to visit
Master Le Tian?

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,370
I want to hear you read poetry.

13
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,300
I tried to call you but
couldn't get through.

14
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,020
And I don't have any
other form of contact.

15
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,490
I didn't want to write you a letter

16
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,610
so I could only come here in person.

17
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,729
What do you want to listen?

18
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll read it for you.

19
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,770
Actually,

20
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,760
after meeting you,

21
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,330
I find that I don't want
you to read me the poetry.

22
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,330
Then what do you want?

23
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,610
I want to date you.

24
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,330
The... My... Where're my shoes?

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,060
They are here.

26
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,210
Where are my shoes?

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,140
Thank you.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,670
Right.

29
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,930
Where are the others?

30
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,380
They're in training.

31
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,690
They're in training, right?

32
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,970
Where are they training?

33
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,370
I guess they're on the field.

34
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,690
Tian Yong, wait for me!

35
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,370
Why do you do this again?

36
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,240
The suspect had evacuated when the

37
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,800
police and I reached the scene.

38
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,020
The police are
currently searching for him.

39
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,330
Why is your cousin only one here?

40
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,410
What about Xia Chu?

41
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,470
She couldn't come.

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,870
I'll call her hospital.

43
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,450
She is not used to living
in the military camp.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,880
Moreover, she can't leave her work behind.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,440
What to do?

46
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,970
She's alone out there.

47
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,840
Aren't you worried?

48
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,970
I asked Rao Zhi to

49
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,370
send someone to look after her.

50
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,050
And she should be
fine as she's staying

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,120
in the hospital in these days.

52
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,260
Okay, then.

53
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,390
Right,

54
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,180
have you told Xia Chu about her

55
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,609
first love visiting the

56
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,650
police station?

57
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,660
No.

58
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,440
I don't want to stress her out.

59
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:27,880
Okay.

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,150
Don't go so fast.

61
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,290
I just confessed to you.

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,490
Why are you so
vulnerable to confession?

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,130
Just walk slowly, it's not like
I'm going to eat you.

64
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,520
Liang Shao Xue!

65
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,620
Brigade Commander, Captain!

66
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,670
Mu Ze, persuade him for me.

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Persuade him on what?

68
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,440
She wants to persuade me
to get some rest.

69
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,150
No!

70
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,850
Persuade him to date me.

71
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,150
What?

72
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,010
Who are you?

73
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,270
Who am I?

74
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm the Brigade Commander.

75
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,520
Is his rank higher than yours?

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,670
Don't embarrass yourself, okay?

77
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,930
Brigade Commander,
help me to persuade him.

78
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,370
You want me to persuade him to date you?

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,130
What's the reason?

80
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,610
I'm outstanding!

81
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,850
Liang Shao Xue!

82
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,670
Let her continue.

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,690
I'm starting to wonder how outstanding

84
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,300
this young lady is.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,290
Say it.

86
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,760
Actually,

87
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,940
about being outstanding,

88
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,690
most of the time,
it's a kind of self-perception.

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,850
More like a delusion.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,400
Are you really my brother?

91
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,670
Tian Yong,

92
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,620
do you like this kind of feeling?

93
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,650
Comrade Liang Shao Xue,

94
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,870
stop messing around.

95
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,990
I'm not messing with you.

96
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,700
I really do like you.

97
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,380
I want to be with you.

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,610
Are you not going to stop?

99
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,900
Report!

100
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,870
Speak.

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,080
I want to take half an hour off!

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,570
Where are you going?

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm going to the Martyrs Cemetery,

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,770
with comrade Liang Shao Xue.

105
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,130
They...

106
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,760
This is the Martyrs Cemetery.

107
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,070
They

108
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,640
are the predecessors and
comrades of our army

109
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,670
who had sacrificed
over the past few decades.

110
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,420
<i>Martyr Luo Liang</i>

111
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:45,740
This is the former captain

112
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,840
of mine and your brother,

113
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,309
Luo Liang.

114
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,590
He was born in 1986.

115
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,740
He's young.

116
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,720
Was he married?

117
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,580
He had a child

118
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,010
that lost his father
before he was born.

119
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,690
Sister-in-law has been

120
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,690
raising him all these years.

121
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,850
She runs a book store.

122
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,750
It's hard for her.

123
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,210
But this is her own choice.

124
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,930
At the moment she chose this man,

125
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,230
she had already prepared for the worst.

126
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,410
Xue,

127
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,570
you don't understand.

128
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,760
I understand.

129
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,690
Are you not trying to tell me that

130
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,600
you have a dangerous job

131
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,580
so that I can give up on you?

132
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,450
Aren't you afraid after
seeing these tombstones?

133
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,809
I'm not afraid.

134
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,450
When I was studying in Paris,

135
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,290
there was a graveyard
beside the neighbourhood.

136
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,730
People will have a walk there
after having dinner

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,850
and chat with their deceased relatives.

138
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,580
The graveyard at sunset

139
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,610
is the most beautiful moment in a day.

140
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,850
Just like now.

141
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,070
Why me?

142
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,150
Because you worship soldiers?

143
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,810
I hate men in uniforms

144
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,290
before I met you.

145
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,520
They could be someone's son,

146
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,050
husband

147
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,490
and father.

148
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,040
But after putting on the uniform,

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,650
all that is left is the role

150
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,120
behind the uniform.

151
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,950
They didn't look like
themselves anymore.

152
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,890
Then you shouldn't like me.

153
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,850
I have nothing left except

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,120
this military uniform.

155
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,600
But you care about my loneliness,

156
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,350
happiness and safety.

157
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,480
You care about my vulnerability

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,790
that others couldn't see.

159
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,890
That meant more
than everything put together.

160
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,290
Tian Yong,

161
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,650
death can't confine our affection,

162
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,850
it can't scare me either.

163
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,770
Death can't scare you, right?

164
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,010
Right.

165
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay.

166
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,430
<i>Three Hundred Tang poems</i>

167
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,650
What about this?

168
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,660
What do you mean?

169
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,720
You're back.

170
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,490
What is this?

171
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,840
You rejected my

172
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,780
little sister?

173
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,810
No.

174
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,630
I just told her

175
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,090
to understand my spiritual world

176
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,380
by memorizing
Three Hundred Tang Poems

177
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,390
before deciding whether
she likes me or not.

178
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,560
You ask her to memorize
Three Hundred Tang Poems?

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,940
You ask a classic literature
illiterate who can't tell

180
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,390
Li Bai from Du Fu to

181
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,040
memorize Three Hundred Tang Poems.

182
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,700
You're not rejecting her

183
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,930
but humiliating her!

184
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,030
I don't believe that
I'm worse than a parrot!

185
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,490
Is that your book?

186
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,550
The book you sleep with?

187
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,130
Yes.

188
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,300
You gave it to her?

189
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,880
I had no choice.

190
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,680
How did she force you?

191
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,960
She didn't force me.

192
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,510
Just that

193
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,260
something strange would happen

194
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,080
every time I came across
character with radical of female

195
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,270
when I was reading this book recently.

196
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,270
Every radical of female

197
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,640
would turn into her face.

198
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,230
Captain,

199
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,470
if I have no strange disease,

200
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,480
this only shows that

201
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,000
she is fated with the book.

202
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,010
Tian Yong.

203
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,330
Tian Yong.

204
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,480
Captain!

205
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,210
I can't control my feelings.

206
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,730
But I guarantee that

207
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,640
my every thought

208
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,520
begins with affection

209
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,860
and ends with virtue.

210
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,850
It's definitely pure.

211
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,520
Tian Yong.

212
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,580
Tian Yong!

213
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,090
Take care.

214
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,490
Take care?

215
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,690
You can stay here

216
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,570
but we need to have an agreement.

217
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,900
You need to follow the rules.

218
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,940
Like what? What are the rules?

219
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,730
For example,

220
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,780
you must not mess with Tian Yong.

221
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,330
Why?

222
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,000
What why? Sit down!

223
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,180
You're back for vacation, right?

224
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,760
You'll return to the
United States after the vacation.

225
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
Is it appropriate to
date Tian Yong at this point?

226
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,530
It will work if he likes me.

227
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,620
And then?

228
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,710
And then we'll be together.

229
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,970
How can you guys be together?

230
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,450
The Pacific Ocean separates you two

231
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,080
and you're 12 hours apart.

232
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,220
Then I can stay in China

233
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,730
or take him back to the United States.

234
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,200
He's on active duty.

235
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,450
What do you mean
back to the United States?

236
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,900
Won't he be discharged?

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,290
I can wait for him.

238
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,570
You wait for him?

239
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,530
How many times have you guys met?

240
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,970
Three times.

241
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,140
You just met him three times
and you want to wait for him?

242
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,540
It's normal to have
love at first sight,

243
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,370
why is it abnormal to wait for him
after meeting him three times?

244
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,920
Can you sit down?

245
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,370
Xue, let me tell you.

246
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,360
Tian Yong has been reading that

247
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,090
Three Hundred Tang poems
every day

248
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,060
since I first met him.

249
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,640
I asked him if he'd get tired of it.

250
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,840
He said he could read
this book for his entire life.

251
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,320
Look at you!

252
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,590
You had no fewer than

253
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,460
50 interest classes since childhood.

254
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,260
How many times have you changed

255
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,570
your major through
your four years of college?

256
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,900
You always act first, think later.

257
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,210
You only have a three-minute
passion for everything.

258
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,650
You said you like Tian Yong.

259
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,080
I think you're just being impulsive.

260
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,300
You even want to wait for him?

261
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,400
I don't believe that.

262
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,690
So that's how you see me?

263
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,740
I tell you what.

264
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,060
Lacking self-awareness is

265
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,120
the biggest obstacle in growing up.

266
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,210
I say that applies to you too.

267
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,930
Don't disagree with me.

268
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,660
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you what.

269
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,770
I'm being serious with you.

270
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,840
You don't think it's love because
we've only met a few times.

271
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,020
You think the geography and time
difference are the obstacles of love.

272
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,110
You think love

273
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,220
only exists when on the same land.

274
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,450
You're wrong!

275
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,880
I tell you what.

276
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,220
Your biggest mistake is

277
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,090
to foist your cognition on me.

278
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,890
Just like Aunt
foist her cognition on you.

279
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,980
Congratulations, brother!

280
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,380
You eventually
turned into the kind of adult

281
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,050
you used to hate
when you were little.

282
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,290
But it's your business, not mine.

283
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,970
Based on my cognition as a 21-year-old,

284
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,680
love is just love.

285
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,750
Everything else means nothing.

286
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,260
So

287
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,140
Just because

288
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,970
you dare not doesn't mean I don't dare.

289
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,080
Nothing is immutable.

290
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,710
Not love

291
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,720
nor my personality.

292
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,410
As for the variables,

293
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,010
you don't have a say,

294
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,500
neither do I.

295
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,370
But

296
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,320
right now, I want to date him.

297
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,690
Xue,

298
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,370
listen to me.

299
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,570
Tian Yong

300
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,980
is not as happy as he looks
on the surface,

301
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,250
get it?

302
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,280
You are not as strong as you seem.

303
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,640
So you have be more
discreet about this.

304
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,350
You have to reconsider it.

305
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,690
This is very important.

306
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,160
Tian Yong is not someone
you can flirt with.

307
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,470
Right?

308
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,320
It's unacceptable

309
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,650
to me in either side.

310
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,170
What's that sound?
I'm talking to you.

311
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,380
You just envy me!

312
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,600
Why would I envy you?

313
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,000
Of course you'd envy me.

314
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,570
You're envious that me and Tian Yong

315
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,730
are determined to stay together
throughout all eternity.

316
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,250
But your Dr Xia

317
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,580
only puts her heart and soul
in her medical career.

318
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,190
You're no match

319
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,500
to even a pinky finger.

320
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,790
Okay.

321
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,260
If Tian Yong still likes
you after wrapping

322
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,290
his head around that,

323
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,630
I'll read my name backward.

324
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,020
What's wrong with that?

325
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,940
He'll like me.

326
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,100
He should like me.

327
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm so cute.

328
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,850
Moreover, we...

329
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,740
We...

330
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,280
<i>Can you stay by her
side for 24 hours a day?</i>

331
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,870
<i>When I show up on her side,</i>

332
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,520
<i>what can you do for her</i>

333
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,280
<i>as you're in the military camp?</i>

334
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,400
Hello.

335
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,380
<i>Hello, Uncle Rao.</i>

336
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,590
Xue came to my unit.

337
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,650
You don't have to worry.

338
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,160
<i>I know.</i>

339
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,570
How did you know?

340
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,280
I installed a tracking
program on her phone.

341
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,500
<i>Really?</i>

342
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,930
Here's the thing.

343
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,970
<i>Peng Fei and Xiao Qiang are
guarding at the hospital.</i>

344
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,890
<i>Xia Chu is currently fine.</i>

345
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,070
<i>You can rest assured.</i>

346
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,490
<i>And</i>

347
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,130
<i>we found through street surveillance</i>

348
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,560
<i>that Long Yi had fled to the border.</i>

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,760
We already informed
the frontier armed police

350
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,850
to cooperate in the manhunt.

351
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,310
But so far,

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,540
we've got nothing.

353
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,280
What about Zhuo Ran?

354
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,600
Is he still at the police station?

355
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,340
No,

356
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,310
he's in the detention centre.

357
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,009
We'll take him to the police station

358
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,310
when we need to talk to him.

359
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,460
<i>Uncle Rao,</i>

360
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,820
did he explain

361
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,249
why Long Yi came after Xia Chu?

362
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:24,070
<i>He said he didn't know why.</i>

363
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,530
Do you believe that

364
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,729
he's innocent in T4

365
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,969
criminal chain?

366
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,940
Of course I don't.

367
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,860
This is not my first day as a police.

368
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,610
I've seen many deceptive

369
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,160
criminals with
antisocial personality disorder.

370
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,480
<i>They will go to any lengths</i>

371
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,950
<i>to achieve their objectives.</i>

372
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,430
<i>There must be a deeper reason</i>

373
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,940
<i>why that man named Old Master</i>

374
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,170
<i>went to such lengths for Xia Chu.</i>

375
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,510
One thing's for certain.

376
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,770
The division within T4

377
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,760
is getting deeper as Zhuo Ran

378
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,790
chose to cooperate with us

379
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,560
<i>at this point.</i>

380
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>That Old Master
behind this organization</i>

381
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,270
<i>must be related to the</i>

382
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,700
<i>murders of Sang Kun and Gui.</i>

383
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,730
We don't care about
Zhuo Ran's intention.

384
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,750
Our intention is to find

385
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,000
the murderer and
establish the truth.

386
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,970
Since he wants to use the police,

387
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,950
in return, we can use him as well.

388
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,060
Okay,

389
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,610
as long as you know what you're doing.

390
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,330
Uncle Rao,

391
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,970
I want to ask for a favour.

392
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,670
Go ahead.

393
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,750
Can you get me a tracker which you

394
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,670
installed for Xue?

395
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,240
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

396
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,150
We should just eat out.

397
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,200
Never mind.

398
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,000
Just eat at the canteen.

399
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,010
There's no much left
in the canteen at this time.

400
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,800
We shouldn't eat so full at dinner.

401
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,820
People used to say,

402
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,900
it's better to dine like

403
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,090
a pauper.

404
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,900
Okay, you guys

405
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,300
have been very tense these days.

406
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,780
That's all for me,

407
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,780
you guys can go.

408
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,090
Okay, go ahead.

409
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,020
Okay.

410
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,130
-Yi Chi,
-Yes.

411
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,780
keep the former
leader company for us.

412
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,970
Rest assured.

413
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,740
Okay, then we'll leave first.

414
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,220
Okay.

415
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,960
Thank you.

416
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,760
You've worked hard.

417
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,340
Take care.

418
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,430
Well, sir,

419
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,350
this way, please.

420
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,310
Okay.

421
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,460
You brat.

422
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,890
Enough, let's go.

423
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,170
The resuscitation of this patient with

424
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,950
paraquat poisoning is a valuable case.

425
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,620
You have to summarize the

426
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,780
problems encountered in

427
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,580
the operation and
treatment procedures.

428
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,320
It would be nice to
write them up after that.

429
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,180
I have no time to write papers.

430
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,170
Moreover,

431
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,030
my theoretical level is limited.

432
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,640
That's why I leave it to Xia Chu

433
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,120
and another resident.

434
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,720
Please recommend it

435
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,300
when the paper is completed.

436
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,270
Okay.

437
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,150
Xia Chu is a sweet girl.

438
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,260
You're right.

439
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,220
She is not only pretty

440
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,040
but smart too.

441
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,360
The most important is

442
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,720
her ability.

443
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,950
Do you like her?

444
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,050
Of course I do.

445
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,520
I like a smart and

446
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,360
hardworking resident like her.

447
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,590
I mean outside the professional realm.

448
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,900
Don't make a crazy match.

449
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,280
I just cherish

450
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,770
Xia Chu's talent.

451
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,080
There's no love sentiment.

452
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,580
Mainly,

453
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,180
she is not my cup of tea.

454
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,580
I think you've tried many types

455
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,190
but still haven't found
the one that fits your taste.

456
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,210
Dad,

457
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,820
to be honest with you.

458
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,250
I already found one.

459
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,620
Uncle,

460
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,020
it's been a long time.

461
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,050
Li Juan.

462
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,990
I wouldn't even know you were here

463
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,630
if I didn't run into
Xiao Zhai down the hall.

464
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,990
I happen to bring you lunch.

465
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,060
Okay.

466
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,820
Thank you.

467
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,820
You're welcome.

468
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,620
Thank you.

469
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,610
You're welcome.

470
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,650
Right, Zhang Yi Chi,

471
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,030
what did you say

472
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,540
just now?

473
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,510
Right,

474
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,920
you said...

475
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,450
I already found a suitable partner.

476
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,000
Really?

477
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,580
You didn't tell me that.

478
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,780
I didn't get a chance.

479
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,730
This is your fault.

480
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,740
You knew that

481
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,970
uncle and aunt are
worried about your marriage.

482
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,480
Why didn't you

483
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,150
notify them as soon as you found one?

484
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,570
We just met.

485
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,890
That's perfect.

486
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,150
You should bring her
to uncle and aunt sooner.

487
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,510
So that you won't have to waste

488
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,600
time and effort like we did before.

489
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,410
Right, uncle?

490
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,890
All experience is a lesson in life.

491
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,320
It won't be wasted.

492
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,750
But

493
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,220
it would be best if I could meet her.

494
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
Let's make it on weekend.

495
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,360
My friend is opening a restaurant.

496
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,030
The environment is good,
the food taste delicious.

497
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,660
I'll ask him to reserve a room for you.

498
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,020
We wouldn't want to trouble you.

499
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,860
Not at all.

500
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,450
It's his pleasure to
have you as his guest.

501
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,750
Please help him

502
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,260
to promote his restaurant on

503
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,690
among your friends.

504
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,710
Okay.

505
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,770
His mother and I are okay with that.

506
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,810
But Dr Zhang is busy,

507
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,450
it's all up to him.

508
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,740
Okay.

509
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,040
Then I'll leave you here.

510
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm going to check my
schedule this weekend.

511
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,090
Uncle, I'll go check him.

512
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,670
This brat is already 38 years old,

513
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,890
but still can't act serious.

514
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,020
Zhang Yi Chi, why are you mad?

515
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,190
I'm helping you.

516
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,760
I have no idea why you

517
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,270
make all this ruckus.

518
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,490
I'm jealous.

519
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,570
I wonder

520
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,700
what kind of woman she is

521
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,490
could make you protect her this well.

522
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,740
Is that funny?

523
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,700
No.

524
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,410
I have to make myself give up on you.

525
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,540
Otherwise, I would be tired to leave

526
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,780
with your bond to me.

527
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,700
Don't act like you love sincerely,

528
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,770
okay?

529
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,030
We've known each other for years.

530
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,390
We know each other well.

531
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,650
What's with your attitude?

532
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
Enough.

Okay, I'll be right over.

Mr Zhang.

539
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,070
How's Liu Ran doing?

540
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,070
Her fever is up to 39.8 degrees and
is severely dehydrated.

541
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,970
Dr Zhang, this is Liu Ran's
blood results three days ago.

542
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,730
Acinetobacter Baumannii.

543
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,890
Based on previous experience
of anti-infective treatment

544
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,000
and some survivors' cases,

545
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,270
I suggest

546
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,570
we use

547
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,610
polymyxin E for treatment.

548
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,450
This is the oldest top antibiotics.

549
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,130
There's no

550
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,760
turning back once we use it.

551
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,610
I know.

552
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,110
Just use it.

553
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,170
Monitor the usage and

554
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,360
the drug reaction.

555
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,670
Use it as soon as possible.

556
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,170
Old Master.

557
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,310
You're not in the office?

558
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,250
<i>I went out to contact the business.</i>

559
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,350
No problem with the buyers, right?

560
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,550
We have a deal.

561
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,590
No problem.

562
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,890
I already arranged the delivery guys.

563
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,680
What about the drop spot?

564
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,070
<i>It's in Black Maplewood.</i>

565
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,610
<i>We'll use T4 logo as a mark.</i>

566
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,960
Tell those villagers that

567
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,280
I'll wait for their return

568
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,420
with their families.

569
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,500
Yes.

570
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,120
Old Master,

571
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,720
he's here.

572
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,540
Send him in.

573
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,510
Yes.

574
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,190
Captain Rao, we lost him.

575
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,890
<i>Somewhere in South-East Asia
Willick, T4's headquarters </i>

576
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,850
Many people recommend you to me.

577
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,570
I've seen your profile.

578
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,190
You're good.

579
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,630
Tell me your requirements.

580
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,650
I only want money.

581
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,860
You're straightforward.

582
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,380
I got plenty of money.

583
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,690
The amount you get
depends on your ability.

584
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,460
Deal.

585
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,210
Are you sure Long Yi
is going to that place?

586
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,090
We'd agreed to meet there.

587
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,290
<i>I have to go help them.</i>

588
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,480
<i>Or else Old Master
will get suspicious.</i>

589
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,060
He already has his guard up

590
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,420
against me.

591
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,090
If I don't show up this time,

592
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,650
he'll quickly assume

593
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,620
I've betrayed him.

594
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,010
He still has my mother.

595
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,500
I'll do whatever you want as long as

596
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,890
you can save my mother.

597
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,080
I'll cooperate fully with the police.

598
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,440
Please believe me.

599
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,140
Chief,

600
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,450
we can't hesitate.

601
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,410
This is the best time

602
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,810
to infiltrate T4.

603
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,830
If we let him leave the country,

604
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,970
we'll lose our

605
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,460
only lead if he doesn't return.

606
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,870
I have a plan to contain him.

607
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,460
Furthermore,

608
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,920
after a few days of observation,

609
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,480
I found that, for whatever reason,

610
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,670
there must be some

611
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,330
conflict between him and old master.

612
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,190
So we are on the same page

613
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,060
regarding Old Master.

614
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,050
Chief,

615
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,570
he is our only way to get in.

616
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay, then.

617
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,780
You send someone to follow him.

618
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,130
I'll ask for instructions
from the superiors.

619
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,850
Inform Interpol for assistance.

620
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,590
Conduct an immediate capture

621
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,780
if things go wrong.

622
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,760
Yes.

623
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,300
<i>Based on the information</i>

624
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,170
<i>provided by the source
and armed police,</i>

625
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,780
<i>a group of well-trained
cross-border drug dealers</i>

626
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,650
<i>with mercenary-related background,</i>

627
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,160
<i>is using the border population
as cover for drug trafficking</i>

628
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,930
<i>to bring in major</i>

629
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,190
<i>shipment of drugs.</i>

630
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,770
<i>This morning,</i>

631
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,810
<i>the frontier armed
police has captured</i>

632
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,930
<i>a few villagers who carried drugs.</i>

633
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,950
<i>But</i>

634
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,810
<i>they found no trace of T4.</i>

635
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,290
<i>Based on the comprehensive information,</i>

636
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,860
<i>T4 should be hiding in the jungle</i>

637
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,020
<i>near boundary pillar number 17,</i>

638
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,210
<i>waiting for opportunities.</i>

639
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,180
<i>The superiors order us
to dispatch Team Thunder to</i>

640
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,530
<i>assist in searching and
catching the criminals.</i>

641
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,010
<i>Take action now!</i>

642
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,590
Are you sure

643
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,180
it's safe?

644
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,980
Safe?

645
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,130
In this world,

646
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,510
there's no such thing.

647
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,070
This is the Chinese
People's Liberation Army.

648
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,380
You have illegally entered
the territory of China.

649
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,880
Put your weapons down
and prepare to be inspected.

650
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,810
Open fire!

651
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,700
Go, go, go!

652
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,890
We've been exposed!

653
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,700
Repeat, we've been exposed!
Team B, evacuate!

654
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,640
Be careful! They have snipers!

655
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,710
The target is

656
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,930
at ten o'clock.

657
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,720
He's out of effective range.

658
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,610
Covering fire,
I'll take the guy down!

659
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,610
What are you doing?

660
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,720
Who will lead if you're dead?

661
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,690
It's fine.

662
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,070
I'll go.

663
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,490
I'll go.

664
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,540
Cover me.

665
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,580
All units,

666
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,490
lay down suppressing
fire at ten o'clock!

667
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,809
Follow me!

668
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,710
Songpaisarn!

669
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,180
Medic! Medic!

670
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,290
I need a medic!

671
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,530
Songpaisarn!

672
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,310
Songpaisarn!

673
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,790
Hands up!

674
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,580
It's a bomb!

675
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,350
Is everyone all right?

676
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,350
I'm fine!

677
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,530
I'm fine!

678
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,050
Tian Yong, control the villagers!

679
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,090
-Keep searching!
-Yes!

680
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,600
Turn around!

681
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,140
What are you doing?

682
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,730
Why did you run?

683
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,110
I...

684
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,140
Are you Long Yi?

685
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,330
It's me, why?

686
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,480
Take him!

687
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,430
No.

688
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,900
I...

689
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,340
What did I do?

690
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,590
What's going on?

691
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,310
Someone shot at me just now.

692
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,600
I chased him down here.

693
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,870
But seems like it wasn't him.

694
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,980
We found this in the jungle.

695
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,160
3D printed mask?

696
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,420
Captain Liang,

697
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,610
thank you.

698
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,310
Just leave the rest to us.

699
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,660
Thank you.

700
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,570
Let's go.

701
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,090
<i>Long Yi is arrested.</i>

702
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,190
<i>I understand.</i>

703
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,820
<i>I'm going to Old Master now.</i>

704
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,050
<i>Keep in touch.</i>

705
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,650
<i>Somewhere in South-East Asia
Willick, T4's headquarters </i>

706
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,100
<i>Based on the latest information
our reporter received,</i>

707
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,470
<i>our national army had recently
conducted a joint operation</i>

708
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,090
<i>and took down a group
of armed drug dealers</i>

709
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,180
<i>who entered our country
illegally at the border.</i>

710
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,330
<i>They confiscated a large quantity
of firearms and drugs.</i>

711
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,680
When I reached the jungle
near Black Maplewood,

712
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,000
I found that our people
and goods were gone.

713
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,290
What about Long Yi?

714
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,250
I haven't heard from him.

715
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,810
I'm thinking

716
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,970
if his disappearance

717
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,250
is related to what happened today.

718
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,720
Whether it's related or not,

719
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
China's military police
have to pay for the price

720
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,090
as they touched my goods.

721
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,160
It's a shame that we
lost him in Willick.

722
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,740
He's again the leader.

723
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,680
We must find a way to mess with him.

724
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,960
Instead of messing with him,

725
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,510
let's go after those around him.

726
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,980
He has a sister.

727
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,410
That Xia...

728
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,490
What is the doctor's name?

729
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,800
Xia Chu.

730
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,610
Is she still staying with him?

731
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,580
Yes.

732
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,960
Get her.

733
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,350
Old Master.

734
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,110
Xia Guang Yuan adores his daughter.

735
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,310
Isn't that perfect?

736
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,650
We can punish Liang Mu Ze

737
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,710
and crush Xia Guang Yuan
into submission

738
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,690
by kidnapping Xia Chu.

739
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,800
It's not hard to do this job
with the effort you've put into

740
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,320
the father and daughter, right?

741
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,670
It's not hard.

742
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,920
Do you recognise this?

743
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,760
3D printed mask.

744
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,410
If I'm not wrong,

745
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,940
your company

746
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,040
<i>provides 3D printing service.</i>

747
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,980
<i>You should be</i>

748
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,030
<i>familiar with its function.</i>

749
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,610
This mask was

750
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,930
thrown at the river beach

751
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,970
near Black Maplewood.

752
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,930
And you happened to
appear at that place.

753
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,110
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

754
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,670
<i>Did you throw away this mask?</i>

755
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,170
On the afternoon on 23rd of January,

756
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,140
it was you again

757
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,940
who appeared at the underground
garage of Jianqiaolan Bay

758
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,490
<i>and followed</i>

759
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,940
<i>a female named Xia Chu</i>

760
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,260
to the building

761
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,480
and intended to kidnap her.

762
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,940
Where were you and what were

763
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,910
you doing on

764
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,600
the night of Jan 2?

765
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,750
Don't think that you'll
be fine just because

766
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,860
you say nothing.

767
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,600
I tell you what.

768
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,950
We can still sentence you

769
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,380
without a statement.

770
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,830
I want to see my lawyer.

771
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,020
Rao Zhi.

772
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,000
We'll talk about it after getting the
report from the laboratory.

773
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,530
I understand.

774
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,480
We used every antibiotics we had.

775
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,790
The Acinetobacter Baumannii
in the patient's body

776
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,770
has become
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

777
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,520
It's hard to redress the septic shock

778
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,050
that it causes.

779
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,560
It's meaningless to

780
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,990
keep reviving her.

781
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,400
Is her family here?

782
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,670
Not yet.

783
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,180
Xia Chu!

784
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,340
Where are you going?

785
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,500
I have to search

786
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,260
the prior cases.

787
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,830
Perhaps there're other ways.

788
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,010
Calm down.

789
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,220
Sir, I want to give it a try.

790
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,660
You are a professional doctor.

791
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,690
How can you be this irrational?

792
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,060
I want to try again.

793
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,420
There's got to be another way.

794
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,460
It's impossible,
there's got to be another way.

795
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,350
Xia Chu!

796
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,190
Mr Zhang!

797
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,130
-Enough!
-Dr Xia.

798
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,570
Liu Ran is calling for you.

799
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,830
Liu Ran,

800
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,210
I'm here.

801
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,780
Don't be afraid.

802
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,690
We just got news from the police.

803
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,140
The criminal has been arrested.

804
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:37,880
You're amazing.

805
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,650
You're doing great.

806
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,060
Hang in there.

807
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,360
Fight.

808
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,800
Fight.

809
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,010
Thank... you.

810
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,090
There's a letter I wrote

811
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,130
for you under the pillow.

812
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,810
Make sure to read it.

813
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,280
Okay, I'll read it for sure.

814
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,130
Liu Ran.

815
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,660
Hold still.

816
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,630
You'll be fine.

817
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,220
Hang in there.

818
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,090
Sister...

819
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,270
Thank you.

820
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,700
Thank you.

821
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,930
I'll go inform her family.

822
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,700
Have you reached them?

823
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,220
No one answered.

824
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,600
Then just send him a message.

825
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,260
Tell him that Liu Ran
has passed away.

826
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,020
He'll call us back.

827
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,120
Why is that?

828
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,710
The operation went well

829
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,050
and every index was normal.

830
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,170
What's with the sudden...

831
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,690
Don't forget about the dinner appointment.

832
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,560
My friend has reserved a room for you.

833
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,100
Can you not talk about

834
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,020
the appointment at this time?

835
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,140
What's with this time?

836
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,380
My patient passed away.

837
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,410
Zhang Yi Chi.

838
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,730
This is not your first day as a doctor.

839
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,960
From the moment you
took over this patient,

840
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,130
you should've visualized the worst result.

841
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,640
The relationship between you and her

842
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,000
should be limited
at this consulting room,

843
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,320
operation room and the ward,

844
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,520
these three dimensions.

845
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,810
After you leave these dimensions,

846
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,130
you should have your life,

847
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,810
your friends and family.

848
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,870
Your emotions shouldn't

849
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,020
be affected by a patient.

850
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,930
If you were to be affected by

851
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,800
every death of your patient,

852
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,050
you would soon be knocked over.

853
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,610
Enough.

854
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,770
I'm here to remind you

855
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,060
not to forget about
the serious matter.

856
