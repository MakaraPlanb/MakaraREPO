[My Dear Guardian]

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,880
Did you lose anything?

5
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,360
No, I didn't lose anything.

6
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,020
Rao Zhi.

7
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,320
Nothing suspicious is detected.

8
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,960
You guys are neglecting
what is right under your nose.

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,600
Could it be that before you left,

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,170
you opened the window
but you forgot about it?

11
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,570
Could it someone else in the house
have opened the window

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,720
but didn't inform you?

13
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,080
There's no way I could've forgotten
that I opened the window.

14
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,440
I'm not sure

15
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,250
if anyone else opened the window.

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,450
I think it's better to be cautious.

17
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,330
Please investigate for me, Mr Rao.

18
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,100
How about this?

19
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,290
I'll get someone to check the surveillance
of the surrounding streets.

20
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll contact you if anything.

21
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,590
Sure.

22
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's go back.

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,740
It's my...

24
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,960
Stop moving. Sit down and watch.

25
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,280
It's Er Miao.

26
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,240
Did it lose weight?

27
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,570
Do you have any other videos?

28
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,330
No.

29
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,560
That's the only video.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,440
Please send it to me.

31
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,790
Xia Chu.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,730
When you left home,

33
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,560
did you open the window
in the master room?

34
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,170
I can't remember.

35
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,440
Did I? I don't think so.

36
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,820
What's wrong?

37
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,060
Nothing.

38
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
It's my darling Er Miao.

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,960
I really miss it.

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,970
-You call it Er...
-Miao.

41
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,280
Why are you laughing?

42
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,470
Nothing.

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,320
Where are you going?

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm going to get changed and wash my hair.

45
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,210
Don't be dramatic.

46
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,040
You can barely stand.
How do you wash your hair?

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,400
My hair stinks!

48
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,960
Do you want to recover soon?

49
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,240
Of course, but I have to wash my hair.

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,000
Why don't...

51
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,050
you lend me a hand?

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,279
Do you expect me
to wait on you like a servant?

53
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,800
Isn't a soldier meant to serve the people?

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,060
Dream on!

55
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:42,320
♫ Romance makes little things feel warm ♫

56
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:52,090
♫ Warmth softens even a stubborn heart ♫

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,700
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

58
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,210
Slow down!

59
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,800
The water is going into my ears!

60
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:07,930
It's burning!

61
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,040
It's burning!

62
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,250
You're so troublesome.

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,010
Why don't you do it on your own?

64
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,370
I forgot that

66
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,360
this is Captain Liang's place.

67
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,800
If I won't stop talking,

68
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,320
I'll be chased out of the place.

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,690
What are you doing?

70
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm going to get a towel.

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,860
Don't move. Let me get it for you.

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,320
I can do it.

73
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,130
Let me do it.

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,840
Don't move.

76
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,320
There's a piece of hair on your face.

77
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,159
What's wrong with you?

78
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,890
I enjoy having a strand of hair

79
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,170
sticking on my face.

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,400
It's none of your business!

81
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,120
Stop moving. It's to reduce the swelling.

82
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,480
My mum is calling.

83
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,570
What does it have to do with me?

84
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,880
Of course it has something to do with you.

85
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,440
Have you forgotten that
you're my girlfriend?

86
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,490
Mum.

87
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,450
Son.

88
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,400
Why didn't you reply to
my text messages on WeChat?

89
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,410
I just came back to the camp yesterday.

90
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,520
I've been busy at work.

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,840
What are you doing?

92
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,610
Xia Chu injured herself.

93
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,370
Xia Chu?

94
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,980
She's moved out, hasn't she?

95
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,360
She didn't move out. She decided to stay.

96
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,840
I brought her back to the military camp.

97
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,640
I have to take care of her.

98
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,040
Why would I lie to you? She's here.

99
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,450
I'll let her talk to you.

100
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,220
Hello.

101
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,800
Hello, Xia Chu.

102
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,930
It's me.

103
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,409
I heard

104
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,010
from Mu Ze that you injured yourself.

105
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,440
What happened?

106
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,890
It's nothing.

107
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,850
I injured my ankle.

108
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,240
I feel so much better today.

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,650
You must rest well.

110
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,100
Don't worry.

111
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,850
I'll take care of myself.

112
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,120
Does Liang Mu Ze treat you well?

113
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,480
Liang Mu Ze...

114
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,720
He...

115
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,410
treats me quite well.

116
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,570
Good to hear that.

117
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,530
When I'm free, I'll pay you a visit.

118
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,260
Sure. Please take care.

119
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,520
That's all for now.

120
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,660
Mum.

121
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,770
Are you at ease now?

122
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,530
Moving forward, stop sending

123
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,460
ridiculous photos to the camp.

124
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,130
I have to go. Bye.

125
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,120
Good acting.

126
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,440
As long as you're happy.

127
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,080
Otherwise, you will chase me out again.

128
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,460
Xia Chu.

129
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,420
What?

130
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,400
I have apologised to you, haven't I?

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,130
Put it on until the swelling is gone.

132
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,210
Listen.

133
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,120
Starting from next week,

134
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,850
it will rain every day.

135
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,840
Don't go anywhere.

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,890
If you're bored

137
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,440
and intrigued to check out
our training process,

138
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,400
you may use this.

139
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,820
No one wants to see it.

140
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,320
All right, take a nap
after you blow dry your hair.

141
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,380
Don't get a cold.

142
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,280
Health documentary?

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,200
It sounds great.

144
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,580
Now,

145
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,400
the relationship between doctors
and patients has become strained.

146
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,970
We can provide them a channel

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,210
so that they can understand
each other better.

148
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,890
I think it's quite meaningful.

149
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,860
I support the idea.

150
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,570
However, in order to execute the idea,

151
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,640
we need to get approval

152
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,570
from the management department
of the hospital.

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,620
How about this?

154
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,920
You should come out
with a specific proposal.

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,650
Let me deal with

156
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,730
the hospital.

157
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,370
I think it shouldn't be a problem.

158
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
It helps with digestion.

159
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,620
Thank you.

160
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,680
What is bothering you?

161
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,060
Dr Zhang.

162
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,280
I would like to
ask an irrelevant question.

163
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,840
What is it?

164
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,760
Is Zhuo Ran terminally ill?

165
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,960
How should I put it?

166
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,280
When the disease is under control,

167
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,760
he can live like a normal person.

168
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,320
Once the disease is at its onset,

169
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,080
it can be dangerous.

170
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,480
Is there any way to cure it?

171
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,720
Reduce his stress reaction.

172
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,360
For example,

173
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,240
who called him the other day?

174
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,200
What was the conversation about?

175
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,960
Try to avoid the same
from happening again.

176
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,120
It's quite impossible

177
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,850
to cure it once and for all.

178
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,220
What's wrong?

179
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,010
Something urgent came up.

180
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,000
Now?

181
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm sorry, Dr Zhang.

182
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,800
Do you want to add on?

183
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,290
No need, I can't finish everything.

184
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm so sorry. I'll pay for the bill.

185
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,040
No need.

186
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,840
Hello, sir.

187
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,930
Since your friend has left,

188
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
we purposely bring you

189
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,010
a toy bear.

190
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Can we place it here?

191
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,720
You're being so considerate.

192
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,050
Thank you.

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,280
Sure, enjoy the food.

194
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,380
Sure.

195
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,560
Let's finish the meal

196
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,210
together.

197
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,880
Zhuo Ran.

198
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,620
Mi Gu?

199
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,560
Why are you here?

200
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,290
I'm here to check on you.

201
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,170
You were discharged
from the hospital so suddenly.

202
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,450
I couldn't reach you.

203
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,450
I'm a little worried.

204
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,760
How do you feel?

205
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,250
Have you recovered?

206
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,640
I've recovered.

207
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,260
Good to hear that.

208
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
Since you're ill,

209
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,880
you have to rest well.

210
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,810
Take good care of yourself.

211
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,440
I'm leaving.

212
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,820
Mi Gu.

213
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,720
Thank you for checking on me.

214
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,040
What on earth were you doing?

215
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,540
We almost got caught!

216
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,240
Why were you dilly-dallying?

217
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,730
Nothing happened, right?

218
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,810
Why are you scared?

219
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,480
Why am I scared?

220
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,490
We've been in China for so long.

221
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,980
You've been running around after Xia Chu.

222
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,300
I thought you're something

223
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,760
but we haven't even seen
her dad for once.

224
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,080
I'm talking to you!

225
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,610
Why did you go to his house

226
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,810
and install bugs?

227
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,130
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,010
Do you really think that
by wearing earphones all the time,

229
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,500
you can accomplish the mission

230
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,130
assigned to us by Old Master?

231
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,970
I know what I am doing.

232
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,440
Like hell you do!

233
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,320
Listen, don't put me in trouble.

234
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,210
I'll report everything that happened today

235
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,530
to Old Master.

236
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,040
You'll have to
bear the consequences alone.

237
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,730
Based on the analysis
of a jewellery expert,

238
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,530
the sapphire

239
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,810
on the deceased's walking stick

240
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,220
is the Cornflower Blue Sapphire

241
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,840
originated from Kashmir.

242
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,370
The mining activities

243
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,890
only went on for 28 years.

244
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,690
Therefore,

245
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,970
Kashmir Sapphires
that are available in the world

246
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,960
are really rare.

247
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,380
The last time

248
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,120
this sapphire appeared in public

249
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,930
was two years ago, at the world renowned

[Gem info: Cornflower Blue Sapphire
originated from Kashmir]

251
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,920
Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

252
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,290
A China Mainland merchant

253
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,610
by the name Liu Zheng Ming

254
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,850
won the bid

255
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,960
with 9,210,000 HKD.

256
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,280
Liu Zheng Ming

257
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,320
is the sugar-daddy
of the deceased, Zhou Lan

258
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,580
who killed herself
in the Jiao Tong University district.

259
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,960
His nickname is Xiong.

260
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,330
How much do we know about him?

261
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,130
In the early nineties,

262
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,650
he started off his business
by smuggling imported cigarettes.

263
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,320
He was arrested and sentenced
to prison for seven years.

264
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:20,940
After he's released,

265
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,820
he ventured into Chinese
herbal medicine business.

266
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,410
Now, he's dominated
the herbal medicine market

267
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,720
in the five provinces of Southeast China.

268
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,880
He also has business
in Thailand, Vietnam and so on.

269
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,380
[Gem info: Cornflower Blue Sapphire
originated from Kashmir]

270
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,210
Besides the sapphire

271
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,370
which was recorded two years ago,

272
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,740
we don't have any other records

273
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,580
about his gem collection.

274
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,240
It appears that
he is not a major gem collector.

275
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,610
As for how and why the sapphire

276
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,050
fell into the male deceased's hand,

277
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,960
we don't have any clue as for now.

278
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,560
A Chinese medicine merchant

279
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,840
is involved in two murders simultaneously.

280
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,970
It's not a coincidence for sure.

281
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,570
Judging from the situation,

282
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,960
to find out the identity
of the male deceased in the bungalow,

283
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,820
the breakthrough

284
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,160
is Xiong.

285
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,640
Put up with it.

286
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,160
Slow down.

287
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,740
All right.

288
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,880
you may move around.

289
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,730
That's great!

290
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,250
You're recovering fast.

291
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,730
Like I said,
I can remove the cast on my own.

292
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,120
But you insisted on coming here.

293
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,800
I have to do so.

294
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,840
I'm entrusted by someone.

295
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,040
Please thank
Brigade Commander Dong for me.

296
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,570
Brigade Commander didn't send me here.

297
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,000
It's been raining for a week.

298
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,840
It's not going to stop any sooner.

299
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,480
Yes, it'll rain non stop.

300
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,410
Therefore, every year, at this period,

301
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,640
we'll get ready for war.

302
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,680
Did you receive a new mission?

303
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,530
As the Buddha said, it's a secret.

304
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,080
All right, I have to go.

305
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,200
How about this?

306
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,320
I'll leave some medicine for you.

307
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,640
If I have to go on a mission,

308
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,520
you can apply the medicine
on your own.

309
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,200
Okay, thank you.

310
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,520
I'm leaving.

311
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,000
Is the entire Special Forces Brigade

312
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,450
getting ready for war?

313
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,380
Yes, we're preparing for war.

314
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,000
Team Lightning is getting ready too.

315
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,680
Captain Liang is included.

316
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,880
I'm leaving.

317
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,460
Brigade Commander!

318
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,320
I propose to pass through
the highland side.

319
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,850
It's pouring. I worry that
we might get struck by lightning.

320
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,410
What if we run into a mudslide?

321
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,210
We go through field battle training
on a daily basis.

322
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,320
It's okay.

323
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,240
No doubt it's safer
but how about the speed?

324
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,360
You might be okay with the route

325
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,440
but can the other units catch up with you?

326
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,310
Let's go!

327
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,720
Attention.

328
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,369
Speed up!

329
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,160
Let's take the lead

330
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,000
to pave the way for the other units.

331
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,050
Make sure all of you
take safeguard measures along the way.

332
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,730
Make sure all the units pass safely.

333
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,079
Reply if you receive my message.

334
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,720
Noted!

335
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,960
Noted!

336
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,440
Hurry up. Stay safe. Hurry!

337
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,240
This is Team Lightning speaking.

338
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,280
Attention, all units.
Speed up and stay safe!

339
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,720
Before five o'clock,

340
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
all of you must reach the assembly point!

341
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,200
Go!

342
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,040
Be safe.

343
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,970
-Squad leader.
-Liang.

344
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,820
Are the stewed ribs ready?

345
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,580
It's ready.

346
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,800
As per the Brigade Commander's
instruction,

347
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,850
it's braised on low heat.

348
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,410
Take a sniff.

349
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,800
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

350
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,320
-It smells good, right?
-Yes.

351
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,850
I'll take it with me.

352
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,840
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

353
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,930
I haven't added salt in it.

354
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,900
It's okay. It's good.

355
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,540
It's all right.

356
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,290
-Slow down.
-I'm leaving.

357
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,690
-Don't burn yourself.
-Thank you.

358
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,800
Great. Slow down.

359
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,680
Let me check on

360
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,000
my saviour.

361
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,640
Are you okay?

362
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,000
You're so cool, Liang Mu Ze.

363
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,640
Of course.

364
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,920
Let's get ready for dinner.

365
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,480
Yes!

366
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,330
Our captain

367
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,000
is really something.

368
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,200
Listen, besides catching you,

369
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,380
he's also good at other things.

370
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,760
Not only is he good at diving,
parachuting, rock climbing, and skiing,

371
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,690
he's also good at close quarters combat
and emergency rescue communication.

372
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,170
He can speak three languages
and handle all kinds of vehicles.

373
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,720
He's the top soldier in the army.

374
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,860
He can do things that others cannot.

375
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,920
For example,

376
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,810
metamorphosing and lip reading.

377
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,120
No one in the army is his match.

378
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,810
Nobody can better him.

379
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,050
In that aspect,

380
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,180
he's definitely the best.

381
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,280
Are you writing a novel?

382
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,280
You're even more interesting
than a novel.

383
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,920
I didn't know that you can read lips.

384
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,800
Just a bit.

385
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,570
Anyone can mistake us for a couple

386
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,080
except for you.

387
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,160
For a long time,

388
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,930
I couldn't even stand it
when someone mentioned

389
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,040
the phrase, "special forces soldier."

390
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,760
Let alone start dating again.

391
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,450
Can you teach me?

392
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,420
No.

393
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,370
Dr Xia.

394
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,560
There's a long way to go.

395
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,530
There's a long way to go.

396
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,760
Finish the soup.

397
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,730
Yes.

398
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,660
You too.
Finish it while it's still warm.

399
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,550
-It's quite flavourful.
-It's so bland.

400
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,250
It's so delicious, captain.

401
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,480
I've never had such delicious soup,

402
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,470
captain.

403
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,830
Well done.

404
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,990
I was being impatient.

405
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,390
Why did you bring out the case?

406
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm leaving tomorrow.

407
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,910
My leg has recovered.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

408
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,230
Has it been a week?

409
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,550
Yes.

410
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,710
Are you sure you've recovered?

411
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,090
Yes.

412
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,090
Report!

413
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,790
Captain, I suddenly recall

414
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,630
I have to attend to something urgent.
I have to go.

415
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,110
Don't leave yet.
You haven't finished eating.

416
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,000
Dr Xia, it's quite urgent.

417
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,120
I have to leave now.

418
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,750
Continue eating.
You don't have to send me off.

419
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,310
I'm leaving, captain.

420
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,630
Continue eating.

421
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,840
Is Lieutenant Tian

422
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,840
trying to make space

423
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,110
for us to spend time alone?

424
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,150
Thank you for taking care of me
for the past few days.

425
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,720
I'll replace wine with soup.

426
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,820
Cheers!

427
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,470
That's all?

428
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,310
Don't you have anything else to say?

429
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,710
Like what?

430
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,770
You bought a bouquet in my name

431
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,870
and you haven't apologised to me.

432
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,030
Well,

433
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,560
I was being nosy.

434
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,950
However, I still don't get it.

435
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,870
Why did you get so angry?

436
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,350
Just because Xiao Jun's mum
doesn't like flowers?

437
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,920
She likes flowers.

438
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,310
However, it has nothing to do with me.

439
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,150
Both of you...

440
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,510
It's been so many years.

441
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,910
You've been taking care of them.

442
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,670
So what?

443
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,950
Does it have to involve a love affair?

444
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,320
Do I have to date her

445
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,420
and marry her?

446
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,270
What if I'm taking care of them

447
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,710
as Luo Liang's comrade?

448
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,230
I'm just pretending to be Xiao Jun's dad.

449
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,710
I'll take care of them and protect them

450
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,330
until Xiao Jun grows up,

451
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,830
until he's grown into
an independent adult,

452
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,990
until they don't need
my protection anymore,

453
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,510
until he can protect his own mum.

454
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,580
Is that not allowed?

455
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,350
I'm not avoiding it.

456
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,800
It's to the contrary.

457
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm facing it.

458
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,430
I got it now.

459
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,860
Liang Mu Ze.

460
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,470
I didn't mean to

461
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,470
embarrass you on purpose.

462
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,750
Firstly,

463
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,870
as Xiao Jun's doctor in charge,

464
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,120
I don't want him to get
emotionally agitated.

465
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,790
It will affect his recovery.

466
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,940
More importantly,

467
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,310
I don't want you two to let
each other slip by.

468
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,340
I know the feeling.

469
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,530
I mean,

470
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,470
letting each other slip by
when the feeling is mutual.

471
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,760
It's

472
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,900
quite disheartening.

473
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,240
Therefore, I promised Xiao Jun

474
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,790
to buy a bouquet in your name.

475
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,240
However, I didn't expect

476
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,110
it would bother you that much.

477
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,790
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,070
I was full of myself.

479
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,030
That's why I misunderstood you two.

480
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,310
Have you experienced it?

481
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,270
Pick up the call.

482
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,200
Pick up the call.

483
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,230
Pick up the call.

484
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,830
I think so.

485
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,790
How about you, Liang Mu Ze?

486
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,390
Have you ever let anyone slip by?

487
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,150
Do you feel regret?

488
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,950
No.

489
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,950
I never let anything slip by.

490
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,470
That's why I don't have any regrets.

491
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,920
Eat up.

492
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,150
Have some pork ribs.

493
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,750
You are what you eat.

494
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,670
Listen.

495
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,630
I...

496
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,790
In that situation,

497
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,680
I felt as if

498
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,670
there was a huge bulb on my head.

499
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,280
Did you feel awkward?

500
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,690
It's so awkward.

501
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,520
Lieutenant Tian.

502
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,160
What is the relationship between

503
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,350
Captain Liang and Dr Xia?

504
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,430
What do you think?

505
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,280
If they are really a couple,

506
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,010
she seemed upset

507
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,390
when we called her Mrs Liang.

508
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,090
If there is nothing between them,

509
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,040
why did Captain Liang

510
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,410
bring her back to camp?

511
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,870
She stayed here for so many days.

512
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,490
Xiang Yang.

513
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,950
"The west is veiled in rain
while the east enjoys sunshine."

514
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,510
"My gallant is as deep in love
as the day is fine."

515
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,360
Xia Chu.

516
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,550
My mum wants to see our photo.

517
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,040
What are you doing?

518
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,050
Give it to me!

519
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,080
It's not going to work!

520
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,440
You promised me before.

521
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,840
No doubt I promised you before

522
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,810
but...

523
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,190
Look, this photo is so ugly.

524
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,960
You took the photo from the bottom.

525
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,280
That's the most tricky angle.

526
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,680
Furthermore,
my face looks huge in the photo.

527
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,440
It's also taken against the light!

528
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,040
I look at least three shades darker.

529
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,200
Captain Liang, look at yourself.

530
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,350
Would you smile?
What kind of expression is that?

531
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,040
We are so far apart.

532
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:02,880
We don't look like

533
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,120
a couple who are crazily in love.

534
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,730
If you send the photo

535
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,930
to your mum,

536
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,270
she won't believe in us.

537
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,630
What should we do?

538
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,710
Let me teach you a lesson, Captain Liang.

539
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,080
Liang Mu Ze, come forward.

540
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,990
My face looks huge. Hurry up.

541
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,110
One, two, three, cheese!

542
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,590
Captain Liang, can you put on a smile?

543
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,600
Stay still, don't move.

544
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,990
One, two...

545
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,580
Close your eyes and enjoy life.

546
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,720
This is not okay.

547
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,480
I look silly in this photo.

548
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,280
Be happy, okay?

549
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,090
You look happy.

550
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,870
My mum will think that I've gone crazy
if she sees this.

551
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,950
Do I look crazy?

552
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,010
Taking a photo is so tiring.

553
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,830
It's even more tiring
than going for training.

554
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,030
It's not that tiring.

555
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,670
Since we're pretending,

556
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,950
we have to put in more effort
to look real.

557
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,270
All right, it's done.

558
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,550
Send it to your mum.

559

00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:03,860
♫ Warmth softens even a stubborn heart ♫

561
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,670
We look so real
even though we're pretending.

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:14,340
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

563
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,310
What if it becomes true?

564
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,390
It's none of my business.

565
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:24,410
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence there is no regrets ♫

566
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,120
♫ Getting used to your habits
from breakfast to dinner ♫

567
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,160
Do you really enjoy
working in the hospital?

568
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,130
Of course.

569
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,810
Just wait.

570
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,730
I'm so busy with training.

571
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,730
We need to get ready for war too.

572
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,190
I don't have the time to fetch you.

573
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,310
I have legs.

574
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,660
You mean, your broken leg?

575
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,190
I'm a military officer too!

576
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,680
I won't fall behind
even when I lose my flesh and skin.

577
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,470
I'm not as fragile as you think.

578
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,930
Here, let me show you something.

579
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,270
Come here.

580
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,830
See for yourself.

581
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,550
It's pouring.

582
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,500
It's difficult to travel.
How do you plan to go back?

583
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,750
I...

584
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,120
I can drive.

585
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,270
I have a driving licence.

586
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,150
Drive?

587
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,150
What are you doing?

588
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,750
How do you drive?

589
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,550
It's for the sake of your safety.

590
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,140
Be good, Da Miao.

591
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,450
Good girl.

592
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,360
Liang Mu Ze!

593
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,720
If you ever pinch my face again,

594
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
I'll chop the 27 bones in your hand

595
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,310
into pieces!

596
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,390
Brigade Commander.

597
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,870
Yes, I'm Liang Mu Ze.

598
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,430
I would like to get your permission
on something.

599
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,510
I'm coming. Stop knocking the door.

600
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,760
Change into the military uniform.
Ten minutes later,

601
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,000
go to the assembly point.

602
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,030
Why?

603
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,230
One, two, three, four.

604
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,550
What's wrong?

605
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,350
You have to run.

606
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,630
What?

607
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,000
Either you run

608
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,670
or you train with them.

609
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,350
Me?

610
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,320
Yes.

611
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,040
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

612
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,120
Hurry up. Do it.

613
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,270
Why?

614
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,910
It's for your own good.

615
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,250
You're not my leader.

616
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,550
Why should I listen to you?

617
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,450
Brigade Commander said
it's just a minor accident

618
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,720
but you injured your leg.

619
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,430
That means you lack training.

620
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,610
Hence, he applied to your superior

621
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,460
to include you in the training
as a non-staff.

622
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,510
What?

623
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,350
It's to strengthen your stamina.

624
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,350
He doesn't want you to get into danger.

625
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,930
But...

626
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,470
Let's go.

627
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,230
I'm an injured person.

628
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,830
You've fully recovered, right?

629
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,170
Let's go.

630
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,430
I can walk on my own.

631
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,550
Here, run now.

632
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,930
Keep running.

633
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,400
Let go of me. I can run on my own.

634
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,670
Run on your own.

635
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,750
Keep running.

636
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,670
One, two, three, four.

637
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,710
Xia Chu, I'll beat you up if I catch you.

638
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,790
-I'm coming.
-I can run on my own!

639
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,320
Stop following me!

640
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,640
When you're in danger,

641
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,470
you should run at first instance, got it?

642
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,320
Watch your arms. Swing your arms.

643
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,510
Keep it low.

644
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,960
Don't stop. Keep running.

645
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,830
I can run on my own!

646
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,650
Try it.

647
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,230
I have to practice shooting too?

648
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,060
It's an order from Brigade Commander.

649
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,190
I've only used a rifle before
when I was in recruit company.

650
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,200
Stand here.

651
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,910
Hit the humanoid target at the front.

652
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,770
Here.

653
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,990
Aim carefully.

654
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,310
Liang Mu Ze, I've never used a gun before.

655
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,550
A gun is not much different from a rifle.

656
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,830
Adjust your breathing and relax.

657
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,199
♫ We'll have ups and downs ♫

658
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,850
♫ The journey to happiness is bound
to be filled with waves ♫

659
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,630
Don't be nervous.

660
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,980
♫ I'm glad we came through the
obstacles that time has brought upon us ♫

661
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,469
Hold the gun firmly.

662
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,739
♫ My hands are still eager
to hold you tight ♫

663
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,699
♫ Nothing matters as long as
our smiles outweigh our tears ♫

664
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:58,090
♫ Others can doubt me as long as
I have your trust ♫

665
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,110
What do you think?

666
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,600
Liang Mu Ze, look!

667
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,000
If you connect the bullet holes,

668
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,250
♫ Our souls cross paths
as our gaze meet ♫

669
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,190
you can see a heart shape!

670
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:11,210
♫ Some words you can understand
even if I don't say it ♫

671
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,150
Do it again.

672
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,470
♫ I promise I won't let you slip by ♫

673
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,640
♫ Exchanging everything, we'll become
each other's destiny ♫

674
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,150
Liang Mu Ze is a jerk.

675
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,630
He trained me as if I'm a soldier.

676
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,350
He claimed that he didn't shout at me.

677
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,800
♫ I'll make your heart my kingdom ♫

678
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,620
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

679
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,830
Assemble!

680
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,390
One, two, one!

681
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,630
Comrades.

682
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,150
Lately,

683
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,630
the Southeast region of our country

684
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,640
has been experiencing

685
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,950
heavy rain and flood disaster.

686
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,150
In order to protect
the people and their property,

687
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,310
we've been instructed

688
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,910
to aid the disaster areas.

689
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,670
The fighting is going to begin soon.

690
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,110
I only have one requirement.

691
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,030
Confront the danger.

692
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,780
Help and protect the dyke.

693
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,550
Before the rain stops, we won't give up!

694
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,750
Got it?

695
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,750
Yes!

696
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,190
Let's go!

697
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,340
Turn to the rear.

698
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,430
Start marching!

699
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,310
Captain!

700
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,910
Take care!

701
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,590
Take care, Liang Mu Ze.

702
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,650
I'm back.

703
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,470
-You're back.
-Come here.

704
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,240
-Has your leg recovered?
-Are you okay?

705
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm okay. I've fully recovered.

706
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,240
-You've recovered.
-What are you doing?

707
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,450
-Reading the flood fighting news.
-Look.

708
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,790
They've been immersed
in the water for many days.

709
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,610
It's stated in the news that
many troops

710
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,830
are rushing to the areas.

711
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,390
Xia Chu.

712
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:51,960
Dr Zhang.

713
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,030
You're back.

714
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,040
How do you feel?

715
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,190
I've recovered.
I can start working anytime.

716
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,450
That's great.

717
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,030
Is my hairstyle all right?

718
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,670
Dr Zhang, you're...

719
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,750
I'm filming a show.

720
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,950
There is a lady by the name of Mi Gu
from the life channel.

721
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,120
Do you know her?

722
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,750
I know her. She's my best friend.

723
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,290
She wants to produce

724
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,190
a medicine related documentary.

725
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,310
I'll be the main character
in the documentary.

726
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,150
Please work with her.

727
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,290
Don't worry.

728
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,070
Is she single?

729
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,850
Dr Zhang!

730
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,480
Dean.

731
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,190
Allow me to introduce someone to you.

732
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,110
He is Deputy Dean Zhou.

733
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,350
Hello, Deputy Dean Zhou.

734
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,320
Thank you for

735
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,750
being interested in the hospital.

736
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,080
You're so kind, Dean.

737
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,050
We would like to thank you

738
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,630
for supporting our show.

739
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,430
That's our duty.

740
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,930
This is...

741
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,350
I don't think
there's a need to introduce him.

742
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,370
Hello.

743
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,710
Hello.

744
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,880
We decided to film the signing ceremony
at the eleventh hour.

745
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,870
Sorry to have...

746
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm sorry. I need to answer a phone call.

747
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,560
Xiao Wen, please communicate
with the other leaders

748
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,560
and Mr Zhuo

749
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,960
regarding the filming details.

750
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,110
Okay, Ms Gu.

751
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,590
Thank you.

752
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,270
[Xia Chu]

753
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,000
I changed Xiao Jun's dressing for you

754
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,680
and you promised

755
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,030
to prepare two weeks worth
of medical orders.

756
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,750
Please honour your words.

757
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,410
It's an honour

758
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,630
to set up a special fund

759
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,430
with the hospital.

760
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,630
We will develop 3D medicine production,

761
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,990
organ printing,

762
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,480
auxiliary instrument printing and so on

763
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,830
in full swing.

764
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,470
We believe that

765
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,080
following the rapid development

766
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,070
of 3D printing,

767
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,640
we will welcome

768
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,230
the new era

769
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,270
of personalised medicine.

770
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,630
Take some scenery shots
in the hospital later.

771
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:52,600
Sure.

772
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,030
I hope everything
goes according to plan.

773
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:56,560
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

774
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,530
I'll see you off.

775
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,560
How long will the filming take?

776
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,000
Let's go for dinner tonight.

777
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,790
Should I wait for you?

778
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,270
Are you not going to join
the photography session?

779
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,830
Why should I join?

780
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,620
He's young and talented.

781
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:26,930
I'm sorry.

782
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,510
Please hold on.

783
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:29,890
Mi Gu.

784
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,940
Let's go for dinner tonight.

785
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,390
I'll invite Xia Chu too.

786
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:35,990
Dr Zhang, please join us.

787
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,970
Sure.

788
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,280
I have something to do at night.

789
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,250
Well...

790
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,790
Dr Zhang, don't we have a date?

791
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,830
I'm sorry. I forgot that.

792
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,710
We have a discussion.

793
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,550
I'll not take up your time then.

794
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,710
I'm leaving.

795
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,070
Why did you do that?
