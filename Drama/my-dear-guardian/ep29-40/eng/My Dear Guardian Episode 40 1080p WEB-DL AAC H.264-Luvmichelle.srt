[Episode 40]

4
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,289
Eat it.

5
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,210
Eat it.

6
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,490
I want you to eat it!

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,690
Eat it.

8
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,410
Hurry up.

9
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,840
I know you didn't expect me

10
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,730
to come back alive
when you sent me here.

11
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,300
It'd be best if I could
complete the task.

12
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,810
If I couldn't,

13
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,210
you can have me to
do the dirty work for you

14
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,050
and get rid of the thorn in your side,

15
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,250
right?

16
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,770
You have a good memory.

17
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,340
Eat it.

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,620
I wasn't planning on staying alive.

19
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,860
But Old Master,

20
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,800
what makes you think

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,730
you can leave China alive?

22
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,100
[Rao Zhi!]

23
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,660
[Long Yi is heading out to sea
by motorboat.]

24
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,130
[We are sending our
men over to block him.]

25
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,020
[I'm at the dockside. I'll go!]

26
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,110
This is Whale.

27
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,290
Old Master is dead.

28
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,410
Pei Yu ran away.

29
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,530
Don't waste your energy, Liang Mu Ze!

30
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,290
You can't catch me.

31
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,530
Did you kill Old Master?

32
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,970
He deserved to die.

33
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,990
Don't forget your identity!

34
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,950
Pei Yu!

35
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,030
Pei Yu no longer exists in this world.

36
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,220
It's not today and here

37
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,210
that I forgot my own identity.

38
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,230
I don't need you to remind me.

39
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,270
I still remember the taste

40
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,160
of Xia Chu's lips.

41
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,400
I tell you what.

42
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,450
It was only Zhuo Ran
whom Xia Chu liked.

43
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,770
You are

44
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,250
just his shadow.

45
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,580
Just kill me.

46
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,210
You don't deserve it.

47
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,210
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

48
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,590
♫ It could be the destiny 
but it is not practical ♫

49
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,400
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

50
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,980
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

51
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,810
♫ Remembering your interests, 
getting closer to you ♫

52
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,440
♫ If I can't predict the future, 
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

53
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,930
♫ I can't remember when 
I fell in love with you ♫

54
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:28,160
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

55
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,960
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

56
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,520
Five minutes.

57
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,920
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

58
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,210
Five minutes will do.

59
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:50,120
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

60
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,640
You gained weight.

61
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,420
I ate well

62
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,240
and I didn't lose any sleep.

63
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,570
Aunty is doing well.

64
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,510
There are volunteers
taking turns to take care of her.

65
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,430
Good.

66
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,930
Then

67
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,090
I can rest assured.

68
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,910
Before I came here,

69
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,780
I had a lot I wanted to say.

70
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,530
Just cut to the chase.

71
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,010
Time's running out.

72
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,910
I'm sorry.

73
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,680
You don't look like a
woman in her thirties.

74
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,569
You're too silly.

75
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,089
No woman is truly silly

76
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,830
unless she's willing to be one.

77
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,800
This may be our last meeting.

78
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,710
I've been wanting to
ask you a question.

79
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,620
Did you

80
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,430
ever love me?

81
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,100
Even for a moment?

82
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,980
No.

83
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,520
I'd been treating

84
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,840
you as a handy tool.

85
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,090
Let's go.

86
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,930
Mr Zhang, goodbye.

87
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,660
Goodbye.

88
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,340
Goodbye, sir.

89
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,580
Do your revision.

90
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,420
Mr Zhang, goodbye.

91
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,690
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

92
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,230
It's me.

93
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,070
I'm on the way to the airport.

94
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,630
Then I wish you

95
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,020
a safe journey.

96
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,520
We probably won't see each other
much in future.

97
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,970
You should put your own health

98
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,560
in the first place.

99
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,130
[And I want to tell you]

100
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,970
[that you've been an]

101
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,090
excellent doctor in my mind.

102
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,230
I believe that

103
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,810
you'll be an excellent
teacher in the future.

104
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,990
Well,

105
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,500
then I'll

106
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,670
do my best to

107
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,320
live up your expectation

108
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,550
to be an excellent teacher.

109
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,490
Goodbye.

110
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,730
Mister,

111
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,320
please drive faster.

112
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,480
Okay.

113
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,120
Meng Zhen!

114
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,340
Mum, let's go.

115
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,750
I...

116
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,020
I want to eat

117
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,770
the sponge cake you make.

118
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,370
♫ You were familiar to me at first sight ♫

119
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,520
♫ Never doubted when I approached you ♫

120
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,300
♫ I drown in certainty every day ♫

121
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,610
♫ Coveting the innocence of love ♫

122
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,520
♫ It's for a lifetime at every glance ♫

123
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,920
♫ Preparing for an extreme affection ♫

124
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,090
♫ Talking about everything
I've kept in my heart ♫

125
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:43,810
♫ Until love bind us ♫

126
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,930
It's strange.

127
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,550
My heart beats faster

128
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,980
than usual

129
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,250
every time I see you.

130
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,380
I feel a strange familiarity towards you,

131
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,680
like we've known
each other for a long time.

132
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,290
Xue is here to volunteer again.

133
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,630
How is it?

134
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,610
Do you feel good today?

135
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,130
Aunty said her heart
is beating a little fast.

136
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,560
Let me listen.

137
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,830
Do you feel stuffy or
pain in the chest?

138
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,990
This shouldn't be a problem.

139
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,520
Then why is her heart racing?

140
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,850
Perhaps

141
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,320
her transplanted heart

142
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,340
recognises you.

143
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,980
Rest well.

144
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,900
Call me if there's any problem.

145
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,900
Thank you, Dr Xia.

146
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,080
You're welcome.

147
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,550
It's a young soldier.

148
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,970
What?

149
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,390
I mean the donor who
donated his heart to me.

150
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,610
If he was alive,

151
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,860
his heart might race

152
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,410
like mine does

153
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,250
when he sees you.

154
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,640
Aunty,

155
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,200
can I listen to his heartbeat?

156
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:59,630
♫ There's something about you
that makes me strangely addicted ♫

157
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,810
[Xue.]

158
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,560
♫ I keep wanting to open my heart ♫

159
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,810
Xue!

160
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,690
♫ Afraid of your anticipation, 
some things cannot be repeated ♫

161
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,730
Let me listen

162
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,330
to what your

163
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,090
heart is saying.

164
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,290
♫ We can't reject it 
when fate chooses us ♫

165
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,170
Wait, there's a lot of people.

166
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,950
It's awkward.

167
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,230
♫ I'll hesitate when I get close, 
I'll be sad if I miss it ♫

168
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,670
♫ Your lovely smile, your pure heart ♫

169
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,510
♫ Are irreplaceable ♫

170
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,700
♫ Accustomed to your presence ♫

171
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,880
♫ Being loved every moment ♫

172
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,690
♫ Until the day we meet ♫

173
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,540
♫ Can the missing companionship
instantly fulfil ♫

174
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,540
♫ Your love ♫

175
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,340
Xiao Xue,

176
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,450
write a letter to my son for me.

177
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,960
Okay.

178
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,410
What do you want to write?

179
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,770
What left me yesterday

180
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
can be retained no more.

181
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,350
What worries me today

182
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,340
are the times for which I feel sore.

183
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,370
This is Li Bai's poem.

184
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,970
I like Li Bai too.

185
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,130
Why did I recite Li Bai's poem?

186
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,530
Just recite it.

187
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,570
In autumn wind for miles
and miles the wild geese fly.

188
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,930
Let's follow them with eyes
and drink in tower high.

189
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,290
Your writing's forcible,
like ancient poets.

190
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,630
Your writing's forcible,
like ancient poets.

191
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,370
Mine is in Junior Xie's
direct and easy style.

192
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,340
Both of us have ambitions high.

193
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,630
We'd bring the moon down from the sky.

194
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,530
Cut running water with a sword,
it will flow faster.

195
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,300
Drink wine to drown your sorrow,
it will grow heavier.

196
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,160
[If we despair in our
lifetime of all affairs,]

197
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,450
[tomorrow let us sail away]

198
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,090
with loosened hairs.

199
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,970
[Son,]

200
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,900
[I know you've been blaming me]

201
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,370
[for taking your little brother away]

202
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,810
[and leaving you.]

203
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,590
[I wasn't being partial.]

204
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,660
[I really had no choice.]

205
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,660
[There's no mother]

206
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,610
[willing to abandon her own child.]

207
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,910
[After all these years,]

208
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,960
[you've always kept me company
under the guise of Zhuo Ran.]

209
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,830
[You learned his every move]

210
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,270
[and his emotions]

211
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,670
[to comfort me.]

212
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,260
[It wasn't that I didn't
recognize you.]

213
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,930
[Just that]

214
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,010
[I thought you could]

215
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,110
[live on without guilt
if I said nothing.]

216
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,780
[Come to think of it,]

217
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,050
[we really made a lot of mistakes.]

218
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,020
[I should have stopped you]

219
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,730
[back then on the boat.]

220
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,320
[I should've stopped you from]

221
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,850
[eating that leftover and]

222
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,930
[kneeling before that demon
no matter what.]

223
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,300
[I'd rather die with you]

224
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,370
[that night]

225
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,380
[than watching you]

226
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,490
[compromise yourself for me]

227
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,860
[and live a miserable life.]

228
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,720
[It's time to get back up]

229
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
[on your feet.]

230
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,250
[If it's possible,]

231
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,840
[please abandon your disguise and]

232
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,530
[remove the masks on your face.]

233
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,770
[Even for a day]

234
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,620
[or for an hour.]

235
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,410
[Trust me,]

236
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,620
[you're my son, Pei Yu.]

237
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,290
[You don't have be to someone else.]

238
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,110
[You just need to be yourself.]

239
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,720
[We'll face it]

240
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,140
[and atone for our sins together.]

241
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,730
[Please believe that]

242
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,690
[I love you still.]

243
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,290
[I love you always.]

244
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,920
I am Pei Yu.

245
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,070
I am Pei Yu.

246
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,810
Brother.

247
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,780
Remember,

248
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,860
I'm going to Beijing to

249
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,610
attend the independent
student recruitment.

250
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,090
The details between me and Xia Chu

251
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,320
is in this letter.

252
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,140
We recently had
some conflict because of the novel

253
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,150
by Josephine Tey.

254
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,680
Remember to cheer her up for me.

255
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,100
Mother's habits

256
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,330
are in this notebook too.

257
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,010
Most importantly,

258
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,130
remember

259
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,270
you must smile.

260
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,680
A brighter smile.

261
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,680
Right, that's it!

262
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,210
I'll get on first.

263
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,420
Remember,

264
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,220
from now on,

265
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,570
you're Zhuo Ran.

266
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,540
I am Pei Yu.

267
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,880
I am Pei Yu.

268
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,040
I am Pei Yu!

269
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,780
I am Pei Yu!

270
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,410
I am Pei Yu.

271
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,930
I am Pei Yu.

272
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,130
I am Pei Yu.

273
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,690
[Three months later,
Pei Yu is sentenced to death]

274
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,820
Thank you, Master Le Tian.

275
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,260
Thanks for keeping
me company all this time.

276
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,850
You've worked hard.

277
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,580
If you meet other patients

278
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,040
like me afterwards,

279
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,600
remember to tell them that

280
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,530
everything will be fine

281
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,190
no matter how hard things get.

282
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,140
It's going to be all right.

283
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,460
We can do it!

284
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,170
Sorry to trouble you.

285
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,590
It's all right. Rest assured.

286
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,190
Leaving home with three big laughters,

287
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,270
I'm not an

288
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,730
ordinary man!

289
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,090
I don't feel like he's gone.

290
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,050
Tian Yong isn't gone.

291
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,040
When I sent the parrot off,

292
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,110
I got a strong feeling that

293
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,420
Tian Yong will see this.

294
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,050
It was the parrot who brought him to me.

295
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,320
And they healed me together.

296
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,230
Now that

297
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,900
my parrot has become

298
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,690
Master Le Tian from OK,

299
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,800
it's going to heal more people!

300
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,840
Tian Yong isn't gone.

301
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,220
It's true.

302
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,710
He is in the poem
which I read just now.

303
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,420
He is in every laughter
of Master Le Tian too.

304
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,190
And here,

305
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,660
he's in here too.

306
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,890
He's always been here.

307
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,489
Xiao Xue,

308
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,020
I've decoded the

309
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,969
WeChat message that Tian Yong sent

310
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,449
via his WeChat account, Mr Parrot.

311
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,810
It's in this book.

312
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,920
Read it if you want.

313
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,170
Okay.

314
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,330
Let's go.

315
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,179
Tell me

316
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,980
what your next plan is.

317
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,040
I want to take a graduate exam
in Chinese Literature.

318
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,420
Really?

319
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,130
Which college do you want to apply?

320
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,100
Mother's alma mater.

321
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,050
She has a senior

322
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,330
who studies Poetry Phonology.

323
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,460
It's good.

324
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,250
Are you sure about that?

325
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,060
Just give it a try.

326
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,770
I'll try it next year
if I can't make it this year.

327
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,350
Life is long,

328
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,820
I'm going to make it.

329
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,270
You can do it.

330
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,800
Mother said

331
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,830
she'll return to help
me prepare for the test.

332
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,570
We rent a unit downstairs
at Mu Ze's place.

333
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,730
Come home for

334
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,120
dinner if you're free.

335
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,110
Okay.

336
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,970
You do your best, too,

337
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,010
Officer Rao!

338
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,870
Okay.

339
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,540
Okay.

340
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,410
We, father and daughter,

341
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,030
will try our best.

342
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,990
In the future, if I'm free,

343
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,500
I'll try to spare

344
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,770
a day every week.

345
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,090
Really?

346
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,400
To accompany you.

347
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,410
[This is a voiceless memo.]

348
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,730
[I only hope Xue could understand]

349
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,080
[I've always prepared
to bid farewell to you.]

350
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,610
[Because that is the preparation
ceremony for the next meeting.]

351
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,330
[It's the best comfort on the days]

352
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,550
[when we we can't meet.]

353
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,330
[If]

354
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,450
[we can't meet again,]

355
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,050
[I'll remember the
way you look every time]

356
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,480
[you said goodbye to me with a smile.]

357
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,440
[Please]

358
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,050
[remember the poem below.]

359
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,390
[They are willing to]

360
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,230
[be a star in the sky.]

361
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,910
[They are willing to]

362
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,450
[be a light on the ground.]

363
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,040
[I might sacrifice]

364
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,670
[when I]

365
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,930
[enter the restricted area.]

366
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,510
[Leaving the footprints,]

367
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,990
[paving the way]

368
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,330
[for those who come after.]

369
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,080
[I'm grateful to the world]

370
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,150
[for accepting my body.]

371
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,440
[I'm grateful to my girl]

372
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,050
[for giving me the time of eternity.]

373
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,610
[And you'll always have my soul.]

374
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,100
[Trust me, Xue.]

375
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,190
[All the pain and waiting]

376
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,810
[won't be wasted.]

377
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,770
[Someday,]

378
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,260
[they'll become your love]

379
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,930
[and courage.]

380
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,730
[I wish you have a blissful life.]

381
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm cured.

382
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,970
I don't lose sleep and

383
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,770
I don't have to eat
sleeping pills anymore.

384
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,650
I'm all well.

385
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,340
I saw someone

386
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,090
selling lychee honey yesterday.

387
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,760
So I bought one for each of you.

388
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,000
Taste it.

389
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,060
Tell me if it's delicious.

390
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,340
But its taste

391
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,850
is not the same as before.

392
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,880
Everything has changed.

393
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,640
Only you two are this lively.

394
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,500
Here, cheers.

395
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,610
Cheers!

396
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,170
Uncle, don't drink this fast.

397
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,830
It's fine, I'm happy.

398
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,000
It's rare that Mu Ze takes a day off.

399
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,560
You're off duty too.

400
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,300
I tell you what, it's hard

401
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,700
to have a reunion dinner

402
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,850
in our family.

403
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,850
Right.

404
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,940
Here, Xia Chu.

405
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,380
Try your uncle's cooking.

406
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,530
Thank you, aunty.

407
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,660
Here.

408
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,630
This one.

409
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,750
Taste it.

410
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,930
Thank you, aunty.

411
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,730
I think

412
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,390
we should refurnish the house.

413
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,270
How is it?

414
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,320
How about this?

415
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,670
Let's visit the furniture stores while

416
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,510
we have time tomorrow morning.

417
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,290
Tomorrow?

418
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,620
Tomorrow...

419
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,930
No, we have things to do.

420
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,200
What are you up to?

421
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,380
My unit is going to film a publicity video

422
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,970
about military conscription tomorrow.

423
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,990
I'm the actor.

424
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,140
I'm going to be the viewer.

425
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,770
Anyway, you'll leave tomorrow.

426
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,650
Just make this easy.

427
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,530
Quickly pack your luggage after this meal.

428
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,790
Don't forget any stuff.

429
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,930
I know.

430
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,620
Aren't you afraid

431
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,500
that Xia Chu will be unhappy after

432
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,970
refurnishing this house?

433
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,960
No.

434
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,000
Son, let me ask you.

435
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,150
What will you do when there's

436
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,470
disagreement between me and Xia Chu

437
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,780
in the future?

438
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,160
What will I do?

439
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,580
What should I do?

440
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,250
What to do?

441
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,640
What will I do?

442
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,630
Do you have any
suggestion, old comrade?

443
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,430
Don't drag me into this.

444
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,310
If that's the case,

445
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,450
just mind

446
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,330
our own women.

447
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,990
This is a great idea.

448
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,980
Come on.

449
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,370
Let's have a another toast.

450
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,450
Come!

451
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,100
Xia Chu,

452
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,210
thank you.

453
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,360
From now on,

454
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,130
Liang Mu Ze's everything

455
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,450
is yours.

456
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,440
Well, if that's all right, aunty.

457
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,120
Here, cheers!

458
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,050
Turn right!

459
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,600
At ease!

460
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,570
Halt!

461
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,550
Switch post!

462
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,960
Is every department ready?

463
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,640
Okay, ready!

464
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,970
Rolling!

465
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,930
Three, two, one, action!

466
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,250
[My name is Liang Mu Ze.]

467
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,760
[It's the homophonic word of "a fine
fowl perches only on a fine tress".]

468
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,700
[I grew up, like most]

469
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,370
[of the teenagers,]

470
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,270
[under the protection]

471
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,850
[of my relatives and mentors
before I was 18 years old.]

472
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,590
[When I turned 18,]

473
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,100
[I entered the military school]

474
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,560
[and put the uniform on.]

475
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,130
Prepare to fight!

476
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,710
[Here]

477
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,490
[we fight like the scorching sun.]

478
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,920
[We become stronger.]

479
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,640
[Here]

480
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,460
[we cleave through the waves,]

481
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,890
[shed blood and tears.]

482
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,020
[Here]

483
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,990
[we reach for the sky.]

484
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,380
[We witness growth.]

485
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,100
[Here]

486
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,710
[we push the limits]

487
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,370
[and create glory.]

488
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,110
[Here]

489
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,080
[we grind the battlefield,]

490
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,500
[drawing our sword.]

491
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,620
[Here]

492
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,640
[we pass on the spirit]

493
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,090
[of defending our dignity.]

494
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,400
[Here]

495
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,360
[we experienced extreme pain]

496
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,770
[and tasted the moment of pleasure.]

497
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,540
[Here]

498
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,450
[we lost the waywardness and
arrogance of our youth]

499
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,450
[and gained the unyielding
spirit of a man.]

500
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,480
[We water our youth with our blood!]

501
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,130
[We create the Great Steel Wall
with our responsibilities.]

502
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,230
[We share the same name]

503
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,630
[and the same faith!]

504
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,700
[We are]

505
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,170
[the Chinese People's Liberation Army!]

506
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,530
[The End]
