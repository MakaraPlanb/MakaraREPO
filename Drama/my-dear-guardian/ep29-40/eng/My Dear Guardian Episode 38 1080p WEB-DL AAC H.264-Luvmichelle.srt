I didn't expect

8

I'd be the one

to send him to the police station.

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,050
Right after he said

11
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,700
he wanted to take me to his mother.

We predict that

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,250

127
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,170
No.

128
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,330
But at the scene where we arrested him,

129
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,810
he was logging in to the City of Desire

130
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,410
and had posted on the forum.

131
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,870
What was the content?

132
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,700
"I've got the stuff,"

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,060
"waiting for the wind."

134
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,900
The stuff he meant

135
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,530
might be the information
he wants to get

136
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,050
or

137
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,570
the related clues.

138
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,650
What did he mean by

139
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,450
"waiting for the wind"?

140

But

143
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,630
he asked you to hand his mother

144
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,970
and Tian Yong over to him.

145
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,980
We got news from Dong'an,

146
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,410
It's impossible that he got
the information of the project.

147
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,810
The narrative of
"he got the stuff"

148
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,960
must be false.

149
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,450
Why did he lie

150
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,940
to Old Master?

151
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,170
For all I know,

152
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,100
his mother disappeared

153
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,460
with him back then.

154
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,690
I'd asked Xia Chu.

155
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,250
It's true that his mother is not well.

156
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,130
Looks like she's got a heart condition.

157
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,490
I'm thinking if it's possible that

158
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,250
Old Master forces him
to work for him

159
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,220
by threatening him with his mother.

160
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,630
The reason why he's refused to

161
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,130
denounce Old Master

162
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,630
is probably because

163
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,380
of his mother's safety.

164
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,050
He wants to wait for the wind.

165
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,370
Just let him wait and

166
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,860
send the video of Tian Yong going
through withdrawal to him.

167
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,890
Let's see who lasts longer.

168
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,330
-Yes.
-Let's go.

169
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,080
This is a video on City of Desire

170
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,340
our comrade at the technical team

171
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,770
had seized last night.

172
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,610
Upon initial analysis,

173
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,020
it's a reply to

174
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,810
Pei Yu's post from Old Master.

175
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,840
But it remains unclear

176
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,850
why they filmed Tian Yong.

177
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,610
Based on the image detail capturing

178
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,930
and the manor's floor
plan provided

179
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,610
by the local police,

180
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,770
we guess

181
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,750
Tian Yong might be detained in the

182
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,170
basement of the manor

183
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,030
and it's possible

184
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,090
that he's been injected with drugs.

185
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Commander Dong,

186
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,710
listen to me.

187
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,830
We've reported the current situation

188
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,140
to our superiors and

189
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,370
we've intensified the
interrogation of the accomplices.

190
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,330
After we get the statements,

191
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,930
the orders from the superiors

192
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,810
and set up cooperation
with Willick's police,

193
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,090
we'll conduct the

194
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,380
extraction immediately.

195
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,380
I'll apply to my superiors
for joint operations too.

196
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,870
This is a debt

197
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,930
they can't ever repay.

198
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,339
This is

199
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,780
Tian Yong?

200
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,569
What's wrong with him?

201
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,000
He's being controlled
by the drug dealers.

202
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,870
Brigade Commander sent me this video.

203
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,620
The drug dealers drugged him.

204
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,020
Then

205
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,140
what now?

206
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,740
Waiting for the notice
of the superiors.

207
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,700
Waiting for the notice
of the superiors.

208
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,370
I can't do a thing!

209
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,980
Liang Mu Ze.

210
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,060
Calm down.

211
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,530
Morse code?

212
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,610
I'm wondering

213
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,770
if we should have some

214
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,350
unexpected

215
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,260
methods for communication.

216
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,690
You know, just in case

217
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,420
-you're taken captive someday.
-Get lost.

218
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,450
[Why aren't you the one taken captive?]

219
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,680
Okay.

220
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,270
Okay.

221
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,490
I understand.

222
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,750
Xiao Qiang,

223
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,450
-contact the expert on telegraph now.
-Yes.

224
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,820
Play it again.

225
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,450
Slow down.

226
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,710
What did he mean?

227
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,210
Three Hundred Tang poems.

228
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,660
Rao Zhi, is the message

229
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,170
related to the Three Hundred Tang poems?

230
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,570
Three Hundred Tang poems.

231
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,650
Tian Yong is back!

232
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,420
What are you doing?
Tian Yong gave me this.

233
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,010
It's going to save Tian Yong's life.

234
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,540
[Rao Zhi,]

235
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,610
[I found the clue that
Tian Yong left in the book.]

236
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,570
These might be the
username and password.

237
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,880
Try typing them in.

238
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,770
I got the evidence.

239
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,250
Old Master's records.

240
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,020
He got the evidence.

241
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,610
Old Master,

242
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,650
Tian Yong is dying.

243
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,570
Any word from Zhuo Ran?

244
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,640
No.

245
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,030
Tell him

246
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,670
I'll kill every single one

247
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,670
he wished to protect

248
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,050
when the time comes.

249
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,280
Yes.

250
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,500
[You have to go.]

251
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,370
[No one can cover you.]

252
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,060
You sure?

253
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,890
[Yes.]

254
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,530
[They're coming for you.]

255
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,090
Understood.

256
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,270
How is it?

257
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,020
It has been decoded.

258
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,560
[That's great.]

259
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,750
Xia Chu, I'll park my
car at the hospital.

260
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,050
You drive it home after work.

261
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,760
What about you?

262
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,010
[I need to return to the unit.]

263
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,770
So soon?

264
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,730
You're still recovering.

265
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,050
You have a mission?

266
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,580
Time is running out, Xia Chu.

267
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,840
Just go.

268
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,640
I'll wait for you.

269
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,370
[Once again,]

270
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,810
[I lost track of Liang Mu Ze.]

271
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,790
[Just like every parting before,]

272
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,580
[I don't know where he was headed,]

273
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,320
[and I don't know when]

274
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,710
[we will meet again.]

275
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,130
[I didn't even have
energy left to feel sad.]

276
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,840
[While he's fighting for his comrades,]

277
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,720
[I'm fighting my own battles as well.]

278
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,230
[The border between China and Willick]

279
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,660
How is it going?

280
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,830
When we arrived,

281
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,490
Old Master had already run away.

282
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,660
Lieutenant!

283
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,530
Who did this?

284
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,260
Xiao Teng!

285
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,670
Tell me who did this!

286
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,980
Who did this?

287
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,950
Calm down!

288
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,450
I'd kill him myself

289
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,570
if I know who did this!

290
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,010
Lieutenant!

291
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,650
Willick's police said

292
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,280
Old Master was gone

293
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,050
when they arrived.

294
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,310
What do you think about

295
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,460
this treatment programme?

296
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,450
Sir.

297
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,830
There are two seriously wounded in
the Emergency Department.

298
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,260
We found a tumour on
the heart of one of them.

299
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,550
We need to you check on her.

300
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,510
Xia Chu!

301
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,490
Xia Chu.

302
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,750
Xia Chu!

303
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,970
Patient, Zhuo Mei Qin.

304
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,540
Her electrocardiogram shows

305
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,770
sinus rhythm,

306
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,390
ST-segment elevation

307
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,840
on V4 to V6 leads.

308
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,180
Class II to III on classification
of cardiac functional.

309
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,420
Combining with CT scan,
we found that she has

310
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,050
enlarged heart with
left ventricular aneurysm.

311
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,480
Have you had any treatment before?

312
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,220
Son.

313
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,760
I want to see my son.

314
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,820
Who is her son?

315
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,060
Is he here?

316
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,610
We haven't seen him.

317
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,330
Her son is Zhuo Ran.

318
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,030
Rao Zhi,

319
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,110
am I supposed to tell you

320
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,140
about Zhuo Mei Qin's condition?

321
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,790
Yes.

322
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,810
How is she?

323
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,750
The patient

324
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,020
has been diagnosed with

325
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,130
brain death.

326
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,590
What do you mean?

327
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,580
She is currently under
precarious conditions.

328
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,350
The initial diagnosis

329
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,250
might be ischemic cardiomyopathy.

330
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,580
It's the most serious stage

331
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,940
of coronary heart disease.

332
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,740
And she has old myocardial infarction

333
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,580
with left ventricular aneurysm.

334
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,230
She may die anytime.

335
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,790
We've used every

336
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,130
resuscitation methods

337
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,490
we have on him.

338
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,700
But he was

339
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,210
in shock for too long,

340
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,450
so his

341
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,840
advanced neural center

342
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,530
is gradually dying.

343
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,690
Next,

344
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,850
his brain stem function

345
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,170
is going to waste away

346
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,430
until irreversible termination

347
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,400
appears.

348
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,600
There's only one way now.

349
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,170
Heart transplantation.

350
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,080
Heart transplant?

351
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,990
She wants to see her son.

352
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,150
So it's

353
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,290
meaningless to

354
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,670
keep reviving him,

355
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,490
it would only make him suffer.

356
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,210
You need to decide
as soon as possible.

357
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,710
I...

358
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,850
I need to ask my leader.

359
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,300
[Is there no other way?]

360
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,080
[Does Tian Yong]

361
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,280
[have someone he wishes to see]

362
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,060
[or]

363
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,860
[does he have an unfulfilled wish?]

364
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,100
Mu Ze.

365
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,060
Mu Ze, what's wrong?

366
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,170
Who is that?

367
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,010
Tian Yong.

368
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,800
What's wrong with him?

369
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,920
Go in and take a look.

370
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,620
Where are you taking me?

371
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,890
To the hospital

372
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,510
to see your mother.

373
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,530
Tian Yong.

374
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,690
Tian Yong.

375
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,310
His heart is beating.

376
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,930
He is currently on life support.

377
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,010
Then just keep supporting him!

378
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,820
♫ Requires no validation ♫

379
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,950
♫ It is our shared secret ♫

380
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,910
♫ Keeping it close to the heart ♫

381
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,810
♫ The embrace I long for ♫

382
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,700
♫ Comes up in my dreams often ♫

383
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,060
Get up.

384
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,670
I'll read you poetry.

385
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,940
I've finished memorizing
three hundred Tang poems

386
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,330
by using the method you taught me.

387
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,630
I memorize one poem each time

388
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,830
the sand in the
hourglass finish flowing.

389
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,210
The time really does pass quickly.

390
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,690
Guess what.

391
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,610
I like Bai Ju Yi the most.

392
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,420
His poems are very simple.

393
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,610
Even I can understand what he wrote.

394
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,430
What about you?

395
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,290
Who do you like the most?

396
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,850
I guess it must be Li Bai.

397
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,540
You are both passionate and sincere.

398
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,909
You're the reason I'm able to know

399
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,780
this many poets.

400
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,270
You must be joking with me,

401
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,889
right?

402
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,900
Mu Ze,

403
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,449
did I do something wrong?

404
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,050
It shouldn't be.

405
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,670
I did as you said.

406
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,810
I've been staying in the military camp!

407
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,820
Why is he still lying here?

408
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,860
♫ The embrace I long for ♫

409
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,750
♫ Comes up in my dreams often ♫

410
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:23,970
♫ If I hang in there ♫

411
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:32,220
♫ I know love will surely come, someday ♫

412
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,140
Currently, there has no

413
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,780
beds in the Cardiac Surgery ICU.

414
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,820
So we put the patient in here

415
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,790
to closely

416
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,340
monitor her condition.

417
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,810
Dad.

418
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,660
How could he be like this?

419
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,400
He didn't even say goodbye!

420
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,050
It's okay.

421
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,660
It's okay.

422
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,550
Dr Xia,

423
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,700
please get him changed.

424
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,730
Okay.

425
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,620
Follow me.

426
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,430
Mu Ze,

427
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,190
I'll take Xiao Xue outside.

428
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,590
Let's go.

429
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,790
What did he

430
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,940
experience along the way?

431
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,490
I don't dare to think about it.

432
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,920
Then stop thinking.

433
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,520
I'd rather you know nothing.

434
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,780
I can't do it, Dad.

435
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,900
I can't do it anymore.

436
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,180
You're lucky, Captain Liang.

437
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,500
The one lying in there

438
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,700
is not so lucky.

439
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,370
Liang Mu Ze!

440
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,600
Liang Mu Ze!

441
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,330
I'm warning you.

442
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,600
Don't mess with my man

443
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,880
if you want to save your mother!

444
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,260
Sun Xiao Mo.

445
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,470
Are you all right?

446
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,740
Pull yourself together!

447
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,520
He deliberately provoked you

448
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,650
just to see you lose control.

449
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,360
It's a liberation for him

450
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,100
if you beat him to death.

451
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,560
Is it worth to commit a crime for

452
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,650
that kind of person?

453
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,320
I'm going back to the department.

454
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,380
Liang Mu Ze.

455
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,270
Just cry it out

456
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,580
if you're sad.

457
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,410
What does death feel like?

458
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,750
Does it hurt?

459
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,830
Or does it feel cold?

460
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,940
It's like

461
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,140
being sent off by the
people in the world

462
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,240
and picked up by the heavens.

463
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,350
It's a problem that

464
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,970
everyone of us has to face.

465
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,040
We've got to face it.

466
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,430
Just that we are

467
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,710
destined to face more of it

468
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,010
and be influenced by it

469
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,410
than others.

470
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,630
[Give me back my OK!]

471
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,610
-I have to go in and find OK!
-Stop your ruckus!

472
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,980
OK!

473
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,180
I'm here to pick you up!

474
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,250
I warn you. Do not make loud noises!

475
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:57,250
♫ Sadly, I always have delusions ♫

476
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,690
♫ Let it be, I'm once again
close to tears ♫

477
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,460
♫ An unfamiliar street,
a cruel heartbeat ♫

478
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,480
♫ Time stops, tears are meaningless

479

♫ All I want is a hug ♫

480
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,550
Tian Yong?

481
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,500
Are you all right?

482
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,420
♫ Drunk on your lips ♫

483
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,660
♫ It's the trickery played by hormones ♫

484
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,290
Will you kiss me within five minutes?

485
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:40,200
♫ The best would be mutual affection,
having good feelings, hiding nothing ♫

486
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,240
Absolutely not!

487
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:46,570
♫ The best would be not answering,
anticipating, avoiding misery ♫

488
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,940
I guarantee it with
my ethic as a soldier.

489
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,410
Then do you

490
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,290
want to

491
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,770
try the taste of my lip balm?

492
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:56,220
♫ Whether we argue or show love,
it does not matter ♫

493
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,860
♫ The best would be
being on the same page ♫

494
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,080
It's a lead-based product.

495
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,250
I'll get poisoned if I eat it.

496
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,040

497

Yes.

520

has been sending me messages.
