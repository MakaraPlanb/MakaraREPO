Captain.

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,360
Captain Liang!

6
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,890
What are you doing here? Leave now!

7
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,210
I'm here to deliver the medicine
and to give you a checkup.

8
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,410
I'm alright. Leave now!

9
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,760
How can you be alright?

10
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,880
Xiao Teng said you haven't slept
for days.

11
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,010
I'm reminding you as a doctor.

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,520
You must take a break now!

13
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,840
No need to!

14
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,920
Just take a break for a few minutes.

15
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,880
Send her away.

16
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,200
Unless you take a break,
I'm not going anywhere.

17
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,000
Captain, why don't you listen to Dr Xia?

18
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,600
So you're aware that
I'm your captain?

19
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,050
Send her away!

20
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,600
Listen, Liang Mu Ze.

21
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,890
You should carry out the mission

22
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,210
on the premise that
you take care of yourself.

23
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,960
You're made of blood and flesh!

24
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,610
I'm an occupational military officer.

25
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,450
I know my own body's condition.

26

Send her away!

27
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,130
Yes!

28
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,470
Don't touch me! Liang Mu Ze!

Cool down.

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,750
Thank you, Brigade Commander Dong.

51
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,470
He's not gentle at all.

52
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,440
You need to reflect upon yourself

53
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,320
for what has happened today.

54
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,360
As long as she stays away from the dyke,

55
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,630
I'll reflect upon myself on anything.

56
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,950
If I don't go to the dyke,
will you take a break?

57
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,450
Is it the right time for a break?

58
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,270
-As I said, your safety...
-Enough!

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,850
How are things going on on your side?

60
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,000
No doubt the water level

61
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,730
at the ten mission areas have reduced

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,840
but the water level at three other areas

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,920
are still above the warning line.

64
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,350
Mission area number two
is the most dangerous one.

65
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,090
What happened?

66
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,430
Don't move. Let me check on him.

67
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,400
He came down with a fever.

68
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,390

Brigade Commander,
the three patients who caught a cold

74
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,159
came down with fevers
higher than 39 degrees Celsius.

75
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,470
They have sore throats,
stuffy noses and body aches.

76
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,710
They also suffer from
coughing and diarrhoea.

77
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,280
Report.

78
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,250
I need to use the outhouse.

79
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,490
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

80
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,870
-Bring him to the outhouse.
-Yes.

81
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,430
Brigade Commander, I must not die.

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,390
I'm the only son in the family.

83
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,950
He is still waiting to hand over
the family business to me.

84
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,150
Cut the nonsense.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,520
Stay in bed.

86
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes.

87
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,120
Can't you confirm the diagnosis by now?

88
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,400
With the equipment that we have,

89
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,370
I can't confirm the diagnosis.

90
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,090
You can report it to the superior
since there are three patients.

91
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,050
It's four.

92
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,640

who has just passed out.

-What's wrong, Xiao Teng?
-I'm having a stomachache.

94

Don't go near him.

95
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,360
Stay back.

besides Dr Wu and me,

103
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,390

has to leave the tent immediately.

104
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,230

-Okay.

I only have one thought.

I would rather be
the person in the casket.

144

I don't want anything
to happen to my comrades.

145
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,550
That's why when we were in Isaia,

146
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,190
when Lieutenant Tian injured himself,

147
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,560
you overreacted.

148
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,590
It's not only because
Tian Yong injured himself.

149
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,170
It's also because of
your reckless behaviour

150
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,510
when we're organising the rescue.

151
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,690
The moment you lifted the robber's gun,

152
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,600
it's no different from committing suicide.

153
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,790
Do you know that?

154
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,850
If I didn't give it a second thought

155
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,190
and fired the gun at you,

156
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,240
I think my career as a military officer
would have stopped then.

157
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,200
I bet the complaint

158
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,520
must have caused you so much trouble.

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,350
I was number one
in the Hunter Military School assessment.

160
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,360
Then, I dropped to number two.

161
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,120

162
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,120

She contracted SARS

[Though she survived the disease,]

173

[her health deteriorated.]

was sent to my house,]

fear

185

is one of the human natures
that we have to get over.

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,230
my urge to play my role as a doctor

188
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,630
at disastrous times is stronger.

189
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,310
I don't want to live with regrets.

190
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,370
As such,

191
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,880
no matter what,

192
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,280
I'll guard the dyke.

193
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,600
I'll stay committed
and dedicated to my job.

194
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,920
I'll complete my duty.

195
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,830
Before my comrades give up,

196
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,320
I'll never give up.

197
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,320
Being committed doesn't mean
you don't have to take care of yourself.

198
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,790
Something bad will happen
if you don't rest well.

199
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,720
Are you worried about me?

200
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,850
Yes.

201
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,050
Why?

202
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,240
Why are you worried about me?

203
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm a doctor, Liang Mu Ze.

204
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,710
I can't stand it when someone
doesn't take care of themselves.

205
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,320
Thank you, Dr Xia.

206
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,390
They're back.

207
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,530
Brigade Commander!

208
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,130
Brigade Commander!

209
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,970
Sir.

210
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,800
It's the W4C9 virus.

211
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,250
No mutation is detected.

212
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,390
The vaccine is already on the way.

213
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,240
The isolation measures
were executed just in time.

214
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,200
We'll wait for the patients
to be vaccinated.

215
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,800
Then, conduct blood tests on the soldiers.

216
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,800
We'll give them a talk
on prevention and control

217
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,040
to prevent further infection.

218
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,610
Let's start working!

219
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes!

220
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,150
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

221
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,840
Carry out full protection!

222
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,810
Yes!

223
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,330
Come with me!

224
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,250
See?

225
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,150
As usual, you hold us up again.

226
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,540
But,

227
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,720
well done!

228
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,150
-Report.
-Come in.

229
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,670
Captain, Xiao Teng's fever is gone.

230
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,870
How is he doing?

231
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,260
He's doing fine.

232
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,430
Xiang Yang is taking care of him.

233
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,270
He's still muddle-headed though.

234
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,390
He kept asking me,

235
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,030
"Where are the angels?"

236
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,560
What angels?

237
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,400
When he came down
with the fever, he thought

238
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,160
Dr Xia had a pair of wings.

239
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,800
Have the medical team left?

240
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,470
Not yet, they're on the dyke.

241
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,470
Brigade Commander wants to send them off.

242
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,920
Let's check it out.

243
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,910
Yes.

244
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,069
Thank you for your help.

245
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,720
-Don't mention it.
-Otherwise, god knows

246
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,280
what would happen to the soldiers.

247
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,609
It's our duty.

248
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,569
Thank you for the hard work.

249
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,150
Salute!

250
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,920
Take care.

251
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,290
I'll wait for you to come home.

252
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,230
All thanks to the doctors,

253
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,830
especially Dr Xia.

254
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,320
She looks fragile

255
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,150
but she takes her job so seriously.

256
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,440
Not only is she professional,

257
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,160
she is also kind-hearted.

258
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,360
She is such a nice lady.

259
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,800
What do you think, captain?

260
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,640
What's wrong? Are you having insomnia?

261
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm exhausted physically
but my brain keeps me awake.

262
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,590
These are my first sleeping pills
since I came here.

263
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,320
Every medicine has its side effects.
Don't...

264
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,570
What's wrong?

265
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,070
Something is wrong with the pills.

266
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,150
It looks like an effervescent tablet.

267
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,560
It dissolves in the water right away.

268
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,160
It melts in water.

269
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,840
At ease! Attention!

270
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,710
Look to the left!

271
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,680
Eyes front! At Ease.

272
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,000
Attention!

273
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,670
Later, according
to the order from the superior,

274
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,920
besides the injured soldiers
who are recuperating,

275
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,270
the rest who are
from combat battalion and Special Forces

276
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,320
are going to Zone Four.

277
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,850
Team Nine of the Special Forces Brigade
will stay back

278
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,280
as the reserve team, just in case.

279
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,520
Got it?

280
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,630
Yes!

281
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,840
It's the same formula.

282
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,430
The smell is so familiar.

283
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,590
Are you done being sentimental?

284
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,400
Dr Zhang.

285
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,600
How does leading a surgery feel?

286
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,030
Just like a nightmare, it's exciting!

287
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,610
Great.

288
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,160
Get ready to enter the theatre.

289
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,480
Now?

290
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,690
The heart transplant
which was scheduled earlier

291
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,130
had been postponed.

292
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,810
Of course, if you're not keen
to take part in it,

293
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,000
you may skip it.

294
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,990
I want to join.

295
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,960
-Sure.
-Dr Zhang.

296
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,700
Yes?

297
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,470
Xiao Xiao performed well too.

298
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,120
So?

299
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,850
She would like to watch

300
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,600
the heart transplant surgery.

301
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,560
Can both of us

302
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,730
enter the theatre together?

303
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,870
It's full.

304
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,760
There's only one vacancy
for a houseman.

305
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,840
Is there any question?

306
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,110
No.

307
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,120
All right, hurry up.

308
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,040
-In the next round...
-I won't thank you.

309
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,590
Next time, it'll be me.

310
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,690
This place

311
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,670
is a battlefield for patients.

312
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,430
It's also a battlefield for doctors.

313
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,730
Everyone who enters this place

314
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,270
is fighting for survival.

315
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,680
For life,

316
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,710
dignity,

317
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,970
responsibility,

318
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,400
and the irreplaceable
sense of accomplishment at work,

319
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,360
we put ourselves in tight spots
over and over again.

320
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,830
We fight hard against the God of Death.

321
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,730
If I chose the path

322
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,720
because of youth's passion,

323
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,990
then being persistent
throughout the journey

324
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,800
is because I have faith in the profession.

325
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,150
As the saying goes,

326
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,850
"The one who wants to wear a crown"

327
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,640
"must bear the weight."

328
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,190
I'm looking for a birthday present
for our daughter.

329
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,490
You told me

330
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,710
she likes dolls, right?

331
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,070
She doesn't like it anymore?

332
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,710
All right, I got it.

333
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,150
What is it? Say it.

334
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,170
No, no way!

335
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,710
It's not the right time.

336
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,130
When I'm done with my work,

337
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,550
I'll pay her a visit.

338
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,160
I don't know when I can get it done.

339
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,400
Stop speaking in English!

340
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,560
I don't understand English.

341
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,960
Listen...

342
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,690
Li Lei.

343
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,040
Rao Zhi, we found something.

344
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,030
Okay, got it. I'm coming back.

345
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,670
How is it?

346
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,450
Rao Zhi.

347
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,320
The information is provided by
the Intelligence Bureau.

348
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,290
Xiong

349
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,690
has been scrutinised by the narcotics
squad for a long time.

350
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,250
They suspect that his business

351
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,560
is just a camouflage.

352
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,890
He supplies
a type of Chinese shrub, Ephedra

353
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,210
which is one of the ingredients
to produce crystal meth

354
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,560
to drug cartels abroad.

355
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,510
Have the narcotics squad taken any action?

356
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,850
Not yet.

357
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,130
They haven't figured out

358
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,520
the mode of communication
and the transaction channel

359
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,770
between Xiong and the purchasers.

360
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,530
Just like us,

361
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,550
they're monitoring him.

362
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,360
Channel?

363
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,270
The City of Desire?

364
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,950
[Completing invasion]

365
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,460
[Please send the information
to my mailbox.]

366
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,160
Xiao Xiao, let's hang out tonight.

367
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,070
I can't make it. I'm on duty.

368
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,830
How about Xiao Chu?

369
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,000
I'll pass. Something happened at home.

370
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,730
I heard that front line flood fighters

371
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,120
have left the disaster area.

372
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,530
I guess your beloved military officer

373
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,120
is coming home, right?

374
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,710
He's not mine.

375
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,160
As for his whereabouts,

376
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,390
you have to ask him.

377
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,970
Goodbye, everyone.

378
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,230
Have fun!

379
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,240
She's so impatient.

380
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,150
Welcome home, Captain Liang.

381
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,590
I left my key in the military camp.

382
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,940
Take it.

383
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,820
What is this?

384
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,430
Give me a hug.

385
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,910
You bought custard steamed buns!

386
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,470
Yes, I crave it.

387
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,080
That's why I bought an extra portion.

388
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:32,950
♫ Heart is filled
with your little company everyday ♫

389
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,440
Finally you're back.
I've missed you so much!

390
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:43,020
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence there is no regrets ♫

391
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,790
♫ Getting used to your habits
from breakfast to dinner ♫

392
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,570
♫ Spending every minute to stay with you ♫

393
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,080
Liang Mu Ze.

394
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,550
You should smile more frequently.

395
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,240
You look quite handsome when you smile.

396
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,070
How shallow.

397
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,030
Come join me for dinner
after you have unpacked.

398
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,190
♫ Liking your habits,
remembering small moments ♫

399
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,490
♫ Infecting sorrows with smiles ♫

400
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,700
♫ Getting used to what you like,
trying to be brave ♫

401
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:24,030
♫ Liking becomes natural
and turns into a habit ♫

402
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:35,780
♫ Even though it's simple, my heart
still fills with deep emotion for you ♫

403
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,600
I do look quite handsome.

404
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,150
How long will it take?
Should I start cooking?

405
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,110
You may cook now! I'm almost done!

406
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:45,460
♫ We're trying to keep it natural
and romantic at the same time ♫

407
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:55,530
♫ Every time we slow down,
the whole world is filled with love ♫

408
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:05,520
♫ Can't miss a thing about you,
hence the path is simple yet dazzling ♫

409
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,290
♫ Liking your habits,
remembering small moments ♫

410
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,890
♫ Infecting sorrows with smiles ♫

411
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,140
♫ Getting used to what you like,
trying to be brave ♫

412
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:27,260
♫ Liking becomes natural
and turns into a habit ♫

413
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,980
By the way,

414
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,070
I prepared some pills for you.

415
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,170
Take one tablet
when you're having insomnia.

416
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,610
Don't overdose.

417
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,030
Every medicine has its side effects.

418
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,330
What's wrong?

419
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,040
Something is wrong with the medicine.

420
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,520
I'll leave Er Miao with you. Let's go.

421
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,920
Custard steamed bun will be ready soon.

422
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,350
Did you cook those dishes?

423
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,870
No, they're cooked by Ms Snail.

424
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,070
What a lame joke.

425
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,200
I love cooking.

426
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,280
Why?

427
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,800
Human heart is located above the stomach.

428
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,960
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

429
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,110
Is it scientifically proven?

430
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,930
Please trust the professional judgment

431
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,150
of a cardiac surgeon.

432
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,950
So much for professional judgment.

433
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,350
Have some soup.

434
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,830
[Have you taken the pills I gave you?]

435
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,370
[I took one.]

436
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,300
[You...]

437
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,600
[Did you notice anything?]

438
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,240
[What is it?]

439
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,760
You're indeed a straight guy.

440
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,770
Nothing.

441
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,800
How many days will you stay?

442
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,250
I'm going back to
the military camp tomorrow.

443
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,970
All your comrades are back, right?

444
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,990
Yes, they're back.

445
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,260
Good to hear that.

446
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,080
I was under the impression

447
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,750
doctors take life and death lightly.

448
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,120
I don't know about others

449
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,290
but I...

450
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,880
I don't have the talent
to take it lightly.

451
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,160
When I was undergoing rotation
at the Obstetrics Department,

452
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,560
there was an old pregnant woman.

453
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,880
She couldn't give birth to the baby.

454
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,110
She held my hand and said,

455
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,040
"Doctor, it's too painful."

456
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,870
"I don't want to do it anymore."

457
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,510
Two minutes later,

458
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,470
she passed away due to
amniotic fluid embolism.

459
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,310
Her husband

460
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,000
while carrying the newborn

461
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,560
burst into loud sobs.

462
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,080
I never knew

463
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,400
a man could cry for so long.

464
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,120
That was the first time

465
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,320
I witnessed the death of a patient.

466
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,530
Until now, I still vividly remember

467
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,510
the moment she lied
on the operating table.

468
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,610
I always feel that a hand

469
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,390
is holding me down.

470
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,400
No matter how difficult it is,

471
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,950
she motivates me to run forward.

472
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,570
[I'm sorry.]

473
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,680
Five years ago, I went to Yunnan
for residency training.

474
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,030
I received a phone call from home

475
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,550
informing me that
my grandma was terminally ill.

476
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,680
I applied for leave and rushed home.

477
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,830
When I reached home,

478
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,320
my grandma was already unable to talk.

479
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,560
However, when she saw me,

480
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,680
she got agitated. She cried non-stop.

481
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,690
I don't think I would ever

482
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,030
understand how she felt.

483
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,200
I didn't know what to do.

484
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,910
I didn't know what I could do.

485
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,510
I sat at the bedside.

486
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,800
I held her hand

487
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,670
and sang her a song.

488
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,840
So, my grandma passed away

489
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,950
as I sang.

490
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,450
Then, I could feel the warmth of her palm

491
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,840
slowly disappearing.

492
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,430
In the end, it turned completely cold.

493
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,310
But at that moment,

494
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,310
I was really calm.

495
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,330
Yes.

496
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,550
Calm.

497
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,210
[Why are we talking about this]

498
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,920
[all of a sudden?]

499
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,800
You started it first.

500
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,250
However,

501
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,239
it's okay to talk about it.

502
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,350
Military officers and doctors

503
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,000
are two occupations

504
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,280
that are close to death.

505
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,800
We understand death.

506
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,800
That's why we cherish the moment.

507
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,270
When we're alive,

508
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,520
we won't miss out on
any wonderful moments.

509
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,210
Am I right?

510
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,190
You are afraid of missing out.

511
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,950
Do you want some?

512
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,990
Does it go well with Chinese cuisine?

513
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,110
I like it.

514
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,480
We deserve to take a well-earned break.

515
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,030
We can have some liquor.

516
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,910
Just a sip.

517
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,510
Bourbon Whiskey.

518
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,190
It's Matthew's favourite drink.

519
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,170
Who is that?

520
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,790
He's a detective
in Lawrence Block's novel.

521
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,790
When I was in high school,

522
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,920
a new student joined our class.

523
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,630
He sat beside me.

524
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,640
Under his influence,

525
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,840
I started reading detective novels.

526
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,910
He said

527
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,360
he wanted to be a detective novelist.

528
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,120
However,

529
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,270
due to the harsh reality,

530
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,430
he didn't realise his dream.

531
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,870
He said he wanted to be
a National Defence Student

532
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,120
and contribute to society
by joining the special forces.

533
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,490
Back then,

534
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,200
no matter what he said or what he did,

535
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,870
I always thought that he was right.

536
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,240
However, one day,

537
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,070
he disappeared from school.

538
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,880
I couldn't find him anywhere.

539
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,030
I didn't know where to find him.

540
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,880
I couldn't do anything besides reading

541
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,950
the detective novels he got me one by one.

542
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,150
Then, I bought more novels from
the book store.

543
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,590
I even hoped that

544
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,890
one day,

545
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,310
in one of the detective novels,

546
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,800
I could see his name, Zhuo Ran.

547
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,800
He is now neither a novelist
nor a military officer.

548
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,030
He set up a 3D printing company.

549
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,760
He's now a business owner.

550
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,110
I have retained a habit of his

551
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,400
in my own life.

552
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,920
However, I was already 18

553
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,710
and our high school memories

554
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,230
were gone for good.

555
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,830
[How about you, Liang Mu Ze?]

556
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,590
Do you practice

557
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,880
someone else's habit?

558
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,980
No.

559
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,800
Your life

560
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,380
is so boring.

561
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,100
Because of his ambition,

562
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,980
you're not interested
in military officers, is that it?

563
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,890
What do you mean?

564
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,260
The other day,

565
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,020
you told him,

566
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,700
for a very long time,

567
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,620
you couldn't even stand the phrase,
"special forces soldier,"

568
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,540
let alone seeing one.

569
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,260
You eavesdropped on me?

570
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,260
No, I didn't.

571
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,620
I can read lips.

572
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,580
Just a bit.

573
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,300
However, I could understand what you said.

574
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,220
Cheers.

575
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,540
Good morning.

576
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,120
Good morning.

577
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,540
Did you stay awake
for the whole night again?

578
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,160
What say you?

579
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,000
You look energetic.

580
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,500
You have sharp eyes.

581
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,930
You're not humble at all, Braised Egg.

582
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,080
What?

583
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,650
I'm complimenting your head shape.

584
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,900
Thank you for the compliment.

585
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,020
What are you looking for?

586
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,700
"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders."

587
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,700
You're still reading it?

588
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,100
Didn't I tell you the ending?

589
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,660
I'll never get sick of reading you.

590
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,690
It feels like spring when I read you.

591
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,970
What are you saying?

592
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,220
I'm talking about the book.

593
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,620
What were you thinking?

594
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,180
It was on the shelf.

595
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,260
Where is it?

596
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,220
Do you have any plans later?

597
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,820
No, I don't have any plans.

598
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm going to chill in the morning
before going to the hospital.

599
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,850
Let's take a stroll
at the furniture store.

600
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,580
I want to change some of the furniture.
Give me some suggestions.

601
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,540
Sure.

602
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,450
♫ The sky is smiling
and my heart is fluttering ♫

603
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,860
♫ Time stops as we're surrounded
by happiness ♫

604
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,610
♫ I always have the urge
to hold you in my arms ♫

605
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,340
♫ Though we argue at times ♫

606
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,020
♫ Though we fight at times ♫

607
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,910
♫ We chit-chat the whole night through ♫
♫ ​The sweetness is just right ♫

608
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,190
♫ We share the same taste in food ♫
♫ The sweetness is just right ♫

609
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,630
♫ No one knows
what triggered our first fight ♫

610
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,960
♫ When we think back, love is a wonder ♫

611
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,910
Xia Chu.

612
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:24,710
♫ Our encounter is not too old school ♫
♫ The amount of happiness is just right ♫

613
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,680
♫ Our connection is not too boring ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

614
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,260
♫ No one ever notices
your smiling lashes ♫

615
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:41,380
♫ We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

616
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,660
Slow down.

617
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,700
It's so comforting.

618
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,170
Finally it doesn't look like
a sample house.

619
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,420
Er Miao, come on, try out the new couch.

620
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,130
Er Miao!

621
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,620
You're not giving me face.

622
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:03,910
♫ The sky is smiling
and my heart is fluttering ♫

623
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,230
♫ Time stops as we're surrounded
by happiness ♫

624
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,930
♫ I always have the urge
to hold you in my arms ♫

625
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,410
♫ Though we argue at times ♫

626
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,020
I think I'm out of favour.

627
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,350
♫ Though we fight at times ♫

628
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,320
Like this?

629
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,340
-Like this?
-Yes.

630
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,930
♫ We chit-chat the whole night through ♫
♫ ​The sweetness is just right ♫

631
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,020
It's quite nice.

632
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,210
♫ We share the same taste in food ♫
♫ The sweetness is just right ♫

633
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,500
Come here.

634
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,660
♫ No one knows
what triggered our first fight ♫

635
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,450
One, two, three!

636
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,850
♫ When we think back, love is a wonder ♫

637
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:43,620
♫ Our encounter is not too old school ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

638
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,720
♫ Our connection is not too boring ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

639
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,410
♫ No one ever notices
your smiling lashes ♫

640
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,140
♫ We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

641
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,980
What are you doing?

642
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,820
Do you want some?

643
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,460
You haven't lost all your conscience.

644
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,770
Why are you laughing?

645
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,460
Nothing.

646
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,700
You can't have it unless you tell me.

647
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,030
I suddenly recalled the first time

648
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,770
we had custard steamed bun in the store.

649
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,260
I had the urge to squeeze the custard

650
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,860
onto your face.

651
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,300
It's never crossed my mind.

652
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,060
Here.

653
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,200
Liang Mu Ze, that's inhumane!

654
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,310
Don't move!

655
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,300
Go back!

656
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,370
I didn't see anything.

657
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,380
The memory has been deleted.

658
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,420
I'll go get changed. Clean up the mess.

659
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,460
By the way,
don't forget to clean the litter.

660
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,620
Why?

661
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,450
Fine, I'll do it.
