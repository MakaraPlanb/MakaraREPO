Where's the anaesthetist?

181

There are many wounded people today.
We don't have enough manpower.

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,220
Pump it back

197
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,190
through the jugular vein.

198
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,100
Very good.

199
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,070
Open the chest.

200
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,510
It's here, I found it.

201
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,230
The bullet pierced

202
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,150
through the pericardium
and visceral layers from the edge

203
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,150
and embedded in the myocardium.

204
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,390
Luckily,

205
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,510
it didn't pierce the heart.

206
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,150
There's only a thin crack

207
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,580
in between.

208
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,550
This guy is very lucky.

209
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,070
Tweezers.

210
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,020
No wonder the blood

211
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,990
is not gushing.

212
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,540
It slowly seeps in instead.

213
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,910
It gives us ample time to rescue him.

214
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,950
-We are lucky.
-Haemostat.

215
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,630
What's wrong? Feeling dizzy?

216
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,510
No.

217
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,830
I'm just a little scared.

218
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,070
Relax.

219
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,710
Let me tell you.

220
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,150
There was an officer who suffered

221
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,070
a more serious injury than him.

222
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,110
He was shot twice and had stab wounds.

223
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,950
Fractures too.

224
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,430
After the surgery,

225
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,990
he recovered in half a year.

226
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,350
And

227
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,710
without any side effects.

228
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,190
Good, hold it.

229
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,430
Good, hold it.

230
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,990
Okay.

231
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,910
We've done it.

232
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,910
Okay.

233
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,430
Needle.

234
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,150
Good. It's completed.

235
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,060
Fifteen minutes faster

236
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,180
than estimated.

237
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,870
What do you think?

238
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,630
Do you think I'm good?

239
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,550
You are my idol.

240
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,670
Okay.

241
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,470
When you go back, don't forget

242
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,950
to introduce

243
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,070
a girlfriend to me.

244
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,670
Okay.

245
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,030
How was it?

246
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,990
The operation was very successful.

247
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,830
After the observation period,

248
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,550
I'll send him to ICU.

249
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,910
If he gets through today,

250
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,510
he shouldn't have any problem.

251
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,180
He still needs to endure today?

252
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,350
I drank it.

253
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,710
I am thirsty.

254
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,950
Captain Liang.

255
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,550
When he stabilises,

256
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,550
I suggest

257
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,190
you send him back immediately.

258
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,830
The conditions here aren't ideal.

259
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,350
Okay.

260
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,060
We've sent

261
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,470
your comrade to the ICU.

262
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,350
Wait.

263
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,830
Listen to me first.

264
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,150
I don't have time to listen to a fool.

265
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,750
What?

266
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,460
Because of your crazy action,

267
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,900
my friend was shot.

268
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,510
I'm very sorry

269
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,030
about your friend.

270
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,460
But you know exactly

271
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,510
what happened.

272
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,950
When that terrorist

273
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,900
tried to shoot,

274
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,740
I was really worried

275
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,220
more people would get hurt.

276
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,060
That's why

277
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,940
I tried to stop him.

278
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,820
We were carrying out a rescue mission.

279
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,900
As a hostage, you just stay where you are.

280
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,070
I know.

281
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,190
But the situation was changing rapidly.

282
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,790
I was trying to help.

283
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,190
We don't need your help.

284
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,750
We are trained soldiers.

285
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,300
This is our battlefield.

286
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,940
As a hostage, you only need

287
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,340
to stay calm and cooperate.

288
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,590
What were you thinking?

289
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,660
You are a professional soldier.

290
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,980
I am a professional doctor.

291
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
I'm a soldier too.

292
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,790
I knew that terrorist was injured.

293
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,430
I made a judgement call.

294
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,980
I thought I could stop him.

295
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,310
What was the result?

296
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,150
A bullet pierced his heart.

297
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,630
I'll take care of him in ICU.

298
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,910
I'll make sure he is all right.

299
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,350
Maybe I didn't keep my cool.

300
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,390
I didn't do well.

301
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,220
Once again, I'm sorry.

302
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,190
But I want to let you know.

303
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,460
It's your battlefield

304
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,670
and mine too.

305
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,870
I always try my best to help.

306
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,030
Did you bandage the terrorist's wound?

307
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,620
Yes.

308
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,990
You did your utmost to save the terrorist,

309
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,380
they tried their best to kill us.

310
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,300
I've already told you.

311
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,550
This wasn't my intention.

312
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,830
At that moment,

313
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,740
he was an injured man

314
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,870
who needed help.

315
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm telling you, this is a battlefield.

316
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,180
An enemy on the battlefield
is an enemy indeed.

317
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,420
The Geneva Conventions

318
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,340
must be obeyed.

319
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:04,860
I've taken

320
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,260
the Hippocratic Oath.

321
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,180
Unless I get an order from my superior,

322
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,030
my specialization

323
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,030
requires me to save
who is in mortal danger.

324
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,350
I don't care about that.

325
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,180
You are

326
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,900
not qualified to be a soldier

327
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,870
nor a doctor.

328
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,670
What?

329
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,710
Apologise to me.

330
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,510
Are you crazy?

331
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,030
You must apologise to me.

332
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,230
You can't insult my specialization.

333
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,990
You can't question...

334
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,030
What're you doing?

335
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,030
Release me.

336
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,190
You're a crazy man!

337
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,390
Come back.

338
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,470
Let go of me.

339
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,830
Come back.

340
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,510
Which unit are you from, 2467?

341
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,150
Come back, let go of me.

342
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,910
I'll make a complaint.

343
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:28,170
[One week later.
Special Forces Brigade in Ningjiang]

344
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,390
Brigade Commander.

345
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,550
Brigade Commander.

346
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,030
So?

347
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,070
Have you reflected on your problem?

348
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,500
Yes.

349
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,140
Then tell me.

350
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,110
I represent China mainland's
special forces

351
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,590
in the Hunter Military School.

352
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,900
I'm one of the 14 soldiers

353
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,470
who have completed all subjects,

354
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,190
but I'm ranked number two.

355
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,380
My grades are poor.

356
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,990
-That's all?
-That's all.

357
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,350
Fine, you can continue to stay.

358
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,270
Yes, there is more.

359
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,180
Say it.

360
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,190
There's also that doctor's complaint
about me.

361
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,710
What about?

362
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,990
It has spread throughout the war zone.

363
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,750
You tied up a doctor

364
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,550
from the medical team in Isaia.

365
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,630
What have you done, Liang Mu Ze?

366
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,670
No, Sir.

367
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,060
Tian Yong almost died

368
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,140
because of her.

369
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,110
She's a hostage you must protect.

370
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,150
Brigade Commander.

371
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,630
As a joint operations commander,

372
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,060
I must ensure

373
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,350
the safety of the hostages

374
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,420
and

375
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,590
of my comrades.

376
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,860
So, you mean you are right?

377
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,710
You did nothing wrong, correct?

378
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,420
No, Sir.

379
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,150
Calm down.

380
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,750
Watch your blood pressure.

381
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,230
Don't make excuses.

382
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,470
Watch your behaviour.

383
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,550
I've completed my self-reflection report,
Brigade Commander.

384
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,150
Liang Mu Ze.

385
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,990
Do you really

386
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,430
admit your mistake this time?

387
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,110
Yes, I do.

388
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,110
-If I do it again...
-It's fine.

389
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,420
Do 500 push-ups.

390
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,860
Go home

391
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,300
after you have completed them.

392
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,310
Continue to reflect.

393
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,790
-Yes.
-And

394
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,870
after completing

395
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,390
Tian Yong's hospitalisation,

396
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,260
-return to the unit.
-Yes.

397
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,470
[My son.]

398
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,670
[Mr Dong said he approved your leave.]

399
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,630
[That's great.]

400
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,260
[You should think about]

401
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,830
[your personal issues.]

402
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,460
[By the way,]

403
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,510
[we found you a housemate.]

404
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,750
[It's my friend's child.]

405
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,830
[I hope
you can get along with each other.]

406
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,220
How are you?

407
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,790
I'll visit you one day.

408
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,750
Can you share the table?

409
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,230
I have no choice.

410
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,070
Don't worry about me.

411
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,710
I never hear anything.

412
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,550
I don't know.

413
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,270
He can share the table.

414
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,590
I don't know.

415
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,910
Thank you.

416
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,470
Can I take your order?

417
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,950
Let me have a look.

418
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,270
Talk to you later.

419
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,630
Goodbye.

420
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,110
Don't pretend.

421
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,620
If you want to apologise,
wait till I'm done.

422
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,590
Apologise?

423
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,830
Are you apologising to me?

424
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,750
Were you punished?

425
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,190
Are you upset?

426
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,510
It's fine.

427
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,470
Men grow up in blows.

428
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,550
I don't want to share the table.

429
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,630
You can leave.

430
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,710
This is my table.

431
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,270
Then leave with your table.

432
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,470
Are you ready to order?

433
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,580
-Yes.
-Okra.

434
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,550
Chicken.

435
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,550
Tofu.

436
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,900
Salted egg yolk bun.

437
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,710
Okay.

438
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,740
We have one bun left.

440
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,230
He ordered it first.

441
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,950
Put it here.

442
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,420
What's wrong?

443
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,260
What's wrong?

444
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,940
It's my boyfriend.

445
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,990
My boyfriend choked on the beef.

446
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,870
Put him over the back of the chair.

447
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,380
No.

448
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,380
Punch him.

449
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,340
A hollow punch.

450
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,950
Punch where?

451
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,910
In the stomach.

452
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,870
How are you?

453
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,870
Thank you.

454
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,150
It feels good.

455
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,389
What a poor kitten.

456
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,070
Why are you here?

457
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,909
Were you abandoned?

458
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,949
Do you want me to bring you home?

459
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,230
[Bring me home, miss.]

460
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,350
I don't have my own place.

461
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,750
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,429
Goodbye.

463
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,110
I don't care.

464
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,230
Let's take a bath.

465
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,540
It's very cute, for real.

466
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,710
[No, it's not.]

467
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,460
[Do you know how many parasites]

468
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,430
[a cat has?]

469
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,270
I have de-wormed it.

470
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,070
No.

471
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,030
That house was lent to you

472
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,190
by Mu Min.

473
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,340
I know, I know.

474
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,590
I'll be very careful.

475
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,990
I remember locking it.

476
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,670
[What did you say?]

477
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,830
I'll talk to you later, Mum.

478
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,750
Xia Chu.

479
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,190
[Oh my, what a handsome man.]

480
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,150
It's you.

481
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,310
Why are you here?

482
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,180
This is my house.

483
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,270
Are you Mu Min's son?

484
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,350
Yes.

485
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,420
Didn't you say

486
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,100
the house was vacant?

487
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,140
Liang Mu Ze appeared

488
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,590
when I moved in.

489
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,710
[Isn't that normal?]

490
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,870
[He is the actual owner.]

491
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,550
If you aren't willing,

492
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,950
you can move out.

493
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,340
[Move again?]

494
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,870
[I just moved in.]

495
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,270
I've moved multiple times

496
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,870
since I graduated.

497
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,420
Xia Chu is a girl.

498
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,340
Of course,

499
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,310
she's a girl.

500
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,870
Didn't I tell you?

501
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,910
You said he's a guy.

502
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,460
[When did I tell you he's a guy?]

503
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,140
[I don't care.]

504
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,270
[She already stopped
renting her old place.]

505
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,540
[Furthermore,]

506
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,870
[do you want to see her
live on the street?]

507
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,950
They have a hostel in the hospital.

508
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,910
The application time is already over.

509
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,710
Or

510
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,150
you can come home.

511
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,940
You can be a doctor here.

512
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,270
Why would you go to such a faraway place?

513
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,630
You should know.

514
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,660
When I married your dad,

515
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,110
her mum came to help me

516
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,230
in Dong'an.

517
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,710
What does it have to do with me?

518
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,940
You can take care

519
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,470
of each other.

520
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,750
It's a complicated society outside.

521
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,220
[You have two choices.]

522
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,980
[You can choose to stay,]

523
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,180
[or you can come back to Dong'an.]

524
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,550
[It's no use.]

525
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,740
When I bought the house,

526
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,510
I wanted you to get married soon.

527
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,030
I heard

528
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,350
her son

529
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,750
is an officer.

530
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,270
How does she look like?

531
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,350
Is she pretty?

532
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,950
What are you thinking, Mum?

533
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,750
What do you think?

534
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,390
Or...

535
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,670
[I can get your grandfather
to inquire about him]

536
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,470
[in his unit.]

537
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,380
Miss Lan.

538
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,110
Don't create problems for me.

539
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,740
It's my problem.

540
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,670
I can solve it myself.

541
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,380
Do you want some noodles?

542
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,550
Yes, I do.

543
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,990
You forgot to add salt.

544
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,950
I did add it. A little bit.

545
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,740
Too much salt is not healthy.

546
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,830
Not more than 5g per person every day.

547
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,190
Xia Chu.

548
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,230
I must talk to you.

549
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,430
Wait until I'm done.

550
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,230
This is my lunch.

551
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,590
I'm going to the hospital.

552
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,070
What do you want to discuss?

553
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,830
First of all, which room do you stay in?

554
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,270
This one.

555
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,670
Are you sure?

556
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,270
Mu Min told me I can use

557
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,310
the bathroom in the master bedroom.

558
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,180
So, when you are not home,

559
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,150
occasionally,

560
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,260
only once in a while,

561
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,940
I can use your bathtub.

562
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,070
Secondly.

563
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,540
What's this?

564
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,150
[Don't be so rough.]

565
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,550
[You are hurting me.]

566
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,500
Don't hold it this way.

567
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,820
It'll be scared.

568
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,590
It's a cat that I picked up.

569
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,670
You can keep the cat,

570
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,700
but I don't want to see

571
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,180
any faeces in the room.

572
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,470
No fur and no smell.

573
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,700
Don't worry,

574
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,100
cats are cleaner than humans.

575
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,390
Thirdly,

576
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,190
you can use my bathroom.

577
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,630
But you must pack things up.

578
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,190
Is this yours?

579
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,820
My memory padded bra.

580
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,310
I thought I lost it.

581
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,430
Where was it?

582
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,830
In my dryer.

583
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,590
It's so dirty.

584
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,990
Okay.

585
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,150
Lastly, number four, which is also

586
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,740
the most important.

587
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,710
Listen clearly.

588
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,790
Move out from here

589
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,310
in one week time.

590
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,710
What?

591
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,790
Move out.

592
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,500
You ate my noodles just now.

593
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,460
Have you forgotten?

594
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,030
I remember. It wasn't tasty.

595
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,950
Do you really want me to move out?

596
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,580
Why did you

597
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,140
talk so much just now?

598
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,670
Just go straight to the fourth point.

599
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,460
To see

600
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,670
your shocking look.

601
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,310
It feels good.

602
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,470
I can pay the rent.

603
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,670
I don't need money.

604
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,990
Liang Mu Ze.

605
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,940
If you can't afford one,

606
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,910
tell me.

607
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,950
I'll find you a moving company.

608
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,070
Liang Mu Ze.
