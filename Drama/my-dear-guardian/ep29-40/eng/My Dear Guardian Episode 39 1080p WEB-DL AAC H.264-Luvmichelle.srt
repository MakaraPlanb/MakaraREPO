8
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,880
Her cardiac function is weak.

9
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,259
The ventricular wall is thin.

10
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,160
It may rupture at any time.

As for the liver and kidneys,

21
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,640
as he's been injected with drugs
when he's alive,

22
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,930

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,480
varying degrees of damage.

Now,

29
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,120
the main issue is

30
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,840
the recipient of the heart.

The most critical patient

35
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,760
is Zhuo Mei Qin who was admitted
on the day before yesterday.

36
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,440
However, based on
the information provided by the police,

she's the mother

38

was one of the accomplices in the gang

41
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,010
which Tian Yong worked
as an undercover agent in.

42
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
Her son committed a crime.

43
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,200
It's nothing to do with the mother.

is another thing.

49
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,450
To Tian Yong and his family,

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,560
it's too cruel.

He doesn't have a family.

I have no idea.

77
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,840
However, it must be someone
who is in dire need of his heart.

78
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,960
Someone needs his heart.

79
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,920
That's great.

80
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,450
However, he's gone.

Dr Chen as soon as possible.

95
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,440
That's my duty.

96
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,040
You've worked hard.

97
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,600
Many knives see blood

98
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,520
when they're used to murder a person.

99
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,640
However, only the scalpel

100
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,880
sees blood when it saves people.

101
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,840
Why do you come to the hospital?

102
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,400
Are you not feeling well?

103
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,500
No.

104
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,520
We're here to send Tian Yong off.

105
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,660
In that case,

106
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,240
where are you going?

You must be hungry, right?

113
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,080
I saw Xia Chu just now.

114
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,180
She's still busy at work.

115
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,640
I think it'll take a long time.

116
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,690
Why don't we find a place

117
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,200
for some food?

118
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,500
Mum.

119
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,480
I'm hungry.

120
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,320
This is the restaurant.

121
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,810
After entering the restaurant,

122
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,079
you guys may get a table first.

123
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,140
Okay.

124
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,839
Let me know what you'd like to eat.

125
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,220
I'll get the food.

126
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Let me do it.

127
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,839
You have no idea what I like.

128
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,140
Let's go.

129
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,680
-Let's sit here.
-Sure.

130
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,400
Xiao Jun has grown taller.

131
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Yes.

132
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,240
Kids grow really fast.

133
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,480
I heard from Xia Chu that

134
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,160
you're going to Beijing soon.

135
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,580
The first draft of my script
has been approved.

136
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,530
I enjoy working with

137
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,160
the company too.

138
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,100
Coincidentally,

139
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,560
a classmate of mine

140
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,850
went to the company.

141
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,920
He's in charge of production.

142
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,500
He wants to take me in.

143
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,520
I think

144
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,080
I can give it a try.

145
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,440
What about your bookstore?

146
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,120
My parents have just retired.

147
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,610
I'll leave the bookstore to them

148
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,120
so that they have something to do.

149
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,600
Will Xiao Jun go along?

150
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,180
Yes.

151
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,610
I've found a boarding school for him.

152
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,200
It's great.

153
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,290
As a script writer,

154
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,530
you'll get more opportunities in Beijing.

155
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,680
Yes.

156
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,720
How about you?

157
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,920
Are you all right?

158
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,500
I mean is your body all right?

159
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm all right.

160
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,560
Well,

161
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,120
I won't die any sooner.

162
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,530
I met Dr Zhang today.

163
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,650
Which Dr Zhang?

164
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,490
Dr Zhang Yi Chi

165
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,840
who was initially a heart surgeon.

166
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,920
You mean the one
who contracted Hepatitis B, right?

167
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,960
That's a shame.

168
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,130
I think

169
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,520
he's not as handsome as before.

170
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,880
How about his former girlfriend?

171
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,240
Which girlfriend?

172
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,130
Who else?

173
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,800
I only know Li Juan.

174
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,650
Isn't their relationship

175
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,490
going on and off for a few years?

176
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,970
Then, a married lady with a son

177
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,480
ruined their relationship.

178
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
Are you serious?

179
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,980
Let me tell you.

180
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,500
I was under the impression
that they broke up

181
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,840
because Dr Li went abroad.

182
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,160
It's true.

183
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,530
For a short period of time,

184
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,320
that lady went to the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery very frequently.

185
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,010
She claimed that
the son was getting treatment

186
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,920
but she was actually going after Dr Zhang.

187
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,530
Later, when she found out Dr Zhang

188
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,920
contracted Hepatitis B,

189
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,720
she left immediately.

190
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,690
She's so materialistic.

191
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,850
No wonder Dr Li resigned.

192
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,620
If I were here,

193
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,760
I would leave too.

194
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,960
I think

195
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,690
it's not about falling out of love.

196
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,850
It's absolutely

197
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,600
a humiliation.

198
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm sorry.

199
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,480
Sorry to interrupt.

200
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm Zhang Yi Chi.

201
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,480
I heard your conversation.

202
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,140
It seems that

203
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,210
all of you are quite concerned
with my love life.

204
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,560
Dr Zhang.

205
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,240
We...

206
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,840
You have nothing better to do.

207
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,840
If

208
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,520
your work life is going well

209
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,370
and your love life

210
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,850
is going smoothly,

211
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,200
I'll forget about it.

212
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,160
However, if your own life is a mess,

213
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,320
then please

214
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,500
don't pry into

215
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,000
other people's private lives, okay?

216
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,170
All of you are just my former colleagues.

217
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,340
You're not my mum!

218
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,800
Why are you worried for me?

219
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,320
Xiao Jun.

220
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,660
Here.

221
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,440
You're right.

222
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,360
No doubt she is

223
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,600
married.

224
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,080
Furthermore,

225
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,200
she has a son.

226
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,320
Her lover sacrificed eight years ago.

227
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,320
He's a martyr.

228
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,720
Listen.

229
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,760
It's because of
the sacrifices made by the martyrs,

230
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,360
we get to

231
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,360
live in peace.

232
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,220
That's why you have the privilege

233
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,420
to sit here

234
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,120
and gossip about others.

235
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,640
Compared to those martyrs,

236
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,640
I am nothing.

237
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,880
You're

238
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,560
even worse than nothing.

239
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,400
Keep your nose
out of someone else's business!

240
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,240
Let's go, Xiao Jun.

241
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,840
No, I haven't eaten.

242
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,440
I'll buy you a feast.

243
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,370
Xiao Jun, let's go.

244
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,400
Are you not going to wait for Xia Chu?

245
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,970
Send me a text message

246
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,200
when you reach home.

247
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay.

248
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,320
Can I ask you a question?

249
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,160
What is it?

250
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,520
Why Dr Li and you

251
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,080
didn't get together in the end?

252
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,040
How should I put it?

253
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,760
Perhaps both of us

254
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,280
thought that we were too smart.

255
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,440
We thought too much.

256
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,050
We were too cautious.

257
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,250
We were afraid of getting hurt.

258
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,360
We were afraid it might not work out.

259
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,520
And so,

260
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,970
it didn't work out.

261
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,240
I'm not afraid.

262
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,810
Our flight

263
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,760
is next Friday, at 3 p.m.

264
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,090
Have a safe journey.

265
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,360
Sure.

266
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,440
Come here.

267
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,440
Listen.

268
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,960
You're a man.

269
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,280
You should know what you should do.

270
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,770
[Outpatient Department]

271
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,210
Thank you.

272
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,770
Who received Tian Yong's heart?

273
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,770
You're still here.

274
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,200
I've just completed the procedure.

275
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,840
When the military truck is here,

276
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,880
we'll send him back.

277
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,640
Will there be a memorial service?

278
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,680
The organisation is making arrangements.

279
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,520
Where will he be buried?

280
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,170
The Martyrs' Cemetery.

281
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,400
He will be Luo Liang's neighbour.

282
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,040
You haven't answered my question.

283
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,040
I can't answer the question.

285
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,650
Organ donation

286
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,800
has to be carried out
in strict confidence.

287
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,360
The identity
of the donor and the recipient

288
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,320
should not be revealed.

289
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,240
Is it Zhuo Mei Qin?

290
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,740
I saw both of them

291
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,360
go into the theatre together.

292
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,720
All I can say is,

293
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,290
today's the first time

294
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,520
I feel upset

295
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,890
over a successful surgery.

296
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,320
You've worked hard, Dr Xia.

297
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,580
[We have mastered]

298
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,440
[the evidence
of Lu Wen Long's criminal activities.]

299
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,200
[There's nothing much you can say.]

300
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,080
If you insist on keeping quiet,

301
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,210
then you'll lose the chance.

302
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,360
How is my mum doing?

303
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,560
The surgery was a success.

304
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,780
A week later,

305
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,290
she will be discharged from the ICU.

306
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,240
How did you ascertain my identity?

307
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,440
We found out through
the clips from the TV station.

308
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,800
Later, when you barged
into the drill site,

309
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,560
a foreign military officer recognized you.

310
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,810
According to him,

311
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,520
when Pei Yu
served as a foreign military officer,

312
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,320
he had a heart attack
for unknown reasons.

313
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,420
It's such a coincidence.

314
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,940
When you came back

315
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,010
in Zhuo Ran's name,

316
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,600
you had a heart attack too.

317
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,660
Then, we obtained a report

318
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,760
from the hospital where Pei Yu was born.

319
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,090
We found that one of the pregnant ladies

320
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,360
was Zhuo Mei Qin.

321
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,400
She gave birth to a pair of twins.

322
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,200
Initially, we suspected

323
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,800
you're the twin brother

324
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,120
of the deceased, Pei Yu.

325
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,360
Later,

326
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,680
when we searched through
the underground of your company,

327
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,170
we found that the password to the door

328
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,400
was set as

329
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,400
910218.

330
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,320
That's Pei Yu's birth date.

331
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,450
Compared to Zhuo Ran

332
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,280
who was born at midnight
on February 29,

333
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,880
he was born three minutes earlier.

334
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,000
You can pretend all you want

335
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,540
but your subconscious

336
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,960
has betrayed yourself.

337
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,560
Hence, we assume that

338
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,610
in the crossfire
which happened eight years ago,

339
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,850
Zhuo Ran died

340
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,330
but you survived.

341
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,480
Pei Yu.

342
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,490
[I have told you everything]

343
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,880
[that you want to know.]

344
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,850
Now let me ask you a question.

345
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,440
You are the founder of City of Desire,

346
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,800
Scary Pirate.

347
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,240
Am I right?

348
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,040
Yes.

349
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,960
Why did you build the platform?

350
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,160
It's due to loneliness.

351
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,960
Loneliness?

352
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,890
It's unfair.

353
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,280
[I am the only person in the dark.]

354
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,400
[I'm drowning.]

355
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,010
The order in the world

356
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,040
ought to be changed.

357
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,680
The internet

358
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,920
is a fascinating soul.

359
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,880
However, inherent to it

360
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,840
is an ugly flaw.

361
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,130
I'm the person who found the flaw

362
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,160
and made good use of it.

363
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,840
If everyone is a criminal,

364
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,160
then committing crime

365
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,240
is not a lonely journey.

366
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,920
Just like you.

367
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,800
You eliminate sins

368
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,810
to get acknowledgment.

369
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,340
However, once the acknowledgment

370
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,240
ceases to exist,

371
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,880
you will become depraved too.

372
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,440
Becoming depraved together

373
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,920
is a wonderful experience.

374
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,660
Wonderful?

375
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,880
Yes.

376
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,360
Those people who died in the suicide game

377
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,770
must be

378
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,290
really thankful for me.

379
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,610
Turns out this is

380
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,360
how you hypnotise yourself.

381
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,660
I can tell you without hesitation.

382
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,080
To me,

383
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm not eliminating sins
to get acknowledgment.

384
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm doing it for my wife and daughter.

385
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,780
Even though everyone is against the idea,

386
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,520
even though they don't understand it,

387
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll still do the same.

388
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,720
That's because I'm a husband

389
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,260
and a father.

390
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,460
I want them

391
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,650
to live a safe and peaceful life

392
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,960
under the sun.

393
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,320
Even if everyone commits crime,
it doesn't mean you have to do it.

394
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,080
It also doesn't mean that
I will tolerate criminals.

395
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,050
For a scum like you,

396
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,040
I'll arrest you every time I see you.

397
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,680
I won't let go of you.

398
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,840
I'm a scum.

399
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,920
[Have you ever thought about it?]

400
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,330
[One day soon,]

401
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,850
[when your mother wakes up]

402
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,880
[and find out about the things
that you have done,]

403
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,440
[how would she feel?]

404
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,970
You...

405
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,010
Don't agitate her.

406
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,280
Then tell me Lu Wen Long's whereabouts.

407
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm not sure of that.

408
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,240
However, I know that

409
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,850
he has a hiding spot in the country.

410
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,960
Where is it?

411
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,770
I can bring you there.

412
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,010
Whale.

413
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,960
The target is approaching the port.

414
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,159
Got it. We're ready.

415
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,400
I don't believe that
he would work with us.

416
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,000
Boss is waiting for you.

417
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,980
Old Master.

418
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,300
I'm here.

419
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,450
What took you so long

420
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,080
since you have obtained the information?

421
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,480
I need to shake off the Chinese armed
forces who have been following me.

422
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,220
Have you done that?

423
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,650
I found a scapegoat.

424
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,960
Where is the thing?

425
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,690
How is my mum doing?

426
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,880
She's doing well.

427
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,210
She's waiting for you to go home.

428
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,200
Hu.

429
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,680
Don't do that.

430
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,810
I thought

431
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,760
you wouldn't give me the chance.

432
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,050
Am I so not reasonable?

433
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,650
As long as you listen to me...

434
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,280
I've always been obedient.

435
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,800
Let me do it.

436
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,640
After my dad died,

437
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,330
I've been treating you

438
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,160
as my spiritual father.

439
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,810
I risked my life for you.

440
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,210
I killed for you.

441
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,480
The list goes on.

442
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,000
I did everything

443
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,120
hoping to live a stable life in exchange.

444
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,880
I want my mum to live well.

445
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,160
The signal is gone.

446
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,370
Something is wrong.

447
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,690
They must have found out about us.

448
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,000
That's why they block the signal.

449
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,050
Attention!

450
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,010
Move!

451
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,120
I've been so careful.

452
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,480
I've been staying low to the ground.

453
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,440
I'm worse than a dog.

454
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,600
However, it's not enough for you.

455
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,800
You hope that I can be like my father

456
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,880
who died without a resting place.

457
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,680
Am I right?

458
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,400
I've told you many times.

459
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,800
Your father

460
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,970
was killed by the Chinese armed forces.

461
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,680
When the accident happened,

462
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,720
to be honest, I was very upset.

463
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,960
However,
the Chinese armed forces told me that

464
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,200
the person who shot my dad to death

465
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,560
was you.

466
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,210
The Chinese armed forces?

467
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,640
They told you that?

468
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,720
Why?

469
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,280
What do you think?

470
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,000
It's to instigate me for sure.

471
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,930
You're already surrounded by them.

472
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,980
Old Master.

473
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,680
You must be crazy.

474
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,090
If you kill me,

475
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,130
your mum won't live any longer.

476
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,320
Where is my mum?

477
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,440
Tell me!

478
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,650
All this while,

479
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,600
you've been controlling me with my mum.

480
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,600
I've had enough of it!

481
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,970
Let me tell you.

482
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,400
Without me,

483
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,410
you and your mum

484
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,720
would have died a hundred times!

485
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,490
Just like your scum of a father,

486
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,000
you're not being grateful!

487
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,640
Let me tell you.

488
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,250
All these years,

489
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,360
I treated your father like my own brother.

490
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,570
I brought wealth to him.

491
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,360
I shared prosperity with him.

492
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,360
However, behind my back,

493
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,440
he attempted to steal my goods!

494
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,800
I gave him a chance.

495
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,840
However, he refused to return the goods.

496
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,960
I really...

497
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,560
I really gave him a chance.

498
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,100
He pushed me too hard!

499
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,880
He deserved it!

500
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,800
Let me tell you.

501
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,530
If you kill me,

502
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,770
the Chinese armed forces

503
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,520
will not let you off.

504
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,160
So,

505
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,440
it's true that you killed my dad.

506
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,120
Zhuo Ran.

507
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,170
I'm getting old.

508
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,040
You're the only person who I can trust.

509
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,440
You're overly ambitious

510
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,650
but you've never let me down

511
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,240
in any way.

512
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,690
Am I right?

513
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,600
I've decided.

514
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,360
If we ever escape,

515
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,200
I'll pass everything to you.

516
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,720
Okay?

517
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,800
All mine?

518
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,320
Yes.
