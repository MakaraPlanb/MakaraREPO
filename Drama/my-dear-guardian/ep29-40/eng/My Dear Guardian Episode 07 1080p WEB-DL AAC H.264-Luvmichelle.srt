-About the...
-How did you know Xia Chu?

14
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,470
We started as Internet friends.

15
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,610
I found an article

16
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,610
she wrote on the Internet

17
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,760
about her first love.

18
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,360
At that time,

19
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,840
I was about to graduate from university.

20
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,890
I couldn't find a job yet.

21
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,390
Quota for postgraduate studies
had all been filled up.

22
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,610
My boyfriend wanted to break up with me.

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,090
I was extremely depressed.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,470
But after reading her article,

25
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,660
I was inspired.

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,380
I replied to her article.

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,640
Then, we started texting
each other on WeChat.

28
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,880
Later on, we arranged a meet-up.

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,490
It's kind of weird.

30
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,810
Although our age gap

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,180
is quite big

32
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,180
and our personalities are so different,

33
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,290
but somehow we had

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,270
endless topics to talk about
every time we meet.

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,450
Maybe it's because

36
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,170
we are both brilliant individuals

37
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,840
and role models of outstanding
contemporary young women?

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,340
Hence we empathize and admire each other.

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,610
Did she ever mention to you about...

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,420
You?

41
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,870
Yes.

Me.

43
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,410
Of course she did.

44
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,460
She told me a lot

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,170
about your past with her.

46
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,230
What happened after that?

47
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,390
Was she in a new relationship?

48
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,730
She had a relationship
during her university years

49
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,630
but it ended very soon.

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,350
She was too busy.

51
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,430
Too busy?

52
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,010
Perhaps it was because she was too busy.

53
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,290
Perhaps it was because of other reasons.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,270
Perhaps it was because of you.

a younger special operations force.

190
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,420
All the young officers
in the special force

191
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,930
signed up for the position

192
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,570
of captain.

193
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,610
[After many rounds of tests,]

194
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,270
[it was down to Luo Liang]

195
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,970
[and me.]

196
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,380
[How did it go?]

197
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,690
[I lost to him.]

198
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,430
Why didn't you attend

199
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,580
our first training this afternoon?

200
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,630
I was tired so I didn't want to go.

201
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,180
No matter how tired you are,
you're still the lieutenant.

202
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,730
Bond with the team and train warriors.

203
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,020
The entire brigade is watching us now.

204
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,810
No matter how tired you are,
you have to endure it.

205
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,950
In that case, I'll withdraw
from Team Thunder tomorrow.

206
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,930
I don't care who becomes the lieutenant.

207
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,440
Now that I'm Team Thunder's captain,

208
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,530
you are dissatisfied?

209
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,800
Answer me.

210
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,110
Yes, I am.

211
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,010
Didn't you see the test results?

212
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,000
What makes you captain? Tell me.

213
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,990
What makes you?

214
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,030
The way you're behaving now
says that I'm more worthy.

215
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,490
You're not fit to be
captain of Team Thunder.

216
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,859
You don't even have the basic qualities

217
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,050
of a soldier.

218
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,250
Shut up.

219
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,280
I don't need a lecture from you.
Get lost.

220
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,359
As a soldier,

221
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,819
you rise from where you fall

222
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,440
on the battlefield.

223
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,410
Taking things personal like this,

224
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,720
giving others your attitude
and giving up on yourself

225
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,210
make you a coward.

226
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,650
Do you feel better now?

227
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,250
Get up. Let's continue.

228
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,150
No.

229
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,770
You've already wasted a lot of energy
punching the sand bag today.

230
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,770
If we continue to fight,
I won't win fairly.

231
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,610
How are you so sure that you'll win?

232
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,590
We'll become rivals for a lifetime,
won't we?

233
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,370
There's still a long way to go.

234
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,770
We don't have to do this now.

235
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,400
The Brigade Captain told me that

236
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,730
you're a good sword.

237
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,810
But you still need to be sharpened.

238
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,570
It might do you good

239
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,130
that you're not captain.

240
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,890
Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,

241
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,900
gather for indoor close-quarters combat.

242
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm busy. You can proceed without me.

243
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,420
Don't you dare.

244
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,950
Sir.

245
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,430
Lieutenant of Team Thunder,

246
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,570
code name Whale, requests to return.

247
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,920
Fall in.

248
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,190
From today onwards,

249
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,370
not a single soldier here

250
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,400
will be left behind.

251
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,970
Do you hear me?

252
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,000
Only death will keep us apart.

253
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,260
Xiao Jun's mother said

254
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,540
you went on a mission together.

255
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,870
Yes.

256
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,290
We went on a mission together

257
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,430
but he didn't return.

258
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,690
He was the only one who didn't return.

259
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,810
As usual,

260
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,650
write your will and
the receiver's address.

261
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,290
Submit it before you disembark.

262
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,920
Captain, aren't you going to write one?

263
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,930
Meng Zhen doesn't want to do it. She said
she'll be waiting for me to go home.

264
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,290
Is she going to deliver soon?

265
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,290
One more month to go.

266
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,010
If I don't make it back,

267
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,580
you guys have to look after

268
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,410
the baby and her for me.

269
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,350
Don't worry.

270
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,450
Your son is also my son.

271
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,840
In your dreams!

272
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,950
Your parents are also my parents.

273
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,050
Your pet is also my pet.

274
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,050
Do you remember that poem we recited

275
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,770
during the joint activity?

276
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,190
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, Captain!

277
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,550
You start.

278
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,550
Yes, Captain.

279
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,080
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

280
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,970
Ready and go!

281
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,770
Why do you say I am bare?
With this armour we share.

282
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,490
To war we are summoned,
So prep our weapon.

283
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,330
[We'll fight against one foe.
Why do you say I am bare?]

284
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,040
Why do you say I am bare?

285
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,030
Why do you say I am bare?

286
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,500
Are you okay?

287
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,790
I want some honey drink.

288
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll go get it.

289
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,320
[Here you go. I made soup too.]

290
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,380
Sister-in-law, let me do it.

291
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,200
-How does it taste?
-It's delicious.

292
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,950
-You like the taste?
-It's so delicious.

293
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,380
-Eat more if you like it.
-It's so good.

294
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,130
Go help out in the kitchen.

295
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,250
Yes.

296
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,900
I have more coming up.

297
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,110
Don't tire yourself out.

298
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,430
Take a seat, sister-in-law.
I'll get them.

299
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,100
Alright.

300
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,780
Help me with this.

301
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,750
Give it to me.

302
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,510
-Put them here.
-I'll do it.

303
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,500
Take a seat.

304
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,220
This soup looks good. You made this?

305
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,840
Yes. It took me the whole afternoon.

306
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,050
Let me do it myself.
They're looking at us.

307
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,540
We are used to it already.

308
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,500
So what if they are looking?

309
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,060
I'm just being a good role model.

310
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,250
When they get married and have a family,

311
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,970
they must know how to love their wives.

312
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,730
Captain, teach me will do.

313
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,740
Our Lieutenant doesn't
need help with that.

314
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,610
After being admitted
into the military hospital,

315
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,680
he received a huge sack of love letters.

316
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,360
Food can't shut you up.

317
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,350
Are you envious?

318
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,980
Good for you, you little punk.

319
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,930
Nothing catches your heart
in that sack of love letters?

320
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,020
That's not it.
It's just that I'm still young.

321
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,250
I'm not in a hurry.

322
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,280
[You're not but I am.
Sister-in-law.

323
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,150
Can you introduce someone to me?

324
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,850
Sure. I'll match you up with someone.

325
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,160
What kind of girl do you like?

326
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm shy to say this but
I really don't ask for much.

327
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,950
As long as

328
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,510
she's as pretty as you.

329
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,150
Isn't that asking for too much?

330
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,930
How should I say this...

331
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,670
In order to meet my wife,

332
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,050
I gave up half of my life.

333
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,940
Great.

334
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,810
Captain Luo is talking

335
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,100
very weirdly today.

336
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,420
I'm not used to it.

337
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,690
That's because I'm happy.

338
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,560
I'm becoming a father soon.

339
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,250
This is a big news!

340
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,150
It's great news!

341
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,990
Here's to you, sister-in-law.

342
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,740
Alright.

343
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,330
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

344
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,450
I want to have a word with you two.

345
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,730
After this meal today,

346
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,620
I want you to really train yourself hard.

347
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,860
Not only train yourself,

348
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,170
but everyone in our team too.

349
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,690
We can't be all form but no substance.

350
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,510
We must demand of ourselves
actual combat standard

351
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,160
Don't go easy.

352
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,860
Don't go soft. Don't be lenient.

353
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,800
I hope everyone

354
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,810
is sturdy and indestructible.

355
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,500
I hope everyone come back safely

356
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,250
after every mission.

357
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,170
I want to see results, not accidents.

358
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,840
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, Captain.

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,140
-Let's toast.
-Here.

360
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,020
Cheers to my wife. You've worked hard.

361
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,700
I just finished my work.

362
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,840
Place your order first.

363
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,470
Once I arrive, we can start eating.

364
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,640
I am sorry.

365
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,050
It's okay.

366
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,200
Is Zhuo Ran's family member here?

367
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,200
Yes.

368
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,890
-You're Zhuo Ran's kin?
-Yes.

369
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,040
Zhuo Ran?

370
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,150
That's right.

371
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,860
Patient experienced
ventricular tarchycardia.

372
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,340
We've checked the cardiac markers.

373
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,460
Myoglobin and troponin have
substantially increased.

374
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,570
Patient's condition has stabilised now,

375
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,910
but he's still unconscious.

376
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,370
I suspect that
it's a heart-related problem.

377
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,460
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?

378
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,940
Can you hear me?

379
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,090
Xia Chu.

380
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,990
Xia Chu.

381
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,300
Xia Chu.

382
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,490
He knows Xia Chu?

383
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,520
Xia Chu.

384
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,470
Did this happen before?

385
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,470
I'm not sure about that.

386
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,210
I just got to know him recently.

387
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,710
It's for work.

388
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,170
When this happened,
what was he doing?

389
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,300
Eating and talking.

390
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,870
Everything was normal?

391
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,680
Yes.

392
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,260
While we were eating,

393
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,720
he received a phone call.

394
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,440
After that, his mood changed.

395
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,800
He passed out before I got a chance

396
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,030
to ask him what happened.

397
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,410
-Have you done the imaging test on him?
-Not yet.

398
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,540
Here's the thing.
Since his family member is not present,

399
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,450
we can only let the doctor decide about

400
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,010
his treatment plan.

401
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,170
As his friend,

402
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,900
can you sign the letter of permission?

403
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,970
-I can.
-Alright.

[Don't forget to get her a present.]

421
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,160
[Alright.]

422
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,010
Present?

423
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,670
What should I get her?

424
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,140
Have you found the origin of

425
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,520
the blue diamond on the cane?

426
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,550
Investigate it quick.

427
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,160
I can't leave.

428
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,580
He's still in the emergency room.
No one is here but me.

429
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,550
I have to accompany him.

430
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
You must be worried.

431
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,260
I'm hanging up.

432
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,600
How is it? Is it serious?

433
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,440
We found a problem
based on his electrocardiogram.

434
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,570
However, it's not a typical
pattern of myocardial infarction.

435
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,190
We'll wait for
the cardiology doctor to arrive

436
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,060
and do a radiography
on his coronary artery.

437
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,620
I'm sorry.

438
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,810
There's an emergency here.

439
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,380
A patient in the emergency room
is in need of an operation.

440
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,010
I'm held up by the director.

441
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,110
Alright.

442
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,640
Okay. Let's meet up another time.

443
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,630
I am sorry for holding you up.

444
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,930
It's just a small matter.

445
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,290
Actually, I'm also a friend of Zhuo Ran.

446
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,330
But if you still feel bad about it,

447
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,690
you can add me on WeChat

448
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,650
as a consolation.

449
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,020
I'll scan your code.

450
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,990
Sure.

451
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm Zhang Yi Chi, a cardio surgeon.

452
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,580
You are?

453
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,670
I'm Mi Gu.

454
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,670
Nice to meet you.

455
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,310
[Miss Mi Gu, what's the update
on your proposal?]

456
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,810
[The director is asking about it again.]

457
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,090
Good morning.

458
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,960
How did I fall asleep?

459
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,440
You'll have to ask yourself.

460
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,100
After I poured you
a cup of honey drink,

461
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,220
you were already fast asleep.

462
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,690
I couldn't even wake you up.

463
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,060
How do you feel?

464
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,160
Does it feel good to
sleep through the night?

465
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,740
Alright now, Captain Liang.
You should go wash up.

466
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,380
Come and have your breakfast
after you're done.

467
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,570
Start repenting later.

468
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,220
I made the yogurt and jam myself.

469
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,380
It's all natural.

470
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,010
Wholemeal slices and nuts

471
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,190
can protect your mucosa
and blood vessels that were damaged

472
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,780
after exposing to tear gas.

473
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,750
And of course,

474
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,650
this freshly-blended mixed fruits juice

475
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,690
that is rich in Vitamin C

476
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,040
and Vitamin B.

477
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,490
They work as a lubricant

478
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,060
to speed up the detoxification process.

479
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,450
The top choice for defeating poisoning.

480
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,250
A good day starts with good breakfast.

481
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,540
Let's do it, Captain Liang.

482
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,140
You were more adorable last night.

483
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,280
That's enough, Xia Chu.

484
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,340
I'm serious.

485
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,630
I thought

486
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,410
you lack emotion

487
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,720
and nothing can touch you heart.

488
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,860
But after listening to
what you said last night...

489
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,210
I didn't say anything.

490
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,680
Nothing at all.

491
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,640
Fine.

492
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,740
I made an appointment for you

493
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,130
with the psychiatrist in my hospital.

494
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,950
What?

495
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,690
Send me to work at nine o'clock today

496
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,930
and then go for your appointment.

497
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,750
I'm busy. I have training.

498
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,820
Isn't your training over?

499
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,810
I don't need to see a psychiatrist.

500
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,950
Of course you do.

501
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,130
Although you're from the special forces,
you're still a human.

502
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,130
If you want to sleep in peace at night...

503
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,910
Liang Mu Ze.

504
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,090
Look what I've got.

505
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,409
Meow. Let me take a look too.

506
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,330
Will you go now?

507
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,639
You're threatening me.

508
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,850
Yes.

509
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,150
Alright. I got it.

510
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,280
Dr Li, you want to see me?

511
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,320
The radiography report of the
patient who experienced

512
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,699
a sudden ventricular tachycardia is out.

513
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,699
He has been transferred
to cardiology ward?

514
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,020
There is no vacant bed yet.
I'll get him transferred

515
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,980
once someone gets discharged.

516
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,010
Okay.

517
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,640
I'll check at the emergency department.

518
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,970
Hold on.

519
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,370
You bailed on your parents again?

520
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,690
How did you know?

521
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,600
Your mother told me.

522
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,490
She wants me to remind you

523
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,410
to have your meals regularly.

524
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,550
I realised that you're
becoming more virtuous lately.

525
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,160
Men like women like that, don't they?

526
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,900
It seems like my effort

527
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,690
as training partner is not in vain.

528
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,570
You've grown up.

529
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,370
Of course I have to.

530
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,770
That's great.

531
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,010
Let's meet at the same place
this weekend. I'll be waiting for you.

532
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,130
Where is that?

533
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,290
You're awake. Are you feeling better?

534
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,640
Where is Xia Chu?

535
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,640
I haven't contacted her yet.

536
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,480
Do you want to eat something?

537
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,810
I'll go buy some food for you.

538
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,470
Can you get me a bottle of mineral water?

539
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,440
Okay, I'll buy you some porridge too.

540
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,890
You haven't eaten anything
the whole night.

541
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,870
You must be hungry.

542
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,160
There's a stall selling steamed buns
opposite the hospital.

543
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,450
The steamed buns are especially delicious.

544
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,970
I'll buy you some.

545
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,410
Thank you.

546
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,250
I'll be right back.

547
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,710
Seeing a psychiatrist

548
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,140
is not a big deal.

549
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,640
It's just like talking
to a hole in a tree.

550
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,790
Let me tell you this.

551
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,860
Human brains are

552
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,940
just like a container

553
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,820
filled with different emotions.

554
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,170
Sometimes, you'll have to empty it out.

555
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,030
If you don't,

556
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,770
it will explode.

557
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,540
I'm getting off now.

558
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,510
Liang Mu Ze,
you must attend the appointment.

559
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,670
You must.

560
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,890
You really must.

561
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,690
Make way please.

562
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,230
Xia Chu?

563
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,670
Xia Chu.

564
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,780
Mi Gu.

565
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,250
-Xia Chu.
-Mi Gu.

566
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,990
Xia Chu.

567
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,200
Mi...

568
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,050
-Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.
-What?

569
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,680
Zhuo Ran is in the emergency room.

570
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,840
The radiograph of your left ventricle
and coronary artery

571
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,100
shows no sign of infarction.

572
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,250
We can eliminate the possibility of
myocardial infarction.

573
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,850
However, we've found that

574
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,590
at the apex of your heart,
most of the ventricles don't contract.

575
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,940
From the radiography, a swollen ventricle
that looked like a wilting octopus is seen

576
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,640
and the markers of myocardial damage

577
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,370
has started to increase.

578
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,140
It means

579
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,550
death of heart muscles.

580
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,250
Judging by your current condition,

581
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,810
I can say that the dizziness

582
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,970
and chest-pain is all due to

583
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,500
stress cardiomyopathy.

584
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,900
Stress cardiomyopathy?

585
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,730
You've always been healthy.

586
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,140
You even wanted to
get into a military school.

587
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,770
How can you have stress cardiomyopathy?

588
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,540
Xia Chu.

589
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,820
This condition

590
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,080
is usually caused by

591
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,520
intense emotional or physical stress.

592
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,660
For example,

593
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,030
a shock,

594
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,490
deep fear

595
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,770
or a sudden loss of a loved one

596
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,390
which can cause an epilepsy attack.

597
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,450
In your case, it's because
of a phone call.

598
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,880
I want to talk to Xia Chu

599
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,270
in private.

600
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,540
No problem.

601
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,700
Don't get worked up.

602
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,990
Do your ward rounds

603
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,690
-20 minutes later.
-Yes.

604
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,770
Liang Mu Ze.

605
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,570
Why are you here?

606
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,810
I'm looking for someone.

607
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,740
Is it Zhuo Ran?

608
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,730
No, Xia Chu.

609
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,400
Why is everyone asking for her today?

610
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,120
-Who else did?
-Director Zhang.

611
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,770
I just got a call
from Cardio Surgery Department.

612
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,700
They need you to check on ward 18.

613
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,310
Alright, I got it.

614
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,530
I'll get back to work now.

615
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,490
She is in that ward.

616
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,520
Go on.

617
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,730
I met Mi Gu just now.

618
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,380
She told me you're in the hospital.

619
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,560
She sent you here?

620
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,550
You were together last night?

621
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,630
What's with the phone call?

622
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,080
You have to tell me, Zhuo Ran.

623
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,600
What did you call me just now?

624
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,860
Zhuo Ran.

625
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,500
You still remember this person,

626
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,240
don't you?

627
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,160
Of course I do.

628
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,290
What are you saying?

629
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,450
You do remember.

630
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,030
You should also remember

631
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,650
those weekends you spent together,

632
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,280
those detective novels you read together,

633
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,450
the path you took together after school,

634
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,810
that bottle of water,

635
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,530
that diary

636
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,450
and the never-ending letters
you wrote each other.

637
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,610
All those memories

638
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,600
were your past with Zhuo Ran.

639
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,680
It's Zhuo Ran.

640
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,010
Xia Chu, it's Zhuo Ran.

641
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,150
It's Zhuo Ran.

642
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,650
Calm down, Zhuo Ran.

643
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,770
-You can't get up...
-This.

644
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,660
This part of me

645
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,640
almost stopped beating

646
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,020
just now.

647
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,130
It's because

648
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,860
I was sad

649
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,960
that you forgot Zhuo Ran.

650
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,860
I need to do my ward rounds now.
I'll visit you later.

651
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,960
That comrade...

652
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,170
Don't be with him.

653
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,580
Are you kidding me?

654
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,610
It can't be him.

655
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,880
Anyone can misunderstand
my relationship with him,

656
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,170
but not you.

657
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,960
For a very long time,

658
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,490
I can't even stand
hearing the words,

659
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,610
special force.

660
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,320
Let alone getting into a relationship.

661
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,640
You should know the reason.

662
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,100
Xia Chu.

663
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,510
Why are you here?

664
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,900
It was in the car?

665
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,840
I'm so forgetful.

666
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,530
Sorry for causing you trouble.

667
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,990
Thank you.

668
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,830
Where are you going?

669
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,710
I'm going to visit Xiao Jun.

670
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,290
Have you seen the psychiatrist?

671
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,010
I am talking to you.

672
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,980
-No, I didn't.
-Why?

673
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,330
I don't want to.

674
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,210
Liang Mu Ze,
do you still want the photo?

675
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,770
It's up to you.

676
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,680
[Where are you?]
