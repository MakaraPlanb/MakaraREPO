[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,560
Do you practise like this often?

5
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,440
Of course. It's my daily routine.

6
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,930
From the day I was kicked out
of the operating room

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,400
by my supervisor for shoddy suturing.

8
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,040
Every day.

9
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,060
[Mr Xia]

10
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,820
[Mr Xia]

11
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,090
Dad.

12
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,920
I just saw the news.

13
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,840
Something bad happened to
a doctor in your department.

14
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,570
How are you?

15
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm fine.

16
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,520
Are you really fine or are you
just pretending?

17
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,560
[Don't keep the bad news to yourself.]

18
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,530
I'm fine, really.

19
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,770
That's good to hear.

20
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,680
Are you off work?

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,760
[Send me Liang Mu Ze's home address.]

22
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,320
What are you going to do?

23
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,210
I'll wait for you there.

24
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,200
Pack up your stuff and bring them out.

25
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,400
You're coming back to Dong'an with me.

26
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,130
No way.

27
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,520
[Why not?]

28
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,570
[Whatever I say goes.]

29
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,220
[Listen,]

30
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,730
[if you don't resign]

31
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,880
and come back with me,

32
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll visit your workplace every day.

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,970
[And call your superior every day.]

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,290
How can you do that?

35
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,480
You're being militant.

36
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,250
I'm an adult.

37
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,690
[Even if you're 80 years old,]

38
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,730
[you're still my little girl.]

39
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,960
I can't stand by and watch you
jump into the fire.

40
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,280
[Look here missy,]

41
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,200
[you'd better listen to me.]

42
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,329
[This is for your own good.]

43
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,460
Did you hear what I said?

44
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,220
[Can you give me some time?]

45
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,250
I promise I'll

46
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,600
straighten things out at work.

47
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,930
Xia Chu.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,280
Please, can you stop pressuring me?

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,160
Xia Chu.

50
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,370
Aren't you supposed to be sending
Meng Zhen home?

51
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,690
I did.

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,010
I'm here to fetch you.

53
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,280
How did you know I was still
at the hospital?

54
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,800
Call it a hunch.

55
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's go home.

56
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,980
Are you going back to the camp?

57
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,680
Do you know when you'll be redeployed?

59
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,810
Soon.

60
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,320
You should get inside.

61
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,720
Is something wrong?

62
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm thinking of

63
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,200
transferring back to Dong'an.

64
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,930
Have you made up your mind?

65
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,640
Today was so tiring.

66
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,320
Not just physically,

67
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,080
but emotionally, too.

68
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,440
Dr Zhang is such a brilliant surgeon.

69
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,000
But from now on,

70
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,600
he'll never step into another
operating theatre again.

71
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,490
He gave us

72
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,090
a hell of a pep talk today.

73
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,730
But still, I feel awful.

74
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,280
For a moment, I felt

75
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,120
what's so great about being a doctor?

76
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,090
Compared to spending time
with our parents,

77
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,320
wearing a white coat

78
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,720
or a set of fatigues

79
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,920
means very little.

80
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,240
If that's how you feel,

81
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,360
then go for it.

82
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,960
But if you don't truly believe in it,

83
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,900
you shouldn't let anyone

84
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,410
influence your life decisions.

85
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,840
I really mean it.

86
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,540
Really.

87
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,150
Very well.

88
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,800
This is so conservative.

89
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,170
It doesn't look feminine at all.

90
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,050
I'm not going to wear this.

91
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,960
Sister-in-law, you're back.

92
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,730
I bought a bunch of stick-on
tattoos online.

93
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,690
They're super realistic.

94
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,690
No bad guys will come near us now.

95
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,120
Let me tell you...

96
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,730
I'll show my brother

97
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,410
I can protect myself just fine

98
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,080
and he shouldn't be paranoid.

99
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,780
Going on a business trip?

100
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,320
No. I'm moving out.

101
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,679
Moving out?

102
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,520
[Xia Chu is moving out.
Come back, pronto.]

103
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,820
Stop. Don't go.

104
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,580
Don't go.

105
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,410
Xiao Xue, calm down.

106
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,370
Mu Ze, she's going away!

107
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,690
She's going away!

108
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,090
Put the boxes back.

109
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,250
Liang Mu Ze,

110
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,450
those are my boxes.

111
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,600
Those are my luggage, Liang Mu Ze.

112
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
Let go of me, Liang Mu Ze.

113
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,240
Sick of white coats
and fatigues, are you?

114
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,210
That's right.

115
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,370
Liar.

116
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,730
If you really are,

117
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,850
you wouldn't have given me that drivel.

118
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,740
You weren't sure

119
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,640
because this isn't what you want.

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,730
You said those words

121
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,050
not for me, but for yourself.

122
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,450
You were trying to convince yourself.

123
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,490
You decided to transfer and move back
for no reason

124
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,560
other than your father coerced you
over the phone.

125
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,080
You're avoiding the issue.

126
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,060
Xia Chu,

127
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,040
some things in life

128
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,440
you just have to face
no matter how much it hurts.

129
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,810
This is such a thing.

130
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,080
There's no use running away.

131
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,060
You can avoid

132
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,440
the issue now, but what about
the future?

133
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,090
You'll regret it, you know that?

134
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,280
I don't think so.

135
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,490
How dare you accuse me
of running away?

136
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,490
I'm not trying to run away.

137
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,180
Quitting my job is my idea.

138
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,620
It's what I want.

139
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,330
It's how I honestly feel right now.

140
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,210
I'm an adult.

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,410
I know what I'm doing.

142
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,700
You don't have to lecture me.

143
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,850
I hate the way you label people

144
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,250
as if you know better.

145
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,250
Who are you to me?

146
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,080
Do you have the right to control me?

147
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,730
Who am I to you?

148
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,020
Who am I to you?

149
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,450
You're nobody to me!

150
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,660
Go back to your camp.

151
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,960
I don't want to see you again.

152
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,240
Let go!

153
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,960
Let go, Liang Mu Ze.

154
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,890
Let go!

155
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,980
Let go of me.

156
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,420
I can't take it anymore!

157
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,080
Break it up, you two!

158
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,090
Listen to yourselves.

159
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,520
It's like an idol drama.

160
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,380
Liang Mu Ze,

161
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,140
what are you babbling on for?

162
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,100
Just say, "Xia Chu, please don't go."

163
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,100
"I love you."

164
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,010
"I was a lazy bum"

165
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,810
"who wouldn't touch a broom"

166
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,620
"yet I learned to bake for you."

167
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,380
"Do you know why?"

168
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,810
"Because I love you!"

169
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,410
And you, Sister-in-law.

170
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,130
How can you be so oblivious?

171
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't you love him, too?

172
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,690
It was in this very living room

173
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,970
that Liang Mu Ze kissed you

174
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,020
and sent you to seventh heaven.

175
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,280
There's no way you don't love him.

176
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,780
Do you two know what the odds

177
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,450
of finding true love in one's life are?

178
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,500
1 to 280,000!

179
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,690
The odds are nearly nil,

180
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,890
yet you two found each other.

181
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,020
Why can't you

182
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,570
cherish each other?

183
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,170
Why do you oldies

184
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,120
need a little girl like me to lecture you?

185
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,530
Be honest with yourselves, will you?

186
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,970
Stop finding excuses.

187
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,400
Be true to your love!

188
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,220
If you let this opportunity pass by,

189
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,120
you may never see each other again.

190
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,160
Is your dad still in Ningjiang?

191
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,020
Yes.

192
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,100
Take me to him.

193
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,680
Good luck.

194
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,520
That was hard work.

195
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,280
If it's ugly, so be it.

196
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,160
Wait, Liang Mu Ze.

197
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,760
Are you sure you want to do this?

198
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,490
Do you trust me?

199
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,160
I do.

200
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,660
If you trust me,

201
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,100
don't say a word

202
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,210
or do a thing.

203
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,880
Just follow me and I'll
take care of it.

204
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,090
Dad.

205
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,160
Mr Xia.

206
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,940
Dad.

207
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,840
I'd like to chat with you.

208
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Xia Chu likes being a doctor.

209
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,520
I know.

210
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,010
Changing careers, moving back,

211
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,730
those are her decisions.

212
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,520
But

213
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,410
if she hadn't been pressured,

214
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,280
she wouldn't have made those decisions.

215
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,240
What do you mean?

216
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,650
Are you saying

217
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm pressuring her?

218
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,450
She gets a lot of pressure at work.

219
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,530
But most of it was from you.

220
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,320
Liang Mu Ze.

221
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,600
Nonsense.

222
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,240
Get out.

223
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,760
Dad.

224
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,720
Please get out now!

225
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,280
Dad, don't be like that.

226
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,760
Dad, don't.

227
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,000
Mr Xia,

228
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,160
all parents

229
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,570
want what's best for their children.

230
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,930
But seldom do they consider

231
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,560
what decisions

232
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,560
are truly the best for them.

233
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,000
Xia Chu brought me here today

234
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,200
so I could tell you

235
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,900
that when helping the sick
and the dying,

236
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,360
she radiates happiness.

237
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,320
She's passionate about her job.

238
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,640
There's nothing with changing careers.

239
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,920
But now is not the time.

240
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,560
This is her first year
as a resident doctor.

241
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,930
If she gives up this opportunity,

242
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,960
it would not be easy for her

243
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,120
to put on a white coat again.

244
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,930
If she quits

245
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,900
and goes home,

246
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,320
do you think she'll be happy?

247
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,560
This is all I have to say.

248
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,360
Get some rest. I'm off.

249
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,800
What was that about?

250
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,720
He thinks he can lecture me?

251
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,400
Did you see his attitude?

252
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,700
Dad.

253
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,730
I admit he was a little rude.

254
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,280
But he wasn't afraid to displease you

255
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,880
to speak up for me.

256
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,210
For that, I'm grateful.

257
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,920
Liang Mu Ze.

258
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,650
Did your dad disown you

259
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,720
because of what I said?

260
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,440
What are you saying?

261
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,440
My dad's not usually like that.

262
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,600
He's probably just a little paranoid

263
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,570
because of the explosion incident.

264
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,920
I understand.

265
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,610
Why don't you go back

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,760
and talk to him?

267
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,560
I want to follow you and your brigade.

268
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm serious.

269
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,280
Xia Chu,

270
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,530
you don't really want to follow me.

271
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,000
You're just lost

272
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,200
because of Zhang Yi Chi's
sudden departure.

273
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,200
You don't know what to do next.

274
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,760
All the things that are happening

275
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,400
and the pressure from your parents

276
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,850
are affecting your judgement.

277
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,120
What you need is rest.

278
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,730
Take a shower

279
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,000
and get a good night's sleep.

280
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,800
When you wake up and see
the fatigues

281
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,560
and the white coat,

282
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,160
you'll be glad.

283
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,490
Glad that you're still able to wear it.

284
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,800
Really?

285
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,560
I've been through it.

286
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,600
When Luo Liang left,

287
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,400
I was more devastated than you are now.

288
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,560
I thought

289
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,080
you were going to say,

290
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,650
"Be with me, Xia Chu."

291
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,840
"I'll take care of you."

292
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,240
That's not the kind of love
you want, Xia Chu.

293
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,119
I told you

294
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,800
I wouldn't let you down.

295
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,570
Let's be together.

296
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,400
Forever and always.

297
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,650
Let's be together.

298
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,480
Forever and always.

299
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,170
[We're ready.]

300
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,050
[Let's go.]

301
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,120
Got it. No problem.

302
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,360
Nine o'clock tonight.

303
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,890
We have a guest

304
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,000
at Ms Hua's Hot Pot Restaurant.

305
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,640
Do you have a cigarette?

306
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,050
I don't smoke.

307
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,880
Do you have a light?

308
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,000
What a big appetite you have.

309
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,360
Peng said

310
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,770
you'd treat me well.

311
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,800
Of course.

312
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,000
This is just an appetizer.

313
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,280
Then what's the main course?

314
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,240
I'll let you experience it
when we get the chance.

315
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,320
Hai.

316
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,760
Long.

317
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,340
Dig in.

318
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,440
Hai?

319
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,010
Fei. Long time no see.

320
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,050
Long time no see.

321
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,290
Still alive, I see.

322
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,680
Watch your mouth.

323
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,850
What's the hurry? Sit down
and eat with us.

324
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,240
No thanks.

325
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,290
I just got a message from Jiu.

326
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,610
He wants me to buy some
barbecue for him.

327
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,000
I should get to it.

328
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,930
Jiu is out now?

329
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,290
Yes.

330
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,560
Haven't you heard?

331
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,410
We're having a celebration for him.

332
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,880
Want to join us?

333
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,970
Come on.

334
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,280
Let's go.

335
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,320
What do you say?

336
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,280
Do you want to experience it?

337
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,600
Let's drink!

338
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,650
Hai,

339
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,840
who is this?

340
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,400
A friend.

341
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,970
Long.

342
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,080
Nice to meet you, Jiu.

343
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,330
Are we shaking hands now?

344
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,730
Drink, drink!

345
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,360
Let's drink!

346
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,880
Come on!

347
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,610
Let's drink!

348
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,690
Come on.

349
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,600
Sit down and drink.

350
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,040
Drink, drink.

351
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,170
[Hai and Jiu have been]

352
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,930
[hanging out together
in the last couple of days.]

353
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,560
[They hired a bevy of girls.]

354
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,100
[On the surface,]

355
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,120
[it was a never-ending party.]

356
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,530
[In reality,]

357
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,260
[it was Jiu's high-end
underground casino.]

358
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,460
[I heard]

359
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,760
[he's quite the high roller.]

360
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,400
[He's the real deal.]

361
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,680
This is the middleman.

362
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,600
Jiu trusts him very much.

363
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,360
Let's meet him.

364
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,690
Long Yi.

365
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,480
Jiu's idea is,

366
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,410
money is no object

367
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,200
as long as it's the good stuff

368
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,080
and there's plenty of it.

369
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,600
No point going small,

370
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,680
am I right?

371
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,650
Jiu wouldn't like that.

372
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,040
Don't worry.

373
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,600
How much can you take?

374
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,440
How much do you have?

375
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,600
As much as you can take.

376
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,930
Level with me.

377
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,800
Does Jiu have the appetite for it?

378
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,160
[You bet.]

379
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,000
[Jiu has a big appetite.]

380
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,850
What do you say?

381
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
If it doesn't work for you,

382
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,910
that's okay.

383
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,840
We'll forget about the deal.

384
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,840
It's not like we need your business.

385
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,730
Right?

386
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,080
It's okay.

387
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,620
I'll be off.

388
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,340
[Hey now.]

389
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,300
Sit down, sit down.

390
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,920
What's the rush?

391
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,770
[There's always room for negotiation.]

392
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,600
[We can work something out.]

393
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,080
Tell you what.

394
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,400
Don't take this the wrong way,

395
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,130
but if you can't

396
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,840
make the call,

397
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,600
bring me someone

398
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,170
who can.

399
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,040
I fully represent the seller.

400
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,000
[Long Yi,]

401
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,210
[do you take me for a fool?]

402
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,650
Hello, Jiu.

403
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,560
[Yes, we're in the middle of it.]

404
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,240
[Sounds good.]

405
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,660
Okay.

406
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,880
Sure.

407
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,480
Bye, Jiu.

408
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,640
Jiu is going to Hawaii the day after.

409
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,320
So soon?

410
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,040
Things are getting hot.

411
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,400
[Besides,]

412
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,640
[you're not the only ones selling.]

413
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,450
Jiu can take his time.

414
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,580
Good beer.

415
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,830
See you.

416
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,720
Sit down.

417
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,920
[He wants to see the owner
of the goods?]

418
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,200
That's right.

419
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,770
Jiu is very cautious.

420
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,320
He insisted on negotiating
face to face.

421
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,920
[Have you looked into his background?]

422
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,570
We've checked Jiu and the middleman,

423
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,620
[Hai.]

424
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,770
[They're clean.]

425
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,010
"We?"

426
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,450
Long Yi is out.

427
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,000
Old Master.

428
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,700
[I suppose you know
what happened]

429
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,900
[in the organisation recently?]

430
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,860
I do.

431
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,850
[Did the Chinese Police give you
a hard time?]

432
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,980
No.

433
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,240
It was a standard interrogation.

434
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,120
They had no evidence,

435
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,840
and I kept my mouth shut.

436
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,560
You've just come out,

437
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,120
and already a buyer has contacted you.

438
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,880
[How lucky for you.]

439
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,580
They also have some cash
that needs moving.

440
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,250
If you don't feel safe going,

441
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,460
I can deal with them.

442
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,440
[No.]

443
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,360
[I'll do it myself.]

444
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,720
When?

445
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,920
[Before we decide on the
distribution channel,]

446
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
we must figure out the bait and switch.

447
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,570
[The solution]

448
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,050
[to our problem is]

449
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,130
[Xia Guang Yuan and his research.]

450
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,020
I know.

451
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,160
You do?

452
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,330
Then why haven't you succeeded yet?

453
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,500
Don't give me that line

454
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,400
[about the explosion and some dead cop.]

455
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,890
[It's not enough.]

456
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,320
Listen, Zhuo Ran.

457
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll say this again.

458
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,380
[I want Xia Guang Yuan.]

459
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,500
If not him,

460
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,320
at least his daughter.

461
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,970
Somebody must pay for my loss.

462
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,440
Do you understand, Zhuo Ran?

463
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,800
I understand.

464
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,280
Listen,

465
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,720
don't keep me waiting for too long.

466
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,840
I won't.

467
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,930
This is the last time.

468
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm serious.

469
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,680
I've already broken the law

470
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,100
by breaching the security system

471
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,880
and stealing the data.

472
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,820
If you want more detailed information,

473
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,000
there's nothing I can do.

474
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,480
It's not on his computer.

475
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,840
Then where is it?

476
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,960
You need to ask the professor.

477
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,640
Incidentally,

478
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,480
I was just thinking of inviting
you and Professor Xia

479
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,100
to Isaia.

480
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,060
Where?

481
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,120
Isaia.

482
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,640
We have a lab and a manufacturing
facility there

483
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,250
that can meet all of your needs.

484
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,600
An overseas lab?

485
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,320
I've never thought of that.

486
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,320
Now's the time to think about it.

487
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,330
What did the professor say?

488
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,000
I haven't asked him.

489
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,290
There's no way he'll go.

490
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,600
Then I hope you'll help me

491
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,520
deliver this invitation

492
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,920
to Professor Xia.

493
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,360
Whose invitation is this?

494
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,600
Yours.

495
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,820
At noon tomorrow,

496
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,520
your girlfriend and the
entire research team

497
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,800
will receive an automatic email

498
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,810
describing in vivid detail

499
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,080
your arrest for
solicitation of prostitution.

500
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,960
Zhuo Ran,

501
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,370
what do you want?

502
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,220
Of course,

503
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,810
if you can deliver this invitation

504
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,050
to Professor Xia

505
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,250
and persuade him to go to Isaia with you,

506
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,520
I guarantee

507
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,200
that provocative email

508
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,850
will never see the light of day.

509
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,080
When it's over,

510
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,200
you'll go back to being the upstanding
Professor Tang.

511
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,660
The arguments you have

512
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,080
with your girlfriend
over financial matters

513
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,610
will magically disappear.

514
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,680
Trust me.

515
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,720
I know.

516
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,480
You set this up.

517
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,120
It's all a ploy, isn't it?

518
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,740
I'd appreciate your cooperation,

519
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,570
Professor Tang.

520
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,690
No way.

521
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,010
I'm telling you,

522
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll never betray my teacher.

523
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,560
Think.

524
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,000
Between being a successful traitor

525
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,250
and a failure that nobody wants,

526
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,720
which is worse?

527
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,570
Professor Xia,

528
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,280
take a look at this.

529
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,130
Half a month ago,

530
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,010
somebody transferred a sum of money

531
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,210
to your personal account.

532
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,600
Are you aware of that?

533
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,140
Who transferred it?

534
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,690
It's an overseas account.

535
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,850
Opened by a guy called Francis.

536
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,730
Does it ring any bells?

537
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,250
Not that I recall.

538
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,130
Overseas?

539
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,320
Could it be one of Xia Chu's friends?

540
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,520
Why do you bring her up?

541
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,400
Why would her friend give us money?

542
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,140
It's such a huge sum.

543
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,250
Why would Xia Chu

544
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,140
not tell us

545
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,330
and keep us in the dark?

546
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,420
As for the real identity
of the account owner,

547
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,520
we'll look into it.

548
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,890
And

549
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,360
about your PhD student, Tang Lin,

550
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,660
and the email he received

551
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,420
from your personal email...

552
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,120
As I've said,

553
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,240
I didn't send that email.

554
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,610
I never use my personal email

555
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,440
for work-related matters.

556
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,280
Professor Xia,

557
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,640
simmer down.

558
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,850
We'll look

559
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,320
into this matter.

560
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,780
So far,

561
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,290
it seems your personal email

562
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,920
has been hacked.

563
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,300
The university

564
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:41,890
would like you

565
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,700
to hand over your research materials

566
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,530
to ensure the project's smooth progress

567
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,450
while you're under investigation.

568
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,040
Whose idea is this?

569
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,960
It was a collective decision
by the university council.

570
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,970
Later on,

571
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,700
an accounting firm

572
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,020
will perform a proper audit

573
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,680
on the project's finances.

574
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,970
Are they so eager to get rid of me?

575
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,770
Professor Xia...

576
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,890
Ask Chairman Qin to come here right now!

577
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll speak to him face to face.

578
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,850
What's all this fuss about an audit?

579
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,900
Are you after the hacker

580
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,440
or me, Xia Guang Yuan?

581
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,320
This is an outrage.

582
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,050
An outrage.

583
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,490
What are you waiting for?

584
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,720
Go!

585
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,460
Alright.

586
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,370
Professor Xia,

587
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,040
we shan't bother you, then.

588
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,280
Honey,

589
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,280
why don't you

590
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,280
hand the project over to them?

591
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,450
I can hand it over.

592
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,880
I can back out of it.

593
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,640
But I can't just leave.

594
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,640
Those who want me gone

595
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,690
don't really care

596
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,400
about my research.

597
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,200
I've had enough of you people.

598
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,240
Professor.

599
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,760
This is all my fault.

600
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,080
If I hadn't sent that email...

601
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,120
Right now, this whole thing

602
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,489
has gone way beyond

603
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,080
your email.

604
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,820
Some green-eyed monsters

605
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,320
are trying to ruin me.

606
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,360
What are you going to do about it?

607
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,400
If you ask me how to conduct research,

608
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,639
I'd have an answer.

609
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,920
But if you ask me how to
deal with nasty people,

610
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm stumped.

611
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,420
Take a seat.

612
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,530
Professor,

613
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,800
have you considered resigning

614
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,000
or changing jobs?

615
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,360
It's the same everywhere.

616
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,440
The biggest challenge to doing

617
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,929
research in China

618
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,560
isn't in the laboratory.

619
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,320
What about overseas?

620
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,920
There are many research institutions
out there

621
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,850
that need someone with solid
theoretical grounding

622
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,050
and extensive experience
to lead their projects.

623
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,370
Even outside the laboratory,

624
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,010
you have a bright future.

625
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,560
When my mother passed away
due to a terminal illness,

626
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,560
I swore I'd become

627
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,600
a traditional medicine researcher.

628
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,650
But at this age,

629
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,770
my career and my job

630
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,440
aren't just about personal interests.

631
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,160
I feel

632
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,880
I have other responsibilities.

633
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,080
So

634
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,410
even if I can't stay in the laboratory,

635
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,880
I won't venture overseas

636
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,080
as it's against my original intention
of joining this field.

637
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,530
But don't worry.

638
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,440
I'll be in the front line,

639
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,620
making sure

640
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,960
you youngsters are not affected.

641
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,240
You're all good kids.

642
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,010
You shouldn't

643
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,080
get mixed up in these shenanigans.

644
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,840
Professor, actually I...

645
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,750
What?

646
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,010
I'm getting married.

647
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,720
You're getting married?

648
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,360
We're having a wedding in Isaia.

649
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,320
I'd like you

650
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,760
to be our witness.

651
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,400
This is so sudden.

652
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,770
This was a long time in the making.

653
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,170
I wanted to tell you,

654
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,050
but then,

655
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,880
the investigation happened,

656
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,720
and I couldn't bring it up.

657
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,040
My big day is just around the corner.

658
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,560
I hope

659
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,040
on this momentous occasion,

660
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,210
you can be

661
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,640
my witness.

662
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,760
Isaia is visa-free.

663
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,130
I've arranged the food and accommodation.

664
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,020
All you have to do is fly there

665
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,520
on the weekend.

666
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,440
Will you

667
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,280
be free?

668
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,160
This is wonderful news.

669
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,480
I'll be there.

670
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,520
Can you believe that Tang Lin?

671
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,450
Such an important thing as marriage,

672
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,040
and he's only just told you.

673
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,640
We don't even have time to prepare.

674
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,780
I'm not the best man.

675
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,240
What's there to prepare for?

676
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,720
Shouldn't you at least prepare
a wedding gift?

677
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,000
I'll just give him money.

678
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,520
Young people nowadays have all
kinds of crazy ideas.

679
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,290
Even if we take the trouble
to pick out a gift,

680
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,120
they may not even like it.

681
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,050
Good point.

682
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,210
Professor Xia.

683
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,480
What do you think?

684
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,800
I'll look so dashing in that.

685
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,200
You wish.

686
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,410
I guess we can use a trip.

687
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,560
Think of it as a vacation.

688
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,530
But where is this Isaia?

689
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,200
How come I've never heard of it?

690
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,960
The wife's family chose it.

691
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,330
It has great views.

692
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,080
Are you sure you aren't coming?

693
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
I can't.

694
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,720
It's the old man's birthday.

695
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,160
Then

696
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,560
wouldn't it be inappropriate
for me to skip his birthday?

697
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't worry about it.

698
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,520
Birthdays come around every year.

699
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,940
But a wedding happens only
once in a lifetime.

700
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,520
You're his teacher.

701
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,720
You should be there for him.

702
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,050
Call Xia Chu.

703
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,210
Ask her to keep you company.

704
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,640
Enough already.

705
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,010
Young people have their own plans.

706
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,890
She might not be

707
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,440
too happy to come back.

708
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,460
Whenever I think

709
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,020
of her and that military guy,

710
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,120
I get upset.

711
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,570
Why do you have an issue

712
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,050
with Liang Mu Ze?

713
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,440
He's Mu Min's son, after all.

714
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,160
So what if he is Mu Min's son?

715
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,970
You don't know him.

716
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,620
And you do?

717
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,000
How well do you know him?

718
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,410
I just don't get it.

719
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,050
Are you unhappy with him

720
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,240
or the fact that he's a soldier?

721
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,050
I just don't like him.

722
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,570
I don't like anything about him.

723
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,290
When I'm back,

724
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,220
I'll settle this matter

725
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,410
with Xia Chu.

726
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,440
You must stand on my side.

727
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,680
Stubborn old coot.

728
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,680
Honey,

729
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,940
I packed your suit in the luggage.

730
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,610
Remember to iron it

731
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,290
at the hotel before you wear it.

732
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,320
-Here, Tang Lin.
-Got it.

733
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,360
Congratulations, Tang Lin.

734
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,250
Remind him

735
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,440
to measure his blood pressure
and blood sugar at night.

736
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,580
Okay.

737
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,240
Professor,

738
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,610
my stomach hurts.

739
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,610
Let me use the bathroom.

740
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,400
Go. Hurry.

741
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,860
I'll wait for you here.

742
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,820
Okay.

743
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,800
[We've landed.]

744
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,770
Sorry.

745
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,800
No problem.

746
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,000
No problem.

747
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,400
Sir, may I see your passport, please?

748
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,590
What?

749
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,720
Sir, may I see your passport?

750
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,120
My friend...

751
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,520
Sir, where's your passport?

752
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,680
I'm waiting...

753
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,040
Sir, passport!

754
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,090
Please show us your passport!

755
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,760
Sir, please open it.

756
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,250
One step back.

757
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,760
-One step back.
-Okay.

758
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,680
What's this?

759
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,360
This...

760
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,490
It's cocaine! Seize him!

761
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,580
What are you doing?

762
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,820
What do you want?

763
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,020
I have no idea.

764
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,330
Who does this belong to?

765
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,780
What do you want from me?

766
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,120
This isn't mine.

767
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,680
I have no idea.

768
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,000
Wait.

769
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,330
This may be

770
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,720
the biggest redeployment

771
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,360
in this time of peace.

772
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,000
Many brigades

773
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,560
are leaving

774
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,330
or are about to leave
their familiar bases.

775
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,930
To put down their roots

776
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,290
in new territories.

777
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,240
To us, the Special Forces Brigade,

778
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,130
redeployment

779
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,730
isn't simply about moving.

780
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,810
Have these been sorted?

781
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,920
Yes, they have.

782
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,730
We must carry out the redeployment

783
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,890
as though we're in

784
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,640
an actual war.

785
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,960
Captain, shouldn't we wait
for the Lieutenant?

786
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,600
No, move on.

787
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,840
Alright.

788
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,480
[Xiao Xue may have gone to your camp
to find Tian Yong.]
