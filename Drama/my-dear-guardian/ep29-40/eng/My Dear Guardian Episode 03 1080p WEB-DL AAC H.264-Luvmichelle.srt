[Episode 3]

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,670
Meng Zhen.

5
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,190
Dr Xia.

6
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,430
I just finished rounding.

7
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,789
How is the result?

8
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,509
This is the echocardiography report.

9
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,789
The doctor said it's atrial septal defect

10
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,830
and made us handle the hospitalisation
procedure.

11
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,700
Where's Liang Mu Ze?

12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,990
Mu Ze didn't come
as he has work to do today.

13
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,110
It's the same with the doctor here.

14
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,070
Why are they the same?

15
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,070
It's not what I meant.

16
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,229
Dr Xia, is something wrong?

17
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,060
One second.

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,030
Okay.

19
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,430
Okay, I'll be right there.

20
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,740
Dr Xia,

21
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,910
is something wrong
with Xiao Jun's condition?

22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,180
How about this?

23
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,110
Let me keep this report.

24
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,590
You go and register
for admission first.

25
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,660
I'll see you at the ward

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,710
when I finish my work.

27
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,060
Okay.

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,230
I don't want to get admitted.

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,270
Xiao Jun.

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,870
Xiao Jun, be a good boy.

31
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,550
You can return home

32
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,870
after getting well.

33
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,030
I'm not sick.

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,190
Xiao Jun!

35
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,750
What are you doing?

36
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,180
It's all because of you

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,670
that Liang Mu Ze doesn't want us!

38
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,270
Luo Xiao Jun, watch your words!

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,510
You've become very rude!

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,630
Dr Xia, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,390
Something is wrong with him today.

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,870
Please don't mind him.

43
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,700
It's all right.

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,270
Hurry up and register for the admission.

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,470
Okay.

46
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,270
Let's go. What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,140
Enough.

48
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,230
Xiao Jun, let me tell you.

49
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,700
You can't be rude

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,900
to the elderly,

51
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,870
understand?

52
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,460
I don't want to be hospitalised.

53
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,590
Ask Liang Mu Ze to come to pick us up.

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,590
I want to see Liang Mu Ze.

55
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,180
You must behave.

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,710
Wait for me.

57
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,470
Hello, we're here
to register for admission.

58
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,260
Mr Zhang,

59
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,660
let me assist in your surgery.

60
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm well-prepared.

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,030
Have you sent the patients'
medical reports?

62
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,190
I've finished sending them.

63
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,230
Dr Zhang,

64
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,990
Tian Yong's wound has recovered well.

65
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,310
I've changed the dressing for him.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,500
Tell him to return and recuperate.

67
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,750
Regular inspection will do.

68
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,190
Dr Zhang,

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,390
are you close

70
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,070
with Dr Li Juan
from the cardiology department?

71
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,420
Just say it.

72
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,390
What's the matter?

73
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,700
She just admitted a patient,

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,579
named Luo Xiao Jun.

75
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,270
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

76
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,430
I suspect it's not a simple
atrial septal defect.

77
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,350
Some adjustments might need to be made

78
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,540
on the previous
interventional surgical plan.

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,590
This is his echocardiography report.

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,030
Did the cardiology department
request a cardio surgery consultation?

81
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,110
No.

82
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,860
In fact, Dr Li Juan

83
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,709
didn't perform further tests on him.

84
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,470
Then what do you want me to do?

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,790
Can you take a look at him?

86
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,430
He is a patient
the cardiology department admitted.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,110
They didn't request our consultation.

88
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,150
We can't step in.

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,180
But...

90
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,430
This is the hospital policy.

91
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,670
Enough, I've got a surgery.

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,430
No, Dr Zhang.

93
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,430
Don't follow me.

94
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,180
I had a chance to convince him

95
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,750
to let me join the surgery.

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,460
Meng Zhen,

97
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,180
hang on, I'll be right there.

98
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,430
[No, Dr Xia.]

99
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,830
[Xiao Jun is missing.]

100
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,390
What?

101
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,030
This is Xiao Jun, right?

102
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,150
He left on his own?

103
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,350
It's fortunate

104
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,270
that he wasn't abducted.

105
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,540
This brat!

106
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,110
Where will he go?

107
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,550
Did he say anything

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,870
to you before leaving?

109
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,860
It's the same thing.

110
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,780
He said he didn't want to get admitted.

111
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,830
And that he wanted to see Liang Mu Ze.

112
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,550
Liang Mu Ze?

113
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,710
Yes.

114
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,430
Did you call him?

115
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,110
I did, but he didn't answer the phone.

116
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,670
I guess he's on a mission

117
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,990
or he might be training.

118
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,390
Don't worry.

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,380
How about this?

120
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,750
You search nearby the hospital.

121
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,590
I'll contact Liang Mu Ze.

122
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,150
Xiao Jun might go look for him.

123
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,470
Okay.

124
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,740
Lieutenant Tian!

125
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,620
Yes!

126
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,590
Hello, Dr Xia!

127
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,710
Great! You haven't left!

128
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,550
Is Liang Mu Ze on a mission?

129
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,110
I don't know.

130
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,150
Xiao Jun is missing.

131
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,700
He might go to the unit for him.

132
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,950
Hurry up and return to the unit!

133
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,780
If you see Liang Mu Ze,

134
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,030
you must tell him this news.

135
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,630
If you don't see him, you must be mindful.

136
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,060
If Xiao Jun really went to the unit,

137
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,190
bring him back immediately.

138
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,110
This child suffers from severe
congenital heart disease.

139
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,910
He needs to be hospitalised immediately.

140
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,660
His life would be in danger

141
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,110
if things went wrong, got it?

142
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,950
This time the operation

143
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,990
was not perfect.

144
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,670
We almost got trapped by the enemy.

145
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,910
This is fatal

146
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,390
for the special forces!

147
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,670
It's a disgrace!

148
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,820
There's always one way

149
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,230
to cleanse our shame!

150
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,550
Thunderbolt is invincible!

151
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,100
Kill them all!

152
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,110
I heard it from Xiao Wu

153
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,430
that you've taken two bottles
of sleeping pills

154
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,190
from the infirmary during this time.

155
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,550
Yes.

156
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,190
I lost

157
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,590
the previous bottle.

158
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,750
Did you lose it

159
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,790
or you finished it?

160
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,909
I lost it

161
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,630
or they hid it from me.

162
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,950
Your insomnia gets worse

163
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,990
every time you lose a comrade
or when there are

164
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,550
some flaws in the operation.

165
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,710
And then,

166
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,350
you train yourself like a maniac.

167
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,430
Because I'm angry.

168
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,070
Or are you scared?

169
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,310
I scare nothing.

170
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,790
It's been eight years, Mu Ze.

171
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,830
Don't force yourself too much.

172
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,590
I'm fine, Brigade Commander!

173
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,950
Good.

174
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,950
Salute!

175
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,060
Report to Brigade Commander!

176
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,030
Tian Yong has returned!

177
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,670
Get some rest.

178
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,740
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

179
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,710
Captain,

180
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,990
is Xiao Jun here?

181
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,110
No.

182
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,110
Why would Xiao Jun be here?

183
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,710
He is missing.

184
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,750
Missing?

185
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,390
Luo Xiao Jun?

186
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,590
Luo Xiao Jun?

187
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,990
Luo Xiao Jun?

188
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,630
He is not here!

189
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,310
I've searched
all the places where he could go.

190
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,870
This kid is really...

191
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,270
Where did he go?

192
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,070
He's here.

193
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,430
Xiao Jun.

194
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,230
What's wrong? Xiao Jun.

195
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,070
Xiao Jun, what's going on?

196
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,100
Don't scare me, Xiao Jun!

197
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,510
Xiao Jun!

198
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,670
I saw Dad.

199
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,750
Xiao Jun! Xiao Jun!

200
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,830
Xiao Jun!

201
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,190
-Xiao Jun! Wake up!
-Let's send him to the hospital.

202
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,510
Come in.

203
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,150
Dr Li,

204
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,910
I'm Xia Chu,
a resident of Cardio Surgery.

205
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,790
Can I help you?

206
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,510
You admitted a boy, named Luo Xiao Jun,

207
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,900
with a suspected atrial septal defect

208
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,710
in the morning.

209
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,910
Do you remember him?

210
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,630
I do.

211
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,190
What's the matter?

212
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,990
I would like

213
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,110
to ask your advice about this case.

214
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,910
I've read his report.

215
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,030
According to the extent
of his left ventricular hypertrophy,

216
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,470
I was wondering whether it's not

217
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,990
a simple atrial septal defect.

218
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,790
Are you doubting about my diagnosis?

219
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,070
No.

220
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,110
I just think that...

221
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,990
When I was

222
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,430
in the Isaia Joint Medical team,

223
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,300
there was an Italian doctor

224
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,590
who shared a case with me.

225
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,190
So you are the resident who went

226
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,590
to Isaia with Zhang Yi Chi?

227
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,230
Yes, it's me.

228
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,750
That case...

229
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,710
I know.

230
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,470
Nowadays, it's been tough
for the Cardio Surgery.

231
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,220
The bypass surgery

232
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,790
is being replaced by PCI.

233
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,300
And the interventional surgery

234
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,110
for congenital heart
disease is evolving.

235
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,070
Cardio Surgery needs patients.

236
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,310
I can understand that.

237
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,750
But you don't have to be this nasty.

238
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,830
If Cardio Surgery needs anything,

239
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,710
just ask Zhang Yi Chi to come to me.

240
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,340
Atrial septal defect.

241
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,990
"The patient had visited the
local hospital for many times."

242
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,180
"His pulmonary hypertension
was considered"

243
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,580
"the result of atrial septal defect."

244
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,190
"At last, by combining it with a CT scan,"

245
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,390
"the clinician diagnosed him..."

246
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,340
Meng Zhen.

247
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,820
[We've found Xiao Jun.]

248
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,180
[We just reached the hospital.]

249
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,790
[And we're going to
the Cardiology Inpatient Ward.]

250
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,310
Okay, I'm coming over.

251
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,590
Teacher,

252
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,950
there had been a case.

253
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,940
The echocardiography showed it was
a simple atrial septal defect.

254
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,660
But after further tests with a CT scan...

255
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,510
Good, it's good for you
to take note of cases.

256
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,300
So Xiao Jun might be

257
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,310
the case too.

258
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,740
What case?

259
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,900
Who is Luo Xiao Jun?

260
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,500
He's a patient
of the Cardiology department.

261
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,500
Xia Chu, I've performed

262
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,790
three emergency surgeries.

263
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,430
It's been 16 hours!

264
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,750
The last patient went flatline

265
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,870
when I operated on him.

266
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,820
We, three doctors,

267
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,510
alternatively gave him CPR.

268
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,350
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

269
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,750
They compressed his chest,
I applied the needle.

270
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,100
I just wanted to place
a tube in his femoral artery,

271
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,830
but his artery had completely shrunken!

272
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,590
I couldn't find it!

273
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,190
I couldn't find it.

274
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,110
-Dr Zhang.
-I tried my best!

275
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,270
I'm exhausted.

276
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,550
Don't tell me this.

277
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,670
I need to rest.

278
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,990
But isn't all this what

279
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,180
we should do?

280
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,110
Saving lives.

281
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,590
Isn't that what we should do?

282
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm exhausted!

283
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,390
Rookie!

284
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,750
[But isn't all this]

285
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,990
[what we should do?]

286
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,950
[Saving lives.]

287
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,430
[Isn't that what we should do?]

288
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,920
[Hippocratic oath]

289
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,510
Dr Xia.

290
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,150
How is he?

291
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,580
It's been arranged.

292
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,990
The operation will be tomorrow.

293
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,230
Good.

294
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,950
Is anything wrong?

295
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,030
Xia Chu, tell us the truth.

296
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,430
What have I done?

297
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,750
We, as the patient's family,

298
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,710
need to know about
the kid's actual condition.

299
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,350
Dr Xia,

300
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,670
is something wrong with Xiao Jun?

301
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,060
No.

302
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,030
It's...

303
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,620
What do you mean by "no"?

304
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,950
Yes or no?

305
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,910
Why are you being so mean?

306
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,020
I'm only a resident.

307
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,190
What can I say?

308
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,940
Now you ask me what you can say?

309
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,100
Just say what you should say.

310
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,510
Just that

311
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm not sure about it either.

312
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,550
Then hurry up and make it certain.

313
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,830
Okay?

314
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,190
You are a doctor.

315
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,910
You're unfit to be a doctor

316
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,190
if you can't let us

317
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,790
understand the kid's condition.

318
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,030
Liang Mu Ze, enough!

319
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,910
Who are you to criticise me?

320
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,550
As the most important
person to Xiao Jun,

321
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,020
besides making him feel unsafe,

322
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,060
worried that you'd leave at any time,

323
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,940
and making him think
he might never see you again,

324
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,150
what else did you do for him?

325
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,420
As his condition has worsened
to this point,

326
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:38,980
don't you have

327
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,190
a share of the blame?

328
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,590
You're unworthy of being a father

329
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,630
if you think I'm unfit to be a doctor!

330
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,990
Dr Xia, Xia...

331
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,350
Actually, Xiao Jun's condition

332
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,620
is more severe than you think.

333
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,990
What are you doing?

334
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,540
Dr Xia said

335
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,740
the atrial septal defect is not

336
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,510
the only problem that Xiao Jun has.

337
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,510
Do you trust her?

338
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,620
We need to understand

339
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,580
the kid's actual situation.

340
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,070
Right.

341
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,380
I think we should arrange

342
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,390
a CTA examination.

343
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,860
You're only

344
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,070
a Cardio Surgery resident.

345
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,870
You have no right
to interfere in my diagnosis.

346
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,780
I asked her to come here.

347
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,220
Dr Li,

348
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,310
can I talk to you for a second?

349
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,830
Just a second.

350
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,310
Let me take a look
at the patient's information.

351
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,550
The echocardiography shows clearly

352
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,150
that his pulmonary hypertension (PAH)
is caused by atrial septal defect (ASD).

353
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,300
Are you sure?

354
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,270
I'm sure.

355
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,859
But

356
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,030
the echocardiography

357
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,859
shows it's not a large notch.

358
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,940
It takes more than ten years for

359
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,790
ASD to progress to PAH.

360
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,340
Are you really sure?

361
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,420
Maybe there's an exception.

362
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,670
Uncertainty is not allowed.

363
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,750
You need to prove it to me

364
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,910
with the statistic
whether he is the exception or not.

365
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,990
How about this?

366
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,940
Cardiology Department requests
a Cardiac Surgery's consultation,

367
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,750
okay?

368
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,980
You decide it
as you're a higher-level doctor.

369
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,270
Okay.

370
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,470
Hello, I'm Zhang Yi Chi,

371
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,510
Associate Professor of Cardio Surgery.

372
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,020
We're planning to give the kid

373
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,230
a further inspection

374
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,030
to determine his condition.

375
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,110
Is it severe?

376
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,630
We'll know about it after the inspection.

377
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,630
Dr Li,

378
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,580
please hurry up and request

379
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,550
a CTA application form.

380
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,150
Okay.

381
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,100
Don't forget

382
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,630
to inform the radiology department.

383
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,110
It's an emergency.

384
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,950
Xia Chu,

385
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,430
you take the patient there

386
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,550
after we get the application form.

387
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,630
Yes.

388
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,910
Don't worry.

389
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,980
[Airport announcement.]

390
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,670
[Passenger on flight CA564]

391
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,910
[from Vitalik to Ningjiang,]

392
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,110
[Miss Mi Gu,]

393
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,260
[please proceed to Gate 4 immediately,]

394
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,630
[someone is waiting for you.]

395
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,430
Excuse me!

396
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,870
Sorry, I've got to catch a plane.

397
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,270
Thank you.

398
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,830
Miss Mi Gu.

399
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,670
Do you know me?

400
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,630
You've taken the wrong luggage.

401
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,230
That's yours.

402
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,060
I've waited for you for quite a while.

403
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,510
It's impossible.

404
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,750
I really took the wrong one.

405
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,390
Luckily, you figured it out,

406
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
or else it would have been awful
if we had left the airport.

407
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,790
I didn't open your luggage.

408
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,940
Let's exchange our information.

409
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,270
Just in case there's anything
in your luggage missing.

410
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,230
It won't happen for sure,

411
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
just in case.

412
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,350
What do you think?

413
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,220
It's not necessary.

414
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,790
Yes, it is. Hang on.

415
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,910
This is my name card.

416
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,990
Where is he?

417
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,300
So you start your company here.

418
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,070
This is an Innovation Park
which is just emerging.

419
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,430
So far,

420
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,510
no company has stationed in here.

421
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,870
It's quite discreet.

422
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,990
Most importantly,

423
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,190
it has the room structures that I need.

424
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,350
You're really wasting time.

425
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,790
You're not me.

426
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,430
You don't understand.

427
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,070
Just kidnap his daughter

428
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,020
and force him to hand in the goods,

429
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,580
just like we did before.

430
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,550
Make it quick.

431
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,780
How nice!

432
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,700
He is different from those merchants

433
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
whom we've dealt with.

434
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,310
It's not Isaia nor Vitalik here.

435
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,510
In China,

436
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,070
fighting and killing are
the dumbest methods to do things.

437
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,630
We need some greater intelligence
to complete the mission.

438
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,350
Is starting a company an advanced way?

439
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,270
Go ahead.

440
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,390
I'll show you around.

441
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,950
That's interesting.

442
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,710
After an eight-year gap,

443
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,870
we have to fill it in with something.

444
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,910
You do take after the  master.

445
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,830
After you.

446
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,390
It's nice.

447
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,390
Your cellar looks nice.

448
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,670
Help yourself.

449
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,310
I will.

450
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,150
The master asked me to help you.

451
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,030
He just couldn't trust me.

452
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,740
Why didn't you dispose of Sang Kun's body

453
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,710
discreetly?

454
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,910
How could you make such a big mistake

455
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,990
if you weren't trying to make trouble?

456
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,380
Is he angry?

457
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,710
What do you think?

458
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,190
[What do you think the dog
will turn into when it grows up?]

459
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,950
[Long Yi.]

460
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,350
[A big dog?]

461
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,990
[What do you think, Hu?]

462
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,630
[I keep it fed.]

463
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,980
[When he grows up,]

464
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,990
[you'll find out]

465
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,750
[that you've been raising a wolf.]

466
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,710
It's a video call from the master.

467
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,020
Master.

468
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,220
[Have you seen Long Yi?]

469
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,190
Yes, I have.

470
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,310
Master.

471
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,030
[He just came back from Isaia.]

472
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,950
He can help you

473
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,790
complete your mission in a better way.

474
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,590
I understand.

475
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,190
[Anything else?]

476
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,830
About Sang Kun's body,

477
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,220
I thought he had

478
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,310
a great force in Vitalik.

479
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,510
[To hide him from the public view,]

480
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,790
[I transported his body]

481
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,270
[to the borderline for disposing of it.]

482
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,270
[But then I ran into
China's military police.]

483
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,070
[I could only evacuate]

484
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,300
[to prevent further exposure.]

485
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,700
Apart from the body,

486
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,020
it's impossible

487
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,430
for them to get any critical clues.

488
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,270
Sang Kun has never been to China.

489
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,910
The body itself
is an useless information too.

490
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,550
So you can rest assured.

491
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,270
This minor blip

492
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,150
is not going to be an issue to T4

493
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,950
and it won't affect you.

494
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,310
[No need to explain.]

495
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,030
I believe in you.

496
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,910
I'll wait for your good news.

497
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,110
Do you think the master
really believes you?

498
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,310
He'll use me no matter
if he believes me or not.

499
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,790
Then what does

500
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,270
it matter?

501
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,940
You're the best actor.

502
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,150
Big Rat Baby,

503
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,790
welcome to my live room!

504
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,380
God Little Dear asks why it's so dark.

505
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,220
It might be a short circuit
due to the broken lightbulb.

506
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,580
What to do? Of course, I'll fix it myself.

507
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,350
You think I'll wait for a prince
to come to me?

508
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,670
Da Jin asks how I fix
the lightbulb in the dark.

509
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,310
Let me show you guys.

510
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,550
Let's go.

511
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,150
And God said, "Let there be light",

512
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,710
and there was light in the world.

513
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,070
Give me a second.

514
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,270
Now, we are using

515
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,870
the free light source from
the five-star hotel across the way.

516
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,900
I'll show you

517
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,870
the scenery across my house.

518
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,270
It's not bad, right?

519
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,190
I'll take a close-up of it.

520
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,030
We'll have a ten-minute break.

521
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,630
Dr Zhang, how is it?

522
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,270
You are right.

523
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,100
The atrial septal defect

524
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,870
with left inferior
pulmonary artery abnormality,

525
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,470
origins from

526
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,590
the aorta descendens.

527
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,430
It's not clearly shown
on the echocardiography.

528
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,870
What is certain is that

529
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,110
some adjustments to the interventional
surgical plan are required.

530
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,500
It's more complicated than we predicted.

531
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,630
But fortunately,

532
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,670
we realised about it in advance.

533
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,830
We can make full preparation for it.

534
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,380
How about this?
I'll communicate with his family.

535
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,910
Go get some sleep.

536
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,270
Dr Zhang,

537
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,270
thanks for helping me.

538
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,470
To be honest,

539
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,430
I'm not helping you.

540
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,380
I'm helping a rookie,

541
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,580
named Zhang Yi Chi.

542
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,390
He was like you back then.

543
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,150
He thought that a doctor should

544
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,110
save lives.

545
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,670
A bounden duty.

546
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,070
So he

547
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,350
made rounds, was on duty,
completed the charts, operated every day.

548
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,230
He was tireless.

549
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,790
He really didn't feel tired.

550
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,140
To be frank,

551
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,510
I would have almost forgotten
what he was like

552
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,830
if it hadn't been
for what happened last night.

553
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,990
Thank you.

554
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,790
Dr Zhang...

555
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,460
But you need to keep this in mind.

556
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,580
Never have private contact

557
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,870
with the patient and his family.

558
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,020
Don't get me into some

559
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,230
strange trouble.

560
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,270
Or else,

561
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,950
don't ever think about
joining my surgeries.

562
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,470
I understand.

563
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,110
Goodbye.

564
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,220
Keep going! Dr Xia!

565
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,190
Dr Xia.

566
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,630
Meng Zhen.

567
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,630
Dr Xia, I'm here to say thank you.

568
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,070
Dr Zhang told me everything.

569
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,590
About Xiao Jun,

570
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,310
if you hadn't found out in advance,

571
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,630
we don't know how the consequences
could have been.

572
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,510
You're welcome, it's my job.

573
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,070
It's fine as long as Xiao Jun
can be rehabilitated.

574
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,270
Sorry for what happened last night.

575
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,270
Actually, Liang Mu Ze is a nice person.

576
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,060
But he's almost inhuman

577
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,700
if it's something about Xiao Jun.

578
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,510
So I apologise on his behalf.

579
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,780
Please don't mind him.

580
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,350
Actually I understand him.

581
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,830
The kid is sick,

582
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,430
as parents...

583
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,230
No.

584
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,750
I think you've got the wrong idea.

585
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,550
Mu Ze is not Xiao Jun's father.

586
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,990
He is a comrade of Xiao Jun's father.

587
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,830
Eight years ago,

588
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,950
[Xiao Jun's father sacrificed himself.]

589
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,750
[He was in my womb at that time.]

590
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,870
[He has spent most of the time with Mu Ze]

591
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,940
[since he was born.]

592
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,550
[And the other comrades]

593
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,630
[take good care of us as well.]

594
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,030
[That's why Xiao Jun has become
so dependent on Liang Mu Ze.]

595
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,430
Actually, I was not afraid
of being hospitalized.

596
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,380
Then why did you escape?

597
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,710
I was afraid you'd hate me.

598
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,510
You are a soldier, my name is Xiao Jun.

599
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,550
I should be brave

600
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,630
and strong

601
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,190
like you.

602
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,340
But I'm either getting bullied
by my classmates

603
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,590
or falling sick.

604
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,950
Over time,

605
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,190
you'll dislike me.

606
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,910
Xiao Jun,

607
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,630
let me tell you.

608
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,910
No matter what happens in the future,

609
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,070
whether you're outstanding,

610
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,670
or you're bad,

611
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,350
my love for you

612
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,310
won't change at all.

613
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,470
Then what about the doctor?

614
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,710
What's wrong with her?

615
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,870
Do you like her?

616
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,070
Why would I like her?

617
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,260
Are you crazy?

618
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,030
I saw you two quarrelling yesterday.

619
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,030
So what?

620
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,420
I like Xuan Xuan.

621
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,270
That's why I like to quarrel with her.

622
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,870
It's all part of the game.

623
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,030
You're good.

624
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,350
Don't tell Zhen.

625
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,550
Rest assured.

626
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,670
It's a men's secret.

627
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,830
You know?

628
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,950
You scared me.

629
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,830
Sister-in-law.

630
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,980
You're leaving?

631
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,950
I'm going back to the unit.

632
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,150
I already got you lunch.

633
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,110
Eat it before leaving.

634
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,950
No, you and Xiao Jun have it.

635
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,580
Okay.

636
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,550
And about

637
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,230
Xiao Jun's surgery,

638
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,390
you don't have to worry.

639
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,510
Dr Zhang is

640
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,470
an extremely skilled physician.

641
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,230
I know.

642
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,630
About the fee, you don't have to...

643
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,230
Don't worry, I got it.

644
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,980
My book store has gained
popularity in these two years.

645
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,940
It's running well.

646
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,030
And I've earned a lot of money
by selling

647
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,070
some cultural and creative products.

648
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,590
So I'm a hidden rich lady.

649
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,990
You don't have to worry.

650
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,820
Okay.

651
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,340
Anyway, as a mother,

652
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,260
I should endure

653
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,270
Xiao Jun's condition.

654
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,950
Rest assured.

655
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,470
You've done enough for us.

656
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,620
I'll get going, sister-in-law.

657
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:39,250
♫ Talking about romance,
I feel warmness in everything ♫

658
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:48,760
♫ Talking about warmness, I've become
soft-hearted although I'm stubborn ♫

659
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,410
[Emergency Department]

660
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:59,360
♫ My heart is filled
with your company daily ♫

661
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,750
Sorry.

662
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:09,130
♫ It's never a pity
to join what you're related to ♫

663
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,230
♫ Getting used to you
from breakfast to dinner ♫

664
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,110
♫ I've used up all my time
to keep you company ♫

665
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,219
♫ I like your likes,
the sensitivity of the details ♫

666
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,920
♫ Feeling safe with you around ♫

667
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,270
Captain Liang!

668
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,790
What's the matter?

669
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,830
I forgive you

670
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,550
about what happened last night.

671
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,909
What are you thinking about?

672
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,389
Xiao Jun's mother told me everything.

673
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,790
That mission

674
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,070
may have left you a painful memory.

675
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,270
And it might be the cause
of your insomnia.

676
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,469
Post-traumatic stress, you know?

677
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,150
You should consult a psychologist.

678
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,790
Although it's touching

679
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,390
that you take care

680
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,270
of Xiao Jun and his mother,

681
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,590
don't you think

682
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,260
that this

683
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,830
is another form of evading?

684
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,950
What am I evading?

685
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,510
Playing the role of Xiao Jun's father

686
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,660
to evade

687
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,190
the fact that your comrade
was sacrificed.

688
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,150
I know.

689
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,670
It's tough to face death.

690
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,670
But this is a mandatory subject

691
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,790
for an adult.

692
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,430
You're right.

693
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,910
When are you planning to move out?

694
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,670
What...

695
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,430
What's the connection between them?

696
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,950
Learning to live independently

697
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,550
is also a mandatory course for an adult.

698
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,350
Move out quickly, get out of my sight.

699
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,750
Is that incredible to own a house?

700
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,350
You don't want to see me
and I don't wish to live there either.

701
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,590
What a cheapskate!

702
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,990
Zhuo Ran?

703
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,180
It's me, Xia Chu.

704
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,270
Answer the phone! Answer the phone!

705
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,220
Xia Chu, be a good girl,
open the door for me.

706
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,790
-Xia Chu!
-What's wrong with her?

707
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,710
Has she been crying all night long?

708
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,470
-Move aside!
-Xia!

709
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,990
Girl!

710
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,590
What's wrong with you?

711
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,070
I was worried sick!

712
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,230
You're killing me!

713
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,380
What's wrong?

714
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm back.

715
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,940
Xia Chu,

716
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,030
what should I do?

717
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,110
Do you think I'm getting old?

718
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,470
Why? Why did he ignore me?

719
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,630
Or

720
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,110
I'll just drop by the hotel tomorrow.

721
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,550
Don't tell me he left!

722
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,430
I don't even know his name,

723
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,070
his WeChat, his number.

724
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,510
I got nothing from him.

725
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,540
Do you know? That guy

726
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,990
is mysterious and depressed.

727
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,390
He makes me curious.

728
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,710
But I wish to protect him.
Anyway, he's amazing.

729
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,110
When I think

730
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,110
that the other ladies

731
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,950
may hunt him down

732
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,150
as he's out of my sight,

733
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,590
I feel like my heart
is scratched by a cat.

734
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,270
Do you think I will meet him again?

735
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,270
What if you meet him again?

736
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,270
Time passed,

737
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,550
so did the feelings.

738
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,910
Xia Chu,

739
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,500
didn't we agree

740
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,030
that you're here to keep me company?

741
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,750
Why are you being
more depressing than me?

742
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,830
What's wrong?

743
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,630
Zhuo Ran is back.

744
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,350
Zhuo Ran?

745
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,950
Is he that high-school deskmate of yours

746
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,430
that you mentioned to me?

747
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,180
I already forgot

748
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,270
what my high-school deskmates look like.

749
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,070
Has he come back for you?

750
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,510
I don't know.

751
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,750
Why didn't you ask him

752
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,190
why he disappeared back then?

753
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,870
I ran away.

754
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,190
Why?

755
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,830
You're not the one who did wrong.

756
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,310
Okay, stop thinking about him.

757
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,790
He is just a man, just forget about him.

758
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,750
Here.

759
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,910
Bottoms up.

760
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,230
It's been a long time, pretty ladies.

761
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,580
Here, have a drink.

762
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,190
Who wants to drink with you?

763
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,230
Don't you recognise me?

764
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,300
Are you crazy?

765
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,300
Mi Gu,

766
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,670
let's go.

767
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,950
You don't have to rush off.

768
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,950
Who are you?

769
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,350
It hurts!

770
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,950
We're drunk, it's a misunderstanding!

771
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,550
Just drink less if you're a bad drinker.

772
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,670
-I'm sorry!
-Gentlemen!

773
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,630
Gentlemen, don't fight!

774
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,270
These two guys are drunk

775
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,390
and are harassing my friends.

776
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,470
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

777
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,790
What are you waiting for?
Get them out!

778
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,990
I'm sorry. Please enjoy.

779
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,830
Xia Chu, are you all right?

780
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,140
He...

781
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,430
He is Zhuo Ran.

782
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,100
He is Zhuo Ran?

783
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,510
So that's what a player looks like.

784
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,390
He's handsome.

785
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,910
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

786
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,590
It's fine. Thank you.

787
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,350
Let's go.

788
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,310
You ran away again.

789
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,310
Right, I ran away again.

790
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,110
Just like you said,

791
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,670
I'm not the one who did wrong,

792
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,470
but I can't face him,

793
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,710
I can't talk to him,

794
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,140
I can't even question him.

795
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,180
His appearance

796
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,630
hasn't changed much from before,

797
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:04,980
but I feel

798
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,550
that something's wrong.

799
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,910
Is this my problem?

800
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,670
Are you asking me?

801
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,550
Mi Gu?

802
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,510
Where's my friend?

803
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,500
Only you who got on the car.
