who got on his plane.

old man like you back?

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,630
handle that girl.

187
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,170
You don't oppose them?

188
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,590
Why would I oppose them?

189
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,960
Didn't he break your daughter's heart?

190
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,660
Didn't you always complain that

191
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,170
I broke your heart?

192
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,580
They were just chipping away

193
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,370
when they were at school.

194
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,180
People will grow up,

195
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,560
especially a man.

196
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,880
The point is how they get along.

197
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,820
Anyway,

198
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,130
as long as it's not the soldier guy.

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,430
Who is that soldier guy?

200
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,760
You don't have to worry.

201
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,820
Get some sleep.

202
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,970
No, who is that soldier guy?

203
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,800
I'll go and do some research.

204
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,990
Get some sleep.

205
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,080
Did he mean that guy?

206
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,930
The scientific name of parrot
is Blue-eyed Cockatoo.

207
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,320
Its common name is
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo.

208
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,490
And it's called
Australian White Chicken too.

209
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,640
It's a rare species

210
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,240
but it has average language skills.

211
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,580
It even speaks English!

212
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,440
Seems like its gene is mutated.

213
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,950
Do you know

214
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,450
what the mark on its foot means?

215
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,750
It probably belongs to an institution.

216
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,380
I don't know the exact situation too.

217
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,480
I have to look it up.

218
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,360
Then what are you going to do with it?

219
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,120
According to the procedure,

220
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,990
it would be great if we could
find its original institution.

221
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,400
If not,

222
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,160
we'll just find a new institution.

223
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,760
But

224
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,030
this little thing is quite fierce

225
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,720
based on my contact with it just now.

226
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,520
I didn't succeed in my repeated trials.

227
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,070
Seems like that will
cause problems

228
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,270
if we forcibly take it away.

229
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,210
I feel that

230
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,080
you're getting along with it.

231
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,560
Why don't

232
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,560
you take care of it for a few days?

233
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,690
I'll take it back after I find

234
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,030
its owner.

235
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,210
No problem.

236
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,230
But can it work

237
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,080
as I don't have the related documents?

238
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,720
It's just temporary.

239
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,760
Look at this little guy,

240
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,680
it's energetic and strong.

241
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,630
It might have almost recovered.

242
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,050
I'll send you some

243
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,750
matters needing attention
when I go back.

244
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,130
You just need to follow them.

245
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,160
Like the environment,
the food you feed it

246
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,120
and the water supply and so on.

247
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,640
Just don't let it fly away.

248
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,290
Okay.

249
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,360
Sorry to bother you.

250
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm counting on you.

251
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,880
Toleration song sings
of numerous tolerances.

252
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,800
Being tolerant is the
decency of a great man.

253
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,480
Being tolerant is the
root of a gentleman.

254
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,440
He could endure the heat of the summer.

255
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,220
He could endure the cold of the winter.

256
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,420
He could be happy
while enduring the poverty.

257
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,190
He could be eternal by enduring life.

258
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,510
Hello, can you help me find this bird?
Its name is OK.

259
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,670
Hello, can you help me find this bird?
Its name is OK.

260
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,810
Hello, can you help
me find this parrot?

261
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,070
Its name is OK.

262
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,830
[Missing pet bird]

263
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,590
Hello, can you help me...

264
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,050
Hello,

265
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,920
can you help me look for this bird?

266
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,600
Its name is OK.

267
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,530
It is expensive.

268
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,460
Help me.

269
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,960
Seriously?

270
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,720
What are you doing?

271
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,240
Can you be more reserved?

272
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,190
Mr Zhang,

273
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,079
I want to ask you a question.

274
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,359
What is it?

275
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,250
I heard you laughed until
your jaw joint dislocated

276
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,230
when a young lady from the art troupe

277
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,250
came to our hospital
for medical check-up.

278
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,720
Was that true?

279
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,560
It was true.

280
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,290
Mr Zhang, you...

281
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,320

Greetings, Chief!

296
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,750
You've worked hard.

297
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,240
You must be tired.

298
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,030
Xia Chu, you're here too.

299
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,490
Greetings, Chief!

300
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,610
I'll watch your performance tonight.

301
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,250
Then I can only perform

302
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,280
a live operation for you.

303
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,570
I don't dare to watch that.

304
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,970
Dr Zhang, do you
want to rest for a while?

305
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,440
We slept along the way, it's fine.

306
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,990
Let's start the work.

307
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,360
How about this?
Notify Liang Mu Ze

308
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,400
-and ask Team Thunder over to help.
-Yes.

309
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,830
Hurry up and get prepared!

310
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,880
Yes!

311
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,090
This way.

312
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,200

313
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,530
Girl, what are you doing?

314
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm in the unit.

315
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,290
[You're still working
on New Year's Day?]

316
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,010
You should ask me which day

317
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,870
I'm off in a year.

318
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,690
Dr Xia,

319
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,650
you live a busy life every day.

320
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,610
You just get a little monthly wage.

321
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,880
What's in it for you?

322
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,610
Perhaps I was out of my mind

323
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,040
when I filled the application forms.

324
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,750
Indeed, you were.

325
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,930
[How about you?]

326
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,000

What do you mean hang out?

328
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,490
Didn't I tell you that I had done

329
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,520
an episode on left-behind children?

330
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,160
[I'm going to visit them today.]

331
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,830
[I was thinking]

332
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,970
to take you with me

333
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,810
if you have nothing to do

334
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,880
and provide them
medical check-up for free.

335
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,900
But you're on a business trip,
so forget it.

336
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,640
Maybe next time.

337
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,530
You have to tell me
in advance next time.

338
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,040
So that I can free up time for it.

339
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,590
Also,

340
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,880
[the flu is getting serious
in this season.]

341
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,970
[You need to prepare]

342
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,480
[some cold medicine for the kids.]

343
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,240
I got it.

344
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,610
Xia Chu!

345
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,490
Get changed!

346
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,070
The soldiers will be here soon.

347
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,220
Okay.

348
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,320
I'll go to work first, goodbye.

349
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,530
Bye bye.

350
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,050
Done, go in there for
one more test.

351
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,280
Okay, thank you.

352
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,940
Hello, Dr Xia.

353
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,830
Hello, Captain Liang.

354
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,550
Give me your hand.

355
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,460
Xue didn't trouble you, right?

356
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,080
Not for the time being.

357
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,160
But

358
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,000
who knew when the

359
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,430
next surprise will be?

360
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,380
Try to understand.

361
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,240
Gifts blind the eyes.

362
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,360
Considering you gave me those cherries,

363
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,520
I won't quarrel with her.

364
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,280
Do you like them?

365
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,550
I do.

366
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,690
But how did the idea of
hanging those cherries up

367
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,710
come into your head?

368
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,840
For water controlling.

369
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,760
Boring,

370
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,430
just like your blood pressure.

371
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,680
It's too normal.

372
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,790
Lift your shirt.

373
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,560
Your heartbeat is a bit fast.

374
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,080
Yes.

375
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,560
I'm sick. What should I do, Dr Xia?

376
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,760
You should go for a check-up
if you're sick.

377
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,840
You might need a
thoracotomy if it worsens.

378
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,220
Do you dare?

379
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,360
I dare to let you operate
if you dare to do it.

380
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,280
Dr Xia,

381
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,280
your stethoscope will be embedded
in my chest

382
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,360
if you keep pressing it.

383
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,280
Sorry.

384
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,770
I'll see you at night,

385
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,730
Dr Xia.

386
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,880
Hello, Dr Xia.

387
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,710
Hello, sister-in-law.

388
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,170
Sister-in-law, you're so pretty.

389
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,900
Village Chief.

390
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,840
Director Mi, the kids
are really happy when

391
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,850
they heard you're coming.

392
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,170
They waited here early in the morning.

393
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,640
They kept asking me

394
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,290
-if you've reached.
-Sister Gu!

395
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,560
You all came. Come on, let's go there.

396
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,370
-Do you miss me?
-Yes!

397
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,870
Director Mi, have a seat over here.

398
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,890
Xiao Qiu, this is a toy for you.

399
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,710
-Do you like it?
-I do.

400
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,000
Nan Nan, you've grown taller.

401
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,490
Luckily, I bought you a dress

402
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,610
that is one size bigger.

403
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,750
Thank you, sister.

404
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,840
Guo Guo, your braid looks nice.

405
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,090
Who tied it for you?

406
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,950
Mother.

407
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,170
Mother tied it for you?

408
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,670
Sister Gu, I want to eat that snack.

409
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,440
Here.

410
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,720
Go and distribute the snacks.

411
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,440
Thank you, sister!

412
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,740
[Long Yi]

413
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,650
[The police found a suit and]

414
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,770
[a pair of shoes under a cover]

415
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,550
[along the coastal road.]

416
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,560
It's similar to Gui's outfit
on the day of forum.

417
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,890
This might belong to him

418
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,520
compared to the video.

419
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,030
I already sent someone
over to search the area.

420
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,720
I got it.

421
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,690
What do you mean you got it?

422
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,960
What should we do next?

423
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,920
There is blood stains on the clothes.

424
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,880
It means he was seriously injured.

425
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,080
He can't have gone far.

426
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,010
Just think about

427
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,320
why his stuffs appeared
at the coastal road.

428
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,960
The immigration bureau
has no further information either.

429
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,050
People like him won't go through

430
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,000
proper channels even
if he wants to leave.

431
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,990
You go and ask around the dock nearby.

432
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,500
Tell me if you got any news.

433
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,610
I captured you!

434
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,680
It doesn't count.

435
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,080
It doesn't count.
Sister Gu, you can do it!

436
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,960
You've been wiped out.

437
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,110
You haven't found Xiao Qiu.

438
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,520
Xiao Qiu?

439
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,160
Xiao Qiu likes to be in the forest.

440
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,410
After I get her back,

441
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,850
let's distribute the gifts again, okay?

442
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,960
Okay!

443
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,520
You guys wait for me!

444
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,760
Sister Gu, you can do it!

445
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,090
Xiao Qiu!

446
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,360
I already saw you!

447
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,160
Come on out!

448
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,880
Xiao Qiu?

449
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,400
Xiao Qiu! Don't run around, come back!

450
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,400
Xiao Qiu!

451
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,850
Xiao Qiu!

452
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,360
Xiao Qiu! Come on out!

453
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,400
Xiao Qiu!

454
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,120
Xiao Nan is still waiting for you!

455
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,920
Follow me back!

456
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,520
Why are you here?

457
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,750
I'm here to visit the kids.

458
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,420
We were playing hide and seek.

459
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,600
I came here

460
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,840
while looking for her.

461
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,080
What about you?

462
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm here to visit an old friend.

463
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,080
Here?

464
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,300
Did you drink?

465
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,030
A little.

466
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll take you down.

467
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,620
Devil!

468
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,120
You're a devil!

469
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,640
Why are you back again?

470
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,540
You screwed our village.

471
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,250
You rot in hell! You rot in hell!

472
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,810
Buzz off! Buzz off!

473
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,370
Why did you come back?

474
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,530
Buzz off! Buzz off!

475
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,570
-Let's go.
-Buzz off!

476
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,520
I'll beat you to death!

477
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,010
Let's go.

478
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,600
Buzz off!

479
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,120
Buzz off!

480
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,510
Devil!

481
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,650
The Village Chief said

482
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,190
that woman is crazy.

483
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,830
She stays in a small house
beside the mass grave.

484
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,320
She usually won't come out.

485
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,880
I wonder what was wrong with her.

486
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,600
She suddenly went mad when she saw us.

487
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,560
Don't mind about what she said.

488
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,060
It was all nonsense.

489
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,640
Actually it's quite good to be crazy.

490
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,920
What did you say?

491
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,960
If I really am a devil,

492
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,960
a sinner,

493
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,040
will I rot in hell?

494
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,430
Every saint has its past.

495
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,950
Every sinner has its future.

496
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,680
It's strange.

497
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,360
What is?

498
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,110
I saw the old Zhuo Ran

499
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,960
in Xia Chu's eyes.

500
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,730
In your eyes,

501
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,450
I actually see...

502
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,560
What?

503
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,640
Myself.

504
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,000
It's really amazing!

505
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,200
I want to take a selfie!

506
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,800
You look really nice.

507
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,450
The crepitation of firecrackers
sends off the old year.

508
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,480
Sweet wine and spring wind brings
warmth into thousands of homes.

509
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,930
You... Is it reading a poem?

510
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,390
Did you teach it?

511
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,360
Hello.

512
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,990
I need to post it on my Moments.

513
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,200
What's wrong?

514
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,240
I'm fine.

515
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,360
I might have eaten
something wrong last night.

516
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,200
I'll go to the washroom again.

517
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,230
Eat some medicine.

518
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,590
Your soldier really does like children.

519
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,370
Team Thunder, gather!

520
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,960
Gather!

521
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,040
Dress to the right!

522
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,170
Eyes front!

523
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,720
At ease, halt!

524
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,610
Comrade Brigade Commander!

525
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,570
Team Thunder are assembled!

526
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,800
Please advice!

527
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,010
Fall in!

528
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,980
Yes!

529
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,600
We've been informed by the superiors

530
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,710
that the police found a person trapped

531
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,650
on Island D in waters

532
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,110
near us during their
investigation of cases.

533
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,720
They need our aid.

534
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,920
The New Year Party is called off.

535
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,690
Liang Mu Ze will lead the team.

536
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,320
Commandos Team Thunder,
prepare to depart!

537
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,040
Yes!

538
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,760
When did you come?

539
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,210
Are you going back tomorrow?

540
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,150
I want to go to your store
and pick up some books.

541
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,960
Dr Zhang,

542
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,920
why do I get the sense
that you're like a bee?

543
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,710
A bee?

544
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,160
It means there's a

545
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,550
very beautiful flower over here.

546
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,680
Right?

547
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,040
Yes!

548
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,230
Oh my goodness.

549
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,800
Have you been following me?

550
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,460
Wu, what's wrong?

551
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,490
Nothing.

552
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,130
No.

553
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,440
The New Year Party is cancelled,
you don't have to go.

554
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,580
I know that.

555
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,590
Our Brigade Commander

556
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,330
asked me over to join the operation.

557
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,530
How can you join

558
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,969
the operation in this state?

559
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm fine.

560
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,070
I already ate some medicine.

561
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,270
Now that I feel...

562
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,429
Are you all right?

563
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,730
Mr Zhang,

564
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,600
what... what should we do?

565
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
In this situation,

566
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,679
we can only go in his place.

567
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,969
Thank you, Zhang!

568
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,130
I... I can't hold it!

569
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,210
I need to go to the washroom!

570
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,239
Thank you!

571
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,639
How about this? Xia Chu.

572
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,650
Yes.

573
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,639
You go.

574
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,250
Yes!

575
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,010
You are her teacher.

576
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,310
Why don't you go?

577
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,630
I'm afraid of water.

578
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,410
Go.

579
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,400
Hello.

580
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,290
I'm the captain of
Commandos Team Thunder,

581
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,320
Liang Mu Ze.

582
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,130
What's the situation?

583
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,680
We found the SOS call
from the trapped victim by kindling

584
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,050
a fire on the island.

585
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,720
Now, the initial development
of the rescue plan is

586
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,410
to use the zodiac boats
and choose a suitable spot

587
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,160
[to land on the island]

588
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,880
[with the aid of your
familiarity with this waters.]

589
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,610
[And considering the condition
of the trapped victim,]

590
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,280
it would be better if you could
have an accompanying doctor

591
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,130
to assist the victim at any time

592
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,530
for further transit.

593
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,010
Tighten the zodiac boat!

594
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,530
Did you get the
life jackets,

595
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,810
rescue ropes and stretchers?

596
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,570
We have everything!

597
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,290
Okay, keep this in mind! Be safe!

598
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,360
Yes!

599
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,810
No problem.

600
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,480
Keep me posted.

601
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,760
Okay.

602
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,960
Report!

603
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,640
Xia Chu?

604
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,440
Why are you here?

605
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,120
Military Doctor Wu is sick.

606
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,370
I'm here to assist in the rescue

607
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,470
in his place.

608
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,640
You? No way. Go find a male.

609
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,840
I can do it.

610
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,010
I have experience of being a frontliner
in the rescue of disaster areas.

611
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,440
I'm a strong swimmer,
I have no seasickness.

612
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,780
Brigade Commander,

613
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,640
she can do it.

614
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,080
Okay, then. I'm counting on you.

615
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,720
I'll ensure the
completion of the task!

616
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,970
Attention! Get on the car and depart!

617
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes!

618
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,600
Make way!

619
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,720
Can you hear me?

620
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,600
I can.

621
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,800
Is the boat yours?

622
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,960
Yes.

623
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,990
What is your job?

624
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,750
I'm a fisherman.

625
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,120
Why did you come to the island?

626
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,020
I was kidnapped.

627
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:35,950
What's your name?

628
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,510
Help me.

629
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,090
Help me.

630
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,110
He's in shock.

631
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,930
The patient needs a
venous access immediately.

632
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,920
Illuminate it for me.

633
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,080
The heavy rainstorm is coming.

634
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,680
The patient can't catch a cold now.

635
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,490
Carry him to the boat!

636
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,640
Yes.

637
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,560
Done!

638
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,170
How are we supposed to go back
in this downpour?

639
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,370
No, the blood oxygenation
level hasn't increased.

640
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,790
He has hemothorax.

641
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,400
I need to perform a
close drainage for him.

642
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,370
Right here?

643
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,150
Does it have the risk of infection?

644
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,610
It does,

645
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,760
but it can save his life.

646
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,830
How can we assist you? Come on!

647
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,410
Hold his hands up.

648
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,380
Lift his shirt up.

649
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,940
Give a hand!

650
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,610
Done.

651
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,840
His condition is temporarily stable.

652
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,550
Let's hope he can make it
until the rain stops.

653
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,650
Go and get some rest.

654
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,160
Take the shift after midnight.

655
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,400
Okay, I understand.

656
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,880
Be safe. Keep me posted.

657
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,420
Okay.

658
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,560
When is this rain going to stop?

659
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,490
I've searched the information
of the weather bureau.

660
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,320
They predict it'll stop tomorrow morning.

661
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,440
What is this?

662
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,390
Nets.

663
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,240
It's for capturing the birds.

664
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,080
Many rare species have gone extinct

665
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,300
because of being
captured by this thing.

666
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,540
It's so cruel.

667
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,760
It's the lure of the money.

668
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,470
You can't think it by
using fact-based logic.

669
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,600
Is there no cure for it?

670
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,680
How could you cure the desire?

671
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,010
You're a doctor.

672
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,600
You should know that

673
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,750
this thing is like a lot of diseases.

674
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,130
The prevalence of desire

675
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,630
is the latent sin in humanity.

676
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,020
It can only be controlled.
It can't be cured.

677
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,600
Does it frustrate you?

678
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,390
Some times.

679
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,490
I'll feel frustrated when I'm powerless

680
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,690
to save the people.

681
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,910
Me too.

682
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,480
Sometimes, I wonder if

683
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,160
my life would be
much easier if I didn't

684
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,830
apply for Military Medical University?

685
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,590
I have many high school friends.

686
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,960
They already worked for a few years.

687
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,600
Some of them are married
and have children.

688
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,760
As for me,

689
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,160
it's like my life just started.

690
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,530
It feels like I got suspended.

691
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,360
Do you regret it?

692
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,250
Not at all.

693
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,640
Let me tell you in secret.

694
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,800
Actually, I have another name.
It's Wan Jiu.

695
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,450
My father came up with it.

696
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,680
It means...

697
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,440
A widely nurturing talent.

698
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,410
You knew it?

699
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,010
When I was in high school,

700
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,920
I wanted to pursue our representative
of the language course.

701
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,430
I memorized

702
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,070
the entire poem of "Lisao".

703
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,970
You said you haven't developed a

704
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,400
habit for anyone before.

705
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,200
Didn't you like to read detective novel

706
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,940
because of someone else?

707
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,360
I admit that.

708
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,810
Do you admit it?

709
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,040
I don't.

710
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,960
The exact words you asked me was

711
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,120
"will someone's habit"

712
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,700
"live tenaciously within me?"

713
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,700
Right?

714
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,290
No.

715
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,530
That lady got married.

716
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,470
I almost forgot "Lisao" too.

717
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,310
I just remember this one line.

718
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,160
And it's related to your name.

719
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,870
This is a coincidence between us.

720
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,450
You talk a good game.

721
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,690
There are not many girls

722
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,910
with such names.

723
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,750
Right, my mum doesn't like it.

724
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,440
She thinks it's tiring
for a girl to have this name.

725
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,940
She wishes I could stay by her side

726
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,470
and be her baby.

727
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,390
But my father is different.

728
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,680
He thinks his daughter

729
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,530
should be capable of so much more,

730
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,000
should spare no effort to create,

731
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,630
and change the world
with intelligence and morality.

732
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,630
Just like him.

733
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,360
People who do science in high school

734
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,720
are usually lonely.

735
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,180
Especially the first two years,
which are the hardest time.

736
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,160
Many people will resign.

737
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,640
Many companies wanted to hire him

738
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,630
but he didn't leave.

739
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,670
He would sit on the cold bench
to calculate and

740
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:21,920
conduct experiments every day.

741
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,960
The intellectuals of their generation

742
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,020
have their own boundaries and beliefs.

743
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,780
So you agree with your father?

744
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,960
I respect him for being brave.

745
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,950
But I feel bad for my mother.

746
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,070
She has two workaholics.

747
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,060
Why?

748
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,530
Are you going to be a superwoman?

749
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,310
I don't know whether I'm strong or not.

750
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,210
But I think

751
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,240
now that I've come to this world,

752
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,270
apart from being a wife of a man

753
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,900
and a mother of a child,

754
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,370
I should be the best of me above all

755
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,800
and be the Dr Xia who saves lives.

756
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,540
What about you?

757
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,250
What type of man do you want to be?

758
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,480
What do you think?

759
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,480
The King of Soldiers.

760
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,280
Don't you?

761
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,000
Didn't you get trained
in Hunter Military School

762
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,450
for the title of
"The King Of Soldiers"?

763
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,530
I went to Hunter Military School

764
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,440
because I received
the order from the superiors.

765
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,770
And "The King of Soldiers"

766
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,440
is not a personal honour.

767
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,530
It carries the

768
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,150
professional image of
the entire Chinese soldiers.

769
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,230
I don't want to be a

770
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,060
superhero as the film shows.

771
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,100
I only want to be a purely

772
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,800
professional soldier.

773
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,240
Do you know what professional is?

774
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,170
Take you, for instance,

775
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,740
you make your rounds,
complete the charts

776
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,150
every day.

777
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,950
Right? And do the shift work.

778
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,470
This is your career
and these are what you should do.

779
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:06,910
As for me,

780
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,350
what should I do?

781
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,450
I need to train, exercise,
implement simulation tasks

782
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,040
everyday.

783
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,040
These are what I should do.

784
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,980
It's not about being a superhero,

785
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,660
nor chanting empty slogans.

786
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,990
I need to adhere to

787
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,540
my professional conviction
that comes with this military uniform.

788
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,480
This is my professional aspiration.
