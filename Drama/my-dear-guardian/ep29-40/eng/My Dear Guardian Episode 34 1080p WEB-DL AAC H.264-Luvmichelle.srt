00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,270
Liang Mu Ze!

5
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,690
It's you!

6
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,579
Long time no see.

7
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,970
Why are you here?

8
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,610
We're invited to watch the drill but

9
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,579
I did not expect to see you here.

10
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,829
So, is everybody okay?

11
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,420
Yeah,

12
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,650
pretty good.

13
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,520
Except for Songpaisarn.

14
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,190
He quit the team

15
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,090
and joined the mercenary army and then

16
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,390
he was killed

17
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,860
in an encounter with

18
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,829
Chinese troops.

19
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,120
I know.

20
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,690
I know.

21
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,770
What about you?

22
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,570
Sooner or later,

23
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,530
we will all be there.

24
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,010
Hey,

25
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,810
do you know his family?

26
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,730
I got a picture

27
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,250
from his body.

28
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,600
Can you pass this to them?

29
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,850
Thank you.

30
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,250
We were so young back then.

31
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,610
Do you know who this guy is?

32
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,970
Pei Yu.

33
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,650
Attention to Team Thunder!

34
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,130
Get your equipment ready!

35
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,580
In 20 minutes,

36
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,659
gather and depart!

37
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,970
Yes, sir!

38
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,260
Why didn't Blue Team
set up their base camp

39
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,620
somewhere with proper roads?

40
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,210
Are you all right?

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,540
Hang in there.

42
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,050
Otherwise,

43
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,250
we can stop the car
and get some fresh air out there.

44
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,120
It's okay.

45
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,900
Look at you.

46
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,500
Professor already told us.

47
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,900
You could've skipped this trip

48
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,159
if you have bad motion sickness.

49
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,120
No way.

50
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,080
Our department is going
to elect the chief resident soon.

51
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,900
This is a merit.

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,080
I won't let you run alone.

53
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,970
Stop pushing me away.

54
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,490
I'm dying. Just let me lean on you.

55
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,730
[Attention to all vehicles.]

56
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,700
[Infantry Brigade from Red Team
just passed by.]

57
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,930
[Please take cover.]

58
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,050
Watch out.

59
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,100
A fleet is coming.

60
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,900
Why should we take cover?

61
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,630
The drill hasn't started yet.

62
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,210
Miss, where's your military literacy?

63
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,060
A drill is real.

64
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,250
You don't have to wait for it to start
to arrest anyone.

65
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,050
No, I can't take it.

66
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,920
Among the Red Team's Infantry Brigade,

67
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,260
there are 59 jeeps,

68
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,970
114 trucks,

69
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,860
9 ambulances,

70
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,340
8 mobile command vehicles,

71
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,650
12 communication vehicles.

72
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,640
The number seems off.

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,180
Report to the command post.

74
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,700
Tell them

75
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,409
Red Team might outnumber us,

76
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,170
but judging
from their equipment and setup,

77
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,680
they're still using the same trick.

78
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,830
Yes, sir.

79
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,580
Enter the woods.

80
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,580
Come down! Help us push the cars!

81
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,690
What happened?

82
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,490
Is the car stuck?

83
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,730
Come help us!

84
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,010
One, two, three!

85
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,150
Captain,

86
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,410
I think the fleet in the woods

87
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,360
belongs to Dr Xia.

88
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,100
It won't budge!

89
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,620
Move aside.

90
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,930
Move aside, move aside.

91
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,770
I think she noticed us.

92
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,970
Be careful next time,

93
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,640
don't let me catch you again.

94
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,220
Xia Chu!

95
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,330
Let's go!

96
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,930
Move it.

97
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,410
Yes, sir.

98
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,200
Four-leaf clover.

99
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,530
That's really rare.

100
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,010
Yeah.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,780
But I still found it.

102
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,800
I just can.

104
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,120
How long does it take?

105
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,890
Very soon.

106
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,840
We'll get there
after we walk through this forest.

107
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,940
It's quite hidden.

108
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,000
Where did you get the bullet
you're hanging on your neck?

109
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,380
I was shot

110
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,400
on my chest.

111
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,290
Dang.

112
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,810
And you survived.

113
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,040
There's an old Chinese saying.

114
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,220
Those who survive a catastrophe

115
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,850
are bound to have good fortune later on.

116
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,720
You'll have everything
once you meet Old Master.

117

119
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,870
Pay attention.

120
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,660
Make sure your radio is silent.

121
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,800
Turn off all light sources.

122
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,200
Turn off night vision infrared.

123
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,330
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,430
Fox, Koala,

125
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,720
take care of the sentry.

126
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,690
Got it.

127
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,250
Freeze!

128
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,890
Sorry,

129
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,970
please make room.

130
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,890
Done.

131
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,990
Let's go.

132
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,690
Sorry, gentlemen.

133
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,660
Captain,

134
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,860
we got their strategy map.

135
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,590
We'll go all out this time.

136
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,180
What if it is a bait?

137
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,210
Just give it a shot.

138
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,120
If 99 percent is true,

139
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,610
it will be our lucky day.

140
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,780
Move.

141
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,100
[I'm telling you,]

142
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,450
[this is against the law!]

143
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,800
I gave them my order,

144
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,340
but they didn't obey it.

145
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,340
Besides that,

147
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,900
sent me any information,

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,670
they had already

149
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,380
gotten rid of your logistics department.

150
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,700
You can look into it.

151
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,630
As for the details,

152
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,570
I'm not clear about it either.

153
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,030
[Fine.]

154
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,830
[You win.]

155
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,650

165
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,420
to interfere our digital devices.

166
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,020
Hurry up

167
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,660
and solve the interception!

168
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,630
Yes, sir!

169
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,670
Organize an air strike

170
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,810
and attack Blue Team's base camp
right now!

Air raid! Air raid! Take cover!

172

This is communication vehicle number 4.

173
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,310
We were not harmed during the air raid.

174
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll move to another location

175
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,740
and continue interfering

176
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,890
Red Team's communication network.

177
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Move!

[Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4's Headquarters]

179

Usually, at this hour,

180
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,770
Old Master will be at the dining hall.

181
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,280
Every night,

It has to be prepared
when he's having dinner.

184

188
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,410
you're from Chinese Mainland's
top special forces.

189
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,190
I used to be.

190
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,370
What about now?

191
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,960
I made a mistake,

192
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,640
got sent to jail,

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,700
Why did you come here?

195
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,580
Long Yi called me

196
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,940
and said there's an opportunity here.

197
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,450
Old Master, I can explain.

198
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,940
I do have opportunities for you,

199
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,570
but what can you offer?

200
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,010
Connections,

201
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,930
access,

202
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,810
and the bosses' money.

203
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,320
If you work with me,

204
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,330
not only your stuff,

205
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,360
even weapons,

206
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,930
organs,

207
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,650
and information,

208
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,820
will have a market

209
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,810
through me.

210
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,430
You don't have to wait.

211
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,850
As long as you ask for it,

212
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,610
I can provide it anytime you want.

213
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,900
You brought so much cash,

214
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,970
yet you managed
to leave the country safely.

215
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,010
Should I say that you're lucky

216
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,520
or is someone

217
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,130
playing tricks behind my back?

218
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,510
Tell me, who sent you here?

219
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,700
Money.

220
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,850
Money sent me here.

221
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,840
Take him away.

222
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,050
How was it?

223
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,020
Not good.

224
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,540
I can't track his signal.

225
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,460
Where's Zhuo Ran?

226
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm contacting him,

227
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,410
but there's no answer.

228
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,730
Sun Xiao Mo,

229
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,900
take someone

230
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,060
to check Zhuo Ran's company
and hotel suite right now.

231
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,460
You must track him down.

232
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,480
Yes.

233
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,200
Director Zhuo,

234
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,630
some police officers...

235
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,990
I think he's asleep.

236
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,450
He's been working overtime recently.

237
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,280
Why don't you ask him when he's awake?

238
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,210
Mr Zhuo.

239
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,550
He's really asleep.

240
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,380
He printed a 3D mask of his own face

241
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,300
saying that it was for product testing.

242
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,220
Then, he asked his male staff to put it on

243
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,650
and sat in his office.

244
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,620
Now,

245
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,250
he is nowhere to be found.

246
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,970
Calm down.

247
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,140
You knew that he's from the special forces

248
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,500
and a police undercover.

249
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,080
Why didn't you tell me?

250
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,760
You made me bring him to meet Old Master,

251
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,320
and secretly fanned the flames

252
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,280
in front of Old Master,

253
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,950
made him suspect his identity
and my motive.

254
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,770
What exactly do you want?

255
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,190
Heart.

256
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,910
What?

257
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,640
Tian Yong's heart.

258
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,570
I remotely controlled the computer

259
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,290
of Hospital 109,

260
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,280
and saw Tian Yong's

261
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,400
organ donation registration form

262
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,160
in their internal system.

263
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,030
His blood type

264
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,120
is the same as my mother's.

265
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,700
Later, I checked
his physical examination data

266
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,260
and confirmed that their hearts match.

267
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,300
He can save my mother.

268
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,960
Old Master threw him into a well.

269
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,610
He won't die.

270
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,050
Old Master won't let him off.

271
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,050
He won't let you off either.

272
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,920
How did you know he's a police?

273
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,090
When the police arrests Old Master,

274
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,610
remember to save Tian Yong.

275
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,530
Why should I listen to you?

276
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,180
If you flee with Tian Yong,

277
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,890
you'll have better protection.

278
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,780
What if the police don't come?

279
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,460
Old Master still won't kill Tian Yong.

280
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,430
Otherwise,
he wouldn't go through all the trouble.

281
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,620
Save Tian Yong.

282
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll take care of the rest.

283
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,810
If you fail,

284
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,710
I will take your life right away.

285
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,210
I still have

286
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,400
the information which Tang Lin stole.

287
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,250
You didn't give it to Old Master?

288
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,670
After tonight,

289
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,010
everything will be over.

290
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,940
This is a statement
of Professor Xia Guang Yuan

291
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,270
from Institute of Chemistry,
University of Dong'an.

292
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,450
He said,

293
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,170
one time, Zhuo Ran framed him

294
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,370
for drug possession.

295
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,870
He even dragged his assistant down.

296
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,300
He repeatedly stole

297
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
a medical sedative formula

298
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,370
and clinical experiment data

299
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,810
that their laboratory was researching on.

300
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,170
I think

301
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,310
this is his main motive

302
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,130
for travelling
between Ningjiang and Dong'an.

303
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,530
I must've overlooked it.

304
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,160
How is Tian Yong now?

305
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,660
Judging from the news we got,

306
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,100
I assume Tian Yong has exposed himself.

307
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,490
What's your suggestion?

308
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,760
Seek international cooperation

309
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,640
through diplomatic relations.

310
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,240
Form a joint military
and police team immediately

311
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,970
to travel to the country and arrest him.

312
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,410
Up till now,

313
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,010
we haven't found any solid proof
against Old Master.

314
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,320
If we start an overseas operation,

315
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,820
it might be a problem.

316
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,290
What about Tian Yong's safety?

317
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,130
I know.

318
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,260
I know.

319
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,110
What about this?

320
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,400
Keep on tracking Tian Yong's whereabouts.

321
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
I will report this situation

322
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,310
to the superior.

323
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,500
After we get the approval,

324
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,100
we will start overseas operations.

325
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,210
This is the only thing we can do now.

326
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,210
Captain,

327
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,240
which is our target today?

328
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,330
Red Team's Special Forces Brigade?

329
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,670
Stop joking, captain.

330
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,180
There are over 2,000 people

331
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,550
in their Special Forces Brigade.

332
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,220
There are just a few of us,

333
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,050
we'll make a fool of ourselves.

334
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,970
Look at how terrified you are.

335
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,170
I mean this.

336
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,940
This is...

337
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,770
The defensive tank
of Red Team's Infantry Brigade?

338
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,650
Where are the red armbands we seized?

339
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,890
Amazing.

340
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,700
Let's depart three minutes later!

341
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,050
Yes! Got it!

342
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,450
Move!

343
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,270
Stop!

344
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,010
Stop!

345
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,340
Come up here.

346
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,570
I'll drive.

347
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,620
You want to drive the tank?

348
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,500
Tian Yong is not here.

349
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,060
Take over the lieutenant's place

350
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,250
and command on my behalf.

351
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,410
Yes.

352
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,940
Keep the radio connected,

353
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,330
be ready to fire at any time.

354
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,850
Consider it done.

355
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,170
The gun.

356
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,200
Sergeant, you've come to the wrong place.

357
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,500
No!

358
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,970
Isn't this Special Forces Brigade?

359
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,250
What are you doing?

360
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,300
Chief,

361
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,670
we've fallen behind.

362
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,140
Our signal was intercepted by Blue Team,

363
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,530
we couldn't contact the other tanks.

364
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,750
We're running out of petrol.

365
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,220
We'll leave after refilling petrol here.

366
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,500
Go find the logistics for petrol.

367
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,890
Stop blocking the way here.

368
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,120
Go refill petrol and leave right away.

369
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes!

370
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,190
Fox.

371
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,520
We've located the target.

372
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,420
Be ready to fire.

373
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,080
Copy that.

374
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,360
Sir,

375
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,770
the drill's commanding department
has confirmed

376
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,340
that Red Team's Special Forces Brigade

377
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,360
has been attacked by our commandos.

378
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,560
Besides that...

379
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,990
Besides what?

380
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,930
The chief of Red Team is pissed off.

381
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,700
That little brat.

382
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,330
Freeze! Hands up!

383
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,070
Get everyone under control!
Search carefully!

384
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,199
Go, go!

385
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,730
Mum.

386
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,659
Mum.

387
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,440
Everything's fine now.
Let's get out of here.

388
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,110
Where is Tian Yong?

389
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,050
Where are you going?

390
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,850
Don't look at him. Look at me!

391
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,900
You traitor.

392
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,690
You exposed my factory in Isaia,

393
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,230
now you're using Tian Yong as a bait

394
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,470
so that the police would arrest me,

395
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,440
right?

396
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,730
You even try
to use Xia Guang Yuan's research

397
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,650
to do a deal with me.

398
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,130
What were you thinking?

399
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,810
Listen. Over here,

400
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,720
the person who calls the shots is me.

401
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,530
Only me!

402
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,340
Thank you for your cooperation
in this play.

403
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,050
So I can find out

404
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,710
the ghosts hiding around me.

405
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,270
Don't be happy just yet.

406
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,910
The government has received a report
from the Chinese police.

407
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,140
Next time,

408
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,670
it could be a real one.

409
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,880
You're here.

410
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,250
I'm leaving.

411
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
What can they find?

412
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,320
Please.

413
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,890
Old Master, please take us in.

414
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,810
No, don't eat it!

415
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,390
I know you're a good son.

416
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,980
You did all these

417
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,770
just to save your mother.

418
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,360
You're a good child.

419
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,980
I'll make your wish come true.

420
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,660
Go get Xia Guang Yuan's research for me

421
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,410
in exchange for your mother.

422
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,600
What do you think?

423
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,940
Go back to Chinese Mainland now,

424
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,650
I will arrange manpower for you.

425
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,570
All you have to do

426
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,400
is get the stuff I want,

427
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,950
including Tian Yong.

428
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,040
If you want to use him

429
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,720
to exonerate yourself from your crime,

430
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,230
you can do that as well.

431
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,640
Make your own choice.

432
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,730
Where do we go?

433
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,710
The training ground of the Chinese army

434
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,710
to find someone.

435
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,130
Many of those who fell into that well

436
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,540
either drowned or died from terror.

437
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,790
The water isn't deep.

438
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,230
No.

439
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,130
They died from despair.

440
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,660
They didn't know
if they could make it out alive,

441
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,300
just like now.

442
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,580
Do you think the people who sent you here

443
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,250
still care about your safety?

444
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,690
Who... Who sent me here?

445
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,020
Make a guess.

446
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,840
Think.

447
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,680
Wasn't it Long Yi?

448
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,870
Perhaps you can tell me

449
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,050
how much

450
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,450
the Chinese police know about me,

451
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,340
what evidence they have.

452
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,160
If you're so concerned
about the Chinese police,

453
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,110
why don't you send me back?

454
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,880
I will find out for you.

455
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,890
I am

456
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,050
an expert in this.

457
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,450
You're quite stubborn.

458
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,720
But when it comes to certain things,

459
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,580
even a Chinese Special Forces soldier

460
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,070
can only give in.

461
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,540
Handcuffs.

462
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,380
If you can't stand it,

463
00:41:59,470 --> 00:41:59,990
just call me.

464
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,050
Did you hear me?

465
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,010
Call me if you can't stand it.

466
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,130
Both of you,

467
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,360
listen to me.

468
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,950
If you kill him,

469
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,970
I'll let you out.

470
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,610
Grenade launcher, fire!

471
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,260
Meet at the designated location!

472
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,050
[Roger!]

473
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,300
Everyone, go to the designated location

474
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,010
-to meet the tank!
-Yes!

475
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,380
I heard

476
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,090
that Liang Mu Ze and his men

477
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,830
wiped out the ace unit

478
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,710
which Red Team was proud of.

479
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,780
The commander from Red Team was so pissed

480
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,580
that his blood pressured spiked to 180.

481
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,940
Do you know what the slogan

482
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,210
for Red Team is now?

483
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,980
Turn the training ground upside down,

484
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,850
arrest Liang Mu Ze!

485
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,560
You must be proud, huh, Dr Xia?

486
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,850
It's none of my business.

487
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,240
You're blushing.

488
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,370
Liang Mu Ze.

489
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,260
-Plant the bomb.
-Yes.

490
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,540
The equipment!

491
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,690
Let's go. Move.

492
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,290
Get in the tank!
