[Episode 5]

4
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,020
Have you seen Dr Zhang?

5
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,990
He's in the dressing room.

6
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,630
Thank you.

7
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,670
You're welcome.

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,470
Dr Zhang!

9
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,830
I'm changing,
what are you doing?

10
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,990
Sorry! Sorry!

11
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,630
She's killing me.
How reckless!

12
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,150
Xia Chu, how inappropriate!

13
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,910
Just carry on and listen to me.

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,260
We might be able to use

15
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,740
interventional surgery
for Xiao Jun's ASD

16
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,190
but only if we can find a method

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,630
that is more intuitive than a CT scan

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,870
for understanding the condition
of his ASD.

19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,790
I tell you what.

20
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,620
The most intuitive way is

21
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,030
to cut the heart open,

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,350
and it's the most accurate way.

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,740
And a 3D printed heart model.

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,500
3D printed heart model?

25
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,790
Do not take photos!

26
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,870
I just want to show
you the previous case.

27
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,270
Someone has succeeded before.

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,670
You get out first.

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,750
Get out!

[Dressing room]

31
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,910
Keep that in mind.

32
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,020
It's the men's dressing room.

33
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,150
I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,910
I was in a hurry.

35
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,270
Then...

36
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,510
Where's the case?

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,070
Look.

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,660
This is his echocardiography

39
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,590
and this.

40
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,070
Okay.

41
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,829
It's possible.

42
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,180
But I haven't done it before.

43
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,070
I might need to
consult with a company.

44
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,030
I have a classmate
who's in this line of work.

45
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,710
Then hurry up and contact him.

46
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,430
Okay.

47
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,390
Xia Chu?

48
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,870
It's me.

49
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,430
I have something to talk to you.

50
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,660
[Go ahead.]

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,740
There's a kid with
congenital heart disease.

52
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,750
His first operation failed.

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,829
We need your 3D printing technology

54
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,470
to print his heart model out

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,310
before we perform the second surgery.

56
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,300
To get a full overview

57
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,950
of the location and type of his ASD

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,670
and to practice the surgery in advance.

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,500
You may wait in there.

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,710
Boss will be right here soon.

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,390
Thank you.

62
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,830
Do you know the
origin of this sketch?

63
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,950
September 7, 2011.

64
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,990
It was my first day
transferring to a new school.

65
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,909
During recess,

66
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,990
someone invited me to play shuttlecock.

67
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,620
I was hesitant.

68
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,110
It wasn't that I don't want to.

69
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,870
Just that I was drawing

70
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,060
a girl with a

71
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,630
beautiful smile at that moment.

72
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,910
Hello, Xia Chu.

73
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,660
The CT scans and the data of

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,830
echocardiography of
the patient are all in here.

75
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,230
How long does it take
to complete the production?

76
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,070
About one week if everything goes well.

77
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,030
How about the fee?

78
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,110
It depends on the material you choose.

79
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,230
Will the quality of the

80
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,630
materials affect the
accuracy of the final model?

81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,590
It won't affect much.

82
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,070
For preoperative purposes,

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,710
normal materials costing a few
hundred will do.

84
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,150
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,020
If you have any medical issues that

86
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,990
need to be communicated,

87
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,310
please feel free to contact me.

88
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,910
Xia Chu,

89
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,670
is it only medical
issues that I can ask?

90
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,540
I don't know about other questions.

91
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,030
And I have no time to answer that.

92
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,990
Are you still mad at me?

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,420
No.

94
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,860
That's it.

95
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,830
Zhuo Ran,

96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,510
I am a resident.

97
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,980
My patients are

98
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,190
my first priority.

99
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,670
If it weren't for helping
my patients,

100
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
I wouldn't be standing here today

101
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,430
and have this conversation with you.

102
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,540
I want to spend my time
on the people and things

103
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,510
that are more meaningful to me.

104
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,030
Do you understand me?

105
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,550
With her attitude,

106
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,940
are you sure the plan
to approach Xia Guang Yuan

107
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,150
through her will work?

108
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,190
Xia Chu's attitude towards Zhuo Ran

109
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,630
would never change.

110
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,870
We just need time to rouse her.

111
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,350
I believe we can get what we need

112
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,590
through Xia Chu.

113
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,990
I hope so.

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,510
So far,

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,980
we can't identify

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
the male body in the villa.

117
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,590
We found an account

118
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,380
named Scary Pirate

119
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,190
in a confiscated laptop

120
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,820
but

121
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,390
it takes time to break the passcode.

122
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,430
So we can't confirm

123
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,990
whether this is related to

124
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,380
the founder who lurks in the drugs

125
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,350
trading platform.

126
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,550
Even if we break the passcode,

127
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,540
this can only mean that the person

128
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,780
logged into the account

129
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,630
named Scary Pirate in the villa.

130
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,460
It can't show who Scary Pirate is

131
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,950
or if he's related to that body.

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,870
This might be a
characteristic of a cybercrime.

133
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,780
Any progress on the

134
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,780
Jiao Tong University district case?

135
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,140
The name of the deceased is Zhou Lan,

136
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,380
22 years old,

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,710
born in Yibin, Sichuan.

138
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,870
She came here from
Chengdu three years ago.

139
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,900
She'd worked as a beverage promoter

140
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,310
in a club before.

141
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,350
She was later kept by

142
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,900
a man named Mr Bear.

143
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,230
After they broke up in March this year,

144
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,740
Mr Bear gave one of his properties

145
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,190
to the deceased,

146
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,550
which is the house where

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,750
the body was found
by the cleaning lady.

148
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,420
Has the autopsy report come out yet?

149
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,390
Yes.

150
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,670
According to the autopsy report,

151
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,910
basically, we can rule out
the possibility of homicide.

152
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,230
Zhou Lan's drowning

153
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,820
might be due to the
hallucination which was

154
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,310
caused by the consumption
of methamphetamine.

155
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,510
Where is the drugs' source?

156
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,059
We logged into an account

157
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,789
which she saved on the laptop.

158
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,460
We found that she had sent

159
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,549
a few posts requesting drugs in a

160
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,950
drug trading platform
called City of Desire.

161
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,350
How did a 20-year-old young lady

162
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,620
enter this

163
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,870
bottomless world?

164
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,070
Who is Mr Bear

165
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,190
exactly?

166
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,820
Hurry up! Keep going!

167
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,390
Hurry up!

168
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,670
Keep going! Keep going!

169
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,630
Hurry up! Keep going!

170
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,910
Hurry up! Keep going!

171
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,790
Hurry up! Run!

172
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,270
Hurry up! Run!

173
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,310
Hurry up! Keep going!

174
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,550
Hurry up! Run!

175
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,670
I'm a second faster
than your vice-captain.

176
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,070
Finish the remaining five kilometres.

177
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,350
Vice-captain,

178
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,470
are you an undercover
whom the captain sent here?

179
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,870
Are you a fun guy
whom the monkey sent here?

180
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,710
Wipe your drool.

181
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,830
Okay, stop hesitating!
Let's get started!

182
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,060
All tanks!

183
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,140
Five kilometres of trail running!

184
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,830
Double march!

185
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,510
Get your equipment.

186
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,630
I got it!

187
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,910
Brigade Commander.

188
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,110
In the last comprehensive assessment,

189
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,870
you set a new record
for Team Lightning.

190
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,990
Here's your citation.

191
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,350
Let's take a photo.

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
This isn't a first-class merit.

193
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,420
You're getting

194
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,660
greedy.

195
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,550
Even a field citation

196
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,910
can't satisfy you?

197
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,100
It was within our expectation.

198
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,310
We can get a better result

199
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,870
if Tian Yong hadn't cramped up.

200
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
Don't be proud!

201
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,540
Later on,

202
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,230
there will be a special combat training
for reserve officers.

203
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,310
By then,

204
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,910
all the experts will be here.

205
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,070
The more experts, the better.

206
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,140
It would be boring
if they were incompetent.

207
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm quite cool.

208
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,590
What's the point that
I think you're cool?

209
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,390
You have to make the
ladies think you're cool.

210
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,270
Silly boy.

211
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,430
When it comes to girls,

212
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,790
I've had only one problem

213
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,910
since childhood.

214
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,590
Too many ladies are coming for me.

215
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,270
Are you sure about that?

216
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,980
Then why did your mother

217
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,750
send me the photos?

218
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,430
What photos?

219
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,870
No, Mother, you're a

220
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,860
knowledgeable lady

221
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,700
who has been working for years, right?

222
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,020
Why did you become ignorant
and old-fashioned

223
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,510
when it comes to your child's marriage?

224
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,620
Not that I don't like it.

225
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,870
Just that it's too many.

226
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,670
I need to work too.

227
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,430
Mother?

228
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,430
Now she is mad.

229
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,620
Report!

230
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,590
Come in.

231
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,350
Captain,

232
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,790
Brigade Commander said...

233
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,310
Here it comes again.

234
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,070
What did he say?

235
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,110
Brigade Commander asked you to

236
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,310
drive me to the hospital
for a re-inspection

237
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,910
and to visit Xiao Jun.

238
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,830
Noted.

239
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,700
You can take some.

240
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,670
No, Captain.

241
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,060
-Why did you ask me to take it?
-Don't be shy.

242
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,940
-No!
-Take it!

243
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,220
I didn't see it, really!

244
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,550
-Take a pick!
-I really didn't see it!

245
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,350
Captain!

246
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,390
Keep it...

247
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,470
Captain, I'll go change my clothes!

248
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,110
He was staring at it.

249
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,950
Captain,

250
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,710
You're really ungrateful.

251
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,100
How I wish my parents

252
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,390
could arrange my marriage.

253
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,470
And you?

254
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
You don't appreciate it

255
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,020
and you even keep

256
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,630
yourself away from girls like a monk.

257
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,710
What's wrong with you?

258
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,910
I just don't like it.

259
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,040
What do you dislike?

260
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,030
There's always a stack of photos.

261
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,750
Looking at the photos,
having blind dates.

262
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,300
It's so old-fashioned.

263
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,140
Why don't you just say

264
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,580
you don't like any of the girls
in the photos?

265
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,110
What's all this for?

266
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,390
What isn't old-fashioned?

267
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,980
Among tens of thousands of people,

268
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,390
in the boundless river
spanning tens of thousands of years,

269
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,230
there's such thing as being too
early or too late.

270
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,620
What a coincidence! You met

271
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,550
the one you wish to meet.

272
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,030
You can only ask her discreetly,

273
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,620
"So you're here?"

274
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,870
Shut up!

275
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,430
Do you think this will work, Captain?

276
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,270
Stop talking.

277
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,820
According to the 3D printed heart model

278
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,030
of the patient,

279
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,670
ASD runs obliquely between the lower
part of the right superior and inferior

280
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,550
pulmonary vein and the superior
part of the inferior vena cava.

281
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,030
If we use APMLATZ
septal occluder on the

282
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,030
model to simulate the occlusion,

283
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,700
the right superior

284
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,230
and inferior pulmonary vein
will be obstructed,

285
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,470
which is the same problem
on the first surgery.

286
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,980
If we use a PDA occluder

287
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,300
to occlude it,

288
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,310
there'll be no obstruction on the right
superior and inferior pulmonary vein

289
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,790
making for a tight and secure seal.

290
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,830
Above is the result
of the surgical trial

291
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,550
according to the 3D printed heart model.

292
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,590
I've finished the debrief.

293
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,870
Thank you.

294
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,270
Xia Chu,

295
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,310
prepare for the surgery.

296
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,870
Yes.

297
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,070
We don't need to cut the heart open?

298
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,470
Yes.

299
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,270
But I heard Dr Zhang said

300
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,470
it's hard to process
with interventional surgery.

301
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,630
Yes, it is.

302
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,060
That's why we need to duplicate

303
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,590
Xiao Jun's heart and simulate

304
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,310
the occlusion on the heart model

305
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,710
before the surgery.

306
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,430
Duplicating the heart,

307
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,550
does it really work?

308
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,740
Of course.

309
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,470
Conventional ultrasonic imaging
with CT imaging

310
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,100
and 3D data test mode,

311
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,830
these are the latest technologies.

312
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,230
Have there been any
successful cases before?

313
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,310
Why are you here?

314
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm with Tian Yong.
He's here for a re-inspection.

315
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,580
If this is the first attempt...

316
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,790
This is the first time
for our hospital.

317
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,540
But there's been successful cases

318
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,630
in other hospitals.

319
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,950
3D printing technology

320
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,790
can make a more
accurate surgical plan.

321
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,630
There are certain
risks in thoracotomy too.

322
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,980
As for the interventional surgery,

323
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,870
the damage it causes
is relatively minor.

324
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,350
Why don't you give it a try?

325
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,340
Trust her.

326
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,910
I'm in charge of tomorrow's operation.

327
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,750
You failed in the first operation.

328
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,100
Interventional surgery is

329
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,190
the field of cardiology.

330
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,630
Rest assured.

331
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,070
For a surgeon, an interventional surgery

332
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,670
is nothing new.

333
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,070
What about this?

334
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,630
It's more intuitive

335
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,870
with this.

336
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,430
What are you doing?

337
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,230
It's not our first time to kiss.

338
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,180
What are you doing?

339
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,340
Enough.

340
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,590
We've broken up for years.

341
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,270
Why did you do that?

342
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,180
Did you do that to

343
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,230
your resident too?

344
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,990
Which resident?

345
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,780
Xia Chu.

346
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,020
How is that possible?

347
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,260
You're ridiculous!

348
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,020
Let me tell you,

349
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,780
I've stayed away

350
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,710
from all my colleagues

351
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,830
since we broke up.

352
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,980
I knew

353
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,950
you'd regret

354
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,910
breaking up with me.

355
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,060
Why don't

356
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,110
we get back together?

357
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,910
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?

358
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,550
I don't...

359
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,990
Don't tell me

360
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,710
it's all because of an operation.

361
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,980
It's a huge operation
that might

362
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,910
break new grounds for clinical medicine.

363
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,940
Li Juan,

364
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,109
you haven't changed a bit

365
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,390
after all these years.

366
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,099
Have you changed?

367
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,310
I am responsible for my patient.

368
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,710
I thought you would
oppose this operation.

369
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,350
A doctor told me.

370
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,950
When a patient is
on the operating table,

371
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,430
the person who wishes for
his safety the most

372
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,190
is the doctor.

373
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,830
True.

374
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,430
Is the 3D printed heart model reliable?

375
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,950
It should be performed

376
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,270
by a cardiologist if it has to be done.

377
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,110
One more time.

378
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,990
This operation won't work.

379
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,580
Why not?

380
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,620
We've studied the patient's

381
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,150
3D printed heart model thoroughly

382
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,070
and the surgical plan
is well-established.

383
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,180
What remains is

384
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,750
seriousness and patience.

385
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,470
There will be no problems.

386
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,630
Zhang Yi Chi is going
to perform the repair of ASD.

387
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,270
Notify the anesthesiologist
and extracorporeal circulation

388
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,790
to prepare for the repair of ASD.

389
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,710
Yes, Dr Zhang.

390
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,510
Dr Zhang,

391
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,260
use model 26 PDA occluder.

392
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,150
We've tried it many times.

393
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,470
Its umbrella is more stable.

394
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,550
You can't go wrong.

395
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,830
Sir,

396
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,190
please don't give up.

397
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,270
Try it again.

398
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,910
Open model 26 PDA occluder.

399
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,150
Yes.

400
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,430
Dr Zhang.

401
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,870
Dr Zhang.

402
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,230
It's successful.

403
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,110
We had a little trouble while occluding

404
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,670
the ASD at first,

405
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,220
but then at her insistence,

406
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,540
we promptly

407
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,180
replaced it with a PDA occluder,

408
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,190
and it worked.

409
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,870
Thank you!

410
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,790
Thank you!

411
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,710
Thank you!

412
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,950
And Dr Xia.

413
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,950
Thank you very much!

414
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,190
You guys really

415
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,590
are angels, thank you.

416
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,310
Okay, you can rest assured now.

417
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,590
I have to drop by the emergency room.

418
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,900
Go on, you go on.

419
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,990
I'll get going.

420
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,110
Dr Xia

421
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,910
told you that, didn't she?

422
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,070
Yes.

423
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,430
You work this hard

424
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,990
just for an operation?

425
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,870
It's not about the operation,

426
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,630
it's for saving the patient.

427
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,070
Then how do you feel
about reclaiming the patient?

428
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,630
A patient is not a prize.

429
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,350
Don't use the word "claim."

430
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,750
I tell you what, Xia Chu.

431
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,980
Every resident in this hospital

432
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,550
wishes to take part in the surgery.

433
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,430
We work hard to show our strengths.

434
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,230
I finally got a chance

435
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,150
but you easily took it from me.

436
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,910
You took advantage of me.

437
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,590
I'm enough with your sweet-talk.

438
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,460
Do you know

439
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,780
how annoying you are?

440
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,180
Easily?

441
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,220
I only slept for

442
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,750
ten hours in seven days for this model.

443
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,340
I kept researching, practising
and recording data

444
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,180
during this period.

445
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,830
From the operation in the morning
to the handover,

446
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,790
I didn't even have time to eat.

447
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm so sleepy and hungry
I could vomit,

448
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,710
but I keep going, why?

449
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,990
Because someone told me

450
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,980
not to give up on

451
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,430
my patient until the last minute.

452
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,220
I made it.

453
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,550
Now, I'm really happy.

454
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,790
Your likes and dislikes

455
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,020
are meaningless to me.

456
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,940
I didn't come to this hospital

457
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,300
to please you.

458
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,060
Why are you here?

459
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,710
You haven't eaten, right?

460
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,980
Laoyou noodles, without spices.

461
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,110
Your favourite taste.

462
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,430
You don't have to be like this.

463
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,980
Did the surgery go well?

464
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,430
Yes.

465
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,710
The model is useful.

466
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,390
Thank you.

467
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,910
That's great.

468
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,860
Eat the noodles.

469
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,070
I'll leave first.

470
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,870
How are things going?

471
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,310
Xiao Jun hasn't come out yet.

472
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,470
I'm in the middle of something.

473
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,430
Dr Xia, you're awake.

474
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,830
Dr Xia, you've worked hard.

475
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,590
Can I help you?

476
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,470
Nothing.

477
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,790
Have you

478
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,430
found a place to stay?

479
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,070
I'm still searching.

480
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,550
I've been working overtime recently.

481
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,990
I have no time for it.

482
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,870
Then stop looking.
Just live in my house.

483
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,550
What?

484
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,510
Really?

485
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,630
Yes.

486
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,710
You're not that generous, Liang Mu Ze.

487
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,390
Yes.

488
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,940
There's a condition.

489
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,910
Okay.

490
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,950
You didn't even ask
what the condition is.

491
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,350
I'm fine with everything.

492
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,830
Nothing is more important
than one's life and death.

493
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,590
Okay then.

494
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,510
Date me.

495
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,510
What did you say?

496
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,910
Date me.

497
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,340
To handle my mother.

498
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,710
Just faking it.

499
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,910
Liang Mu Ze, are you crazy?

500
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,630
How could we pretend to fall in love?

501
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,820
Definitely not.

502
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,180
Did you spread

503
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,510
the information about me having a son?

504
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,750
I...

505
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,590
I didn't mean to.

506
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,900
My mother forced me.

507
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,270
I had no choice.

508
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,990
She always tries to set us up.

509
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,300
If I don't get firm with her

510
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,430
and put a stop to it,

511
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,110
she'd never stop nagging me.

512
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,270
You did wipe it out of
your mother's mind.

513
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,540
But my mother is

514
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,820
dying to take girls to my unit.

515
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,350
What should I do?

516
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,990
Isn't that great?

517
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,950
No.

518
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,110
I really can't pretend to fall in love.

519
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,300
Moreover,

520
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,420
what if you really fall in love

521
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,230
with me?

522
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,470
Just worry about yourself.

523
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,270
Me? Why should I be worried?

524
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,150
I'll fall in love with you?

525
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,230
Are you kidding?

526
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,900
By your silence,

527
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,230
I assume you accept it.

528
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,710
I ate.

529
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,430
A dose of public display of affection.

530
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,110
Liang Mu Ze, don't be like this.

531
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,910
What if someone sees us?

532
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,670
You made me nervous.

533
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,230
Why are you so nervous, Dr Xia?

534
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,350
I...

535
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,030
I'm just shocked.

536
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,860
By the way,

537
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,950
why must you ask me

538
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,350
to trick your mother?

539
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,030
You live in my house.

540
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,710
And you refuse to help me?

541
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,470
It must be you.

542
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,310
Senior.

543
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,310
[Where are you?]

544
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm in the hospital on
afternoon break.

545
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,190
[How about tomorrow?]

546
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,350
I have a night shift tomorrow.

547
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,910
What's wrong?
What's up?

548
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,630
[Professor Zhao of the
Military Medical University]

549
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,790
[had three consecutive
operations yesterday.]

550
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,540
[He died of acute myocardial
infarction on his way home.]

551
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,230
[Can you stop by?]

552
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,460
Okay.

553
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,910
Wait for me,
I'll be right over.

554
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,990
Deal?

555
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,390
What's wrong?

556
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,310
One of my professors
at the Military Medical University

557
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,190
died of acute myocardial infarction.

558
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,790
Where are you going?

559
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,510
To the airport.

560
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,940
I'll give you a ride.

561
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,110
I booked the 2 p.m. flight.

562
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,750
You don't have to pick me up.

563
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,910
Just send me the address.

564
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,030
I'll go there by myself.

565
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,060
Okay.

566
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,910
[Mr Zhang, I'm off.]

567
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,710
[Something's up, I'm
going back to my hometown.]

568
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,750
[I'll be back before
tomorrow's night shift.]

569
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,110
[Just a few days
before his retirement.]

570
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,820
His greatest wish

571
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,430
is to retire

572
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,390
to travel the world with his wife

573
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,700
to make up for the time

574
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,350
he's owed his family due to work.

575
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,310
Mrs Zhang is a high-school
geography teacher.

576
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,270
The farthest place they'd ever been to

577
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,230
was Yellow Mountain,
which they visited on their honeymoon.

578
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,350
Every time I go to Mr Zhang's house,

579
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,460
Mrs Zhang will take out

580
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,230
the photo and tell me

581
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,150
they would go to

582
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,340
Yellow Mountain again
after Mr Zhang retires

583
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,950
to see the clouds.

584
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,830
He's gone just like that.

585
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,150
Let's go.

586
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,470
I think it's stuck.

587
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,110
Let me take a look.

588
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,230
Done.

589
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,510
-Go.
-Thank you.

590
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,470
Do you have money?

591
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,430
I do.

592
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,710
Then

593
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,940
I'll get going.

594
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,950
Go.

595
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,620
About pretending to be your girlfriend,

596
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,110
I'll promise you

597
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,670
if it's a genuine need.

598
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,390
We'll talk about it when you're back.

599
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,540
Selling point!
It must have a selling point!

600
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,420
The reason why

601
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,830
the last issue became a hot topic...

602
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,150
3D printing company?

603
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,590
Mi Gu, what did you say?

604
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,510
Are you listening to me?

605
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,780
I'm listening.

606
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,540
So

607
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,540
you think

608
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,950
it's in a 3D printing company?

609
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,380
This is my way of thinking

610
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,350
about this problem.

611
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,030
This is the power of modern technology.

612
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,500
Good.

613
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,630
We'll do this.

614
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,750
Leave it to me.

615
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,980
[Mi Gu, please cover]

616
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,660
[the topic of 3D printing for this issue]

617
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,390
[as soon as possible.]

618
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,270
[I'm looking forward to it.]

619
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,470
[Hello, I am Mi Gu.]

620
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,790
[I'd like to meet up and]

621
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,300
[talk with you about 3D printing.]

622
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,350
[Are you free?]

623
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,590
[I'm sorry. The user you're calling]

624
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,150
[is not available.]

625
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,510
[Can you contact Zhuo Ran for me?]

626
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,830
[I'm looking for him.]

627
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,150
[I've met Mrs Zhang.]

628
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,550
[Everything is fine.]

629
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,150
[Thank you for giving me a ride.]

630
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,050
[Friend request]

631
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:15,100
[Special Forces: Accept]

632
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:39,690
[Set note and tag]

633
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,030
It's rare.

634
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,750
You proactively add a friend.

635
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,710
And it's a girl.

636
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,100
Can't I do that?

637
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,190
You can.

638
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,670
Is she extraordinary?

639
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,390
No.

640
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,030
But she is a doctor,
she saved Xiao Jun.

641
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,270
How long have you been living together?

642
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,310
Not even a ten-thousandth
of the time we've been together.

643
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,630
Well played.

644
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,230
Why do I feel that

645
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,470
you treat her differently?

646
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,060
What's the difference?

647
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,190
Look.

648
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,390
To send her to the airport,

649
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,110
you left me in the hospital

650
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,190
for so long.

651
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,510
You put off rejoining the unit

652
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,870
and

653
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,230
you have to take the risk of
being lectured by Brigade Commander.

654
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,950
Isn't the reason sufficient?

655
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,310
Isn't that obvious?

656
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,990
You're giving a reason

657
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,910
to scold you if you

658
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,070
don't drive faster.

659
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,350
Yes, sir!

660
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,550
It is hard to meet,
but hard to part too.

661
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,830
As the east wind wanes,
all the flowers fade.

662
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,270
Silkworms wonâ€™t stop spinning
silk till they die.

663
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,670
Sericulture is the new way to get rich.

664
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,270
Drive fast.

665
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,070
Xia, are you back?

666
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,860
I left the snow mushroom soup
on the table.

667
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,990
Drink it.

668
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,910
Miss Lan.

669
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,790
Girl, you're back. You scare me.

670
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,310
I thought it was your father.

671
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,950
Have you eaten?

672
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,180
I'll cook for you.

673
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,270
Never mind.

674
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,030
I've eaten.

675
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,110
You've eaten?

676
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,870
You didn't have your first meal
at home when you're back.

677
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,070
Where did you eat?

678
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,470
What did you eat?

679
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,870
Miss Lan,

680
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,110
I want to sleep with you tonight.

681
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,550
Silly girl,

682
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,830
you're past the age

683
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,590
to act like a baby.

684
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,190
Look at it.

685
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,870
How long since you've
cleaned your ear wax?

686
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,150
Don't move.

687
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,060
Home is the best, right?

688
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,670
Don't leave then.

689
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,950
No.

690
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,270
I still need to work.

691
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,430
You're

692
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,430
like your father.

693
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,790
You're a workaholic.

694
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,990
Has Father been busy recently?

695
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,030
Sure.

696
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,150
He's so busy that he's been gone
for three weeks.

697
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,030
Where did you two go

698
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,790
for your honeymoon?

699
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,110
No honeymoon.

700
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,070
Your father was summoned

701
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,230
by the research group the day
after our wedding.

702
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,470
Don't move!

703
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,790
Then you two must go on

704
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,910
a trip when father retires.

705
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,150
I'll pay for you.

706
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,550
You'll pay for us?

707
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,150
What can you do for us with your

708
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,150
starvation wage?

709
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,190
Just

710
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,710
take good care of yourself,

711
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,830
that would be enough for me.

712
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm doing fine.

713
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,580
Right.

714
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,310
Why did you come back

715
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,470
all of a sudden?

716
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,990
Did someone bully you in the hospital?

717
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,630
No.

718
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,110
Were you not satisfied
with your new house?

719
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,390
No.

720
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,950
You've got a boyfriend?

721
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,470
Stop being ridiculous.

722
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,260
I'm sleepy, let's sleep.

723
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,220
You...

724
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,220
You stupid girl.

725
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,950
You always avoid me
when I talk about something important.

726
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,710
Avoid me, will you?

727
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,670
Why did you want to go that far?

728
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,230
I worry when you're away from home.

729
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,070
I worry when you're back home.

730
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,950
You think that I'm naggy

731
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,710
and you refuse to listen to me, don't you?

732
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,190
I can only worry by myself.

733
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,710
You'll know it one day.

734
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,340
You'll know it when
you become a mother.

735
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,270
That whether every mother
in the world is the same.

736
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,630
I'm fine.

737
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,900
I just missed you guys

738
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,030
and wanted to come home.

739
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,670
I shouldn't have

740
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,230
allowed you to study medicine.

741
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,030
You're right.

742
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,540
What's good to study medicine?

743
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,710
But I like it.

744
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,910
What should I do?

745
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,490
[Military University Professor died of
sudden heart attack due to overwork.]

746
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,190
I'm back!

747
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,670
Er Miao.

748
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,310
Er Miao.

749
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,190
Do you miss me?

750
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,910
Look what I've got you.

751
