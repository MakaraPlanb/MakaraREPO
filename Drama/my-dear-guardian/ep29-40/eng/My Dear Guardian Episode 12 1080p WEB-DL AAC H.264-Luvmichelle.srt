00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,130
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,410
Old Master.

5
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,330
It's been a while, Zhuo Ran.

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,660
Old Master.

7
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,060
[How is it going with the company?]

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,820
Everything is going well.

9
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,910
But I've heard that

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,860
there has been a little trouble
with this task.

11
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,440
[It's just a bit tortuous, that's all.]

12
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,650
Tortuous?

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,270
This doesn't sound like your
usual way of doing things.

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,230
[Old Master,]

15
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,050
I have flexible ways to get things done,

16
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,550
it depends on the target.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,750
[Approaching the target's daughter,
I get it.]

18
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,030
But why mess with the army?

19
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,690
In order to remove all obstacles,

20
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,250
to hold the

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,020
daughter card in our hands.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,220
Isn't that what you sent me to China for?

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,880
So

24
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,090
you are acting in the
interest of the company,

25
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,090
is that right?

26
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,260
[Of course.]

27
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,650
[There's nothing personal here.]

28
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,410
Good.

29
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,570
Trusting you is a right decision.

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,600
[Thank you for your trust, Old Master.]

31
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,250
Zhuo Ran,

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,530
[your mother hasn't been]

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,560
[in the best of health lately.]

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,079
Can I talk to her for a minute?

35
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,370
[She's resting.]

36
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,720
The doctor said

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,610
her blood vessels that
have been bypassed before

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,800
are blocked again.

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,740
Looks like the medicine isn't working.

40
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,410
[She needs a heart transplant.]

41
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,460
You should finish the task
as soon as possible

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,840
so that you can come back early.

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,780
[Without her son around,]

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,220
[how am I supposed to arrange]

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,070
such a major operation
for her, am I right?

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,270
[I got it.]

47
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,840
Okay, that's all.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,550
I'll be waiting for the good news.

49
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,470
Old Master,

50
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,710
he is lying.

51
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,810
He didn't approach the military major

52
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,390
simply to complete the task
you assigned him.

53
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,680
Long Yi,

54
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,630
do you know the tips of flying a kite?

55
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,670
The wind direction, wind
force, running speed

56
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,720
and the timing to pull the string,

57
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,110
if you can get these things right,

58
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,560
the kite

59
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,790
will fly high and far.

60
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,910
However,

61
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,190
no matter how high or how far it flies,

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,870
as long as the string is still in my hand,

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,040
it will never fly away.

64
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,909
Old Master,

65
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,550
I'm going back to China tomorrow then.

66
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,000
Do one more thing for me before you leave.

67
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,909
Okay.

68
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,470
Get rid of Gui.

69
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,490
He approached my client
without permission.

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,370
I'm afraid he's getting greedy.

71
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,560
Got it.

72
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,350
Thanks.

73
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,040
Don't mention it.

74
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,110
If you really want to read that book,

75
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,240
I can buy you another one online.

76
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,390
Never mind, I'll go back and look again.

77
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,290
Okay.

78
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,480
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

79
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,440
Lately?

80
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,590
We met once after we came
back from the flood relief mission.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,360
What's the matter?

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,490
You want to talk to her?

83
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,990
No, I'm just asking.

84
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,650
Mr Zhang asked you

85
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,840
to find out about this for him, didn't he?

86
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,030
No.

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,070
It's very obvious that Mr Zhang

88
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,450
has a thing for Mi Gu.

89
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,130
I just didn't expect

90
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,080
you would do such

91
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,760
meddlesome thing.

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,400
Once again, you're out of
character, Captain Liang.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,580
Bye.

94
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,310
[Outpatient Department]

95
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,390
[Liang Mu Ze, come to the
flower shop now, it's an emergency.]

96
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,010
The most crucial first
step in floral arrangement

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,030
is to choose the right colour scheme,

98
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,670
avoid using too many different colours.

99
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,890
For example,

100
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,550
these three colours I use seem more...

101
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,580
Avoid using too many different colours.

102
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,670
For example,

103
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,650
choose the colours based
on the age and personality

104
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,800
of the person you are
giving the flower basket to.

105
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,900
When I chose this gladiolus,

106
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,840
we should trim its roots.

107
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,770
What brings you here?

108
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,990
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,600
Xiao Jun's little girlfriend

110
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,070
sent him a postcard,

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,320
I came here to give it to him.

112
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,270
Since I'm here, I stayed to
learn about floral arrangement,

113
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,790
cultivate my taste.

114
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,280
Meng Zhen, where's Xiao Jun?

115
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,290
He's upstairs, go and see him.

116
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,550
I'll be upstairs then.

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
Enjoy your class.

118
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,160
To make it absorb more water,

119
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,670
I cut it diagonally.

120
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,230
Xiao Jun.

121
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,360
Liang Mu Ze, you're finally here.

122
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,520
Hurry up, show me the moves

123
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,960
of the military boxing skill again.

124
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,490
Now.

125
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,150
What's the matter? Who
picked on you again?

126
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,030
No one, it's for Xuan Xuan.

127
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,240
A month ago,

128
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,230
she sent a postcard to the hospital.

129
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,170
But by the time it arrived,

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,520
I was already discharged.

131
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,440
Dr Zhang just gave it to me today.

132
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,710
She mentioned in her postcard that

133
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,000
she wanted to see me

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,080
do the military boxing
skill on her birthday.

135
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,409
but I can't remember some of the moves.

136
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,600
This is the emergency?

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,810
-This is very important to me, okay?
-Okay.

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,000
Xiao Jun!

139
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,290
What's the matter?

140
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,640
Nothing.

141
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,680
Mu Ze, would you like to stay for dinner?

142
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,870
Sure.

143
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,970
Xiao Jun,

144
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,630
stop pestering Mu Ze all the time.

145
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,400
He just came back, he's tired.

146
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,330
Give him a break.

147
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,330
It's okay. Let me hang
with him for a while.

148
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,520
Okay.

149
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,960
Have you done your homework?

150
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,010
Just a little bit left.

151
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,160
Finish your homework first.

152
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,130
Yes, Sir!

153
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,350
You need to do

154
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,730
this.

155
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,910
Yes, Sir!

156
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,320
Why are you here alone?

157
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,190
Meng Zhen went food shopping.

158
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,789
She's making you a welcome-back dinner.

159
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,950
Look.

160
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,559
That's me right there.

161
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,330
Looking good, right?

162
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,190
I looked sharp in military uniform.

163
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,590
Does he work for your hospital?

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,810
No.

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,690
Their company

166
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,240
has set up a fund in our hospital

167
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,720
called Public Interest Research Fund.

168
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,850
That day,

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,850
Xia Chu's friend said she
wanted to interview me,

170
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,010
so I took her to record some footage.

171
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,680
I didn't expect that
she actually aired them.

172
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,350
Xia Chu's friend? Mi Gu?

173
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,590
Yes.

174
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,880
Director Mi said

175
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,070
in her next show, she is planning to

176
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,790
interview urban independent bookshops.

177
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,000
I think I should recommend
Meng Zhen's shop

178
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,170
to her.

179
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,480
It'll be good publicity for her shop.

180
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,930
Who? What did you call her?

181
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,120
Meng Zhen.

182
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,640
Chen Meng Zhen.

183
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,750
Nice, right?

184
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,630
Not only is her name nice,

185
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,390
she's very beautiful too.

186
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,810
And she's elegant.

187
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,560
Not only does she know how to enjoy life,

188
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,800
she also has great business mind.

189
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,480
Look how well she manages her small shop.

190
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,170
Whoever gets to marry her

191
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,030
will be a very lucky man.

192
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,120
Dr Zhang, do you come here often?

193
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,310
No, this is my first time.

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,930
I will come here more often from now on.

195
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,110
Don't come here again.

196
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,510
Don't hit on her.

197
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm not hitting on her.

198
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,990
If you are making a mistake,
you must correct it.

199
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,190
Wait, correct what?

200
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,290
I'm an unmarried man

201
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,310
who admires a single woman.

202
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,150
There's nothing wrong with that.

203
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,760
Meng Zhen is different.

204
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,920
Besides, I know fully well what
you are into, Dr Zhang.

205
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,270
You can admire Meng Zhen,
just don't hit on her.

206
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,070
If she and Xiao Jun

207
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,720
are hurt because of you,

208
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,030
I won't let you off.

209
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,410
Let me ask you a question.

210
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
What's your relationship with her?

211
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,920
With Meng Zhen? She's the
widow of my fallen comrade.

212
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,760
I know she's the widow
of your fallen comrade.

213
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,910
So she's not your lover, is she?

214
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,120
In any case,

215
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,880
even if I'm interested
in Chen Meng Zhen...

216
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,190
Meng Zhen, you're back!

217
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,250
I forgot my phone.

218
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,650
Don't mind me.

219
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,910
You guys carry on.

220
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,550
I'll be back soon.

221
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,250
-Dinner will be ready when I get back.
-Okay.

222
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,570
-Take your time.
-Okay.

223
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,030
Don't buy too much food.

224
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,690
She's so nice.

225
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,640
Go back. Are you
really going to stay for dinner?

226
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,360
Shouldn't I leave after dinner?

227
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,070
No dinner for you, just go.

228
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,570
Honestly, I was just joking.

229
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,750
Did you fall for it?

230
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,360
Fine, I'll leave.

231
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,610
I can see that if I really stay,

232
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,990
you're going to lose your appetite.

233
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,830
All right now, just go.

234
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,620
Doesn't your hospital have a

235
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,290
toxicology and pharmacology laboratory?

236
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,110
Yes, the best in the city. Why?

237
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,150
Examine this bottle of pills for me.

238
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,960
Is this an official task
or a private favour?

239
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,640
A tough ask. Just go already.

240
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,440
Fine, leave it to me.

241
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,440
How are the patients?

242
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,210
Mr Zhang, what are you doing here?

243
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,720
Isn't today your off day?

244
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm running an errand for a friend.

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm just dropping by to

246
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,120
bring you girls

247
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,450
some food.

248
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,640
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

249
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,410
Most of the patients are doing fine,

250
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,370
except for one patient

251
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,190
who just had a heart surgery.

252
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,400
After he woke up,

253
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,610
his emotions became
unusually sensitive and fragile.

254
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,040
According to his wife's description,

255
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,030
he has become a totally different person.

256
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,850
His personality changed?

257
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,490
I looked into the heart donor.

258
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,800
He was a young man in his twenties,

259
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,870
who loved to read and write poetry.

260
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,010
When he was recuperating,

261
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,870
he even composed nearly 100 song lyrics.

262
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,500
You are saying that

263
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,310
his personality changed

264
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,680
because he has someone else's
heart in his body now?

265
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,440
I was just thinking that

266
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,540
since the heart delivers
blood to the whole body,

267
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,310
including the brain,

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,110
is it possible that

269
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,130
when some of the donor's stem cells

270
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,650
reach the brain,

271
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,520
it has affected the memory
function of the recipient,

272
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,520
and that this could
be a sign of rejection?

273
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,360
I think you are overthinking this.

274
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,550
It's actually a
psychological implication.

275
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,810
Think about it,

276
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,150
a man who has been suffered
from heart disease for over 20 years,

277
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,490
had a narrow escape from death.

278
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,400
He has received a second chance to live,

279
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,250
it's completely normal that

280
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,560
his personality has changed dramatically.

281
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,530
Besides, he also knew that his donor

282
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,570
was a young man in his twenties.

283
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,350
And unconsciously,

284
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,230
it could affect him
psychologically too, right?

285
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,160
It's hard to tell about such stuff.

286
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,450
There's one thing I've
always been curious about.

287
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,130
You see,

288
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,110
about the Chinese characters
invented by our ancestors,

289
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,330
the one word that associates
with emotions and feelings,

290
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,970
is 'heart'.

291
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,270
You see,

292
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,760
when one sees a pretty
woman, his heart flutters.

293
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,230
When one falls in love,
he finds his heart's desire.

294
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,950
When one has a breakup, his heart breaks.

295
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,340
Am I right?

296
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,960
Could there be something that

297
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,560
cannot be explained medically in this?

298
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,800
How about this?

299
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,770
Go talk to the doctors
in psychiatry department,

300
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,070
they may have better advice.

301
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,970
Okay, I'll go now.

302
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,720
Dr Zhang,

303
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,760
there's something wrong
with those pills you gave me.

304
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,470
[Hang in there, Liang Mu Ze.]

305
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,710
Go now.

306
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,310
What's wrong with them?

307
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,430
The compound of
these pills are a bit odd.

308
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,710
Where did you get it from?

309
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,350
Don't bother with where did I get it from.

310
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,880
You just need to tell me

311
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,350
if it's toxic or not.

312
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,850
Fine.

313
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,810
I'll let you know when
the results are out.

314
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,160
-Be quick.
-Okay.

315
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,130
-And don't tell anyone else.
-Okay.

316
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,320
Mr Zhang.

317
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,720
What are you doing back here?

318
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,750
Did you get that bottle of pills just now

319
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,250
from Liang Mu Ze?

320
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,240
He told you too?

321
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,910
He's such a big mouth.

322
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,940
He even asked me to keep it a secret.

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,480
Why did he want to examine it?

324
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,270
Why do you care

325
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,880
about his affairs?

326
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

327
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,930
[Outpatient Department]

328
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,730
Get in the car.

329
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,840
Did you eat the bottle
of pills I gave you?

330
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,030
I did.

331
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,520
Is there a problem?

332
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,870
No.

333
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,550
Then why did you ask Mr Zhang
to find someone to examine it for you?

334
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,050
Zhang Yi Chi told you?

335
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,360
I saw it myself.

336
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,640
What exactly are you
thinking about, Liang Mu Ze?

337
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,400
Did you think I gave you fake drug?

338
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,510
No.

339
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,190
This has nothing to do with you.

340
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,630
Who does this have to do with then?

341
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,010
-Get in the car first.
-Why exactly?

342
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,470
You have to give me an explanation.

343
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,530
Otherwise, I will think

344
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,400
my good intention has been misunderstood.

345
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,390
I'll explain it after
the results are out.

346
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,440
Fine then.

347
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,840
I'll see you when the results are out.

348
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,630
Rao Zhi, okay, I'll be right there.

349
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,080
Uncle Rao.

350
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,320
I hope I didn't disturb you.

351
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,800
You didn't.

352
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,080
What are you doing here?

353
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,390
I once made a promise to your aunt.

354
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,070
No matter how busy I am,

355
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,790
I must take one day per week

356
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,980
to spend time with her and our daughter.

357
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,240
In the past,

358
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,040
we visited this park often.

359
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,480
They would feed the pigeons

360
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,200
and I would doze off on this bench,

361
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,550
occasionally woken by their laughter,

362
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,829
watching them running around.

363
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,230
At that time,

364
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,109
I felt that no matter how hard
and exhausting my works were,

365
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,000
it was worth it.

366
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,270
Xue is coming back home.

367
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,560
She didn't listen to me.

368
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,640
She only informed me
after she booked the flight.

369
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,280
But Mu Ze,

370
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,670
I can't see her.

371
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,040
I understand.

372
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,490
Send me her flight number,

373
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,910
leave the rest to me.

374
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,790
Thanks.

375
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,310
By the way,

376
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,940
you said you suspected someone

377
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,160
had broken into your house.

378
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,410
I've gotten someone
to pull the CCTV footage

379
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,600
from the streets around.

380
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,150
There are a lot of footage.

381
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,550
It might take some time.

382
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,270
It's okay, no hurry.

383
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,310
I've installed CCTV in my home.

384
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,510
If anything happens,
I'll be the first to find out.

385
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,450
After that,

386
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,320
is there anything else unusual happen?

387
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,520
Someone switched my usual medication.

388
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Who did it?

389
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm getting the ingredients
of the medicine checked.

390
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,780
I will contact you if there is a problem.

391
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,140
Uncle Rao,

392
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,230
have you ever thought that

393
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,320
if you let Xue and Aunt

394
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,150
see you at work,

395
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,820
all misunderstandings would be cleared?

396
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,620
I've always thought that

397
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,510
the elimination of crime is not
really about anything else,

398
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,950
it's to protect their smiles.

399
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,840
But sometimes there is more evil

400
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,270
in the world than we can imagine.

401
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,430
Honestly,

402
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,190
I don't dare to risk it.

403
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,560
I'd rather keep them far away.

404
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,160
Old Master, we have a problem.

405
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,730
Several of our processing plants
outside the country have been robbed.

406
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,850
All the goods are gone.

407
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,760
Who did it?

408
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,770
Gui.

409
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,840
You sure?

410
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,810
Without doubt.

411
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,550
And I just got word that

412
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,990
he's on a boat to China.

413
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,560
Notify Zhuo Ran.

414
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,800
Yes.

415
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,160
Who is this?

416
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,630
Mi Gu.

417
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,190
What's the matter with you?
Why do you look so nervous?

418
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,520
The lift pervert is back.

419
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,510
He almost got into my place today.

420
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,550
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

421
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,560
Running into such a pervert,

422
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,970
why are you so unlucky?

423
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,280
It's all because...

424
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,360
Because of what?

425
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,880
Because I've been down on my luck.

426
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,080
Have you had dinner?

427
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm so mad that I've lost my appetite.

428
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,710
Has that annoying colleague

429
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,090
of yours set you up again?

430
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,720
It's that braised egg, Liang Mu Ze.

431
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,690
He actually took the medicine

432
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,270
I gave him to our hospital for testing.

433
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,530
What is he thinking about?

434
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,450
Did he seriously think that

435
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,010
I would take advantage of

436
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,560
my own profession to poison his drug?

437
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,110
Am I that wicked to him?

438
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,070
Xia Chu.

439
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,640
I've made up my mind.

440
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,280
This time, I'm really going to move out.

441
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,600
I don't want to share a place

442
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,840
with a man who has such
evil thoughts anymore.

443
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,850
What if he did find out something?

444
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,120
What can he find out?

445
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,930
I gave him that drug personally.

446
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,120
It's impossible that there's
something wrong with it.

447
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,910
I switched the pills.

448
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,720
What do you mean by that?

449
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,880
The day I went to pick up Er Miao,

450
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,960
I replaced the bottle of pills

451
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,520
with tranquillizers.

452
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,360
You...

453
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,000
Why?

454
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,440
Because of Zhuo Ran.

455
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,160
He was really worried about you.

456
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,750
Xia Chu isn't doing good.

457
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,880
When I had a meal
with her the other day,

458
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,280
I noticed that she was very tense

459
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,520
and stressed.

460
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,360
It can't be.

461
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,290
I just had a video chat with her,

462
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,190
she seemed fine.

463
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,370
She even told me that
she was going to join

464
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,520
the frontline of flood relief
with her medical team.

465
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,120
She has been avoiding me.

466
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,800
My return this time

467
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,960
seems to have made her feel distressed.

468
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,310
You want me to talk to her?

469
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,490
What is this?

470
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,680
Tranquillizer.

471
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,570
Xia Chu has

472
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,640
a history of sleeping pill addiction.

473
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,110
It's a bad habit

474
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,520
she picked up after I left.

475
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,550
I knew that.

476
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,830
But she hasn't had
insomnia for a long time.

477
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,590
But I'm still worried.

478
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,350
I'm afraid that she would relapse.

479
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,050
You've been keeping an eye on her?

480
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,230
Yes.

481
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,670
What do you want me to do?

482
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,760
Find a chance to go
through her backpack.

483
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,720
If you find those pills,

484
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,990
replace them with this.

485
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,490
Its dose is very small,

486
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,850
equivalent to a placebo.

487
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,870
It won't affect her much if she eats it.

488
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,150
You and I both want her to be well,

489
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,470
right?

490
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,970
I really thought that
bottle of pills were yours.

491
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,160
Are you guys close?

492
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,890
If you aren't close,

493
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,400
things like switching my pills,

494
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,030
why would he come to you?

495
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,530
Because he knows we are good friends.

496
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,200
Last time when he suddenly fell ill,

497
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,950
you were the one who
took him to the hospital.

498
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,040
We were talking about work that time.

499
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,440
Mi Gu,

500
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,550
I want the truth.

501
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,440
Xia Chu,

502
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,160
do you remember the man at the airport

503
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,810
I told you about,

504
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,480
the one I fell in love
with at first sight?

505
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,720
I used the same suitcase as him.

506
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,420
He was staying at the
hotel opposite my house.

507
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
His window was just opposite my house.

508
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,510
A French window.

509
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,830
I thought

510
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,670
I was meant to be with him.

511
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,350
Until you told me that

512
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,870
he was Zhuo Ran.

513
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,200
I didn't tell you before

514
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,680
because I thought

515
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,150
I could let go.

516
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,520
I didn't want to make things complicated.

517
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,240
Then why are you telling me now?

518
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,760
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,680
[It's me.]

520
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,030
Xia Chu just came by.

521
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,720
She learned

522
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,810
about the pills.

523
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,120
[Liang Mu Ze is now having
the drug examined.]

524
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,680
It's fine.

525
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,200
Those pills I gave you,

526
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,320
even if they're tested,

527
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,990
they won't find anything wrong in it.

528
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm not worried about the pills.

529
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm worried about our relationship.

530
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,590
[Us.]

531
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,310
[Xia Chu and I.]

532
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,840
[You and I.]

533
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,800
[Gui betrayed us, get rid of him.]

534
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,470
[Copy that.]

535
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,550
[Zhuo Ran, are you there?]

536
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,880
I really don't want to lose Xia Chu.

537
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,280
And I don't want to miss out on you.

538
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,630
Missing out on me

539
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,190
might actually be a blessing to you.

540
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,560
Whether it's good luck or bad luck,

541
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,150
I just want my own choice.

542
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,670
[I only trust my own judgment.]

543
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,830
You can reject me,

544
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,830
but don't try to change my mind.

545
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,790
[Xia Chu,]

546
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,680
[it was Zhuo Ran who
asked me to switch the pills.]

547
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,770
[Hello, everyone. I'm Zhuo Ran.]

548
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,710
[Z-h-u-o, R-a-n.]

549
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,430
Hello, Xia Chu.

550
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,160
Zhuo Ran?

551
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,360
It's me.

552
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,950
Xia Chu,

553
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm back.

554
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,200
Have you met with Mi Gu lately?

555
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,400

557

Why?

558
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,470
Because of Zhuo Ran.

559
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,960
He's really worried about you.

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,640
I've found a place.

570
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,160

575
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,500
Sorry for the trouble I've
caused you during this period.

576
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,040
Thank you.

577
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,710
If you are leaving,
take all those things you bought with you.

578
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,680
[They are too big for me to take away,
I'll give it to you.]

579
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,430
[I don't want those junk.]

580
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,170
[What junk?]

581
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,450
[I hand-picked those stuff]

582
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,880
and I paired them carefully.

583
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,590
And you are just going to leave them here?

584
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,640
Just abandon them here?

585
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,870
Have you ever thought about my...

586
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,270
Thought about what?

587
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,230
Have you even thought
about these junks' feelings?

588
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,490
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

589
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,830
Wait.

590
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,550
Let me show you something.

591
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,760
This...

592
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,880
You installed a surveillance in the house?

593
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,520
[You spied on me?]

594
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,950
[I have no interest in your privacy.]

595
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,400
I installed surveillance to
keep an eye on my house,

596
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,280
to protect you.

597
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,630
This isn't spying.

598
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,720
And it just happened to record

599
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,550
what you friend did.

600
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,760
She did it for a reason.

601
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,210
The pills she switched aren't harmful

602
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,650
to the body of the person taking them.

603
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,930
No matter her reason,

604
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,170
no matter what her purpose is,

605
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,950
I found that my pills had been switched,

606
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,460
so I took it for a test.

607
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,780
Nothing wrong with that, right?

608
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,030
No.

609
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,990
Why are you still leaving then?

610
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,510
Get out of the way!

611
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,510
Let go!

612
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,600
Let go!

613
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,290
Stop it, Xia Chu.

614
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,730
Let go! I'm not mad at you!

615
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,810
Who are you mad at then?

616
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,840
I don't want to say.

617
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,890
Then you are mad at me.

618
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,320
No, I'm not mad at you, really!

619
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,230
I just had too much going on today.

620
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,570
First, I found that you took
the drug I gave you for testing,

621
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,930
and I was furious.

622
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,720
I went to see Mi Gu.

623
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,480
I just wanted to complain to her,

624
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,910
I didn't expect that she would tell me...

625
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,880
Forget it, that's not important.

626
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,730
Everything just came together.

627
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm in over my head.

628
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,920
I don't know how to digest it.

629
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,400
I need time.

630
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,770
I need space to calm myself down.

631
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,970
I need to get my mind straight.

632
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,230
At least right now, I don't
want to see you, Liang Mu Ze.

633
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,460
No.

634
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,070
Get out of my way!

635
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,660
If you don't want to see me, it's fine.

636
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,820
I can leave,

637
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,850
but you can't.

638
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,200
Not to mention that it's night now.

639
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,360
What do you care?

640
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,960
I don't.

641
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,830
I need you.

642
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,190
My cousin is returning
home at the end of the month.

643
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,470
That's your business.

644
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,920
I've sent you her flight number.

645
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,890
Pick her up for me.

646
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,770
Why should I?

647
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,770
She will stay here too.

648

649

She will be living here,

651
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,920
but I won't.

652
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,350
Help me out, Xia Chu.

653
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,800
Please?

654
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,850
I really have to leave now.

655
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,810
Call me if you need anything,

656
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,360
but I might not be able to answer it.

657
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,000
I haven't agreed to it yet!

658
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,130
There is another thing I need to tell you.

659
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,320
I don't want to hear it.

660
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,480
Fine, tell me, hurry up.

661
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,920

she has adult ADHD.

664
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,800
She has difficulty in concentrating

665
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,050
and controlling her emotions.

666
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,690
She also has intermittent depression.

667
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,690
She can pass out at any time.

668
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,720
What?

669
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,600
So when you pick her up,

670
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,850
make sure you pay
attention to her condition.

671
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,280
Be careful and more careful, okay?

672
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,690
You know she is sick

673
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,990
and you are still asking
me to pick her up?

674
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,890
Well, you are a doctor.

675
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,370
I am a cardiothoracic surgeon!

676
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,160
That's still a doctor.

677
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,830
Besides, other than you,

678
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,520
I don't trust other people.

679
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,630
So it can only be you, Xia Chu.

680
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,150
Stop flattering me.

681
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,320

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,180
Long Yi.

739
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,890
Please.

740
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,240
You deserve to die.

741
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,580
Nice shot.

742
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,020
Looks like you really hate him.

743
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,820
Even his head is blown off.

744
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,820
I found Gui.

745
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,460
Where is he?

746
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,580
The ID of Zhou Lan, which
we have been monitoring,

747
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,790
was found to have been logged in

748
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,040
by someone else at Xiong's company.

749
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,630
After that,

750
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,870
he engaged with someone
with the ID, Buddha

751
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,510
on City of Desire.

752
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,470
They agreed to pick up the goods

753
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,590
at Wenhui Hotel

754
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,260
at 3 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

755
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,140
As for the identity of the other party,

756
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,220
it is not yet clear.

757
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,200
Keep an eye on this Xiong person.

758
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,380
Yes, Sir!

759
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,950
So this is Gui?

760
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,070
As the founder of the platform,

761
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,550
I have a way of finding out every ID

762
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,650
that appears on the platform.

763
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,220
By the way,

764
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,150
a medical forum will be held

765
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,180
at Wenhui Hotel two days later.

766
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,270
The security measures will definitely

767
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,340
be much tighter than usual.

768
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,190
Yet he chose to hand
out the goods at that place.

769
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,500
Why would he want to do that?

770
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,700
Xia Guang Yuan?

771
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,000
Since Gui wants to
replace Old Master so badly,

772
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,980
he won't let go of this opportunity.

773
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,230
Are you saying that Xia Guang Yuan

774
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,930
is his real target?

775
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,140
Gui

776
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,300
is too greedy.

777
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,140
Where are you going?

778
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,960
The hotel.

779
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,330
Gui, I've confirmed it.

780
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,160
Xia Guang Yuan will attend
the event as scheduled.

781
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,350
Good.

782
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,470
What about the deal
with Xiong the day after?

783
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,760
I'll go personally. Leave it to me, Gui.

784
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,890
Finally, I'm going to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

785
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,040
Are you home?

786
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,030
[I am.]

787
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,210
[What's the matter?]

788
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,020
Draw the curtains.

789
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,940
Open the window too.

790
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,980
Do you see me?

791
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,540
I do.

792
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,610
What are you doing up there?

793
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,860
I am watching you.

794
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,570
It's windy.

795
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,140
It's nothing.

796
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,260
Do you have any plans two days later?

797
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,930
I have work to do that day.

798
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,690
Are you going to cover the medical forum?

799
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,450
How did you know that?

800
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,650
[I always have a way of finding out about]

801
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,220
[the people and things that interest me.]

802
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,420
I would like to ask
you for a favour, Mi Gu.

803
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,890
Go on.

804
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,890
The test results are out.

805
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,540
[How is it? Is it poisonous?]

806
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,660
I can't exactly say it's poisonous,

807
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,910
but it's not completely safe either.

808
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,100
What do you mean?

809
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,300
Do you know about its characteristics?

810
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,900
[It dissolves very easily in water.]

811
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,030
That's right.

812
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,150
The inside of the pill is porous,

813
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,840
it dissolve easily in water,

814
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,390
making it easy for
the patient to swallow.

815
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,530
This is the key feature
of 3D-printed drug.

816
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,400
3D-printed drug? Are you sure?

817
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,710
[It can't be wrong.]

818
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,430
[Our department is also
working on developing this.]

819
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,390
The main ingredient of the drug

820
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,670
is a combination of several herbs

821
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,510
that have a calming and sedative effect,

822
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,740
synthesized by 3D printing technology.

823
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,480
[Most importantly,]

824
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,420
[it is overdosed with an adjuvant]

825
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,250
[called aristolochia debilis.]

826
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,560
Long-term use of this drug

827
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,140
comes with the risk of liver cancer.

828
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,850
[What are you going to do with this drug?]

829
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,860
[For an assassination mission?]

830
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,100
Put the drug away.

831
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,940
I'll come and get it from you.
