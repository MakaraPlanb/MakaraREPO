00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,560
[What are you doing?]

6
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,759
I'm in the store.

7
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,789
What's up?

8
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,280
[Nothing much.]

9
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,160
[I just got off from work]

10
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,430
[and thought I'd call you.]

11
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,440
Miss, how much for these books?

12
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,410
Hang on.

13
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,930
Are you a member?

14
00:01:59,009 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

How's business?

19
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,800
[Pretty good.]

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,570
By the way,

21
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,160
I organised a reading session
at the store

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,720
based on movies.

23
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,000
We had a pretty huge crowd.

24
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,280
[The reception was fantastic.]

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm thinking of doing

28
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,200
zodiac themed

29
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,640
hats, socks, t-shirts, and the like.

30
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,790
[What's your zodiac?]

31
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,829
[Wait, let me guess.]

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,440
It's...

33
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,710
[Meng Zhen.]

34
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,640
Let's have a meal this weekend.

35
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,950
I'll come and fetch you and Xiao Jun.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,560
What's the occasion?

37
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,030
I'd like to introduce you and Xiao Jun

38
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,150
to my parents.

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,790
I want to announce to them

40
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,270
[that you're my lover.]

41
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,350
Sure.

42
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,370
Alright.

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,710
See you this weekend.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,910
Xiao Jun.

45
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,050
Time for your medicine.

46
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,090
All done?

47
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,510
Mum.

48
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,320
Yes?

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,110
Actually, Zhang Yi Chi is alright.

50
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,600
Why are you telling me this?

51
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,910
He may not be athletic,

52
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,829
but he has a brilliant mind.

53
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,880
A woman should find a clever husband.

54
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,190
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

55
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,160
What told you that?

56
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,270
It's true.

57
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,470
That's what Xuan Xuan said.

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,550
For her sake,

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,390
I must work hard and become
a smart person.

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,470
Good. You have my support.

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,880
So

62
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,149
it doesn't have to be Daddy Liang?

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,010
Liang Mu Ze is my father.

64
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,750
Zhang Yi Chi is your husband.

65
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,649
There's no conflict.

66
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,770
What do you mean "husband?"

67
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,230
We're not even past first base.

68
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,670
What are you thinking with that
little head of yours?

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,390
About your happiness.

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,220
Okay.

71
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,950
I'll try my best to lead a happy life.

72
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,920
Alright?

73
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,890
Alright.

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,150
Good boy.

75
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,750
[Dr Xia,]

76
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,360
[I don't know if I'll]

77
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,470
[survive the infection.]

78
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,550
[But there's something]

79
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,230
[I must tell you.]

80
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,430
[The truth is,]

81
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,590
[I regretted my decision]

82
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,320
[the moment I swallowed the pesticide.]

83
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,830
[I thought I would die for sure.]

84
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,230
[Thank you for not giving up.]

85
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,870
[You've prolonged my life.]

86
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,950
[I never was a brave person.]

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,270
[But my father's passing reminded me]

88
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,950
[that I must live on.]

89
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,110
[Not just for myself,]

90
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,990
[but for the sacrifices he made
for me.]

91
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,200
[This ordeal at the age of 18
was too painful.]

92
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,070
[Luckily, I was given a second chance.]

93
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,270
[The gentle breeze.]

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,390
[The warm sunlight.]

95
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,130
[The scent of foliage.]

96
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,960
[Even the most]

97
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,390
[minute speckle of dust makes
me feel alive.]

98
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,790
[If even for one day.]

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,720
[One day is enough.]

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,480
[Dr Xia,]

101
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,030
[thank you.]

102
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,670
[Besides "thank you,"]

103
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,990
[I don't know what else to say.]

104
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,750
[Thank you.]

105
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,870
[I have no regrets.]

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,910
[Every patient steps into a hospital]

107
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,990
[with the hopes of getting better.]

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,159
[And every doctor puts on her white coat]

109
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,950
[with the belief that it is her duty
to cure them.]

110
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,150
[In the brutal struggle
between life and death,]

111
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,590
[the patient may be fragile,]

112
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,550
[but the doctor must be strong.]

113
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,430
[We fight against a common enemy,]

114
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,630
[licking our bleeding wounds]

115
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,310
[in our respective ways.]

116
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,110
[We seek victory,]

117
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,990
[but the possibility of defeat]

118
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,630
[is ever-present.]

119
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,430
[Life is full of vicissitudes.]

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,070
[In the face of the light,]

121
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,110
[what is victory?]

122
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,870
[One must keep living.]

123
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,750
[With courage]

124
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,110
[and passion.]

125
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,830
[Liu Ran passed away.]

126
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,630
Have you met Old Master?

127
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,870
Does he know about the merchandise?

128
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,550
He knew the moment it happened.

129
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,790
And he didn't suspect you?

130
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,710
If I had done it,

131
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,190
I wouldn't have had the nerve
to see him.

132
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,510
That's what he probably thought.

133
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,270
What's his next move?

134
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,450
He'll let me know

135
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,590
when the time comes.

136
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,970
At least

137
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,150
he hasn't shut me off.

138
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,640
That risky move,

139
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,830
whether for you or for me,

140
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,350
was the right move.

141
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,550
Whether it's the right move
doesn't depend on what you say

142
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,630
but what you do.

143
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,600
I get it.

144
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,960
I'll cooperate with the cops

145
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,510
from here on out.

146
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,750
As long as I can save my mother.

147
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,350
Good.

148
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,710
How's your arm?

149
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,870
Commander,

150
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,590
it's still weak.

151
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,310
Further check-up is required.

152
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,310
Is that what the doctor said?

153
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,310
I feel I should get it checked.

154
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,730
Right.

155
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,890
Go in the afternoon.

156
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,910
Yes, sir!

157
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,890
The rest of you, go back
and recalibrate.

158
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,560
Then assemble at the canteen
for dinner.

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,530
Thank you, Commander.

160
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,020
Dismissed.

161
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,740
Tian Yong!

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,490
Tian Yong!

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,300
Tian Yong!

164
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,580
I knew it,

165
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,770
you're back!

166
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,140
How did you know Tian Yong
was back?

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,570
Tarot cards.

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,950
You can tell the future
with tarot cards?

169
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,990
Of course.

170
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,750
Look.

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,070
I have four cards here.

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,850
Each represents a question.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,610
Where is Tian Yong?

174
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,930
What is Tian Yong doing?

175
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,890
When is Tian Yong coming back?

176
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,470
That's only three questions.

177
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,430
What's the last one?

178
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,710
Three and four are pretty
much the same.

179
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,540
How are they the same?

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,060
They're both single digits.

181
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,270
Okay.

182
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,830
Fine.

183
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,030
Let me ask you,

184
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,530
how did you know Tian Yong was
coming back today?

185
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,930
Well,

186
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,030
I held my breath,

187
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,070
closed my eyes,

188
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,260
and put my hands together.

189
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,710
Focusing my gaze on the card,

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,530
I asked my question.

191
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,030
The thoughts in my mind

192
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,170
coalesce in a confusion of magnetic waves.

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,660
Then suddenly,

194
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,230
I heard your wife

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,180
coming downstairs with a soldier's wife.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,020
They said you were coming
back today.

197
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,060
After all that hocus pocus,

198
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,180
turns out you got it from someone else?

199
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,510
What does it have to do with tarot cards?

200
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,650
Nothing.

201
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,460
Then why did you bring out
the tarot cards?

202
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,630
Foreshadowing.

203
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,110
It's a performance device
in ancient oral literature.

204
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,870
The tarot cards are meant to
arouse the audience's interest

205
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,260
and serve as a prelude to
the main message.

206
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,410
You scared me.

207
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,420
Commander.

208
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,900
Quit talking nonsense.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,260
What's it to you?

210
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,710
Easy there.

211
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,900
Are you injured?

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,900
Keep an eye on her.

213
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,870
Yes.

214
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,260
How did my brother get injured?

215
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,580
What do you think of my
foreshadowing?

216
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,180
Don't hit your brother so hard next time.

217
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,500
Let's go.

218
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,930
Commander, I'll send her home
right now.

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,390
Is it just me

220
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,020
or am I getting old?

221
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,270
I couldn't understand a word

222
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,900
your cousin was saying.

223
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,490
Oh no. I don't get her, either.

224
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,010
Neither does the rest of my family.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,400
Really?

226
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,530
You said Tian Yong

227
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,090
is not compatible with your cousin.

228
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,460
Indeed,

229
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,740
Tang Yong is an ancient literature buff.

230
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,890
If the two of them get together,

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,010
they'd have trouble communicating.

232
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,090
They're not right for each other.

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,940
Not necessarily, Commander.

234
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,460
Of all the ways youngsters
communicate today,

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,690
language is the least significant.

236
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,230
Really?

237
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,860
Isn't that a good thing?

238
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,260
Yeah.

239
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,300
I still don't get it.

240
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,090
Why are you still here?

241
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,780
To keep you company.

242
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,010
Don't you find the camp boring?

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,180
It is boring.

244
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,060
So why don't you go?

245
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,500
Because I want to keep
you company.

246
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,890
This mission

247
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,380
is very dangerous, isn't it?

248
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,210
No.

249
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,460
You're lying.

250
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,770
My brother hasn't had
an injury in ages.

251
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,320
Did you guys

252
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,370
kill?

253
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,330
What did it feel like?

254
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,160
"A hundred battles have worn
my armour down."

255
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,040
"Yet I won't return until
the enemy is defeated."

256
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,610
Wang Chang Ling's

257
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,450
"Conquering the Distant City,"

258
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,130
poem four of seven?

259
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,850
That's right.

260
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,940
You know something?

261
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,450
While you were gone,

262
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,730
I've been poring over that book
you gave me.

263
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,060
For a girl of 21,

264
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,970
memorising 300 Tang poems

265
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,650
is a great feat.

266
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,530
You've worked hard.

267
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,850
Then there's my AMBD.

268
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,100
What's that?

269
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,280
You know ADHD?

270
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,670
Yes.

271
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,930
If left untreated

272
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,880
until adolescence,

273
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,730
it'll become what's known as

274
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,520
autoimmune mucocutaneous
blistering disease.

275
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,330
You mean

276
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,970
something's wrong with your brain?

277
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,440
Can't you tell?

278
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,400
I think you're very smart.

279
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,480
I think so, too.

280
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,760
But

281
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,380
I can't concentrate

282
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,130
for more than five minutes.

283
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm always getting lost.

284
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,740
I'd talk to you one second

285
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,680
and fall asleep the next.

286
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,530
But despite the difficulties,

287
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,250
I still memorised the poems for you.

288
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,960
Do you know

289
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,290
what this means?

290
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,560
Wait here.

291
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,280
Tian Yong!

292
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,330
Where are you going?

293
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,460
For me?

294
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,300
Yes.

295
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,970
Why an hourglass?

296
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,380
Since you can only concentrate

297
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,720
for five minutes at a time,

298
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,330
it means

299
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,680
you should raise your

300
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,680
memorising efficiency
within a five-minute duration.

301
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,200
The hourglass empties in five minutes.

302
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,490
You can use it to time yourself.

303
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,280
Set yourself little targets.

304
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,490
Such as...

305
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,930
I said those things to you

306
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,730
not because I wanted to discuss
how to study poetry.

307
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,690
Yes.

308
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,720
That's right. Not just poetry.

309
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,060
It can also help you

310
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,100
keep track

311
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,440
of your life.

312
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,960
And make you more aware.

313
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,450
What's the matter?

314
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,450
I'm thinking.

315
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,560
About what?

316
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,130
Whether you'll kiss me in the
next five minutes.

317
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,170
I won't.

318
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,810
I swear on my code of conduct,

319
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,010
not just in the camp,

320
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,540
but even the remote wilderness,

321
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,720
that I will not.

322
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,730
You can trust me 100 percent.

323
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,900
Really,

324
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,200
it's a matter of principles.

325
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,690
Then do you...

326
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,410
Do you

327
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,490
want

328
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,480
to taste

329
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,850
my lipstick?

330
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,330
It contains lead.

331
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,160
I'll get poisoned.

332
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,460
Tian Yong!

333
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,430
Here!

334
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,180
Does your phone have any romantic songs?

335
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,330
Play them.

336
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,380
Now?

337
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,350
Yes.

338
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,730
Are you sure?

339
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,930
You'd better hurry.

340
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,600
Look into my eyes.

341
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,160
What do you see

342
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,920
in my eyes?

343
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,290
Mum...

344
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,890
Mum...

345
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,640
Reporting in!

346
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,540
Captain,

347
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,660
Captain Rao Zhi of the
City Security Bureau

348
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,970
wants you to have this.

349
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,980
Thanks.

350
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,000
[Liu Ran passed away.]

351
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,090
Friend, are you done crying?

352
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,650
Sorry.

353
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,800
Thanks.

354
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,170
I can't stand that song.

355
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,570
So why did you play it?

356
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,090
It's the only song in my phone.

357
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,170
You were asking for it, then.

358
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm an orphan.

359
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,690
I grew up in a children's home.

360
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,640
I was adopted once.

361
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,890
But because I wouldn't speak,

362
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,610
I was sent back.

363
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,080
After that,

364
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,520
I joined the army at 18.

365
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,090
At first, I just wanted to
make a living.

366
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,490
But after I came here,

367
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,330
I never wanted to leave.

368
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,800
What about your parents?

369
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,600
I have no idea.

370
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,650
This hourglass

371
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,460
and the "300 Tang Poems"

372
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,720
I gave you

373
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,290
are the only pieces of memory
I have left of them.

374
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,480
Do you hate them?

375
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,530
I do.

376
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,970
How could I not?

377
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,760
A part of me hates them,

378
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,170
but a part of me wishes to see them

379
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,330
in my dreams.

380
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,730
Although in my dreams,

381
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,120
I never get to see their faces clearly,

382
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,050
they're always leaving me

383
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,450
or passing away.

384
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,610
Every time, it ends with me

385
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,250
waking up in tears.

386
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,160
If only I can see them in a dream one day,

387
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,130
I'd be

388
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,560
content.

389
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,050
Actually, I'm the same as you.

390
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,340
You?

391
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,930
Although I'm not an orphan,

392
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,570
nor did I grow up
in a children's home,

393
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,840
I seldom get to see my parents.

394
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,410
They're always busy.

395
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,680
Or

396
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,730
they just don't want to see me.

397
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,960
Why wouldn't they?

398
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,920
Do you know why I adopted the parrot?

399
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,970
I was sexually assaulted.

400
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,250
I was 13.

401
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,650
I went to a doctor, did the examinations.

402
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,410
Then my mum brought me to the US.

403
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,650
Perhaps in my parent's eyes

404
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,100
I'm like a tumour,

405
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,480
constantly reminding them of their
failure as parents.

406
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,650
I destroyed their marriage.

407
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,370
I made them feel insecure
and frustrated.

408
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,770
That's why I like to wear quirky outfits

409
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,850
and put on quirky makeups.

410
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,730
I want them to hate me.

411
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,690
To hate me so much
that they can't ignore me.

412
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,770
My brother says I'm dumb.

413
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,120
What do you think?

414
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,450
It seems I am kind of dumb.

415
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,800
So dumb that I can only
make friends with a parrot.

416
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,200
I talk to it every day.

417
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,370
When I cuss at someone,
it'd cuss at that person, too.

418
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,100
It never questions me,

419
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,530
nor does it know right from wrong.

420
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,610
It's always on my side.

421
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,130
Ever since I had it,

422
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,850
I realised

423
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,930
I can face this miserable world

424
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,280
with a smile.

425
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,330
Yes, it's dumb.

426
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,360
But it's also useful.

427
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,640
Isn't that right?

428
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,640
Xiao Xue.

429
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,620
I wanted

430
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,900
to tell you this

431
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,570
after our kiss.

432
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,690
But then you played that song

433
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,520
and told a story that's sadder
than mine.

434
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,490
I couldn't take it.

435
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Do you know

436
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,400
why I'm giving you the parrot?

437
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,360
Because your kindness

438
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,920
will make it forget its anger

439
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,320
and become a better version of itself.

440
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,040
Tian Yong.

441
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,090
All those poems must've messed
with your head.

442
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,010
You don't understand anything.

443
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,370
I do.

444
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,620
[Not only will kidnapping Xia Chu]

445
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,180
[teach Liang Mu Ze a lesson,]

446
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,170
it'll also force Xia Guang Yuan
to cooperate.

447
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,800
[Given the groundwork you've laid
with the girl and her father,]

448
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,680
[this should be a cinch.]

449
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,800
Xia Chu, it's me.

450
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,580
What's up?

451
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,900
[Let's meet up.]

452
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,280
Sorry.

453
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,550
[At the Japanese restaurant
opposite your hospital.]

454
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,310
I booked a private room.

455
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,820
See you there.

456
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,340
Zhuo Ran...

457
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,760
[Rao]

458
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,630
[Did you ask Xia Chu out?]

459
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,090
Yes.

460
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,510
What do you want?

461
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,230
Don't you know how I feel about Xia Chu?

462
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,380
I'll send someone to protect her.

463
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,540
Don't try anything funny.

464
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,620
Li Lei, come here for second.

465
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,850
Dr Zhang.

466
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,880
You're here.

467
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,260
Where is Xia Chu?

468
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,780
She's on leave today.

469
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,030
What's the hurry?

470
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,900
Can you give me a ride
after work?

471
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,460
I'd like to visit Xiao Jun.

472
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,310
You want me to give you a ride?

473
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,950
It's a little out of the way.

474
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,830
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Meng Zhen

475
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,140
and Xiao Jun tonight.

476
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,460
I'm going to introduce them
to my parents.

477
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,080
Your parents...

478
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,350
There's no need to worry.

479
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,380
I know what you're thinking.

480
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,040
Relax.

481
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,470
I know what kind of women

482
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,030
I should get involved with

483
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,060
and what kind of women
I shouldn't.

484
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,160
Since I got involved with Meng Zhen,

485
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,360
I'll go all the way.

486
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,850
Trust me.

487
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,970
Take good care of them.

488
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,600
Zhuo Ran.

489
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,590
Zhuo Ran.

490
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,320
Zhuo Ran.

491
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,920
What do you see?

492
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,140
Zhuo Ran.

493
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,500
That's right.

494
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,000
It's our past.

495
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,610
Let go of me, Zhuo Ran.

496
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,200
And our future.

497
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,160
Let go.

498
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,000
How have you been?

499
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,920
Pretty good.

500
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,140
And you?

501
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,620
I'm

502
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,760
doing okay myself.

503
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,300
Everything

504
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,280
is coming together as I planned.

505
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,330
My predicament will soon be over.

506
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,240
When it's finally over,

507
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,610
will you

508
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,680
give me another chance?

509
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,040
Did you ask me out

510
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,610
just to give me

511
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,200
this ridiculous speech?

512
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,600
Did you?

513
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,280
I want to make up

514
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,880
for what the old Zhuo Ran did.

515
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,860
When he saw the environment
you grew up in,

516
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,560
he shrank.

517
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,200
He couldn't confront the pain
of loss

518
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,600
and chose to run away.

519
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,560
He was a fool.

520
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,410
So I came back.

521
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,240
I want to show him

522
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,200
that I can do

523
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,040
what he couldn't.

524
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,970
I can fit in with your family.

525
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,520
I can give you the life you want.

526
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,740
Xia Chu.

527
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,600
The past eight years have not
been in vain.

528
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,920
Finally, I can do this.

529
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,080
But I can't.

530
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,480
You planted the listening device

531
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,160
in Liang Mu Ze's house, didn't you?

532
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,320
Mi Gu never told you

533
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,160
that I stayed in Liang Mu Ze's house.

534
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,330
You lied to me.

535
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,340
Yes.

536
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,280
I stalked you.

537
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,400
And not just once.

538
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,800
I know I'm being ridiculous

539
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,860
but I can't help myself

540
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,080
but to know everything about you.

541
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,720
To make up for the eight years
that we've lost.

542
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,010
Xia Chu.

543
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,560
The stalking,

544
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,290
the listening device,

545
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,929
it was all me.

546
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,960
But I won't apologise.

547
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,350
[Braised Egg]

548
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,159
What are you doing?

549
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,480
Liang Mu Ze.

550
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,840
Where are you?

551
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,530
In the Japanese restaurant
opposite the hospital.

552
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,489
I'm just kidding.

553
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,159
It's not funny at all.

554
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,280
Are you worried whether he's mad?

555
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,320
Don't bring him into this.

556
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,250
Zhuo Ran, you disrespected me.

557
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,490
I did?

558
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,020
Yeah, who do you think you are?

559
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,840
Who let you answer my call?

560
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,800
How do you think Liang Mu Ze
will react?

561
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,770
I don't want to think about it.

562
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,410
How he reacts has nothing
to do with you.

563
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,120
But you do.

564
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,930
If he could hang up on you

565
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,730
at the sound of my voice,

566
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,730
is he any different

567
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,860
from the Zhuo Ran who
abandoned you eight years ago?

568
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,210
Do you want to make the
same mistake again?

569
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,320
Enough!

570
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,410
Let me send you home.

571
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,650
No, I'll walk.

572
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,800
Calm down.

573
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,650
I'm very calm right now.

574
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,660
It's you who's too presumptuous.

575
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,640
Look,

576
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
when you left,

577
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,570
I was a little fazed

578
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,970
by the loss

579
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,330
of an old friend at first

580
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,460
and went through a rough patch.

581
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,000
But later, I enrolled
in the Military Medical University

582
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,770
and made many new friends.

583
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Studying, dating,

584
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,810
extracurriculars,

585
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,200
I did it all.

586
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,890
I got by just fine.

587
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,450
I wasn't as pathetic as you thought.

588
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,530
I'm not some lovesick damsel

589
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,780
waiting for your rescue.

590
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,340
I won't give up

591
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,040
just because my first relationship failed.

592
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,930
Not in the past,

593
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,740
not now,

594
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,960
not ever.

595
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,680
As for Liang Mu Ze,

596
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,010
I love him.

597
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,010
If he takes your "hi"

598
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,050
the wrong way,

599
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,210
and things don't work out,

600
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,280
it doesn't mean you and I
will go back to the way we were.

601
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,240
The past is in the past.

602
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,130
I've moved on from my
18-year-old life.

603
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,970
Even if it wasn't perfect,

604
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,560
I don't want to live it again.

605
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,020
I live for the present

606
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,280
and the future.

607
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,800
My relationships

608
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,220
should be decided by me,

609
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,970
not you.

610
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,200
The reason I came here

611
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,770
is to make myself clear

612
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,560
to you once and for all.

613
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,480
Do you understand?

614
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,200
Liang... Liang Mu Ze.

615
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,720
What are you doing here?

616
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm here to fetch you.

617
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,360
Let's go.

618
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,720
But we haven't gotten
to the eel rice yet.

619
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,250
It's your favourite, Xia Chu.

620
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,920
I no longer like eel rice.

621
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,040
Please let go of me.

622
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,440
In that case,

623
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,320
we'll go back to our normal lives.

624
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,000
When did you come back?

625
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,240
Did you see my message?

626
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,800
Can you slow down, Liang Mu Ze?

627
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,760
Liang Mu Ze.

628
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,840
I know you're mad at me.

629
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,840
You didn't like me meeting up
with Zhuo Ran, did you?

630
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,620
Don't deny it.

631
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,280
I know that's what you're thinking.

632
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,080
You're hurting my hand.

633
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,920
I met up with him

634
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,720
not because I couldn't
get over him

635
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,570
but because I did.

636
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,970
I wanted to set the record straight

637
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,440
so he would let go, too.

638
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,800
In any case,

639
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,200
I loved him before.

640
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,160
Since we came together on good terms,

641
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,920
we should part ways on good terms.

642
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,480
Because we may never
see each other again.

643
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,840
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

644
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,010
Do you understand, Liang Mu Ze?

645
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,260
Why don't we go to this restaurant?

646
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,940
Sure.

647
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,960
Why is she on the ground?

648
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,040
Are they having a fight?

649
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,240
Don't mind them.

650
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,600
Get up.

651
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,560
I can't walk. I don't want to walk.

652
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,080
Liu Ran passed away, do you know that?

653
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,280
The lung transplant was a success,

654
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,000
but the infection got to her.

655
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,760
All the doctors

656
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,050
stood by and watched her
drift into sleep.

657
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,250
There was nothing they could do.

658
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,760
Nothing.

659
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,920
It was totally hopeless.

660
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,930
Don't cry.

661
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Have you any idea

662
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,600
what I've been through
the last few days?

663
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,420
I was so sleepy

664
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,620
but I couldn't sleep.

665
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,960
I kept seeing her in my dreams.

666
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,730
She even thanked me,

667
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,170
as if I deserved it.

668
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,690
I couldn't help her.

669
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,280
I couldn't do a thing.

670
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,380
Being a doctor is so hard.

671
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,260
Everything is one big confusion.

672
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,690
It's so tiresome.

673
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,560
There, there.

674
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,730
Come.

675
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,920
Get up.

676
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,100
Why?

677
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,210
You said you couldn't walk.

678
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,560
I'll carry you on my back.

679
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,680
Are you sure?

680
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,840
Come on.

681
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,960
Is something wrong?

682
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,200
Nothing. You're a little heavy,
that's all.

683
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,240
Just kidding. Hold tight.

684
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,890
Hold tight.

685
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,250
You have a stubble.

686
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,760
It's time to shave.

687
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,400
I'll do it when I get back.

688
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,600
Your ears are red.

689
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,800
They're freezing.

690
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,840
Let me blow on them.

691
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,120
That's enough.

692
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,690
I see so many documentaries

693
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,940
of this calibre every year.

694
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,650
They're all

695
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,900
too dramatic.

696
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,240
There's no subtlety.

697
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,240
What do you think?

698
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,880
[Zhuo Ran]

699
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,000
Perhaps the closer I am
to their lives,

700
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,000
the hardest it is for me to take
an objective view.

701
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,730
Amateur.

702
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,040
What did you say?

703
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,440
She said you're very honest.

704
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,800
That's right.

705
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,400
[Zhuo Ran]

706
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,120
Excuse me, I have to
take a call.

707
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,650
Zhuo Ran, listen here.

708
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,980
I'm having a gathering with my friends.

709
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,170
I have my own life and career.

710
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,770
I can't be at your beck and call

711
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,700
24-7.

712
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,890
I'm not some maid

713
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,450
that you can order around at will.

714
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,480
I detest this kind of relationship.

715
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,360
Say something.

716
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,360
[Every saint has a past.]

717
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,600
[Every sinner has a future.]

718
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,570
[Isn't that right,]

719
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,540
[Mi Gu?]

720
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,960
What's with you?

721
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,500
Why are you telling me this?

722
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,640
[I'm in the hotel.]

723
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,700
[Are you coming?]

724
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,040
No.

725
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,490
My party has just started.

726
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,720
[I'll be waiting for you.]

727
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,320
Had your phone call?

728
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,640
Yes.

729
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,040
By the way, we just broke out
a bottle of wine.

730
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,280
It's pretty good.

731
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,240
Shall we go inside and taste it?

732
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,560
Come on.

733
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,090
No, thanks.

734
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,170
You guys go ahead.

735
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,650
You came.

736
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,960
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

737
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,520
I don't feel like it.

738
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,320
What's wrong?

739
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,880
Why are you drinking so heavily?

740
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,540
I thought I had to wait all night for you.

741
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,780
Was the party fun?

742
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,860
Sure.

743
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,940
A group of beautiful, intelligent
men and women,

744
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,820
sipping their
ten-thousand-dollar-a-bottle wine,

745
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,220
musing over

746
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,740
topics of social justice

747
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,620
and equality.

748
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,380
They pretend to stand up
for the underprivileged.

749
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,020
But I assure you,

750
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,780
those people

751
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,070
haven't the slightest clue

752
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,100
what life is really like.

753
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,030
Not once have they

754
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,820
considered stepping out of

755
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,620
the extravagant,

756
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,460
highly intellectual,

757
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,830
cultural elitist,

758
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,620
and socially superior little bubble.

759
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,420
I watched them

760
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,820
descend into their own
self-indulgent world,

761
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,340
their faces immaculate and pompous.

762
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,180
Do you think it was fun?
