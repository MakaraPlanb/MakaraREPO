[Episode 14]

4
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,200
Zhuo Ran.

5
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,490
Did you notice that

6
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,759
you're especially unlucky
when you're with me?

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,140
You either injure yourself or fall sick.

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,120
Perhaps we're not meant to be together.

9
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,680
How about this?

10
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,200
I'll stay away from you.

11
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,680
I know I'm quite annoying at times.

12
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,430
Mi Gu.

13
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,360
It's not your fault.

14
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,200
I don't mind.

15
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,240
Did I interrupt you?

16
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,600
We're coming in.

17
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,870
Hello, Mr Zhuo and Ms Mi.

18
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,100
With regard to the incident

19
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,730
outside the banquet hall at the hotel,

20
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,040
it's indeed tricky and troublesome.

21
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,570
Now, we need cooperation
from both of you

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,800
to give a statement.

23
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,970
He's still bleeding.

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,930
Can we do it later?

25
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,920
No.

26
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,800
Please cooperate with us.
It won't be long.

27
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,600
-You...
-Mi Gu.

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,530
It's okay.

29
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,570
Do we do it together or...

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,680
Do it separately.

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,000
Come with me.

32
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,780
He's a lunatic.

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,490
He's been pestering me a long time
insisting to date me.

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,650
Have you ever given him any promises?

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,790
Of course not.

36
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,200
I don't know.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,160
Don't know?

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,020
Ms Mi Gu and I

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,720
met each other not long ago.

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,329
I'm not quite familiar

41
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,880
with her romantic experience.

42
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,000
So,

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,630
both of you are not close with each other?

44
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,160
Yes, you may say so.

45
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,240
All thanks to Zhuo Ran.

46
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,130
That's why I escaped.

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,970
Why did he

48
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,800
ask for your help to obtain
the licence of the forum?

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,210
He's a businessman.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,910
Isn't it normal for him
to expand his connection?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,420
I couldn't help but wonder

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,900
why you chose to attend

53
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,860
a medicine related forum?

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,310
My company

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,510
is mainly about 3D printing.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,910
Lately, we're doing a collaboration

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,500
with the hospital.

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,230
Therefore, I'm interested
to get an understanding

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,130
of the related industry information.

60
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,270
You're indeed far-sighted

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,620
and in the full vigour of life.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,370
Do you know this person?

63
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,810
No.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,110
No.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,410
Does Zhuo Ran know him?

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,900
How do I know?

67
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,460
Why do you keep asking about Zhuo Ran?

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,100
He's not the person who assaulted me.

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,820
We need to get a better understanding
of every detail at the scene.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,990
Take off your shirt.

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,750
We received complaints
from the public

72
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,340
that you

73
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,070
illegally possessed a gun.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,580
We need to confirm on that.

75
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,650
Can you give me a hand?

76
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,070
Okay, no problem.

77
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,510
What a nice material.

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,140
Please raise your hands.

79
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,690
It seems that it was just a mischief.

80
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,510
Mr Zhuo, I'm so sorry.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,220
People who simply take up police resources

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,580
should be taught a lesson.

83
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,740
That's all for today.

84
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,740
You're working for the people.

85
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,470
I can understand that.

86
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,810
All right, see you again.

87
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,810
Please sign the document
if everything is okay.

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,540
It's not working.

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,620
Do you have any other pen?

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
I have a pen.

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,650
Do you?

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,820
It's done.

93
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,570
Use it.

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,540
Thank you for your cooperation.

95
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,270
What do you keep in your bag?

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,410
It looks quite heavy.

97
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,450
It's camera.
I need it for working purposes.

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,840
Let's go.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,460
Mi Gu.

100
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,300
It's not your fault.

101
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,270
I heard from my dad
that someone assaulted you.

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,460
Are you okay?

103
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,820
Are you injured?

104
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm fine.

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,430
Zhuo Ran injured himself though.

106
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,890
Is it serious?

107
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,750
According to the doctor,

108
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,580
his nerves and bones are intact.

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,730
I think he should be fine.

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,980
Where is he?

111
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,300
He's undergoing debridement.

112
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,050
Well...

113
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,980
I went to the hotel
for film shooting on location.

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,060
He was there to attend a medical forum.

115
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,290
We...

116
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,150
We were there for work

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,370
and we ran into each other by chance.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,460
Something unexpected occurred.

119
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,190
As he's bleeding profusely,

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,090
-I sent him to the hospital.
-Actually...

121
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,659
Don't mind it.

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,780
Take a seat.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,980
I mean,

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,220
to Zhuo Ran, I...

125
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,580
Yes.

126
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,940
When I saw him,

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,950
I still felt something

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,610
which couldn't be explained.

129
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,740
However, I think

130
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,570
it's not because of him per se

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,850
but it's because of the memories.

132
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,160
Everything in the past happened for real

133
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,040
and it won't happen again in the future.

134
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,660
Hence, I won't forget it.

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,740
Sometimes, we couldn't help reminiscing

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,460
those guys in white shirts

137
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,740
who played basketball on the court.

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,630
However, it's just nostalgia.

139
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,179
Life goes on no matter what.

140
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,580
The story between Zhuo Ran
and I has ended.

141
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,660
As for you,

142
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,850
if he really makes you happy,

143
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,920
then you should go ahead.

144
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,380
I thought

145
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,980
you wouldn't talk to me anymore.

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,060
Just because of a former lover?

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,690
Am I so petty?

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,140
To me,

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,580
a serious friendship

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,580
is more memorable than
romantic relationship.

151
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,100
I love you, Mi Gu.

152
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,770
Any man

153
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,430
can never take your place in my heart.

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,180
I've to get back to work.

155
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,540
Call me if anything.

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,950
Why did you bring me to the hospital?

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,990
Didn't I tell you to send me home?

158
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,220
We're here to apologise.

159
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,290
What?

160
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,830
Hello.

161
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,270
Hello.

162
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,380
Is Xia Chu here?

163
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,510
I think she went to the emergency ward.

164
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,710
You may give her a call.

165
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,970
All right, thank you.

166
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,420
-I don't want to go there.
-Let's go.

167
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,220
Thank you for your help at the hotel.

168
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,060
Have you taken the medicine?

169
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,110
What?

170
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,170
-What are you doing?
-It's tranquillizer.

171
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,340
I told Mi Gu to replace the tranquillizer.

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,780
Have you taken it?

173
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,170
The tranquillizer is not for myself.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,020
I gave it to Liang Mu Ze.

175
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,580
Tell him to throw it away.

176
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,660
What's wrong?

177
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,510
My company had a collaboration
with a medicine manufacturer before.

178
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,470
We attempted to use 3D printing technology

179
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,410
to produce hypnotic
which is made of Chinese medicine.

180
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,410
However, the first batch

181
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,220
contains excessive birthwort.

182
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,310
Long term consumption

183
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,300
may lead to kidney failure
or worse, liver cancer.

184
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,560
Hence, we decided to destroy the products.

185
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,070
My assistant took it by mistake.

186
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,660
I didn't know that

187
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,120
and I gave it to Mi Gu.

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,350
Normally, when a man and a woman
are together

189
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,030
and they did not pick up the phone call
at first instance,

190
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,470
it's either they're busy
or they're having fun.

191
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,780
Don't ask for embarrassment.

192
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,410
Xia Chu.

193
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,910
It was an accident.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,520
Luckily nothing happened to you.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,220
I'm fine

196
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,800
but my friend almost took

197
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,060
substandard medicine.

198
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,970
Do you know

199
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,330
how much of trouble you caused me?

200
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,740
If his health is affected

201
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,250
because of my negligence,

202
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,440
I won't be able to forgive myself.

203
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,130
Also,

204
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,340
before you make any decision

205
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,960
that has something to do with me,

206
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,050
will you please

207
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,420
inform me about it?

208
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,690
Don't simply do whatever you want.

209
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,060
Don't get Mi Gu
involved in your so-called accidents.

210
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,700
Please don't hurt me over and over again

211
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,440
in the name of protecting me.

212
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,330
She looks like she's having fun.

214
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,200
Where did you go?

215
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,600
Take a guess.

216
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,040
Where did you find her?

217
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,680
Well...

218
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,960
Sorry to have troubled you
to pick her up at the airport.

219
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,040
Mu Ze.

220
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm tired.

221
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,220
She...

222
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,180
What's wrong?

223
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,260
She fell asleep due to her illness.

224
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,600
Let's go to your office.

225
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,560
Let's go.

226
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,120
Zhuo Ran.

227
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,440
You're still here.

228
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,800
I went to pick up the medicine.

229
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,330
The doctor prescribed medicine

230
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,810
for tetanus and antibiotics.

231
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,790
Thank you.

232
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,770
Let's go to the injection room.

233
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,120
Okay.

234
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,740
Do you plan to leave her here?

235
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,650
Yes, if I send her home,

236
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,720
she'll run away once she's awake.

237
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,600
Even if you leave her here,

238
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,800
I can't be watching her all the time.

239
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,200
Are you busy?

240
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,440
Of course.

241
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
At night, if any emergency

242
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,380
happens to any of the patients,

243
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,130
I have to handle it at the first instance.

244
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,610
Why were you

245
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,210
hugging a man in the lift?

246
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,420
The test result of the medicine is out.

247
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,400
I know.

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,210
It's Chinese medicine
produced by 3D printing technology.

249
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,570
Zhang Yi Chi told you that?

250
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,250
No, it's Zhuo Ran.

251
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,200
Zhuo Ran told you about it?

252
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,330
He told his assistant to get the medicine.

253
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
His assistant got confused.

254
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,170
-So, he's the one who gave it to Mi Gu?
-Yes.

255
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,010
However, he didn't know that
his assistant made a mistake.

256
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,240
Was that his explanation?

257
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,900
I believe that it's the truth.

258
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,980
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have had come to to see me

259
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,240
at the first instance.

260
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,840
Did he know that
I was testing the medicine?

261
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,280
I didn't tell him anything.

262
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,480
How about Mi Gu?

263
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm not sure of that.

264
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,080
He's...

265
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,330
trying to get us before we get him.

266
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,930
It's just an accident.

267
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,800
You don't have to come down
on him too hard.

268
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,700
Accident?

269
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,970
Of course it's an accident.

270
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,770
Otherwise,

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,050
why would Zhuo Ran harm me?

272
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,970
The medicine was for me.

273
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,360
He didn't know that.

274
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,970
How did he know
that you have the medicine?

275
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,690
How did he know?

276
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,980
For a very long time

277
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,610
after he left,

278
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,580
I could only fall asleep

279
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,890
with the help of drugs.

280
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,480
When I had insomnia,

281
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,880
I sent many emails to him.

282
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,410
In some emails, I scolded him.

283
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,200
In some, I begged of him.

284
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,400
He didn't reply any of the emails.

285
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,970
He didn't reply

286
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,410
but I think he knew

287
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,170
what was going on with me.

288
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,610
Therefore, when he came back,

289
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,770
he worried that I got agitated.

290
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,730
He told Mi Gu to keep a close watch on me

291
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,790
just in case.

292
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,200
As a result,

293
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,320
he accidentally discovered the medicine.

294
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,060
Trust me, Liang Mu Ze.

295
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,560
Zhuo Ran wouldn't harm me.

296
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,200
There's no reason for him
to make things personal against you too.

297
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,970
This is just

298
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,720
an odd coincidence.

299
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,370
In short,

300
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,490
I'm sorry for this incident.

301
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,970
If you get mad at me or hate me for that,

302
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,160
I can totally understand it.

303
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,530
However, I can't doubt my friend.

304
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,680
This is my principle
when it comes to dealing with people.

305
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,280
Are both of you just friends?

306
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,160
Liang Mu Ze, what do you mean?

307
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,770
There's an eight year gap.

308
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,119
Are you sure you still know him well?

309
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,840
Also, how old are you?

310
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,240
Running away from home

311
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,260
was a trick I used when I was young.

312
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,330
You can't be using the same trick
all the time.

313
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,720
It'll become ineffective.

314
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,120
Think like an adult.

315
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,410
You may fight me or mess around

316
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,520
but you're not allowed
to run away from home.

317
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,100
Got it?

318
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,460
You just want me to stay home

319
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,970
and take care of your cousin.

320
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,970
That's right.

321
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,280
[Zhuo Ran didn't have a gun with him.]

322
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,130
[The meeting concluded successfully.]

323
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,150
[I'm back to the camp.]

324
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,040
Zhuo Ran switched my medicine.

325
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,840
It's not a coincidence for sure.

326
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,160
Something must be wrong with him.

327
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,960
Keep a close watch on him.

328
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,100
What's wrong?

329
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,020
Professor Xia is receiving
physiotherapy treatment. It's ending soon.

330
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,780
Tang Lin wants us to wait for him.

331
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,140
Zhuo Ran.

332
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,080
Officer Liang.

333
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,650
Why did you attend the medical forum?

334
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,560
What's wrong?

335
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,530
Are you going to question me again

336
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,720
like those police officers?

337
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,660
At that moment, you behaved

338
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,400
as if you're fully prepared.

339
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,360
It's all about upbringing.

340
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,080
I must protect a lady

341
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,880
who was assaulted by a violent guy.

342
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,220
How about changing away my medicine?

343
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,280
Who were you trying to protect? Xia Chu?

344
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,020
It was me.

345
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,770
I'm asking you a question.

346
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,460
What happened?

348
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,400
Xia Chu doesn't need your protection.

349
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,320
Stay away from her.

350
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,660
Can you stay by her side

351
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,210
twenty-four hours a day?

352
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,730
When I am by her side,

353
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,330
what can you do for her

354
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,230
being in the military camp?

355
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,530
Try me.

356
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,570
Who is he?

357
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,820
Why did he mention about Xia Chu?

358
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,720
Do they know each other?

359
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,120
Professor Xia.

360
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,940
He

361
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,120
is Liang Mu Ze.

362
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,810
He's an officer with
the Special Forces Brigade.

363
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,460
He's just an uncultured person

364
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,280
who is not good at
controlling his emotion.

365
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,800
It seems that he's one of
Xia Chu's admirers too.

366
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,130
Rao Zhi, finally he said something.

367
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,160
He wants to see you.

368
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,050
Have you thought it through?

369
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,330
Are you their leader?

370
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,750
Yes.

371
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,890
Leader.

372
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,650
No, I mean Chief.

373
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,090
I really had no idea that

374
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,960
there were many other things in the car.

375
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,270
[I trust you.]

376
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,050
[But would the person who met you
believe you?]

377
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,730
No, Chief.

378
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,210
Please believe me.

379
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,900
I accepted a job on the internet.

380
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,870
I was told to get a new car
when I reached there.

381
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,370
That lad didn't escape, did he?

382
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,970
What do you think?

383
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,730
Not only did he not escape,

384
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,290
he sold you out.

385
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,870
He said you betrayed him.

386
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,360
He's talking nonsense.

387
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,890
[I get nothing if I betray him.]

388
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,860
[Betraying him]

389
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,530
is no different than betraying myself.

390
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,760
Fine.

391
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,520
I'm no stranger to people like you.

392
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,890
Hurry up.

393
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,610
Tell me everything that you know.

394
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,690
Listen, Chief.

395
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm

396
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,600
always unlucky.

397
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,330
You know what?

398
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,330
I ran into a silly lady.

399
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,810
That lady...

400
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,850
You'd better contact her parents
as soon as possible.

401
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
That young lady is crazy.

402
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,450
Something is truly wrong with her.

403
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,860
I'm worried about her.

404
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,440
When her illness strikes,

405
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,930
in just a split second,

406
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,200
she may destroy her whole family.

407
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,480
She always...

408
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,330
You don't have to worry
about that young lady.

409
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,650
You'd better worry about yourself.

410
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,410
Okay, got it.

411
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,540
If I come clean,

412
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,850
will you protect me?

413
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,560
You're not in the position to negotiate.

414
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,640
We'll ensure your safety.

415
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,840
Answering all the questions honestly

416
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,710
is the best way to save yourself.

417
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,000
The cross-border crimes

418
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,050
is unique.

419
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,540
The criminal knew that
we wouldn't conduct security check

420
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,920
on the VIP's car.

421
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,450
They filled the door

422
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,850
and other compartments

423
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,170
in two identical commercial vehicles

424
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,240
with gold and drugs.

425
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,100
They intended

426
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,300
to get the transaction done in a fast way

427
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,610
by exchanging cars.

428
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,490
According to Liu Zheng Min,

429
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,770
the real owner of the sapphire

430
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,520
is someone by the name of Old Master.

431
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,970
He's the one

432
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,490
who made Liu Zheng Min
took a photo of the sapphire.

433
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,840
In the name of Old Master,

434
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,040
he also transferred the sapphire
to the deceased in the bungalow,

435
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,230
Sang Kun.

436
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,010
Sang Kun

437
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,570
is kind of a big shot.

438
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,210
Under his financial aid, T4

439
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,920
developed along the way.

440
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,410
However, in recent years,

441
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,450
he's down with kidney failure.

442
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,500
As such, T4

443
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,200
has been controlled by

444
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,710
Old Master who has the real power.

445
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,990
As for him,

446
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,440
he's been

447
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,200
looking for a kidney for transplant.

448
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,580
Not long ago, the kidnapping case

449
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,970
that happened to
the Isaia Joint Medical Team

450
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,080
is also related to him.

451
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,480
His murder

452
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,050
is most likely a result of

453
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,530
the internal conflict in T4.

454
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,200
Judging from the current situation,

455
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,840
we're unable to ascertain

456
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,140
the identity of Old Master.

457
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,890
Liu Zheng Min also said that

458
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,690
he's never seen Old Master.

459
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,620
He always

460
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,740
contacted him through a middle person

461
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,860
on City of Desire.

462
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,740
Middle person?

463
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,620
Was it the person who met with him today?

464
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,380
No.

465
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,280
That person is Gui's lackey.

466
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,930
According to Liu Zheng Min's statement,

467
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,250
the person who was supposed

468
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,640
to meet up with him for transaction
was Sang Kun's younger brother,

469
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,610
Bai Sen, whose nickname is Gui.

470
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,020
Last year,

471
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,730
when Gui came to China

472
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,420
to find a cure for his elder brother,

473
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,720
both of them met once.

474
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,490
According to Liu Zheng Min's description

475
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,180
and the surveillance recording
at the scene,

476
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,370
we did a comparison.

477
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,320
We've targeted the suspect
who was blended in with the guests,

478
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,690
Gui.

479
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,850
He disguised as Ba Song.

480
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,770
He pretended to be a legal representative

481
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,090
of a foreign listed company

482
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,940
as a cover.

483
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,480
He was invited to attend
the medical forum.

484
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,890
Why did he send his lackey

485
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,300
to meet Xiong

486
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,610
but he attended the forum instead?

487
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,450
What was his plan?

488
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,010
Xiong is unsure of his plan.

489
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,930
It looks like

490
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,250
only when we find Gui

491
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,680
can we find out more.

492
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,820
At the nearby street of the scene,

493
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,580
we stopped a Chevrolet car

494
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,490
which was ferrying Gui.

495
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,460
We only found a severely injured driver.

496
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,740
He was announced dead
not long after he reached the hospital.

497
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,180
As for Gui's whereabouts,

498
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,520
we're still locating him.

499
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,400
Did the sniper who was hiding
in the residential area

500
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,780
find any clues?

501
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,130
We contacted the management department
to get the surveillance recording

502
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,690
and we found that only the recording

503
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,260
of the said building had gone missing.

504
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,500
We could only leave it to
the technology department

505
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,780
to recover the recording.

506
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,660
At the same time,

507
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,900
we tried to find out
the relevant information

508
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,420
by interviewing the residents.

509
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,980
However, the progress is slow.

510
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,170
We're unable to ascertain his identity
at the moment.

511
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,700
All right, let me

512
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,770
explain the coming work arrangements.

513
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,490
For Team A,

514
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,850
continue locating Gui's whereabouts.

515
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,770
You may send the relevant information

516
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,780
to the Command Center.

517
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,700
Ask them to look out for us too.

518
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,670
Got it.

519
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,140
Team B,

520
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,130
continue look out for the hidden clues

521
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,860
on City of Desire.

522
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,780
Find out if Gui and the sniper

523
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,080
share any form of contact.

524
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,240
Team C,

525
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,290
follow up with Zhuo Ran, the man
who was suspected of possessing a gun.

526
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,980
No doubt we didn't find

527
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,520
any gun on him,

528
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,930
but taking into consideration

529
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,260
there was a time gap,

530
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,530
he's most likely
transferred the gun to somewhere else.

531
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,460
Besides that,

532
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,560
based on the surveillance recording
at the scene,

533
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,500
when Gui saw Zhuo Ran,

534
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,890
he behaved strangely.

535
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,220
Hence,

536
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,020
we must find out his background.

537
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,540
Make sure you leave no stone unturned.

538
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,290
-Got it?
-Yes.

539
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,760
Slow down.

540
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,350
I live next door.

541
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,830
Let me know if anything.

542
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,970
Okay.

543
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,640
Thank you for your help.

544
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,300
Rest early.

545
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,080
Mi Gu.

546
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,800
The interview...

547
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,010
It's okay, Mr Xia.

548
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,570
We can talk about it when you feel better.

549
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,140
That's great.

550
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,800
Let me...

551
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,630
Rest early.

552
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,220
Mr Zhuo.

553
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,700
Please send Mi Gu off.

554
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,170
It's okay. I should do that.

555
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,540
This is my name card.

556
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,020
When Professor Xia is in Ningjiang

557
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,090
and if he needs anything,
he may contact me at any time.

558
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,080
Thank you.

559
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,450
If it weren't for you,

560
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,580
god knows how huge of a mess

561
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,040
that madman would make.

562
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,550
I'm glad that everyone is safe.

563
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,010
Let's go.

564
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,340
Sure, let me get ready
for tomorrow's forum.

565
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,490
I'll see you off.

566
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,730
Goodbye.

567
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,120
Goodbye.

568
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,590
Zhuo Ran.

569
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,360
I'm home.

570
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,620
You should go up.

571
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,100
Hold on.

572
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,630
I've something to return to you.

573
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,570
Is this yours?

574
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,870
Don't you think you need to explain to me?

575
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,380
I'm exhausted, Mi Gu.

576
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,620
I'm exhausted too.

577
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,610
I was on tenterhooks at the hospital.

578
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,340
I wanted to ask you

579
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,920
but I worried that someone
might find out about it.

580
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,760
Where did it come from?

581
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,710
Why did you keep a gun with you?

582
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,710
It's fake.

583
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,370
It's just a toy.

584
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,880
Then why didn't you inform me before hand?

585
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,640
It was an emergency.

586
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,250
I did it subconsciously.

587
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,130
You knew that the police officers
would conduct a search on you.

588
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,840
I only know that all the police officers
in the world are the same.

589
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,900
If they found out that

590
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,440
I brought a toy gun with me,

591
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,810
they would interrogate me non-stop

592
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,560
and then choose to believe
what they want to believe.

593
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,220
I didn't want to put myself in trouble.

594
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,920
What if I got myself into trouble?

595
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,410
If that ever happened,

596
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,370
I would explain to them.

597
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,760
You hugged me

598
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,770
just to hide the gun

599
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,320
and avoid the risk, right?

600
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,080
Am I right, Zhuo Ran?

601
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,440
No.

602
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,980
At that moment,

603
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,280
I wanted to give you some comfort.

604
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,520
I'm going upstairs.

605
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,150
Have you found Gui?

606
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,360
You're asking me?

607
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,320
He ran away under your nose.
Why are you asking me?

608
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,860
The situation was a chaos.

609
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,320
It was chaotic, yes.

610
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,580
You've been making errors
in the past few missions.

611
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,330
Don't tell me it's an accident.

612
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,760
What else could it be?

613
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,290
What do you think it is?

614
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,530
Don't think that you can
check and balance Old Master

615
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,920
by releasing Gui.

616
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,300
If you don't want your mum...

617
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,540
Don't talk about my mum!

618
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,570
For your mum's sake,

619
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,080
you'd better stop playing tricks!

620
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,370
Old Master.

621
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,440
[Are you done with Gui?]

622
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,410
I'm sorry.

623
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,050
[You know that I hate apologies the most.]

624
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,120
I know.

625
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:37,890
However,

626
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,530
though Gui escaped,

627
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,040
we finally got to meet Xia Guang Yuan.

628
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,650
He's changed his mind about me
due to the incident.

629
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,090
Hence,

630
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,820
it's not completely a bust.

631
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,820
What went wrong in the process?

632
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,940
Liang Mu Ze.

633
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,090
Who?

634
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,490
[He's the Chinese military officer]

635
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,980
who I had bugs installed at his place.

636
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,560
Xia Chu is living at his place.

637
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,880
They're quite close.

638
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,650
Because of him,

639
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,130
Gui escaped.

640
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,140
[His presence has made my attempt]

641
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,040
[to approach Xia Chu even harder.]

642
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,880
I wanted to kill him before

643
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,239
but I failed.

644
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,719
He's a Special Forces soldier

645
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,130
and he usually live in the military camp.

646
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,610
It's difficult to go near him.

647
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,889
Even if I get to approach him,

648
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,120
it would be

649
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,690
too risky

650
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,659
to take action in China.

651
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,060
Unless...

652
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,199
[Unless what?]

653
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,380
Unless we can find a chance

654
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,280
to end him

655
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,719
when he receives training abroad.

656
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,550
The difficulty

657
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,850
[will be much lower.]

658
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,920
End him abroad?

659
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,590
Zhuo Ran.

660
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,400
[You're really something.]

661
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,050
Just by one line,

662
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,889
you passed the problem to me.

663
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,400
You can send Long Yi.

664
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,500
Are you trying to get rid of me?

665
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,040
You serve no purpose here.

666
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,770
[Enough.]

667
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,060
[Your mission]

668
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,489
[is to look for Gui
and nail Xia Guang Yuan.]

669
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,080
As for Liang Mu Ze who may spoil our plan,

670
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,600
send his particulars to me.

671
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,990
Got it.

672
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,640
What should we do?

673
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,640
It's not difficult to trace Gui.

674
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,880
It's easy for you to say.

675
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,730
Keep a close eye on
the police and Xia Guang Yuan.

676
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,980
The police are looking for him
and he's looking for Xia Guang Yuan.

677
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,520
We'll find something eventually.

678
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,850
What on earth is this?

679
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,720
Who is she?

680
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,440
Meet each other.

681
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,400
She's Liang Mu Ze's cousin.
Her name is Liang Shao Xue.

682
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,160
Be careful.

683
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't let her crush you to death.

684
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,330
This is my place!

685
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,470
Look after her. I need to take a rest.

686
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,660
Please don't leave.

687
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,250
Where is this?

688
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,760
What's wrong?

689
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,640
It has nothing to do with me.

690
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,650
Where is this?

691
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,710
This...

692
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,460
This is Liang Mu Ze's place.

693
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,240
How is it possible?

694
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,370
No way Mu Ze has a pet cat.

695
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,130
It licked my face!

696
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,890
Don't be dramatic.

697
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
Calm down.

698
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,640
It's early in the morning.

699
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,970
Don't make a ruckus.

700
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,340
Don't irritate our neighbour

701
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,660
or they may report it to the police.

702
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,260
Leave me alone!

703
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,970
I'm about to explode!

704
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,830
Calm down.

705
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,450
You're completely awake.

706
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
If I hadn't woken up,

707
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,610
I might have been sold off
without knowing it.

708
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,840
Do you remember
yesterday, in the afternoon,

709
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,870
you suddenly fell asleep
at the corridor in the hospital?

710
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,320
Falling asleep is normal.

711
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,340
I was dealing with jet lag.

712
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,740
I didn't say that it's abnormal.

713
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,490
I just want to remind you that

714
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,290
when you were in a deep sleep,

715
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,570
it was me

716
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,540
who brought you home

717
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,250
despite being completely
burnt out after a night shift.

718
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,380
Not only did you not thank me,

719
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,100
you're dubious of me.

720
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,520
You suspected that I would sell you off!

721
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,340
Fine, it's okay.

722
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,290
You can question me all you want.

723
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,400
But now,

724
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,260
I beg of you.

725
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,580
Will you keep quiet

726
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,340
and let me take a nap?

727
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,300
That's because I need to work

728
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,700
in the afternoon.

729
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,660
Okay?

730
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,080
Repeat!

731
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,050
-What?
-Repeat

732
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,360
the last word.

733
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,700
I said so many things.

734
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,660
The last...

735
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,610
What did I say?

736
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,720
I said I need to work in the afternoon.

737
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,370
Okay?

738
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,050
OK?

739
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,340
What should I do? I forgot about OK!

740
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,680
How could I forgot OK?

741
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,810
My OK!

742
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,680
Report.

743
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,520
Come in.

744
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,960
Brigade Commander.

745
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,490
The police have forwarded the summary

746
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,010
of the action to me.

747
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm waiting for
a detailed report from you.

748
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,000
Something happened in the process.

749
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,760
However, it went on smoothly in general.

750
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,000
Sure, it's okay.

751
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,740
Later,

752
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,370
please submit a report in detail.

753
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,770
By the way,

754
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,000
have an internal meeting

755
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,400
with everyone who took part in the action

756
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,760
to conclude the matter.

757
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,620
Yes.

758
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,500
Also,

759
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,780
I received instruction
from the higher authorities

760
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,280
to send a team to
the Central Asian military training

761
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,160
which will be held by Willick
at the end of the month.

762
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,390
End of the month?

763
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,730
We don't have much time.

764
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,880
You'll be leading the team
during the training camp.

765
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,320
How long will it take?

766
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,030
It's tentatively scheduled for a week.

767
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,830
However,
it depends on the training progress.

768
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,290
Do you have any question?

769
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,250
No.

770
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,840
Get ready.
Military reform is just around the corner.

771
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,650
This is a rare opportunity.

772
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,330
Don't make any mistake.

773
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,090
Yes, sir.

774
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,920
[Can you stay by her side]

775
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,440
[twenty-four hours a day?]

776
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,910
[When I am by her side,]

777
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,810
[what can you do for her]

778
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,690
[being in the military camp?]

779
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,790
Brigade Commander
wants me to check on you.

780
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,130
Why?

781
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,020
He thinks that you're not in a good mood

782
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,280
after executing the mission.

783
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,970
It turns out that
Xia Chu is also suffering from insomnia.

784
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,860
Why can't she fall asleep?

785
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,330
It's because of her first love.

786
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,400
You...

787
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,130
Are you in a bad mood?

788
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,880
No.

789
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm worried.

790
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,090
I think this guy

791
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,790
has some hidden agendas.

792
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Hello.

793
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,070
[Old Master.]

794
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,060
[The military]

795
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,490
[invited the special forces of China
for a training camp.]

796
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,600
[It seems that]

797
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,340
[the person who you're interested in]

798
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,680
[is in the participant list.]

799
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,580
[I've sent you his particulars
through email.]

800
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,110
You may take a look.

801
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,480
Got it.

802
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,670
Judging from the X-ray,

803
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,940
it's aortic regurgitation.

804
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,730
You can't wait

805
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,830
any longer.

806
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,010
Many problems will manifest as time pass.

807
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,320
Therefore, I suggest that

808
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,410
you undergo the surgery
as soon as possible.

809
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,210
I can't do that, doctor.

810
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,210
I'm really occupied at work.

811
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,570
I can't make it.

812
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,530
Let me be frank.

813
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,890
You will have to undergo the surgery
sooner or later.

814
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,330
It's better to do it early.

815
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,070
I think my body is doing fine.

816
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,400
It's okay.

817
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,880
Why are you here if everything is okay?

818
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,010
Why do you come to me if you're okay?

819
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,170
I'm busy.
Don't take up my time for nothing.

820
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,070
Doctor, don't be mad.

821
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,310
I'm not mad.

822
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,600
It's your body.

823
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,570
You should think for yourself.

824
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,250
I know. How about this?

825
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,450
Please prescribe some medicine for me.

826
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
I'll start with taking medicine.

827
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,500
What do you think?

828
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,260
Please do me a favour.

829
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,720
Thank you. Please do me a favour.

830
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,900
Don't stretch yourself thin.

831
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,850
If you are down with flu or diarrhoea,

832
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,320
you must seek medical help
soonest the possible.

833
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:21,970
Sure.

834
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,020
If your heart contracted a virus,

835
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,340
it would become a serious problem.

836
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,720
-Okay.
-Bear it in mind.

837
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,380
Okay.

838
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,840
Okay.

839
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,780
Thank you, doctor.

840
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,520
That's all for today. Come again tomorrow.

841
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,180
Dr Zhang, it's me.

842
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,980
It's you.

843
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,250
Yes.

844
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,850
Where is Xiao Jun?

845
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,650
Xiao Jun has gone to school.

846
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,650
I'm out for groceries shopping.

847
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,130
That's why I brought you

848
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,740
some steamed cakes which I just made.

849
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:06,580
Try it.

850
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,540
Great.

851
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,970
I was thinking
what I should have for lunch.

852
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,010
Thank you.

853
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,250
You're welcome.

854
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,740
I should be the one to thank you.

855
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,760
Xiao Jun recovered well after the surgery.

856
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,740
Therefore,

857
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,640
I'm here to thank you officially.

858
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,480
Don't do that.

859
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,820
What are you doing?
You don't have to do that.

860
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,720
Well...

861
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,600
I'll not take up your time.

862
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,920
Enjoy the food.

863
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,550
Sure, thank you.

864
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm leaving.

865
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,380
-Goodbye.
-Sure.

866
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,170
Chen Meng Zhen.

867
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,000
My name is Zhang Yi Chi.

868
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,460
The next time we meet each other,

869
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,610
you may address me by my first name.

870
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,860
You're being so polite all the time.

871
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,050
You sound distant.

872
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,840
We're almost the same age.

873
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,520
The way you address me

874
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,870
makes me sound old.

875
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,460
Okay, I got it now.

876
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,260
-I'll go now.
-Goodbye.

877
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,850
Goodbye.
