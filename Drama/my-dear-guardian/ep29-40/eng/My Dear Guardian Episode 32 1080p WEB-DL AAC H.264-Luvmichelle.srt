00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,360
[How is Xiao Xue's condition?]

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,520
[That's great.]

6
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,520
Liang Mu Ze, what are you trying to say?

7
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,130
[I sent you a song.]

8
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,880
[Take a listen.]

9
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,420
♫ The window obscures the moon ♫
♫ My yearning and anxiety ♫

10
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,200
♫ Reflected in meaningless words ♫

11
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,370
♫ The busy shadows and the long nights ♫

12
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,360
♫ Leave behind a feeling in their haste ♫

13
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,380
♫ Your voice shakes as you avert
your gaze ♫

14
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,960
Liang Mu Ze,

15
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,690
you should smile more often.

16
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,130
You look pretty good

17
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,390
♫ Yet you are so mesmerising ♫

18
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,560
when you smile.

19
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,440
So superficial.

20
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,770
♫ Why do I yearn for such
a confusing love? ♫

21
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,890
♫ From the sleepless,
heart-wrenching nights ♫

22
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,100
♫ To the present
sorrow of a lost passion ♫

23
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:33,079
♫ Why should we let loneliness
taint true love? ♫

24
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,690
How old are you?

25
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,380
♫ From endless talks
to a simple goodnight ♫

26
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,650
You should think like an adult.

27
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,980
You can hit me,

28
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,010
you can throw a fit,

29
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,370
♫ Despite my fantasy,
we separated so easily ♫

30
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,280
but you have to come home.

31
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,840
Got it?

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,570
♫ Our tender love contradicts
the change of hearts ♫

33
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,360
My goodness.

34
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,840
I failed.

35
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,990
♫ I can't resist your casual goodnight ♫

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,630

♫ Because of a goodnight,
the foolish lover ends up hurt ♫

38
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,620
♫ From endless talks

♫ Our tender love contradicts
the change of hearts ♫

41
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,600
A while ago, you asked me

42
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,400
whether I'd adopted

43
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,220
anybody else's habits.

44
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,409
You said you hadn't.

45
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,840
It was true back then.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,250
♫ I can't resist your casual goodnight ♫

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,440
But now, I want you to know

48
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,320
that I'm learning to eat durian

49
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,800
♫ I am consumed with our farewell ♫

50
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,440
and to not put salt in my soups.

51
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,159
I'm getting accustomed to your tastes.

52

♫ Because of a goodnight,
the foolish lover ends up hurt ♫

53
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,130
Remember what you said?

54
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,850
The heart is above the stomach.

55
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,120
I don't want to get even with you
anymore, Dr Xia.

56

♫ Because of a goodnight,
the foolish lover ends up hurt ♫

57

[Xia Chu,]

59
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,240
[are you busy?]

60
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,170
No. I'm on my afternoon break.

61
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,160
[How's Dad?]

62
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,930
Did he feel better

63
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,680
after he went back?

64
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't want you two to get angry

65
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,120
[and quarrel because of me, alright?]

66
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,370
[I'm doing fine here.]

67
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,400
I know what to do regarding Liang Mu Ze.

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,330
This Spring Festival,

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,159
I'll try to go back and visit you.

70
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,440
[Xia Chu,]

71
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,300
your father went to Isaia

72
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,050
to attend Tang Lin's wedding.

73
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,040
I haven't heard from him for two days.

74
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,840
[I called his and Tang Lin's phones,]

75
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,980
but neither of them answered.

76
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,610
What's going on?

77
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,090
Mum, don't panic.

78
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,370
[I've been to Isaia before.]

79
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,160
[The signal there is terrible.]

80
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,600
Tell you what,

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,770
why don't you give me
Dad's flight number

82
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,690
and the name of the hotel?

83
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,620
[I'll call in to check]

84
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,770
[and get back to you.]

85
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,280
Alright. I'll send it over right away.

86
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,200
[The number you've dialled...]

87
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,760
[Hotel not found]

88
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,330
[Hello.]

89
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,170
[You've reached the
Chinese Embassy in Isaia.]

90
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,920
[How may I help you?]

91
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,930
Hi.

92
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,330
I've lost contact with my father
after he landed

93
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,760
in Isaia two days ago.

94
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,730
And

95
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,730
I can't find his hotel online.

96
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,970
Can the embassy

97
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,080
help me find his whereabouts?

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,450
[Ms Xia,]

99

[on the 23rd when he was
going through immigration.]

105
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,060
[He is now held]

106
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,080
[at a police station in the suburbs
of Isaia.]

107
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,480
Take a seat.

108
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm the lawyer sent to bail you out.

109
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,520
Here are your

110
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,730
papers.

111
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,420
And here

112
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,290
is your bail bond.

113
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,180
Just sign on the dotted line,

114
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,720
and we'll be on our way.

115
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,410
Don't worry.

116
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,560
Your friend sent me here.

117
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,520
Everything has been arranged for you.

118
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,170
All you have to do is sign it,

119
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,240
Professor Xia.

120
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,000
Have a drink, Professor Xia.

121
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,360
Thanks.

122
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,620
May I ask

123
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,720
where the person
who came here with me

124
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,960
is right now?

125
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,560
I want to call my family.

126
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,040
But my phone is missing.

127
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,360
I want to go home.

128
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,120
Can I go home right now?

129
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,960
Can I?

130
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,920
This isn't the way to the airport.

131
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,210
Where are you taking me?

132
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,420
Pull over!

133
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,040
I... I want to get out.

134
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,240
Calm down, Professor Xia.

135
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,880
It'll all be clear when you wake up.

136
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,480
Willow of Zhangtai, Willow of Zhangtai.

137

Xiao Xue.

141
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,800
Wake up, Xiao Xue.

142
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,640
It's me, Mummy.

143
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,400
Mum.

144
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,320
You're here?

145
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,160
If I don't come here,

146
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,000
what will become of you?

147
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,490
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,800
What happened?

149
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,360
You were fine

150
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,540
and now you're injured.

151
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,760
Sister-in-law.

152
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,970
I thought I heard

153
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,770
someone reciting poems.

154
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,890
Willow of Zhangtai, Willow of Zhangtai.

155
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,280
Are you still as green as ever?

156
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,280
It's you.

157
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,650
Who did you think it was?

158
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,280
What are you trying to find?

159
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,240
What are you trying to find?

160
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,420
What is it?

161
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,930
My smartphone.

162
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,560
Here it is.

163
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,000
Did it ring just now?

164
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,480
Xiao Xue.

165
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,760
I didn't mean to get in his way.

166
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,160
I didn't mean to.

167
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,480
Xiao Xue, what's wrong?

168
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,530
You're not feeling well?

169
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,200
I didn't mean to give him trouble.

170
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,410
Why?

171
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,240
Stop asking.

172
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,760
What are you doing here?

173
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,000
Going through the material.

174
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,520
It's about

175
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,720
Zhuo Ran's confession.

176
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,760
Any new discoveries?

177
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,460
He said a lot of things.

178
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,570
But when it came

179
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,240
to Old Master's identity,

180
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,080
he revealed nothing.

181
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,520
If he wasn't covering up
for Old Master,

182
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,400
he was covering up for himself.

183
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,840
[Is this Mi Gu from Life FM?]

184
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,490
Yes. May I know who's speaking?

185
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,400
I've been following your program.

186
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,520
I have a lead

187
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,570
[that you might find interesting.]

188
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,600
Go on.

189
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,220
[Professor Xia Guang Yuan]

190
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,800
[of Dong'an University]

191
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,760
[was kidnapped in Isaia.]

192
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,810
[T4 has just confirmed they're
responsible for it.]

193
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,640
Who was kidnapped?

194
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,600
[Who are you?]

195
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,680
Mum!

196
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,290
You're back.

197
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,880
What's going on?

198
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,890
We basically

199
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,600
got the picture now.

200
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,640
Try and think about it.

201
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,010
If there is any detail
that we missed,

202
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,410
remember to contact the university.

203
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,610
Or Officer Zhou here.

204
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,690
We'll take our leave, then.

205
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,120
Mum!

206
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,520
Mum!

207
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,160
Here.

208
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,530
Slowly.

209
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,240
Well?

210
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,810
Feeling better now?

211
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,040
So many things have happened.

212
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,970
Why didn't you guys tell me earlier?

213
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,640
What's the use?

214
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,160
You were too far away
to help us.

215
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,720
Didn't you have things

216
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,520
you wanted to tell us back in Ningjiang?

217
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,240
No wonder Dad

218
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,560
was so adamant that I come
back to Dong'an.

219
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,480
Xia Chu,

220
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,200
don't blame your father.

221
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,720
He has too much on his plate.

222
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,520
It's hard on him emotionally.

223
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,040
I know.

224
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,930
I know.

225
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,690
Mum,

226
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,410
Dad would never

227
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,960
run off to another country

228
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,280
and join a research institution
there, would he?

229
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,370
What are you saying, Xia Chu?

230
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,240
Don't you trust your father?

231
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,930
Don't you know what kind of person
he is?

232
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,000
I do.

233
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,800
To him, work

234
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,370
was never

235
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,060
simply work.

236
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,000
It is his dream.

237
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,640
No matter how hard life is,

238
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,050
no matter how unfairly he's treated,

239
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,490
even if he's forced to leave
the laboratory,

240
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,940
he'd never abandon us,

241
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,970
his friends,

242
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,610
his colleagues, his students,

243
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,960
and his project

244
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,720
to pursue a co-called future.

245
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,770
No way.

246
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,130
I know him. There's no way
he'd do such a thing.

247
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,330
I know he wouldn't.

248
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,560
Take it easy,

249
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,540
alright?

250
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,240
No matter what the people
who came to our house said,

251
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,600
I still believe in your father.

252
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,400
I believe in him, too.

253
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,530
Don't worry.

254
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,290
I'll go to Isaia

255
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,080
and bring Dad back safely.

256
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,850
When are you going?

257
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,840
Tomorrow.

258
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,090
I need to go to Ningjiang first

259
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,250
to pack up.

260
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,780
I'll fly from there in the afternoon.

261
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,750
Okay.

262
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,090
Let me pack up.
I'm coming with you.

263
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,810
Mum.

264
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,280
Mum, calm down.

265
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,720
Listen,

266
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,280
you have to stay at home.

267
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,340
The university people might
want to contact you.

268
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,340
Someone has to stay back.

269
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,220
But how can you go on your own?

270
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,240
Trust me.

271
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,480
I can do it.

272
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,280
Tell you what,

273
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,960
why don't you tell me what happened

274
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,540
on the day Tang Lin came to see Dad

275
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,320
down to the last detail?

276
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,040
That day,

277
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,960
Tang Lin came to our house
unannounced.

278
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,000
He told your father

279
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,200
he was going to have

280
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,800
a wedding in Isaia.

281
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,010
Xia Chu!

282
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,060
I have to go to Isaia.

283
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,490
Is this about your father?

284
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,940
I received a phone call

285
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,400
saying he's in trouble.

286
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,610
From whom?

287
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,530
I don't know.

288
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,220
I tried calling back,

289
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,480
but nobody answered.

290
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,280
Wake up.

291
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,730
What's up?

292
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,200
Find Hai.

293
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,610
Right now?

294
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,610
Right now.

295
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,040
Take him to Old Master.

296
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,080
Does Old Master know?

297
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,210
Should I give him a heads-up?

298
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,890
Listen,

299
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,840
Xia Guang Yuan and the others
have arrived in Isaia.

300
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,920
The new product development
is in the bag.

301
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,840
What Old Master wants
is the Chinese market.

302
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,000
I need to solve this problem
as soon as possible.

303
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,520
For my mother.

304
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,930
She doesn't have much time left.

305
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,840
Why do you need Hai?

306
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,600
He's only a middleman.

307
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,640
Because compared to Jiu,

308
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,240
he's more valuable.

309
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,580
[Rao Zhi, Old Master has agreed
to meet up.]

310
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,780
[But Hai must go to his turf.]

311
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,530
[Why Hai?]

312
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,570
He doesn't want to give
you too much sway over him.

313
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,970
[He's hoping Hai]

314
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,130
[can provide more options
for distribution.]

315
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,250
Long Yi

316
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,170
was the man who hurt Xiao Xue.

317
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,140
Isn't that right?

318
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,720
Xiao Xue told me everything.

319
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,240
It's been so many years,

320
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,920
yet Xiao Xue could recognise
him straight away.

321
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,280
Your mission this time

322
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,840
is two-fold.

323
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,800
First, to find the actual location
of T4's HQ.

324
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,930
Second,

325
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,370
to meet

326
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,680
the puppetmaster, Old Master,

327
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,920
and take a clear photograph
of his face.

328
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
So that the police

329
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,680
can identify him.

330
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,850
And if possible,

331
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,880
obtain evidence of him and T4's
crimes.

332
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,880
I'll do whatever it takes

333
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,920
to find proof of their
wrongdoing.

334
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,600
I will complete the mission.

335
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,240
Be careful.

336
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,130
Are you going by yourself?

337
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,970
Don't worry.

338
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,970
I've lived in Isaia for six months.

339
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,160
I'll be fine.

340
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,850
If, like the man claimed,

341
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,840
T4 is involved with your
father's disappearance...

342
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,180
All the more reason
for me to go.

343
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,740
I need to relay the information
to the embassy

344
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,890
and the local police,

345
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,560
so they can find him
as soon as possible.

346
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,370
My father was charged
with drug smuggling,

347
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,770
and now he's missing.

348
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,360
I must go, Mi Gu.

349
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,880
Have you told Liang Mu Ze?

350
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,140
I don't intend to.

351
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,320
Why not?

352
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,210
He's your boyfriend.

353
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,680
Are you afraid he won't come with you?

354
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,930
No.

355
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,490
I know he'd be happy to.

356
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,080
But he can't because he's a soldier.

357
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,450
Even I had to get special permission.

358
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
It's impossible for him.

359
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,540
He'd feel torn.

360
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,560
You're still thinking of him
at a time like this?

361
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,570
Xia Chu,

362
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,290
you're just a girl.

363
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,020
Don't think

364
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,760
you can handle everything on your own.

365
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Tell him.

366
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,530
At least let him hear you out.

367
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,610
I don't want him to feel guilty.

368
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,640
Is there anything I can do for you?

369
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,920
Keep it a secret.

370
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,680
Take care of yourself.

371
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,000
Don't worry.

372
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,640
Dr Zhang.

373
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,690
Can I have Liang Mu Ze's
contact information?

374
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,000
Reporting in!

375
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,500
What's all that racket?

376
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,560
Come in.

377
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,520
[Brigade Commander's Office]

378
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,710
Yes, sir.

379
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,350
Commander,

380
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,400
I'd like to take a leave.

381
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,220
Now?

382
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,010
That's right.

383
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,690
What for?

384
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,610
Xia Chu's father ran into some
trouble in Isaia.

385
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,880
I want to go there with her.

386
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,010
Is there any way

387
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,960
I can get to Isaia as soon as possible?

388
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,850
Do you expect me

389
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,490
to call up the Air and Ground Forces?

390
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,330
Thank you, Commander.

391
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,480
Liang Mu Ze!

392
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,960
You're getting out of line.

393
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,080
You're an active personnel.

394
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,770
What right do I have

395
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,810
to let an active personnel

396
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
leave the country willy-nilly?

397
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,310
Besides,

398
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,740
under what justification
should I let you go?

399
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,940
For business?

400
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,040
For a trip?

401
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,040
Or to visit your family
on a holiday?

402
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,000
I think you're out of your gourd.

403
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,680
Our priority now is the redeployment.

404
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,520
And we're firing on all cylinders.

405
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,380
I know.

406
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,480
Like hell you do.

407
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,650
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze,

408
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,560
I can't send you to Isaia this time,

409
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,890
but even if

410
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,600
I can,

411
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,050
and you arrive in Isaia,

412
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,010
what can you,

413
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,700
a Special Forces soldier,

414
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,010
the face of Chinese military, do?

415
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,340
Do you think this is a movie
where you

416
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,420
get to roam free

417
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,420
in a foreign territory

418
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,560
with guns blazing?

419
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,120
Dream on!

420
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,590
Commander,

421
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,370
I just want to be there

422
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,040
to protect her when she needs me.

423
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,650
I want to protect my loved one.

424
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,750
Say no more.

425
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,490
How many times

426
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,360
must I repeat our code of conduct?

427
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,040
Go back.

428
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,060
Commander.

429
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,000
Don't make me put you
in confinement!

430
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,780
Get out!

431
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,880
Yes, sir.

432
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,890
Please get me

433
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,240
Military Attache Chen's
contact information.

434
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,440
Thanks.

435
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,520
[I heard T4 kidnapped him.]

436
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,160
[But I'm not sure if it's true.]

437
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,930
[I'm really worried about her.]

438
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,880
[I don't know who else can help her.]

439
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,330
[It's dangerous for her
to go there.]

440
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,800
[Can you figure something out?]

441
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,200
Xia Chu.

442
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,720
Why are you here?

443
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,410
Mi Gu told me.

444
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,570
I tried to ask the Brigade Commander

445
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,280
to deploy me to Isaia,

446
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,010
but to no avail.

447
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,040
What were you thinking?

448
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,360
It's just a pipe dream.

449
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,200
I can't come with you.

450
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,540
What are you apologising for?

452
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,690
I'm a military personnel, too.

453
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,760
I understand.

454
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,320
That's why

455
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,840
I asked Mi Gu not to tell you.

456
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,450
I didn't want you to feel guilty.

457
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,090
The fact that you came here today

458
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,400
and told me those things

459
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,880
is enough.

460
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,970
By the way,

461
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,090
when you arrive,

462
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,440
a man named Mahadi will be
there to pick you up.

463
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,080
He's a friend of mine in Isaia.

464
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,090
He works for the local police.

465
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,620
He should

466
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,280
be able to help your father.

467
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,410
If you run into

468
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,850
any trouble there,
just give me a call

469
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,480
and I'll figure something out, okay?

470
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,160
Sure.

471
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,720
You should get going.

472
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,610
I have to go now.

473
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,490
Safe journey.

474
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm going back to the camp.

475
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,470
Bye.

476
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,600
Commander.

477
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,120
Well I'll be, kid.

478
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,560
So tell me.

479
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,760
Where were you heading?

480
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,370
I went to see Xia Chu off.

481
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,420
By the way,

482
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,800
I've sent Xia Chu's contact information

483
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,240
to Military Attache Chen
at the embassy in Isaia.

484
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,960
He'll get in touch with her.

485
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,600
Thank you, Commander.

486
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,280
Remember,

487
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,330
if I see you running off again,

488
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,080
I'll take disciplinary action.

489
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,330
I'll make an example of you
in front of the entire brigade.

490
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,300
Yes, sir.

491
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,630
[At Willick's border]

492
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,680
Where's your partner?

493
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,960
He has something important to do.

494
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,960
What's so important?

495
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,130
Dig in.

496
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,890
The food here is pretty good.

497
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,320
Where are we?

498
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,520
Jade City.

499
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,330
This is their current location.

500
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,700
Based on the map,

501
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,520
I'd say they're in a restaurant
outside the border.

502
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,160
It's the same place Zhuo Ran
met Old Master last time.

503
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,050
Keep an eye on it.

504
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,380
Director,

505
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,120
Tian Yong and the rest
have crossed the border.

506
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,540
Tell the Interpol

507
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,240
and the local police
to keep a close watch.

508
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,050
Got it. I'll coordinate it.

509
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,600
One more thing.

510
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,090
While helping the Dong'an Police

511
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,850
investigate an inter-provincial
wire transfer,

512
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,440
the Financial Investigation Division

513
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,680
made an interesting discovery.

514
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,050
Who is it about?

515
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,560
Zhuo Ran.

516
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,330
Before you came,

517
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,820
I checked the airport

518
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,130
and the police's surveillance footages.

519
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,360
So, I understand your father
has some problems?

520
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,680
Is this your father?

521
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,370
Yes.

522
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,970
His suitcase

523
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,520
was lifted up by a janitor.

524
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,810
The whole process lasted less than

525
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,120
five seconds.

526
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,330
Nothing suspicious

527
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,080
was found with the janitor.

528
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,860
The suitcase had already been opened.

529
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,050
How do you know?

530
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,840
Here.

531
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,840
There is a sign of deliberate tearing

532
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,000
on the sticker along the latch.

533
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,560
Probably caused by the opening
of the zipper.

534
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,840
So

535
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,940
maybe we can check it out?

536
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,480
The CCTV at the baggage claim area.

537
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,600
We need to look into the baggage handler
for that flight.

538
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,630
Yeah.

539
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,690
And what about the student
who came with my father?

540
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,250
He went to a bathroom after
your father claimed

541
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,610
his luggage

542
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,290
and changed his clothes.
Then he left your father alone

543
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,890
with the police.

544
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,920
No entry has been recorded yet, but

545
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,610
we searched,

546
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,840
and we're sending more people
to search for him.

547
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,410
Why would he do that?

548
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,690
I don't know.

549
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,290
He certainly has a direct connection

550
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,160
to what happened to your father.

551
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,000
Have you found that hotel?

552
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,100
Fake address.

553
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,680
That hotel isn't even in Isaia.

554
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,880
So, look at this. Do you know him?

555
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,900
This is the lawyer

556
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,730
that took your father from our custody.

557
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,960
We tried to identify him.

558
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,520
I don't know him.

559
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,610
I don't know anyone in Isaia

560
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,179
apart from the colleagues

561
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,010
from the army medical team.

562
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,040
I couldn't get a lawyer to bail
my father out.

563
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,520
It's a trap all along.

564
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,360
You're really tired today.

565
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,000
You should eat something.

566
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,760
Wait, wait. Eat this.

567
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,730
Liang said

568
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,080
your taste is light.

569
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,920
So he reminded me to put

570
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,639
less salt in your food.

571
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,520
He's so sweet, right?

572
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,800
Yes.

573
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,920
[Liang Mu Ze.]

574
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,970
Xia Chu?

575
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,210
[Where did you get this number?]

576
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,880
I asked the embassy to connect
my call.

577
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,720
[How are you getting on?]

578
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,820
I've found a hotel.

579
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,700
Which hotel?

580
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,680
Is it safe?

581
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,290
[Don't worry.]

582
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,930
[Mahadi found it for me.]

583
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,410
It has great security.

584
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,880
That's a relief.

585
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,820
What about dinner?

586
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,610
[I had dinner with Mahadi.]

587
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,080
[Something light and simple]

588
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,920
at the restaurant where we first met.

589
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,050
The owner still remembers me.

590
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,620
Alright.

591
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,890
Too bad I wasn't there.

592
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,560
Liang Mu Ze,

593
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,130
my father

594
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,280
could be in serious trouble this time.

595
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,480
I don't know how things will turn out.

596
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,560
What are you trying to say?

597
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,050
I'm afraid it might affect you.

598
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,690
[No, Xia Chu.]

599
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,370
No matter the outcome,

600
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,640
I'll always be with you.

601
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,620
[Rest assured.]

602
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,620
[Are you crying?]

603
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,820
No.

604
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,250
Tell you what,

605
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,740
why don't you tell me

606
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,540
everything you know,

607
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,510
alright?

608
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,740
[Okay.]

609
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,770
[Mahadi and I went to the airport today,]

610
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,690
[where we learned that a baggage handler
named Zaha]

611
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,440
[had suddenly quit after the incident.]

612
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,450
[In the past few days,]

613
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,000
[Zaha has been seen frequenting
high-end outlets.]

614
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,730
[Through his fingerprint,]

615
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,250
[the police confirmed he
had handled]

616
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,360
[the bag of cocaine found
in my father's suitcase.]

617
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,250
[Zaha was acting]

618
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,970
[on the orders]

619
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,730
[of a man named Francis.]

620
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,140
[Zaha admitted]

621
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,690
[that Francis was the lawyer]

622
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,600
[who took my father from custody.]

623
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
[By tracking Francis']

624
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,520
[account activities, Mahadi and his team]

625
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,970
[verified that]

626
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,970
[he has been laundering money]

627
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,600
[for the T4 group headquartered
in Willick.]

628
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,530
[Afterward, Mahadi secretly
followed Francis]

629
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,640
[to a secluded industrial area.]

630
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,780
[There,]

631
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,780
[he saw]

632
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,440
[Tang Lin, who had been missing.]

633
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,200
[Based on the analysis]

634
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,140
[of the waste material coming
from the factory,]

635
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,800
[we know there is drug manufacturing.]

636
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,000
What about my father?

637
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,160
He should be there.

638
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,370
Are you sure?

639
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,200
Every day,

640
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,450
two Chinese people would prepare
two servings of Chinese food and send them

641
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,800
to the south factory building.

642
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,180
When can we get him out of there?

643
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,010
Not yet.

644
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,890
Why?

645
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,610
We need more information

646
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,890
and analysis about that building.

647
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,760
What kind of analysis?

648
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,690
Analysis about the building
and its walls

649
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,260
because that building
has two security gates,

650
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,480
meaning there are two security
checkpoints,

651
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,460
and we don't know anything about it.

652
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,450
About the structure and the interior,

653
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,240
we know that.

654
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,660
[The problem is]

655
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,810
[the Isaia police can't find]

656
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,360
[can't any more information
about the building.]

657
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,850
[Their surveillance tools and techniques
are too crude]

658
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,240
[to penetrate the building's interior.]

659
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,140
[They fear going in blindly]

660
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,010
[might result in unnecessary casualties.]

661
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,320
[Hence the rescue is delayed.]

662
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,240
Need anything, Captain Liang?

663
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,560
Mi Gu!

664
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,320
Mi Gu!

665
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,290
Your best friend's father

666
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,010
has been captured by a drug cartel?

667
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,840
How did you know?

668
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,880
You just posted the article
on your public account.

669
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,770
Get back to work.

670
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,050
I need to take a call.

671
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,120
Okay.

672
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,850
Xia Chu.

673
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,650
I saw your article

674
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,690
on your public account.

675
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,340
[I didn't post it.]

676
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,720
[Nor did I write it.]

677
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,120
Then how did it appear
on your account?

678
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,290
I have no idea.

679
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,840
[It's already had over
a hundred thousand views.]

680
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,840
I really don't know.

681
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,930
Xia Chu,

682
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,570
[I promised I'd keep it a secret.]

683
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,810
[I'd never compromise your privacy]

684
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,890
[and your father's safety]

685
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,410
[just to get some views.]

686
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,800
Please believe me.

687
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,520
[I believe you.]

688
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,570
I'm just worried about my father.

689
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,810
If this article

690
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,160
keeps propagating on the internet,

691
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,560
[and my father's captors see it,]

692
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,520
his life may be in danger.

693
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,200
I'll delete it immediately.

694
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,360
[Thanks.]

695
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,400
You're sure

696
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,160
you haven't told anyone about this, right?

697
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,570
Except for Liang Mu Ze,

698
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,080
I haven't told a soul.

699
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,320
[Then who could it be?]

700
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,730
Not only is he privy to this,

701
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,840
he's even able to post
using your public account.

702
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,970
[What is this person trying
to accomplish?]

703
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,370
[Is this Mi Gu from Life FM?]

704
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,760
Yes. May I know who's speaking?

705
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,450
[Professor Xia Guang Yuan
of Dong'an University]

706
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,440
[was kidnapped in Isaia.]

707
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm opening up my boundaries
to you.

708
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,300
From now on,

709
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,760
you'll be an administrator
of my public account.

710
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,920
If I'm not free,

711
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,480
you'll post on my behalf.

712
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,010
[Sorry,]

713
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,060
[the number you've dialled
is unavailable.]

714
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,960
[Please call again later.]

715
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,770
Mi Gu, have a cup of coffee.

716
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,850
Thank you so much

717
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,410
for taking me to that fan's club event.

718
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,920
Don't mention it.

719
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,770
By the way,

720
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,890
Mr Zhuo has been mighty busy
with his clients.

721
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,290
I'm not sure if he's coming
to the office today.

722
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,200
Would you like to call him and ask?

723
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,680
I called him but he didn't answer.

724
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,360
Why don't I give it a try?

725
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,100
No thanks.

726
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,720
I'll just wait here.

727
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,170
Alright.

728
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm off to lunch.

729
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,320
Would you like anything?

730
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,560
No thanks.

731
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,940
Patient's name?

732
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,960
Zhuo Ran.

733
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,330
Date of birth?

734
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,530
Hold on.

735
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,520
February 19, 1991.

736
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,620
[On December 25, 2009,]

737
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,730
[in a joint effort between
the army and the police,]

738
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,970
[a drug dealer, who assaulted a boy]

739
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,520
[who had just turned 18
the prior week...]

740
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,360
2009.

741
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,970
December 25.

742
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,920
Turned 18 a week prior.

743
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,880
Take it back.

744
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,760
Is this yours?

745
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,200
What are you trying to do
carrying a gun around?

746
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,440
