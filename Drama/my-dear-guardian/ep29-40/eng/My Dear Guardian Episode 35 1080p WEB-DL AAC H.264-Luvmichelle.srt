[Episode 35]

4
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,270
So, we're going to
enter the exercise ground.

5
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,670
We're just to bring someone back.

6
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,770
If you're scared,

7
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,090
you can go home to your mum.

8
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,670
Of course not.

9
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,800
Come on.

10
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,240
Did you find anything?

11
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,530
Shrapnel.

12
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,040
Here's the minefield

13
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,680
where China and X Nation
went through war ten years ago.

14
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,680
After this, we will

15
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,310
walk past the Chinese border.

16
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,490
Then,

17
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,590
we'll reach the drill site.

18
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,900
Be careful.

19
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,990
Let's go.

20
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,790
Just place it there.

21
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,590
Be careful.

22
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,850
These medicines are for

23
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,120
wounds and dysentery.

24
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,990
The soldiers stay outdoors
most of the time.

25
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,510
Please handle it with care.

26
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,520
Dong.

27
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,040
You can't do that.

28
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,650
You have to take a break now.

29
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,430
My soldiers are not back yet.

30
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,610
-Dong!
-Brigade Commander!

31
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,150
Inform the control room now.

32
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,720
Hurry up, inform them.

33
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,770
The Brigade Commander is not feeling well.

34
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,090
He can't conduct the drill anymore.

35
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,480
No one is allowed to contact him.

36
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm okay.

37
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,250
Dong!

38
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,370
Brigade Commander!

39
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,159
-What's wrong?
-Dong!

40
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,210
What's wrong?

41
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,480
-Dong!
-Brigade Commander!

42
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,400
Stay away, don't surround
the Brigade Commander.

43
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you have a torchlight?

44
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,250
I have it.

45
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,080
Brigade Commander, open your mouth.

46
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,430
The Brigade Commander is having
an allergy.

47
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,280
What did the Brigade Commander eat?

48
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:18,970
Or

49
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,410
did he get bitten by anything?

50
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,510
Bitten?

51
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,070
Now I remember.

52
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,510
He was bitten by a bug before.

53
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,310
What happened?

54
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,850
He's having chest tightness,
dizziness, breathing difficulty,

55
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,000
and allergy symptoms.

56
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,080
I suspect he's suffering from anaphylaxis

57
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,960
after being bitten by bugs.

58
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,120
He's also having laryngeal edema.

59
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,280
Get ready for emergency treatment.

60
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,280
Sure.

61
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,350
Let's go.

62
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,770
Hurry up.

63
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,680
-Bring the safe here.
-Yes.

64
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,990
Put him down.

65
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,030
Contingency Plan No. 1 is activated.

66
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,840
I'll contact the control room

67
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,520
to report the unexpected situation.

68
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,850
The head of staff

69
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,080
will take over the Blue Team

70
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,290
for the moment.

71
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,260
Yes!

72
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,810
Don't let me die in this minefield.

73
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,010
I swear if we make it out of here,

74
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,230
then I'm going to kill everyone
on the field.

75
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,030
We're here to kidnap a person.

76
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,610
There are so many people in China.

77
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,930
How are you going to kill them all?

78
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,600
There are so many of them.

79
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,150
So you can miss.

80
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,690
Chief.

81
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,450
An explosion took place
at the minefield near the border.

82
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,330
Send some people there

83
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,790
to find out what had happened.

84
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,810
Brigade Commander.

85
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,150
How do you feel?

86
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,230
I'm feeling so much better.

87
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,470
Xia Chu, I'm all right.

88
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,140
Head of staff.

89
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm here.

90
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,150
Where are our people?

91
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,450
Liang Mu Ze...

92
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,670
They're already at the base.

93
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,080
There's some emergencies.

94
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,910
What happened?

95
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,440
Brigade Commander, take a rest.

96
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,490
Brigade Commander, please lie down.

97
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,690
-Brigade Commander.
-Please calm down.

98
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,790
Brigade Commander.

99
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,550
That won't do.
The blood pressure is too low.

100
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,480
Brigade Commander
is not in an ideal condition.

101
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,200
It'd be better to send him
to the nearest hospital

102
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,510
for further treatment.

103
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,230
-Get the car ready.
-Yes.

104
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,640
No, I don't want to go.

105
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,030
-I don't want to go!
-Brigade Commander.

106
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,400
This is an order from the
Political Commissar!

107
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,990
-Brigade Commander!
-Please calm down, Brigade Commander!

108
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,010
Take a rest.

109
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,000
-This is an order!
-I'm not going.

110
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,350
Brigade Commander.

111
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,050
Captain.

112
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,930
We've completely put down

113
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,130
Red Team's trump card.

114
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,240
It's safe to say that
we make Brigade Commander proud, right?

115
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,710
We'll make him treat us to a meal.

116
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,240
Make him get each of us a wife too.

117
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,310
Yes, get a wife!

118
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,070
Captain!

119
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,570
We just received orders
from the command centre.

120
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,400
We're instructed to
head towards border number six now.

121
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,450
Border number six?

122
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,970
Why do we have to go there again?

123
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,290
We just came back from there.

124
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,790
That place is full of Red Team members.

125
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,880
It's okay.

126
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,640
Let me report to Brigade Commander

127
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,360
about the situation in the past two days.

128
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,400
Captain.

129
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,720
It's quite urgent.

130
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,710
An explosion took place at the border.

131
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,970
The command centre has ruled out

132
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,970
the possibility of accidental bombing
during the drill.

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,480
Therefore,

134
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,930
you guys need to check on the situation

135
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,830
and see if it's caused by
the participating soldiers.

136
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,190
Besides that,

137
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,370
something went wrong

138
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,480
with Brigade Commander Dong's health.

139
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,200
He's been sent to the district hospital
for emergency treatment.

140
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,280
We'll check on Dong later.

141
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,970
Xiao Teng!

142
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,650
Yes.

143
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,880
Gear up for battle

144
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,080
and gather here in five minutes.

145
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,110
Yes!

146
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,770
As the exercise ground is too close
to the border,

147
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,970
the commander in chief worries that

148
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,320
if any soldiers lost their way

149
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,810
or crossed the border
to another country by mistake

150
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,520
it'll likely

151
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,630
bring negative impact to
our country and the military.

152
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,280
Therefore, we're instructed
to gear up for combat

153
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,640
and check out the border.

154
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,880
Pay attention, everyone.

155
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,160
This is the real deal.

156
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,370
500m high ground up ahead.

157
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,520
Split up and observe the area.

158
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,080
Report to me once you
detect any drill soldiers.

159
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,190
Yes.

160
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,210
Platoon leader.

161
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,590
We're next to the border.

162
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,000
I guess the noise

163
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,830
came from here.

164
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,970
It could be some wild animals

165
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,930
stepping on landmines

166
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,240
left over from the war era.

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,030
Don't go near that area.

168
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,960
We should head north along the border.

169
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,350
The Blue Team's territory
is about three kilometres away.

170
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,210
That time,

171
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,840
we'll catch Blue Team by surprise.

172
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,070
Hold on, man.

173
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,430
Everyone, come here!

174
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,840
I have a way to keep you alive.

175
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,890
Okay?

176
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,970
Help!

177
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,100
Help!

178
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,770
Hello, 001.

179
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm 011.

180
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,040
Please respond.

181
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,970
You two, come with me.

182
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,670
The rest of you,
stay here and be vigilant.

183
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,190
Let's go.

184
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,310
Are you okay?

185
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,240
Don't fire the gun!

186
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,070
We're not on a drill.
We're on a mission.

187
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,430
What was the noise?

188
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,270
Where is your leader?

189
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,890
He's at the minefield.

190
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,640
It seems that someone got injured.

191
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,400
Our platoon leader
went there with two other soldiers.

192
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,750
Contact the command centre.

193
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,570
You two come with me.

194
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,150
The rest of you stay here
and wait for further instructions.

195
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,150
Yes!

196
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,270
Go get a car.

197
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,960
We need to go there.

198
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,470
Follow the clues
and we'll find the doctor.

199
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,630
Let's go.

200
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,990
Continue the drill.

201
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,240
We won't expose your whereabouts.

202
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,370
When I'm back to the camp,

203
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,320
I'll report to the superiors
about your situation.

204
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,210
Saving a foreigner

205
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,350
is sort of a big deal.

206
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,770
That person sneaked into the border

207
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,350
without any reason.

208
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,510
However, he's lucky.

209
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,010
If you didn't reach there in time,

210
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,910
he would have died from bleeding.

211
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,600
He put on the tourniquet on his own.

212
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,550
The tourniquet was already there
when we found him.

213
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,680
Does the command centre know that
the injured person is a foreigner?

214
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,690
Yes.

215
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,910
The command centre has informed
the Public Security Bureau.

216
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,800
The head of the PSB instructed us
to send him to the hospital.

217
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,230
Interrogation will start
after he has received treatment.

218
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,920
Let's go back to the base.

219
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,850
Can I hitch a ride?

220
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,810
Sure.

221
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,580
Get into the car!

222
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,610
He was alone when we found him.

223
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,120
He's a foreigner.

224
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,080
As we're having a drill,

225
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,520
the Chief commanded us

226
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,800
to send him to the local hospital.

227
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,720
Do you know his situation?

228
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,490
What?

229
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,560
How did he injure himself?

230
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,480
He stepped on the landmine at the border.

231
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,450
It's about 45 minutes ago.

232
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,310
He used a bandage to stop the bleeding.

233
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,800
The drill has just started

234
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,680
but many accidents have taken place.

235
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,270
It's normal to have accidents
during the drill.

236
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,430
This way.

237
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,150
What happened to him?

238
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,650
He's bitten by bugs

239
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,680
which leads to anaphylaxis.

240
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,170
His blood pressure is low.

241
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,290
He needs further treatment.

242
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,260
Okay.

243
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,130
Captain and I
will go to the district hospital.

244
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,280
Bring the rest back to the camp.

245
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,280
Clean up the equipment and take a break.

246
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,390
Got it.

247
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,030
If anyone asks about us,

248
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,720
tell them

249
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,170
we're reporting to the Brigade Commander.

250
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,140
Yes.

251
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,360
Brigade Commander Dong.

252
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,310
Rest well.

253
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,830
Leave the military exercise to the
Head of Staff and the Political Commissar.

254
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,350
Don't worry too much.

255
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,430
Rest well and have a speedy recovery.

256
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,480
Xia Chu, thank you.

257
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,830
You're welcome.

258
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,150
Please take care of
Brigade Commander Dong.

259
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,600
I'll get going then.

260
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,990
Okay, you may get back to work.

261
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,270
[She's heading back to the site.]

262
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,220
[They've left. On the way back
to the drill site.]

263
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,870
Monitor!

264
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,240
What are
the Emergency Response Units we have?

265
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,710
We have a troop
to ensure the safety of the site,

266
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,630
a border brigade
and a Special Forces Brigade.

267
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,890
Besides that,

268
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,770
about ten members of
Commandos Team Thunder

269
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,640
which is Blue Team in the drill
are also with us.

270
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,160
The team is led by the captain,
Liang Mu Ze.

271
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,630
Tell the Emergency Response Units
to be ready.

272
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,350
The medical team and Liang Mu Ze

273
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,080
will go to the scene of the accident
with Commandos Team Thunder.

274
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,280
Contact the local police.

275
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,280
Find out the culprit and the vehicle.

276
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes!

277
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,510
Tian Yong.

278
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,070
Tian Yong!

279
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,710
Get up.

280
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,030
Tian Yong.

281
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,310
Get up.

282
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,720
I've missed you so badly.

283
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,760
♫ There's something about you
that makes me strangely addicted ♫

284
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,880
♫ I keep wanting to open my heart ♫

285
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,440
♫ Afraid of your anticipation,
some things cannot be repeated ♫

286
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,700
♫ We can't reject it
when fate chooses us ♫

287
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,680
♫ I'll hesitate when I get close,
I'll be sad if I miss it ♫

288
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,270
♫ Your lovely smile, your pure heart ♫

289
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,110
♫ Are irreplaceable ♫

290
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,960
♫ Accustomed to your presence ♫

291
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,740
♫ Being loved every moment ♫

292
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,450
♫ Until the day we meet ♫

293
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,290
♫ Can the missing companionship
instantly fulfil ♫

294
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,190
♫ Your love ♫

296
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,010
How is it going?

297
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,980
Are you okay?

298
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,560
I'm okay.

299
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,360
Xia Chu was abducted.

300
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,520
They were in a yellow truck.

301
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,930
Each of them was holding a weapon.

302
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,130
Where did they go?

303
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,240
They headed towards the town.

304
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,320
Koala, pass me the locator.

305
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,680
Are they heading towards the border?

306
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,690
They're going to the beach.

307
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,910
I think they're going to the open sea.

308
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,850
Inform the command centre

309
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,350
and request for helicopters.

310
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,430
Yes!

311
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,710
I'm...

312
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,640
-I'm part of...
-The People's Liberation Army of China.

313
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,190
I pledge...

314
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,520
I pledge...

315
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,080
to be loyal to the authority
of the Constitution,

316
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,160
to serve the people with integrity,

317
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,880
to obey orders, to be devoted to my duty,

318
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,650
to be disciplined, to keep secrets,

319
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,360
to be strong and fearless,

320
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,170
to practise hard
to master the military skills,

321
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,250
to be ready for battle at all time,

322
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,400
to never betray the military,

323
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,710
to defend the Motherland to the death...

324
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,550
Never betray the military.

325
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,190
Defend the Motherland to the death.

326
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,680
Never betray the military.

327
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,720
Salute!

328
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,510
Never betray the military.

329
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,950
Defend the Motherland to the death.

330
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,990
Never

331
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,590
betray

332
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,520
the military.

333
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,240
What do you want to say?

334
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,990
What?

335
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,350
When all hares are killed ,

336
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,550
the hounds will be stewed and eaten.

337
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,790
You...

338
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,110
Who are you?

339
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,280
Who am I?

340
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,790
Don't you know Zhuo Ran?

341
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,640
Both of you attended classes together,

342
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,480
went home together after school,

343
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,810
wandered around on bicycle,

344
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,270
and read detective novels.

345
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,000
Have you forgotten?

346
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,250
No.

347
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,630
You're not him.

348
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,480
He won't treat me like this.

349
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,000
Who are you?

350
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,790
You gave up on him first!

351
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,720
You chose Liang Mu Ze.

352
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,960
Zhuo Ran was so kind to you.

353
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,570
You're his dream.

354
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,280
However, you betrayed him

355
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,760
for a person who murdered him!

356
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,720
You deserve to die.

357
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,870
Easy.

358
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,280
Let me tell you.

359
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,870
You people owe him

360
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,120
everything that's happened today!

361
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,210
We don't have time for this.

362
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,650
We have to withdraw immediately.

363
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,840
Our boss is waiting for us
in the open sea.

364
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,640
Let's go.

365
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,270
No problem.

366
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,510
You have my permission.

367
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,950
Tell Liang Mu Ze

368
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,030
to spare no expense.

369
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,200
Rescue the hostage

370
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,550
before they flee to the open sea!

371
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,930
Attention!

372
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,440
This is the People's Liberation
Army of China.

373
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,690
Stop the boat now

374
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,200
for inspection.

375
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,410
Reporting to the control room.

376
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,410
Two speedboats are heading towards
an isolated island at region number five.

377
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,730
They might enter the deserted resort
on the island.

378
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,800
We're seeking permission
to go on the island.

379
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,870
Got it.

380
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,880
Inform Team Thunder

381
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,790
to be careful on the island.

382
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,920
Inform the public security bureau

383
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,320
to provide assistance.

384
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,370
Follow up now.

385
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,350
Yes!

386
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,310
We should be leaving here
as soon as possible.

387
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,130
Without evidence, the Chinese police

388
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,200
won't act rashly.

389
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,510
Do you want to bet?

390
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,040
Just give me a little more time

391
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,190
to finish with this deal.

392
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,970
We have a lot of pressure
from the Chinese.

393
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,600
They're asking us to hand
over their people.

394
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,440
I need an answer to everything.

395
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,950
Now, I can't wait any longer.

396
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,550
Answer what?

397
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,960
They destroyed our goods,

398
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,080
ruined my business

399
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,290
and dared to make trouble

400
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,430
in my place.

401
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,470
If they really want to play like this,

402
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,680
I'll play with them.

403
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,310
You're an outsider here.

404
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,400
You're a guest.

405
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,870
Next month,

406
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,110
Ba Ye will stand for re-election.

407
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,770
In the event that
the Chinese Police is involved

408
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,430
and getting international,

409
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,550
who would protect you?

410
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,260
Old Master.

411
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,480
Tian Yong escaped.

412
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,990
Old Master!

413
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,560
We've checked the CCTV recording.

414
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,000
Tian Yong didn't leave the mansion.

415
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,350
Go to the study room.

416
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,630
Master.

417
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,370
Master.

418
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,770
Please.

419
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,840
Please give me some.

420
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,310
Please.

421
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,760
Let me have a sip.

422
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,360
Go away!

423
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,350
Look at me.

424
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,390
How could I forget that

425
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,960
he serves no purpose anymore?

426
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,870
Come on!

427
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,360
This is the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.

428
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,520
You've been surrounded.

429
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,590
Surrender now!

430
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,400
Let's go.

431
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,510
I'll cover you.

432
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,520
Go to the rooftop.

433
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,370
Meeting point.

434
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,010
Okay.

435
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,150
-Move. Come on!
-Come on!

436
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,130
We're not going to surrender.

437
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,150
Backup is on the way.

438
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,310
You'll never catch us.

439
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,910
Come on!

440
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,050
I'm on the meeting place, the rooftop.

441
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,480
We need to hurry to get me out of here.

442
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,330
Don't move! Put the gun down!

443
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,400
Stay away or I'll kill her!

444
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,920
I said, put the gun down.

445
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,360
I'll shoot you!

446
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,880
Put your gun down!

447
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,860
Come on!

448
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,790
Don't move!

449
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,670
Stay away!

450
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,670
Go!

451
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,510
Come on!

452
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,330
Xia Chu.

453
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,550
Liang Mu Ze.

454
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,750
Xia Chu.

455
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,430
Hang in there. I'm coming.

456
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,000
Liang Mu Ze.

457
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,760
Liang Mu Ze.

458
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,080
Hang in there.

459
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,350
Liang Mu Ze, I can't take it anymore.

460
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,270
Don't be scared. Hang in there.

461
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,720
I'll count to three

462
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,190
and I'll come to you.

463
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,070
One, two, three!

464
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,920
You're safe.

465
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,990
Don't be scared.

466
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,450
Xia Chu.

467
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,710
We need to get up.

468
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,830
Okay?

469
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,560
Hold me tightly.

470
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,790
Hold me tightly and get up.

471
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,310
The steel wire is going to break.

472
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,290
Hold me tightly.

473
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,590
Let's jump to the other side.

474
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,950
Liang Mu Ze.

475
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,890
I can't do it.

476
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,110
You can do it.

477
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,670
Trust me.

478
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,800
-I can't do it.
-We don't have the time.

479
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,470
Do you trust me?

480
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,870
I'll catch you.

481
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,360
Trust me,

482
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,380
okay?

483
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:56,220
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

484
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,060
♫ Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you ♫

485
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,650
♫ If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

486
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,240
One, two, three!

487
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:12,380
♫ I can't remember when
I fell in love with you ♫

488
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:19,130
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

489
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,650
We're safe.

490
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,640
Xia Chu.

491
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:26,460
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

492
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,000
We're safe.

493
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:33,290
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

494
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,550
We're safe.

495
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:41,460
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

496
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,320
We're safe.

497
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,170
Liang Mu Ze, I want to be with you.

498
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,040
No matter where you go,
I want to be with you.

499
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,190
Okay.

500
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,070
No problem.

501
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,000
But you need to get up now.

502
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,640
Xia Chu, I can't take it anymore.

503
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,870
-No.
-Xia Chu.

504
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,160
You need to get up.
I can't take it anymore.

505
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,400
Captain!

506
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,190
Liang Mu Ze!

507
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,120
I'm fine.

508
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,430
It's just a small wound.

509
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,750
Liang Mu Ze!

510
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,760
Liang Mu Ze, get up!

511
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,440
Please take a look.

512
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,040
This is the entrance to Liang Village.

513
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,990
It's recorded by CCTV.

514
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,390
Pei Yu?

515
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,750
Is it okay?

516
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,720
Xia Chu.

517
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,670
It's me.

518
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,470
You're so beautiful.

519
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,190
Really?

520
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,950
I'm not as pretty as your tutor.

521
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,470
You're prettier than her.

522
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,390
Who is prettier,

523
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,550
me or the nurse in Isaia?

524
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,370
You're the prettiest.

525
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,040
You're pretty.

526
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,200
Of all the beauty in the world,

527
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,320
you're the 99 percent.

528
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,160
The remaining ladies

529
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,280
share the remaining one percent.

530
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,430
Can you imagine how pretty you are?

531
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,590
Liang Mu Ze.

532
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,910
How did you find me?

533
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,520
Take a guess.

534
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,480
In general, men who speak rhetorically

535
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,760
are experienced in love.

536
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,030
To be honest,

537
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,430
how many girlfriends did you have?

538
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,200
Where did you hear that theory?

539
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,630
Please answer my question.

540
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,470
Have you ever cooked spare rib soup?

541
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,400
Let me tell you.

542
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,550
Spare rib soup

543
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,750
has to be boiled on high heat first.

544
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,590
Then, cook it on low heat.

545
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,310
It'll take a few hours.

546
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,870
The longer it's cooked,
the better the taste.

547
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,800
You'll meet many people on the journey.

548
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,320
When a huge pot of soup

549
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,110
boils down to a small bowl,

550
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,200
the colour,

551
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,210
the taste,

552
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,560
and the nutrition value of the soup

553
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,320
are at their richest.

554
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,670
That bowl of soup is only for one person.

555
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,430
It's for you, Xia Chu.

556
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,710
Got it?

557
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,870
I'm that bowl of soup.

558
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,710
Just drink the soup.

559
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,190
Don't ask about the cooking process.

560
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,790
Captain Liang.

561
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,120
Why didn't I realise

562
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,390
you're so good at
saying cheesy pick up lines?

563
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,830
Who is the bewitcher between us?

564
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,430
It makes no difference.

565
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,040
No matter what, it's between us.

566
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,390
Listen.

567
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,000
Ever since

568
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,350
I fell asleep beside you defencelessly,

569
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,070
I knew that I'm doomed.

570
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,190
I'm doomed.

571
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,400
I, Liang Mu Ze,

572
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,470
will always belong to Xia Chu.
