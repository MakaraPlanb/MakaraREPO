00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,070
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,930
I still remember

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,020
the time he was unconscious,

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,280
he kept calling out Xia Chu's name.

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,770
When a man doesn't have you in his heart,

8
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,600
there's no point pushing it.

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,890
I'm not pushing it.

10
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm just trying to stop my own thoughts.

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,090
Xia Chu still doesn't know?

12
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,010
Here's an advice for you.

13
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,079
A friend's ex,

14
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,760
is like a used car
driven by your friend.

15
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,440
Avoid it at all cost.

16
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,730
It's too troublesome.

17
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,520
If you really want it,

18
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,410
then be honest with your friend upfront.

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,730
It'll save you both
from awkwardness in future.

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm speaking from experience.

21
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,370
Miss Gu, the scenery shot is done.

22
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,820
I'll show you the sample video
once it's ready.

23
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,600
If there're further ideas,
we can discuss more specifically.

24
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,570
Sure.

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,660
Thanks, Dr Zhang.

26
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,010
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,130
"A potential long-term partner."

28
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,010
Zhang Yi Chi, are you so desperate?

29
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,610
I'm single. Of course I am.

30
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,930
It's not like I cheat on my partner.

31
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,450
You're bringing this up again?

32
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,010
Are you going to hold onto this
for the rest of your life?

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,250
-Don't start with me.
-Hold on.

34
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,410
Your patient, Luo Xiao Jun

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,010
sent this postcard to the department.

36
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,050
I just saw it.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,210
I'm willing to offer my help

38
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,170
to your charity project.

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,490
I have no say in that charity project.

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,610
Please think of something to help me out.

41
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,970
Won't you help me, please?

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,660
I'm applying for
an overseas graduate school.

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,110
A background in innovative
scientific research

44
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,460
will improve my chances by a lot.

45
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,940
Why are you asking my help for everything?

46
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,060
That's your problem.

47
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm no longer obligated to help you.

48
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,940
You're the reason

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,550
I stayed here in the first place.

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,970
I don't even have a single friend here.

51
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,850
I have nobody to help me.

52
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,130
I don't know where to get help.

53
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,800
Fine.

54
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,690
I'll try to ask Director Chen later.

55
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,310
Thanks.

56
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,600
What are you doing?

57
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,850
She's insane.

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,450
I'm almost done.

59
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,550
I'll wait.

60
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,010
I mistook you for my colleague.

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,880
Xia Chu.

62
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,610
Are you feeling better?

63
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,610
Yes. I've recovered.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,140
Why are you here then?

65
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,500
To sign a contract.

66
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,510
I just met up with Dr Zhang and his peers.

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,980
Are you free tonight?

68
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,130
No, I'm not. I've made arrangements
with my friend.

69
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,580
It's Mi Gu, the one the other day...

70
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,970
She's meeting Dr Zhang later.

71
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,890
Didn't she tell you?

72
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,030
Maybe she sent a message.

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,090
But I haven't read it yet.

74
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,409
So you're free tonight then?

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,010
I'm off to settle some matters now.

76
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,420
Wait...

77
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,380
What happened?

78
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,450
Let me take a look at it?

79
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,770
I have to get help from the
IT department.

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,180
So how is it?

81
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,970
Can all the information be retrieved?

82
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,410
No problem. It's almost done.

83
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,240
Great.

84
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,230
But why did this happen suddenly?

85
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,130
Maybe it was a heat dissipation problem.

86
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,010
Also,

87
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,760
try not to open too many pages at once.

88
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,770
After work,

89
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,210
remember to switch off the computer.

90
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,790
Got it.

91
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,690
Okay.

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,720
It's done?

93
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,870
Thanks.

94
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,970
I really appreciate it.

95
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,330
What do you plan to have for dinner?

96
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm not done with my work yet.

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,170
I'll wait.

98
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,930
It's just dinner.

99
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,530
You'll have to eat after all, don't you?

100
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,110
Okay then.

101
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,090
Both your parents are in Dongan.

102
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,970
Your home is there too.

103
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,970
Why didn't you transfer
to the military hospital there?

104
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,610
After graduating from
military medical school,

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,040
I just went with the military order.

106
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,710
Or is it because

107
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,290
you know my home is in Ningjiang?

108
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,650
I've almost forgotten it.

109
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,770
I don't believe you.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,270
There are many good things in this world.

111
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,010
After we've experienced them,
it's hard to forget.

112
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,770
For example,

113
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,330
grilled eel.

114
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,610
For example,

115
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,530
you and me.

116
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,220
Hi there.

117
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,210
Where's the classroom for twelfth grade?

118
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,530
That way. The third classroom
after you turn left.

119
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,280
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,450
[I didn't dare drink too much water]

140
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,650
in case I missed you
if I went to the toilet.

141
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,620
I was afraid you couldn't find me

142
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,050
when you came back.

143
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,400
It's like the television dramas.

144
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,930
I didn't want to let you go that easily.

145
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,930
I waited until the shop closed,

146
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,250
but you never showed up.

147
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,770
And you never showed up since.

148
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,890
That won't happen again.

149
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,490
Xia Chu.

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,970
What makes you believe that

151
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,210
we have a future together?

152
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,570
Because you still care.

153
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,910
I'm over it.

154
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,820
If you really did,

155
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,600
you wouldn't have said those things.

156
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,620
Hi, my darlings.

157
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,490
I'm almost home.

158
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,830
I don't know why

159
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm so easily tired these days.

160
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,330
Maybe it's my age.

161
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,370
Really?

162
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,900
When women feel tired,

163
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,570
that's when they want to get married?

164
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,330
I think I need sleep more than

165
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,250
I need a husband in my life.

166
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,180
I'm entering the lift.

167
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,930
The connection might be bad inside.

168
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,010
How are you guys doing lately?

169
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,490
Did you miss me?

170
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,750
Miss.

171
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,300
You dropped your phone.

172
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,210
Do you remember me?

173
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,380
No, I don't.

174
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,650
It's me.

175
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,420
The other day,
we met in an alley

176
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,940
behind the hotel.

177
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,380
The night you went jogging.

178
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,570
Do you recall?

179
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,250
You've mistaken me for someone else.

180
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,980
I fell in love with you at first sight.

181
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,650
How can I mistake you for somebody else?

182
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,340
Why don't we be friends?

183
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,550
I know you're Mi Gu.

184
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,190
You're 32 years old and
your Chinese zodiac is a dragon.

185
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,630
You're a psycho.

186
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,550
Am I right?

187
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,330
Help. Help!

188
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,530
Who are you? Get your hands off her.

189
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,770
Get away, you psycho.

190
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,770
-Get away.
-Stop hitting me.

191
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,540
Xia Chu.

192
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,350
Forget it.

193
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,770
What's happened? Who is he?

194
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,450
A psycho.

195
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,540
Are you okay?

196
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,800
Yes.

197
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,480
Feeling better now?

198
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,990
Yes.

199
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,200
Drink with me.

200
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,690
I can't.
The hospital might call me anytime.

201
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,640
I'll have soda.

202
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,640
That one, please.

203
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,130
When did you come here?

204
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,220
Not too long ago.

205
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,000
I knocked but no one answered.

206
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,530
I also called but you didn't pick up.

207
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,970
I fell asleep waiting at the front door.

208
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,710
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,530
I was extremely busy today.

210
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,020
The shots that were done needed editing.

211
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,990
I get it.

212
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,140
-Workaholic. 
-And that's coming from you?

213
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,010
Speak for yourself, Dr Xia.

214
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,940
I don't have that sort of 
aesthetic capital like you do.

215
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,530
I can't afford to slack at all.

216
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,050
That's not true.

217
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,430
Such things are unreliable.

218
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,380
No matter how much aesthetic capital
one possesses,

219
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,900
it won't withstand the pull of gravity.

220
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,390
If I don't work hard now,

221
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,180
once I'm old and grey,

222
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,650
what can I survive on?

223
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,260
How was your date with Dr Zhang?

224
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,210
Zhuo Ran told me about it.

225
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,900
We just discussed about work over a meal.

226
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,090
It doesn't count as a date.

227
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,050
And you?

228
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,770
Did you have dinner with Zhuo Ran?

229
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,450
Do you still

230
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,500
have feelings for him?

231
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,730
We went for Japanese cuisine.

232
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,410
He knows what I like.

233
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,380
He knows I prefer

234
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,890
fresh ingredients,

235
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,690
plain dishes,

236
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,410
sweet and sour ones

237
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,320
and Ramune soda.

238
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,160
On the matter of food,

239
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,610
he knows all my preferences
very well.

240
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,210
That's great.

241
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,610
It would be if relationships are only

242
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,090
about three meals a day.

243
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,740
Isn't it so?

244
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't our daily habits often times

245
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,340
make up the most important aspects
of a relationship?

246
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,530
But i think that sometimes

247
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,180
commitment is more important
than love itself.

248
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,920
Cheers, Mi Gu.

249
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,680
It doesn't matter if love ever comes,

250
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,250
I'm all good as long as you are here.

251
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,530
I am here.

252
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,150
I'll definitely be here.

253
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,180
[From tonight until tomorrow,]

254
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,820
[most coastal regions of Dongan]

255
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,700
[will be continuously hit
by heavy rainstorms.]

256
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,650
[Various areas will be affected
by the flooding.]

257
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,170
[Notice on the recruitment of volunteers
for disaster relief]

258
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,650
Thanks, Xia Chu.

259
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,620
Xia Chu.

260
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,310
Look at these cakes. Pick one first.

261
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,700
Xia Chu. I want this matcha cake.

262
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,070
It looks so cute.

263
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,090
Settle down.

264
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,710
We've got to ask her something.

265
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,050
What's this about?

266
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,020
"To Xia Chu and all medical officers

267
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,140
of the Cardio Surgery Department,

268
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,730
have a great working day.

269
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,090
Yours truly, Zhuo Ran."

270
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,490
Who is Zhuo Ran?

271
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,090
Xia Chu, who is this Zhuo Ran?

272
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,860
He even knows

273
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,130
everyone's palates.

274
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,960
Did you tell him?

275
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,410
It seems like

276
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,010
that military officer is out of the game.

277
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,610
Xia Chu.

278
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,010
We've received the desserts.

279
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,050
Everyone enjoyed it.

280
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,619
Thank you.

281
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,770
Director Zhang.

282
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,180
Isn't the participation voluntary?

283
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,840
I don't want to go.

284
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,810
This is your job.

285
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,610
If everyone doesn't want to go,

286
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,790
what should we do about it?

287
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,310
But why must it be me?

288
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,290
I'll tell you why.

289
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,660
Many times before, when our sister unit

290
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,850
requested medical security,

291
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,820
every resident doctor has all participated

292
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,810
on rotational basis,

293
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,770
except you.

294
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,060
Remember,

295
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,320
we've all got to give back eventually.

296
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,420
Give me the medical records for ward 9.

297
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,530
But I...

298
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,650
I'll go.

299
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,890
You want to go to the flood-plagued areas?

300
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,870
Yes.

301
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,020
Forget it.

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,860
Your leg...

303
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,570
It's healed completely.

304
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,590
I should let you know.

305
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,480
A patient with heart failure
from emergency department

306
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,810
will undergo heart transplant next week.

307
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,010
Moreover, it will be done by the director.

308
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,980
He said that

309
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,500
all resident doctors

310
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,280
can be present for on-site observation.

311
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,640
Listen.

312
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,010
This is a rare opportunity

313
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,370
even for our hospital.

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,490
Are you still sure you want to go?

315
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,330
I'm sure.

316
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,930
In peaceful times like this,

317
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,810
experiences similar to being a war doctor

318
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,090
is quite rare too.

319
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,300
Alright then.

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,370
Make two photocopies,

321
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,790
fill them up

322
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
and the both of you submit them
to administration.

323
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,100
No, wait.

324
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,700
Do I still have to go
even when she's going?

325
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,290
She's going out of enlightenment.

326
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,770
You're going because it's your duty.

327
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,760
Stop staring at me with those big eyes.

328
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,890
What bad luck.

329
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,310
Reflecting it back to you.

330
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,450
[Which flooded area did
your handsome landlord go?]

331
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,850
[Will you meet him there?]

332
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,930
I don't know.

333
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,890
He said nothing about it when he left.

334
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,920
But special forces like his

335
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,940
will usually be the first
to arrive on site

336
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,330
but but the last to leave.

337
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,130
They're the first line of defence

338
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,050
and the last as well.

339
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,520
They just leap to where danger is.

340
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,330
They must be super courageous then.

341
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,540
Yes, that's right.

342
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,340
[So Liang Mu Ze's insomnia]

343
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,610
[is pretty tough on him.]

344
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,570
Why does something sound off.

345
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,170
[What is it?]

346
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,780
When you talked about him before,

347
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,780
you'd say he's strange,

348
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,850
doesn't sleep and how psychotic that is.

349
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
When have I?

350
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,110
[You're denying? You did say that.]

351
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,090
Fine, I'm hanging up now.

352
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,570
I've got to pack.

353
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,660
Remember to come pick Er Miao up.

354
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,350
I'll be gone for quite some time.

355
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,370
I can't let it stay all alone at home.

356
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,220
Got it.

357
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,530
Hanging up now, bye.

358
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,850
Alright.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,790
[Er Miao.]

360
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,410
[Should I bring Liang Mu Ze]

361
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,130
[some medicine to help him sleep?]

362
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,540
Let's do this.
If you meow twice, I'll bring it.

363
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,170
If you meow once, I won't.

364
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,450
You get to decide.

365
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,930
Hey, you have to meow twice.

366
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,930
Meow.

367
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,870
Alright then.
I'll get the medicine.

368
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,000
[You can do it, Liang Mu Ze.]

369
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,340
I'll take a head count.

370
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,730
We'll move out once everybody is here.

371
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,760
Has everyone arrived?

372
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

374
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,250
It's okay. You arrived just in time.

375
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,860
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.

376
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,730
To the left, march.

How are you?

384
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,770
Here.

385
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,350
Hang in there.

386
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,240

387
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,090
Let me check.

388
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,400
Another 50 over kilometres to go.

389
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,440
What happened?

390
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,680
I've never done an operation yet.

391
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,140
I don't want to die.

392

Is everyone okay?

393
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,850
We're fine.

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,550
-What happened?

395

Are you okay?

396
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,710
I've cleaned your uniform

397
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,890
and placed it in the bus.

398
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,960
Have some water.

399
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,200
No, thanks.

400
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,980
If you have something to say,
just say it.

401
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,860
Stop pretending to be generous.

402
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,470
You stop pretending to be petty too.

403
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,770
Me?

404
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,600
At the moment of danger just now,

405
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,000
I heard you scream out

406
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,730
not wanting to die

407
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,610
because you haven't taken on
the operating table yet.

408
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,020
At that moment,

409
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,930
I decided to forgive

410
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,260
all your peculiar, selfish

411
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,010
and petty behaviours in the past.

412
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,070
It's because I know

413
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,760
you want to be a good doctor

414
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,240
like me.

415
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,780
Peculiar, selfish and petty?

416
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,680
Listen here, Xia Chu.

417
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,540
Just because I hugged you back there
doesn't mean that

418
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,380
you get to say all that to me.

419
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,230
I'll not accept that.

420
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,390
Why is it taking so long to change a tyre?

421
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,170
Do you need help, sir?

422
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,830
I can't change it. My tools won't work.

423
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,610
Then what should we do?

424
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,800
Stop.

425
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,630
Stop, stop. We need help!

We need help.

428
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,970
What's the matter?

429
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,860
Our tyre got punctured.

430
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,610
My tools can't repair it.

431
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,060
-Tian Yong.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,900
Get our men to help.

433
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,660
Yes, sir.

434
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,210
Grab the jack lift.

435
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,980
You had them come over to help?

436
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,420
You think I’m capable of that?

437
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,130
What's the matter?

438
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,090
Sir, are you okay? Where does it hurt?

439
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,760
Come over and help get him on the truck.

440
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,520
One, two, up.

441
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,210
His blood pressure has
plunged to 60/90mmHg.

442
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,570
Heartbeat is at 105.

443
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,860
You two are the only doctors

444
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,020
from the Cardiac Surgery Department.

445
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,330
Think about something.

446
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,770
What should we do?

447
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,850
I don't know.

448
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,190
How's it?

449
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,660
Can he be saved?

450
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,380
I said I don't know!

451
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,740
Close those blinds now.

452
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,060
Have your men block the road

453
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,250
to prevent further accidents.

454
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,970
His blood pressure is still falling.

455
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,610
Could it be myocardial ischaemia?

456
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,820
No, his heart rate indicated

457
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,650
a lot of blood in the pericardial cavity.

458
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,730
It could be acute haemopneumothorax.

459
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,530
-We can inject dopamine.
-No.

460
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,110
Dopamine and noradrenaline could increase

461
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,210
myocardial oxygen consumption.

462
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,120
You two have to give him an operation.

463
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,010
But I've never seen
this operation done before.

464
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
This remote place

465
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,690
has no signal at all.

466
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,930
What if we send him back
to the station first?

467
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,900
We'll figure it out after that.

468
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,250
He won't make it.

469
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,370
His pulse is already very weak.

470
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,010
You'll need to open his pericardial cavity

471
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,100
and identify the location of the bleeding.

472
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,690
Who's going to do it? Quickly now.

473
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,440
No, it can't be done here.

474

479
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,130
Yes.

480
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,710
This road is blocked.

481
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,610
Go that way.

482
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,570
That way.

484
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,960
Have you found the location of bleeding?

485
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,990
Remove the excess blood.

486
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,900
The patient is in shock.

487
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,980
Quick, administer the
anti-shock treatment.

488
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,260
Suction.

489
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,570
I found the location of bleeding.

490
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,150
Get ready to stitch the wound.

491
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,940
Trust yourself. You can do it.

492
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,890

Where did she go?

556
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,970
Her hospital formed a medical team

557
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,610
for the flood relief.

558
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,790
No wonder she didn't answer my calls
these days.

559
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,130
The calls never went through.

560
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,260
Rural areas tend to have bad signal.

561
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,490
Moreover, there's the heavy downpour too.

562
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,980
It's normal that the calls
can't get through.

563
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,240
Please don't worry yourselves too much.

564
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,040
You've always been in contact

565
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,680
with Xia Chu?

566
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,150
Yes.

567
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,110
I heard that you left for some time.

568
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,380
That's true.

569
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,130
My mother was sick.

570
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,710
During senior year of high school,
her condition worsened.

571
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,610
After that, a distant relative

572
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,570
introduced her to an overseas doctor.

573
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,290
I left in quite a hurry.

574
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,700
That's why I didn't manage

575
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,250
to properly say goodbye to Xia Chu.

576
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,010
How is your mother doing now?

577
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,810
She's dependent on medicine.

578
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,780
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,090
It must be hard to talk about.

580
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,210
No, it's fine.

581
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,610
In fact I've been keeping it inside
for quite sometime.

582
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,970
It's kind of a relief for me

583
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,380
to have shared it with you.

584
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,340
Anyway,

585
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,570
how are you and Uncle Xia doing?

586
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,540
We're both fine.

587
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,770
I read on the international news online

588
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,740
that Uncle Xia and his team

589
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,330
had some new research findings.

590
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,630
You don't seem too concerned

591
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,300
with Uncle Xia's work?

592
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,830
It's not that.

593
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,980
There are many people
who are concerned about his work.

594
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,620
For me, the real concern

595
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,770
is whether he has taken
his three meals everyday

596
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,090
or if he's eating well.

597
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,630
What more can a husband ask for
with such a loving wife?

598
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,190
Xia, when did you came home?

599
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,570
Last night.

600
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,430
I was afraid to wake you up.

601
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,100
So I slept in the study instead.

602
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,460
Look at you.

603
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,480
You haven't eaten, have you?

604
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,810
Don't worry.

605
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,170
I'm leaving soon.

606
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,200
So soon?

607
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,540
You spend a night home

608
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,030
just to leave again next morning?

609
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,490
Why come back in the first place?

610
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,020
I had to use the toilet.

611
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,800
What's wrong with saying that?

612
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,950
You know I'm very particular
with the toilet I use.

613
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,840
I had constipation for days.

614
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,770
Last night, I suddenly had an urge to go.

615
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,050
So I came home to give it a go.

616
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,570
Did it go well?

617
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,860
This is Xia Chu's friend, Zhuo Ran.

618
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,060
I meant the experiment.

619
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,390
I heard the conversation between you two.

620
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,610
Back then, my daughter shed

621
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,410
quite a lot of tears for you.

622
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,350
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,200
I won't let it happen again.

624
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,450
Thanks for visiting us.

625
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,690
If you're trying to impress Xia Chu

626
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,460
by going through us,

627
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,690
it probably won't work.

628
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,810
I'm going to wash up now.

629
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,160
Hopefully once I'm done,

630
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,450
you've already left

631
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,700
along with your gifts.

632
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,470
[Dongan University Parking Permit]

633
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,450
Xia.

634
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,860
Did you know that Xia Chu
went to the frontline

635
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,460
for the flood relief work?

636
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,400
Has that wild brat ever

637
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,330
told us anything?

638
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,260
But it's good for her too.

639
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,970
Good? I beg your pardon?

640
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,970
She's a military doctor.

641
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,250
It will give her
valuable field experience.

642
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,440
So she's a military doctor,
but not your daughter?

643
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,730
She's a single young lady.

644
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,440
Flood relief is dangerous work.

645
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,400
I can't ignore it.

646
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,700
I'll have to get my father

647
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,480
to transfer her back here.

648
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,260
She's just drifting from place to place

649
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,370
and it worries me.

650
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,010
He doesn't need to get involved
in my daughter's matter.

651
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,350
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,330
He's Xia Chu's grandpa
and your father-in-law.

653
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,970
But he was never fond of me.

654
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,040
I got it, Director Zhang.

655
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,420
Okay, got it.

656
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,600
Why haven't you left?

657
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,790
I needed to answer a phone call.

658
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,390
Professor Xia.

659
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,020
Can I be of any help?

660
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,810
I saw a few kids

661
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,850
running around with some scissors.

662
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,760
Where did they go?

663
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,770
My ride just arrived at the main entrance.

664
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,390
Are you heading back
to the research institute?

665
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,780
I'm on my way to the airport.

666
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,040
I can give you a ride.

667
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,160
It's hard to hail a cab at this hour.

668
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,130
What kind of job are you doing now?

669
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,550

670
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,700

This is my business card.
Please take it.

677
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,120
It's unlikely that

we'll have any business dealings.

arriving in the afternoon.

Yes.

We're finally done
with this horrible place.

688
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,390
But, this horrible place turns out to be

689
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,120
an integral milestone
for Xia Chu's profession.

690
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,400
Isn't that right, Xia Chu?

691
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,210
Although I appreciate the chance
to act as a chief surgeon,

692
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,330
I'd rather hope

in the first place.

can't do anything about him.
