[Episode 31]

4
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,570
Just let me go in.

5
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm Liang Mu Ze's sister.

6
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,580
Sorry. We have a rule here.

7
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,210
No visitors are allowed these few days.

8
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,770
Liang Mu Ze is really my brother!

9
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,500
Don't you have a phone there?

10
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,930
Just call him.

11
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,130
Xiao Teng!

12
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,650
Xiang Yang!

13
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,310
Where are they going?

14
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,780
Is there a mission?

15
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,650
Could you say something, brother?

16
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,530
[Hi,]

17
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,730
[the number you have dialled

Xue.

19
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,290
I'm here to see Tian Yong.

20
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,579
I know.

21
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,690
Where is he?

22
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,660
Xue,

23
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,130
take this parrot home.

24
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm busy recently,

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,860
I don't have time to look after it.

26
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,610
Who told you to do so?

27
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,180
Our OK

28
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,860
will be looked after by Tian Yong,

29
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,890
right?

30
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,980
He left our team.

31
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,900
Who?

32
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,870
Tian Yong.

33
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,660
Where did he go?

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,770
No idea.

35
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,230
But Xiao Teng and Xiang Yang

36
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,170
were inside those cars which passed by.

37
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,280
He wasn't in the vehicle.

38
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,970
Where is he?

39
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,090
I don't know.

40
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,510
Did

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,440
something happen to him?

42
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,480
No.

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,640
Where should I find him?

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,130
Xue,

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,420
right now,

46
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,450
some people stay,

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,040
some have been transferred,

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,010
some have left the unit.

49
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,340
As to where Tian Yong has gone to,

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,570
I really have no idea.

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,530
Bring it home.

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,220
I gave this parrot

53
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,090
to Tian Yong to look after it.

54
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,430
If he wants to return it to me,

55
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,890
ask him to see me.

56
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,330
It won't be so fast.

57
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,770
They have to ask the boss
behind the scene.

58
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,930
Here.

59
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,980
How do you feel

60
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,450
about your new identity?

61
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,770
It feels like living another life.

62
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,930
I don't know where the destination is,

63
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,610
nor do I know how to get there.

64
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,570
I'm scared.

65
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,250
Scared that you won't get the hang of it?

66
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,130
I'm scared there's no going back.

67
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,770
[They took the bait.]

68
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,330
[They'll meet us
at the cruise ship nightclub tonight.]

69
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,580
[According to the information we got,]

70
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,660
[Scary Pirate will enter our country
through secret channels.]

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,320
[They might be there too.]

72
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,570
[The cruise is divided into three levels]

73
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,610
[with six exits.]

74
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,900
[Our men will disguise as tourists]

75
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,010
[and stand guard at different spots.]

76
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,490
[The action team
is on standby on nearby ships]

77
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,120
[and is responsible
of tracking and assisting.]

78
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,330
Tian Yong.

79
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,130
Sir,

80
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,050
follow that car.

81
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,130
[Sorry,]

82
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,250
[the number you have dialled
is not reachable.]

83
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,780
Sir, please speed up,

84
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,330
follow that car in front of us.

85
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,730
I'll try my best.

86
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,970
The price of that car

87
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,130
is equal to two of my car.

88
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,730
A car seems to be following us.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,370
It might be them.

90
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,000
Just ignore it.

91
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,500
My friend is there.

92
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,580
Let me go in.

93
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,460
Friends are not allowed either.

94
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,930
You need a ticket to enter.
Please get a ticket.

95
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,490
[They've boarded the cruise.]

96
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,620
Jiu, we meet again.

97
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,190
Come. Please.

98
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,360
I told you,

99
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,890
I'd come see you again.

100
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,810
By the way, let me introduce to you

101
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,580
my associate.

102
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,540
He's Jiu.

103
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,080
Jiu.

104
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,990
Take a seat.

105
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,110
Where's the owner?

106
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,070
Hang on.

107
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,650
Jiu,

108
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,600
I keep thinking

109
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,500
that you are very familiar.

110
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,810
I just came out from the police station,

111
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,810
309 Xingfu Road.

112
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,040
What's wrong?

113
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,670
Were you there too?

114
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,210
No.

115
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,260
I know.

116
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,410
He's here.

117
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,700
He's in the private room.

118
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,850
Let's go down.

119
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,230
Please forgive us,

120
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,770
rumours have been flying about recently.

121
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,260
It is better

122
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,850
if we're more mindful.

123
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,610
Jiu, please.

124
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,970
[Rao Zhi, they're coming down.]

125
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,930
I finally found you.

126
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,880
I finally found you.

127
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,370
You got the wrong person.

128
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,540
Do you know her?

129
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,810
Attention to all units,

130
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,670
there is an unexpected situation.

131
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,530
Maybe I met her in some club.

132
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,820
Is that so?

133
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,330
Not bad, Hai.

134
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,300
I know you.

135
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,610
It was you!

136
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,260
Qiang,

137
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,560
[find a way to take Rao Zhi's daughter
away from there.]

138
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,130
Tian Yong, make her leave!

139
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,610
It was you, wasn't it?

140
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,450
I've been searching for you for so long!

141
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,910
You're a jerk!

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,340
I know you!

143
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,880
Jerk!

144
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,530
It might hurt a little.

145
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,460
I'm here to see Tian Yong.

146
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,670
Where is he?

147
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,020
He left our team.

148
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,050
Where did he go?

149
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,050
No idea.

150
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,660
Did something happen to him?

151
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,490
As to where Tian Yong has gone to,

152
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,730
I really have no idea.

153
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,720
I have a gift for you.

154
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,010
What is it?

155
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,260
I made you another bulletproof vest.

156
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,420
Promise me,

157
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,250
put it on whenever you go out,

158
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,440
all right?

159
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,490
Jiu,

160
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,330
what is this?

161
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,280
How dare you carry a gun

162
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,630
when you're making a deal with me?

163
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,250
What do you want?

164
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,930
Jiu,

165
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm doing this for our safety.

166
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,070
Hai,

167
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,520
call off the deal.

168
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,200
Take care of it yourself.

169
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,230
Jiu,

170
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm really sorry.

171
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,330
We've come to the final step.

172
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,770
Let's go.

173
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,250
Jiu, I'm sorry.

174
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,330
Okay, I got it.

175
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,610
I'll see to it immediately.

176
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,810
Go to the hospital now

177
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,340
and support the doctor
for emergency rescue.

178
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,060
Report the progress to me at all times.

179
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,030
Yes.

180
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,020

Then, please sign your name.

188

Don't worry,

189
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,090
just leave it to us.

Old Master.

192
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,250
Got it.

193
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,320
When is he coming?

194
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,390
The owner won't be here today.

195
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,870
By tomorrow afternoon,

196
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,310
transfer the payment

197
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,180
to the owner's overseas account.

198
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,660
Once he gets the money,

199
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,890
your stock will be shipped right away.

200
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,130
What will happen after that?

201
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,040
If this deal goes well,

202
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,410
you will meet the owner very soon.

203
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,390
Tell him.

204
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,400
Stop fooling us around

205
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,150
or you will not be able
to leave Ningjiang City.

206
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,020
They left.

207
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,180
Follow them closely.

208
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,130
♫ Looking for a plain
and comfortable clothes ♫

209
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,290
♫ To replace
the thicker and heavier makeup♫

210
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,740
♫ I can see the gaze of the passersby ♫

211
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,280
♫ But I can't see the wound on my back ♫

212
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,380
♫ Poets describe life
as a long and bumpy road ♫

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,370
♫ People in this world are wondering
what kind of life they want ♫

214
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,720
♫ Expecting everyone
to be wise is just too much ♫

215
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,340
♫ Either stupid or run away from it ♫

216
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,920
♫ The dark night tells
who is more serious ♫

217
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,200
♫ Those dark and naive eyes are stuck
amidst the neon lights ♫

218
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,850
[Rao Zhi,
Xue is undergoing emergency treatment.]

219
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,740
Copy that.

220
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,570
♫ Just a small pause
makes everything impossible ♫

221
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,580
♫ A little regret, a little impassive ♫

222
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,490
Go back to the villa first.

223
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,530
They might contact you anytime soon.

224
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,060
Mu Ze.

225
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,050
Uncle Rao.

226
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,810
Xue is still under treatment.

227
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,430
Chief,

228
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,360
Xue's stuff are at the nurse's station.

229
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,860
Please collect them.

230
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,030
Okay, I'll take care of it.

231
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,900
Doctor,

232
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,330
how is the patient?

233
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,640
Has the patient
had any external impact before?

234
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,360
Luckily there's no fatal injury.

235
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,430
We gave her a closed chest drainage,

236
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,480
and the Trauma Center

237
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,310
also relocated
and fixed her injured ribs.

238
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,050
Her condition is more stable now.

239
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,200
We'll let her take anti-inflammatory drugs

240
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,330
and observe her condition.

241
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,450
If she can recover,

242
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,040
she doesn't need to undergo surgery.

243
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,570
Can I go in and see her?

244
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,380
Please wait,

245
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,210
we'll transfer her
into Intensive Care Unit first.

246
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,630
Thank you.

247
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,000
She's still in coma.

248
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,660
Yes. Judging from her condition,

249
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,170
she's no longer in danger.

250
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,090
Rao Zhi has arrived just now.

251
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,190
Yes.

252
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,720
Yes.

253
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,510
Thank you, sir.

254
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,760
She was shot, wasn't she?

255
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,460
Luckily the vest saved her.

256
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,160
It was an accident.

257
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,600
If it was just an accident,

258
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,710
you wouldn't have asked
all the medical staff

259
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,750
to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

260
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,370
Since you've signed the agreement,

261
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,880
just lay this matter to rest.

262
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,730
Don't tell anyone.

263
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,730
I know.

264
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm a doctor,

265
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,680
and also a soldier.

266
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,210
I have the courage

267
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,890
to bear the whole truth.

268
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,470
I trust you.

269
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,530
Thank you, Xia Chu.

270
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,640
♫ I don't remember when I fell for you ♫

271
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,570
♫ I'm afraid of losing you someday ♫

272
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,770
However, Liang Mu Ze,

273
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,690
promise me.

274
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
Don't make me
perform emergency rescue on you,

275
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,690
okay?

276
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,920
I promise you.

277
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,430
It definitely won't happen.

278
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,170
Will you stay here to take care of Xue?

279
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll leave after her mother gets here.

280
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,680
Before redeployment,

281
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,940
how many more times can we meet?

282
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,210
I don't know.

283
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,390
I have to go back to work.

284
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,860
Observe the patient's ECG monitor
at all time.

285
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,880
If the alarm goes off,

286
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,830
inform the doctor immediately.

287
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,870
Got it. Thank you, doctor.

288
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,840
You're welcome.

289
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,090
Miss Bai,

290
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,490
pay attention
to the patient's temperature.

291
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,610
If it exceeds 39 degrees Celsius,

292
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,680
inform me right away.

293
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,910
Dr Xia.

294
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,170
The drip is finished,

295
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,400
but there are rashes on her hands.

296
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,690
There's no chest tightness.

297
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,030
What should we do now?

298
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,440
Inject 5mg of Dexamethasone.

299
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,680
-Pay close attention.
-Okay.

300
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,050
If you feel unwell,

301
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,850
tell me immediately.

302
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,920
I will.

303
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,000
Dr Xia,

304
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:39,960
I have a question.

305
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,470
When can my father get admitted?

306
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,460
Calm down.

307
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,820
A doctor from the respiratory department
will be here for consultation in a while.

308
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,900
Alright, thank you, doctor.

309
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,870
Xia Chu.

310
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,080
Director Song.

311
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,100
Xia Chu,

312
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,060
Director Chen of Cardiac Surgery
asked you to report to him.

313
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,360
Do I go there now?

314
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,440
Go on.

315
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,160
Thank you, Director Song.

316
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,960
Dr Xia.

317
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,280
Dr Zhang,

318
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,770
what's the matter?

319
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,070
Allow me to introduce to you,

320
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,290
Dr Xia.

321
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,540
Nice to meet you, Dr Xia.

322
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,140
Nice to meet you.

323
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,690
What is going on?

324
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,970
Didn't the pregnant woman
who had a haemorrhage

325
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,190
pass away?

326
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,980
None of the babies's family
came to pick them up.

327
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,790
Then,

328
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,870
the welfare home
just notified two adoptive families.

329
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,500
They're here to pick up the babies.

330
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,990
They learned that you're the doctor

331
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,090
of the babies,

332
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,690
so they insisted to thank you
for saving their lives

333
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,350
before leaving.

334
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,660
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr Xia.

335
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,660
You're welcome.

336
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,810
This is my duty as a doctor.

337
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,690
Have the children passed
all the evaluations?

338
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,210
Yes, they have.

339
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,520
Although this twins

340
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,720
look exactly the same,

341
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,350
their personalities are very different.

342
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,970
One of them cries a lot,

343
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,200
another one is quiet.

344
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,470
Do both of you live near each other?

345
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,880
We'll migrate very soon.

346
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,430
It's about time.

347
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,730
Let's pick up the babies.

348
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,460
We'll get going now.

349
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,250
Sure, take care.

350
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,100
[Although this twins]

351
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,230
[look exactly the same,]

352
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,940
[their personalities are very different.]

353
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,510
[One of them cries a lot,]

354
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,860
[another one is quiet.]

355
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,480
[When I was sorting out
the old videotapes]

356
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,550
[in the data room today]

357
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,310
I noticed that the son of a drug dealer

358
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,970
looked exactly like Zhuo Ran.

359
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,020
[Based on your current condition,]

360
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,250
[I can conclude]

361
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,900
[that your light-headedness]

362
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,930
and chest pain

363
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,810
are caused

364
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,890
by stress cardiomyopathy.

365
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,440
Stress cardiomyopathy?

366
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,940
You have always been very healthy.

367
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,490
You even planned
to join the military academy.

368
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,410
[Why would you have
stress cardiomyopathy?]

369
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,550
[Xia Chu,]

370
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,140
you're living under the same roof

371
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,660
with this kind of man.

372
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,630
Aren't you scared?

373
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,700
How did you know?

374
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,540
What?

375
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,480
I have never told you

376
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,620
that I'm staying in Liang Mu Ze's house.

377
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,170
How did you know that?

378
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,350
It was Mi Gu.

379
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,580
She told me everything.

380
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,730
The test result of that medicine came out.

381
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,760
I know.

382
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,650
It was
a 3D printed traditional Chinese medicine.

383
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,810
Did Zhang Yi Chi tell you that?

384
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,570
No, it was Zhuo Ran.

385
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,800
Zhuo Ran told you that?

386
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,170
[He asked his assistant
to get the pills for him,]

387
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,580
[but his assistant made a mistake.]

388
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,010
Let me show you something.

389
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,060
This...

390
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,940
I realized my pills had been swapped,

391
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,610
so I took it for a test.

392
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,960
[That's normal, right?]

393
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,220
[Dr Zhang, something is wrong
with the pills you gave me.]

394
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,380
[Our initial investigation suggests]

395
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,560
[that the death of the deceased]

396
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,510
[could be accomplished by himself.]

397
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,970
This is a plastic gun.

398
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,640
It's 3D printed.

399
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,780
Hey, girl.

400
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,210
Mi Gu,

401
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,850
regarding the videotape
you mentioned last time,

402
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,480
do you still have it?

403
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,720
[Yes.]

404
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,250
Could you take a picture of the son

405
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,020
of the drug dealer for me?

406
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,220
[I just want to take a look.]

407
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,410
Hang on, I'll search for it.

408
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,730
Sure.

409
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,050
[Why do you need it all of a sudden?]

410
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,570
I'm just curious.

411
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,610
They do look similar.

412
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,970
I'd buy it if you told me they were twins.

413
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,920
[Did you ask Zhuo Ran?]

414
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,850
About what?

415
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,650
Whether he has a twin brother?

416
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,840
How is that possible?

417
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,790
He's the only child.

418
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,430
Did you find it, Mi Gu?

419
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,080
It's gone.

420
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,720
It's really gone.

421
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,540
Could you have gotten the wrong person?

422
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,490
It's possible.

423
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,320
[Say something, Rao Feng.]

424
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,210
Can you...

425
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,610
Can you come back?

426
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,590
[What's up?]

427
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,210
It's about Xiao Xue.

428
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,720
[Xiao Xue? What happened to her?]

429
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,370
She's injured.

430
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,540
You might need you to take care of her.

431
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,430
[Okay,]

432
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,910
[I'll buy the ticket now.]

433
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,580
Sorry, I...

434
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,430
Uncle Rao,

435
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,490
did you collect Xue's stuff?

436
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,960
[Yes.]

437
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,910
[By the way, Mu Ze,]

438
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,280
[your aunt]

439
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,200
[bought the earliest flight ticket today.]

440
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,710
She'll fly from Los Angeles to Beijing.

441
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,130
She should be here at noon tomorrow.

442
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,770
As for the exact schedule,

443
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,920
she didn't tell me.

444
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,630
Sure, I'll contact her.

445
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,610
Thank you.

446
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,810
Uncle Rao.

447
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,650
Don't worry, Mu Ze.

448
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,170
I'm fine.

449
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,960
How is she doing?

450
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,520
Do you know what this is?

451
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,380
Dyneema bulletproof vest.

452
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,340
The bullet did not penetrate it.

453
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,700
The bullet did not penetrate it.

454
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,890
I gave it for her.

455
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,240
You knew her?

456
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,210
Why are you so sure that she'd wear this?

457
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,130
When I pushed her away,

458
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,820
she gave me a hint.

459
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,010
Besides, I told her

460
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,520
that she must

461
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,130
always put this on.

462
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,710
Were you so sure

463
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,130
that it'd block your bullet?

464
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,540
I deal with them all the time.

465
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,650
Bulletproof vests and bullets,

466
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,300
spears

467
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,450
and shields.

468
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,580
What if you missed?

469
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,960
I have never missed.

470
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:27,969
I'm sorry, Rao Zhi.

471
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,159
Don't apologise.

472
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,489
What you did today was not wrong.

473
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,679
The only problem is

474
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,010
she's my daughter.

475
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,540
I understand.

476
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,870
Go take a rest.

477
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,740
When did you find out
that he wouldn't come?

478
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,950
When I received that phone call,

479
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,740
I learned about it
the same time you did.

480
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,760
Haven't you heard of anything before that?

481
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,010
If I wanted to deceive you,

482
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,950
I wouldn't have agreed

483
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,530
to meet you at this time.

484
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,880
Do you think you can run away?

485
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,100
Why did he bail on us?

486
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,620
He has doubts.

487
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,160
Even if he has only one percent doubt,

488
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,270
he still won't meet you.

489
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,380
Has he entered the country?

490
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,450
No.

491
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,520
What channel will you guys use

492
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,760
to process the money you got yesterday?

493
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,120
You mean 'they'.

494
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,260
Antique auctions,

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,670
illegal insurance,

496
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,380
online gambling and finance,

497
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,730
anything that you can think of.

498
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,300
Make an appointment for me to meet him.

499
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,570
When are you going to save my mother?

500
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,980
Are you trying to bargain with me?

501
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,850
Give me an exact time.

502
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,190
We have no rights to enforce law overseas.

503
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,050
We can only request
the support of Interpol

504
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,350
and local police.

505
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,260
When?

506
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,020
We're contacting them.

507
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,290
Tell me when!

508
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,770
Once we get solid proof,

509
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,120
they will take action.

510
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,280
But my mother can't wait any more!

511
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,600
Then you'd better behave yourself.

512
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,240
Give us full cooperation.

513
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,930
Wait for my update.

514
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,900
Don't worry about it, chief.

515
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,940
I must attend Ke Wei's funeral.

516
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,380
I'm almost there.

517
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,740
See you later.

518
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,980
Demon!

519
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,590
Who's there?

520
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,110
Who's there?

521
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,420
Who's over there?

522
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,440
Show yourself!

523
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,530
Director Mi!

524
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,410
Director Mi!

525
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,980
Director Mi!

526
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,320
Demon!

527
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,470
Demon!

528
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,910
I'll kill you!

529
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll kill you!

530
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,140
Go to hell!

531
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,370
Give me back my husband!

532
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,420
Give me back my husband!

533
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,010
Give me back my husband!

534
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,180
I'll kill you!

535
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,340
I'll kill you!

536
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,770
Help!

537
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,680
Help!

538
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,770
-Help!
-I'll kill you!

539
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,460
Kill you! Kill you!

540
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,790
Go to hell!

541
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,430
Director Mi!

542
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,550
Help!

543
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,740
Help!

544
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,060
I'll kill you!

545
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,070
Go to hell!

546
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,990
Stop!

547
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,920
She's up there!

548
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,000
Hurry, hurry up!

549
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,010
Hurry up!

550
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,170
Go to hell, demon!

551
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,930
Stop it!

552
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,970
Pull them apart!

553
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,740
Let me go!

554
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,850
Ms Mi.

555
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,490
Ms Mi, are you all right?

556
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,340
Take her away!

557
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,860
Director Mi.

558
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,330
Ms Mi, drink some tea.

559
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,330
She's quite pitiful.

560
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,070
Eight years ago,

561
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,770
she married into our village.

562
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,430
Few days after the wedding,

563
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,710
something bad happened in our village.

564
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
What's wrong with you?

565
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,760
Director Mi finally came here.

566
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,810
Your illness hadn't relapsed for so long.

567
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,120
Why today?

568
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,720
The entire family of her husband died.

569
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,090
She's the only one alive.

570
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,660
She survived,

571
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,580
but something's wrong with her brain.

572
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,460
Even her own family won't take her in.

573
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,690
Eight years ago?

574
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,340
By something bad,

575
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,610
do you mean

576
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,320
the military and police joint drug bust?

577
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,300
Yes.

578
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,540
She was shocked by the gunshot

579
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,010
and lost her mind.

580
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,480
All these years, she still can't move on.

581
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,470
Whenever she sees anyone or anything

582
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,170
related to the drug bust,

583
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,550
her illness will relapse.

584
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,410
Anyway, it's strange.

585
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,690
You have nothing to do with it at all.

586
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,140
Why would her illness relapse
as soon as she saw you?

587
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,170
Wan,

588
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,570
everything is fine now. You can leave now.

589
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,560
Sure, sure.

590
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,180
It's over now. Don't be scared.

591
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,700
It wasn't me.

592
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,920
It wasn't me.

593
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,390
I really didn't mean it.

594
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,100
I didn't mean it.

595
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,670
It was that jinx.

596
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,450
It was that jinx.

597
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,270
He dragged my husband into that.

598
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,830
He said it was just one puff,

599
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,170
but it tore our family apart.

600
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,990
I told him

601
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,150
not to go to that stupid factory any more,

602
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,680
but he wouldn't listen.

603
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,630
He wanted to go,

604
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,090
and dragged my in-laws with him.

605
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,230
He said he'd earn all the money

606
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,730
he spent on drugs.

607
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,170
It was that jinx.

608
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,020
That jinx brought disaster upon us.

609
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,570
He brought disaster upon us.

610
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,340
The jinx is...

611
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,240
It was the man

612
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,180
who ran the drug factory in our village,

613
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,440
Pei Yong Yan.

614
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,550
He's a demon.

615
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,950
He's a sinner!

616
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,130
I won't let him off.

617
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,540
I won't let him off!

618
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,860
Calm down.

619
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,660
[Demon!]

620
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,750
You're a demon!

621
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,100
Why did you come back here?

622
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,210
Our village is miserable because of you!

623
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,800
Does Pei Yong Yan

624
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,930
have a child?

625
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,810
Yes.

626
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,980
How does he look like?

627
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,960
Well...

628
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,510
I don't know how to describe him.

629
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,600
Is that him?

630
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,630
He looks like him.

631
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,790
Is that him?

632
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,010
He looks like him,

633
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,580
but it can't be.

634
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,700
This is impossible.

635
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,810
Why not?

636
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,410
Did you notice that nameless tomb?

637
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,570
Pei Yu and his father are buried in there.

638
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,580
They're dead?

639
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,700
Yes.

640
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,510
After the drug bust,

641
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,380
it was our previous chief

642
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,100
who took care of their bodies.

643
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,960
There's no one else in the Pei family.

644
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,590
We dared not set up any tomb for them.

645
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,290
Judging from the timeline,

646
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,860
if he's still alive,

647
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,420
he should be about this age and look.

648
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,660
Jinx!

649
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,630
Calm down!

650
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,220
Jinx! That's him!

651
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,450
Calm down, don't be agitated!

652
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,970
That jinx is back.

653
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,470
We'll all die!

654
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,410
Calm down! Don't run!

655
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,290
Don't run!

656
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,330
The jinx is back!

657
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,560
Don't run!

658
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,240
The jinx is back!

659
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,880
Director Mi,

660
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,090
you hardly come here.

661
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm sorry

662
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,480
to upset you like this.

663
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,650
Does Pei Yu have a brother?

664
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,910
Not that I know off.

665
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,340
What about his mother?

666
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,090
I only know his mother
is from another city.

667
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,090
She met Pei Yu's father

668
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,120
when they were working in the south.

669
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,410
After they had the child,

670
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,650
they broke up.

671
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,980
Pei Yong Yan brought his son here alone.

672
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,040
In this village,

673
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,910
no one has ever seen his wife.

674
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,560
Director Mi,

675
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,090
you are really interested
in his family affairs.

676
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,580
Is this for your show?

677
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,430
No,

678
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,310
I was just asking.

679
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,770
That's all I know.

680
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,880
It's too bad
that our previous chief is gone.

681
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,490
After that drug bust,

682
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,320
many of them left.

683
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,900
It will be difficult

684
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,130
to find out more.

685
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,270
It's getting late,

686
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,500
I should go back now.

687
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,540
Director Mi,

688
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,600
drive slowly!

689
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,290
Xia Chu,

690
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,510
I just encountered something
really strange.

691
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,050
Tell the patient's family,

692
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,960
he shouldn't drink water for eight hours
before the surgery.

693
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,420
If there's no other question,

694
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,970
ask his family

695
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,410
to sign the informed consent.

696
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,550
Alright, Dr Xia.

697
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,540
Xia Chu, it's time to eat.

698
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,530
Let's go and eat.

699
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,330
Come on.

700
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm not hungry. You should go ahead.

701
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,770
I have something to do.

702
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,050
Then we'll leave now.

703
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,250
Go ahead.

704
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,240
[Xia Chu,]

705
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,370
[I just encountered something
really strange.]

706
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,600
[It could be really serious]

707
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,180
[or maybe I'm overthinking it.]

708
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,930
[But I think I should let you know.]

709
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,510
[Forget it.]

710
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,340
[I'll talk to you when you're free.]

711
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,520
Xiao Chu.

712
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,280
Why didn't you finish
what you were saying?

713
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,380
What is it about?

714
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,420
It is about...

715
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,020
Zhuo Ran,

716
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,680
do you love me?

717
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,020
It slipped my mind.

718
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,670
It slipped your mind?

719
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,430
Are you okay?

720
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,410
[Are you all right, Mi Gu?]

721
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,640
I'm fine.

722
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,880
I have something to say.

723
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,360
What is it?

724
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,520
I...

725
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,420
Liang Mu Ze and I
are officially dating now.

726
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,000
[I know this might catch you off guard,]

727
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,890
my dad hasn't approved of us yet.

728
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,880
But I just have to...

729
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,610
I get it.

730
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,920
Both of us have chosen a hard way.

731
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,890
[But hard doesn't mean it's wrong.]

732
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,080
[Maybe it's because]

733
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,650
everyone is afraid of it.

734
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,450
And we just happen

735
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,250
to be the minority who have guts.

736
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,940
It's green light.

737
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,750
Then you drive first. We'll talk later.

738
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,500
[Sure.]

739
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,470
See you.

740
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,720
Bye.

741
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,490
Pei Yu?

742
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,480
Zhuo Ran?

743
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,090
How is that possible?

744
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,570
Mi Gu,

745
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,280
something must be wrong with you.
