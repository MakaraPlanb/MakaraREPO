00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,340
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,560
Durian flavoured?

5
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,920
I'll eat it outside then.

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,640
No, eat it here. It's fine.

7
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm immune to the smell
of durian now.

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
Have a bite.

9
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,560
I'll pass, thanks.

10
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,320
So you still don't like it.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,920
Of course I don't.

12
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,060
Then why did you make a durian cake?

13
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,640
Because you like it.

14
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,140
I heard

15
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,870
from Dr Zhang that

16
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,220
you've been transferred to the ER.

17
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,510
Are you adjusted?

18
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,260
To be honest, I'm still trying to.

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,020
These past two days,

20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,329
I've lost three of the patients

21
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,880
under my care.

22
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,900
There's one patient,

23
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,050
she has paraquat poisoning

24
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,630
and is currently bed-ridden.

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,579
She may look fine right now,

26
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,860
but when tomorrow rolls around,

27
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,720
her liver will start to deteriorate.

28
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,540
Following that,

29
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,410
pneumonia and atelectasis
will occur,

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,450
or pulmonary edema.

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,450
She might get pulmonary fibrosis.

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,360
At last,

33
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,760
she would suffocate to death.

34
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,960
Up until her last breath,

35
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,070
the patient is aware and conscious.

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,630
Isn't that scary?

37
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,060
Isn't there

38
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,610
even one successful case?

39
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,829
There is.

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,050
But it's very rare.

41
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,820
It depends on how much and when

42
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,329
the patient consumed the poison.

43
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,240
If it is less than 10ml,

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,470
with a timely gastric irrigation

45
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,930
and blood filtering,

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,700
plus a bit of luck from
the person themselves,

47
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,250
perhaps...

48
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,480
I mean there is a chance

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,680
they could get through it alive.

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,520
So what is the condition of

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,920
the patient here?

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't know.

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,990
She wouldn't say anything.

54
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,450
Why did she try to kill herself?

55
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,110
How much did she consume?

56
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,710
How long since she drank it?

57
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,600
She wouldn't say.

58
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,540
Her father couldn't explain either.

59
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,740
If she had drunk a lot,

60
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,209
there's no point in emergency care.

61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,560
But what if?

62
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,120
What if she only drank a little

63
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,070
and there's a chance for her to live.

64
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,940
She's only 18 years old.

65
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,250
18 years old is the prime of youth.

66
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,120
Why did she do it?

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,250
She is a cute girl.

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,900
Plus she just started university.

69
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,460
She's pretty and is well-liked.

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,450
After going out with friends
to have a meal,

71
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,480
she went home that night
and took the poison.

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,450
Why?

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,450
What exactly happened

74
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,360
that made her do such a thing?

75
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,110
Sexual harassment.

76
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,750
What?

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,330
You said the girl is young and pretty,

78
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,610
just started university

79
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,150
and has never had a relationship.

80
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,240
So why did she go out for a meal

81
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,560
and then tried to kill herself later?

82
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,720
She might have been sexually harassed,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,140
so she wanted to die.

84
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,600
Maybe that's why

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,960
she wouldn't say anything.

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,600
Liu Ran.

87
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,190
Liu Ran, can you hear me?

88
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,950
Liu Ran, listen to me.

89
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,400
You have to tell me
how much you consumed.

90
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,340
Half a cap?

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,130
Or one cap?

92
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,050
If you don't tell me,

93
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,320
I won't be able to determine
how much drug to administer.

94
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,560
Can you hear me, Liu Ran?

95
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,080
Liu Ran?

96
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,890
Dr Song, Bed 16 is not doing well.

97
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,110
They need you there.

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,590
Watch over Liu Ran.

99
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,510
I'm a resident doctor here.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,730
My name is Xia Chu.

101
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,470
Liu Ran.

102
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,670
Listen carefully.

103
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,940
I know.

104
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,830
You must have felt hopeless.

105
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,150
That's why you made such a decision.

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,320
I understand your pain.

107
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,280
Truly.

108
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,370
But what I want you to know is,

109
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,100
no matter...

110
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,040
No matter what harm
your body was subjected to,

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,430
you're still you.

112
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,120
There is no reason for you
to feel sorry or ashamed

113
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,000
due to the harm.

114
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,590
Just like...

115
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,670
Just like the ulcer in your mouth.

116
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,310
It's just bodily damage.

117
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,159
It has no other significance.

118
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,710
Remember this.

119
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,960
You did nothing wrong.

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,840
The one who should be punished

121
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,130
isn't you.

122
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,280
You didn't do anything wrong.

123
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,110
Liu Ran.

124
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,160
Do you hear me?

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,280
You're not at fault.

126
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm not at fault.

127
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm not at fault.

128
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm not at fault.

129
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,470
Doctor.

130
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,110
Please.

131
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,240
Please, save me.

132
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,440
I still want to go to school.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,800
I want to go to university.

134
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't be scared.

135
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,400
You'll be fine.

136
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,120
But you need to tell me,

137
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,880
how much did you drink?

138
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,330
Liu Ran's family?

139
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,570
I'm here, doctor.

140
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,590
-How is my daughter?
-Hurry up and pay.

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,170
Okay.

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,320
It's that way!

143
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,070
Yes, okay. I'll go now.

144
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,080
You guessed right.

145
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,400
She

146
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,890
talked.

147
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,510
How much did she take?

148
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,950
She didn't ingest it.

149
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,960
She held it in her mouth for a while.

150
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,030
She couldn't stand the smell,

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,320
so she spat it out.

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,760
Can she be saved?

153
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,090
The scary thing about paraquat is that

154
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,950
even if you didn't ingest it,

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,610
it can still penetrate into the blood

156
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,000
through the skin

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,350
and bind itself to plasma proteins.

158
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,480
That means...

159
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,080
Doctor, I've done the payment.

160
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,799
Okay.

[with a complete treatment plan.]

Liang Mu Ze.

181
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,840
Dr Xia.

182
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,240
Listen.

183
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,120
I tried the cake.

184
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,600
It was still warm.

185
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,970
So I thought

186
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,120
the person who brought it
must still be close by.

187
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,930
Your love of detective novels has its use.

188
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,850
No,

189
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,800
this has nothing to do with
detective novels.

190
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,710
Because you're the only person

191
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,770
who would bring a freshly-baked cake

192
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,880
straight to the hospital for me.

193
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,050
Forgive me for being too free
during my break.

194
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,330
The cake is good.

195
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,760
It's rum-flavoured.

196
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,760
Yesterday, it was chocolate.

197
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,960
The day before, it was peach
and butter flavour.

198
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,680
Every bite after that,

199
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,880
I've savoured with intention.

200
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm glad you like them.

201
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,400
I like them a lot.

202
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,600
Are you getting off work now?

203
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,750
Not yet.

204
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,830
Scarring has appeared

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,080
on Liu Ran's left lung.

206
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,110
Is there no other treatment available?

207
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,960
Even if there is,

208
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,240
it's not something I get to call.

209
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,800
Liang Mu Ze, don't you think

210
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm so useless?

211
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm watching a living person

212
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,880
being stifled to death in front of me.

213
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,350
I really feel like a useless idiot.

214
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,690
I don't get why anyone would invent

215
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,840
a thing like the paraquat.

216
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,930
It is a poison without any proper cure.

217
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,560
-If it didn't exist...
-Dr Xia.

218
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,110
Let me tell you.

219
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,670
Guns,

220
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,600
they can kill.

221
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,680
But it can also stop the killing.

222
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,780
Right?

223
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,270
Heroin.

224
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,230
It kills people.

225
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,290
But morphine?

226
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,510
It alleviates pain.

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,240
In this world, nothing is
in black and white.

228
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,650
Paraquat was first invented

229
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,200
to be the most effective herbicide.

230
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,040
But due to being misused
by certain people,

231
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,670
it was then labelled as a poison.

232
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,760
Maybe the world would be better

233
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,720
without paraquat.

234
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,440
But that no longer applies to us.

235
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,230
In this world,

236
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,840
nothing is set in black and white.

237
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,750
What we can do

238
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,120
is to make sure we make

239
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,000
the best decision each time.

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,840
So, Dr Xia,

241
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,010
stop thinking about

242
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,190
how the world would be without paraquat.

243
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,880
Rather than being a smart ostrich,

244
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,030
it's better to be a brave idiot.

245
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,090
One such brave idiot

246
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,280
is Don Quixote.

247
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,450
Remember that.

248
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,560
A great knight

249
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,880
may fail,

250
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,080
but they will never be beaten.

251
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,990
The same goes for a great doctor.

252
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,400
A great doctor.

253
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,440
Am I...

254
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,930
capable?

255
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,160
Of course you are.

256
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,920
When I say you are, you are.

257
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,760
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

258
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,400
Thanks for the cake

259
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,960
as well as what you just said.

260
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,600
Now go back and do a good job.

261
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,200
Even when it gets busy,

262
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,360
you have to uphold
your military pride, okay?

263
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,460
Bye-bye.

264
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,290
Previously, we've conducted

265
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,210
activated carbon gastric irrigation

266
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,510
and hemoperfusion on Liu Ran.

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,730
We also administered Glucocorticoid

268
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,440
and immunosuppressive therapy.

269
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,120
During the past few days,

270
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,850
the state of her pulmonary fibrosis

271
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,160
has worsened.

272
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,120
The blood oxygen saturation
is unsatisfactory.

273
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,690
So this morning,

274
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,590
we've issued a medical crisis notice.

275
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,350
What is the patient's family background?

276
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,120
She lives in the suburban countryside.

277
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,690
Her parents divorced when she was young.

278
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,200
She's been living with her father
who does odd jobs.

279
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,530
In the past few days,

280
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,160
her father has been the one
taking care of her at the hospital.

281
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,680
Her father's wish

282
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,920
is not to give up on her.

283
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,030
He hopes we'd do our best to save her.

284
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,540
Yi Chi.

285
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,370
Does the ECMO Team

286
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,680
have any suggestions?

287
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,790
To be honest,

288
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,850
even if this patient

289
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,430
is put on the ECMO,

290
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,190
the probability of recovery
is very low.

291
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,590
But it's not totally ruled out.

292
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,750
Saving such a patient

293
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,590
will require a lot of investment.

294
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,430
And I don't just mean investment
from her family.

295
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,530
There are many more tangible
and intangible

296
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,840
community resources.

297
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,760
For her current situation,

298
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,890
we can't be sure if she'll make it

299
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,040
for a lung transplant.

300
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,360
Many organs have been badly damaged.

301
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,930
Her physical state is weak.

302
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,680
Even if she had a lung transplant,

303
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,710
would she be able to recover?

304
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,720
That is another problem.

305
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,040
You all know

306
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,950
that transplantable lungs
are scarce.

307
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,630
Are we really going

308
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,170
to put all our patients
through the same trial?

309
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,150
One more thing.

310
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,330
The ECMO Team has just been established.

311
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,610
To put it bluntly,
the survivability of patients

312
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,940
directly impacts

313
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,850
the team's future reputation.

314
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,880
Thus,

315
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,240
I think it's best that we

316
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,940
eliminate the patients

317
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,010
who are beyond saving.

318
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,290
Give the chance

319
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,840
to patients who can directly benefit

320
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,490
from ECMO treatment.

321
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,780
Make those patients

322
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,290
the focus of clinical treatment.

323
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,290
This way,

324
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,990
our team's future prospects
and development at the hospital

325
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,800
would be better.

326
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,590
Dr Zhang.

327
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,670
The reasoning you just put forth

328
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,810
is pretty cruel.

329
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,970
It is cruel.

330
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,370
But that's the reality.

331
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,240
But we are doctors, not god.

332
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,800
A doctor's duty

333
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,520
is to do our best to save lives.

334
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,880
Even if we cannot guarantee that
all will be saved,

335
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,849
we have no right to determine
who dies, can we?

336
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
The miracles of this world

337
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,170
have never been decided by doctors.

338
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,150
Why can't we give her another chance?

339
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,089
Is our refusal

340
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,280
for the sake of the patient

341
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,410
or is it out of fear of failure?

342
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,560
Xia Chu.

343
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,230
I understand where you come from.

344
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,520
However,

345
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,600
when the hospital makes a plan,

346
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,210
we cannot put our hopes

347
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,200
on miracles.

348
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,030
We need to take into account the risks.

349
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,960
It has to be totally safe. You understand?

350
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,170
Alright.

351
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,560
Let's put that aside for now.

352
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,820
Now,

353
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,650
let's continue with

354
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,400
Liu Ran's treatment plan.

355
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,640
What's that?

356
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,320
ECMO.

357
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,320
It's the abbreviation for extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.

358
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,560
Let me show you.

359
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,080
This is the machine.

360
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,660
Simply put,

361
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,920
it is a cardiac and respiratory
life support

362
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,880
where blood is pumped outside of your body

363
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,530
to a heart-lung machine to be processed

364
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,080
before it goes back to tissues
in the body.

365
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,160
It's not a treatment in and of itself.

366
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,170
It takes over the functions
of the heart and lungs

367
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,810
so that further treatment
can be carried out.

368
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,850
It buys more time

369
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,440
so that the patient can wait
for a transplantable lung.

370
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,310
Then how long will we have to wait?

371
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,120
It's hard to say.

372
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,030
We'll have to see if there are
suitable donors.

373
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,600
What if

374
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,990
there's none?

375
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,510
What if she can't make it until then?

376
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,560
Then what?

377
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,200
Theoretically,

378
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,640
one can be put on the machine
for an extended time.

379
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,960
However,

380
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,600
with the prolonged usage,

381
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,450
the probability of complications

382
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,000
will also increase.

383
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,650
Currently, Liu Ran is already
suffering from respiratory failure

384
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,890
and pulmonary fibrosis
that are life threatening.

385
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,000
ECMO and a lung transplant

386
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,010
are the final

387
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,440
and only hope left.

388
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,000
It's just that

389
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,330
this opportunity also poses
very big risks.

390
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,400
Once installed,

391
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,840
there's no going back.

392
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,120
Moreover, the success rate

393
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,600
is less than 30 percent.

394
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,880
The price is also very high.

395
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,160
I'd like to hear what you think.

396
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,910
Will you give it a try?

397
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,960
Liu Ran's family?

398
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,410
I'm glad you're here.

399
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,440
I'd like to brief you
on Liu Ran's condition.

400
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,340
Doctor, I get it.

401
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,010
Please install the...

402
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,250
the...

403
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,640
That machine of yours.

404
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,950
ECMO

405
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,880
Yes, ECMO.

406
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,250
The treatment plan is prepared
after consulting

407
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,520
all departments.

408
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
Who said you could approach
the patient's family in private

409
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,520
and talk to them about ECMO?

410
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,640
You broke the rules, you know that?

411
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,800
To install the ECMO,

412
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,280
it will cost at least 70, 80 thousand.

413
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,290
There's also the expenses of ICU
after that.

414
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,800
Not to forget the lung transplant.

415
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,050
That's a lot of money.

416
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,680
Where do you propose he get it from?

417
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,400
If he doesn't have it,
he can crowdfund it online.

418
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,650
He said, as long as he is
able to save Liu Ran,

419
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,250
even if there's only a sliver of hope,

420
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,550
he is willing to try.

421
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,070
The outcome of that

422
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
may be that the patient dies,

423
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,010
but he still has to bear hundreds of
thousands of yuan of medical debt.

424
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,760
Will he be able to bear it?

425
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,770
But the fact of the matter is,

426
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,870
the one lying on the hospital bed
is his only daughter.

427
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,080
He should at least be informed

428
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,250
that there is a way

429
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,000
that could save his daughter's life.

430
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,400
For the sake of this 'sliver of hope',

431
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,320
you want him to sell his possessions,
what little thing he has.

432
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,610
Have you thought about

433
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,720
his future then?

434
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,770
If the pressure of using ECMO

435
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,760
is more than the actual final benefit,

436
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,730
then I think

437
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,240
there's no point in letting him know

438
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,080
of the machine's existence.

439
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,210
So how much is the daughter's life worth?

440
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,160
We shouldn't be the ones
to have to answer.

441
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,400
Moreover,

442
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,600
we do not have the right

443
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,650
to decide on their behalf
not to install the ECMO.

444
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,640
What if the decision

445
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,530
would cause the family to lose everything?

446
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,880
How would you know
if they'd lose everything?

447
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,890
Xia Chu, you're too idealistic.

448
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,170
You're still too young.

449
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,490
While Liu Ran is even younger.
She's only 18.

450
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,320
Her life is just starting.

451
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,390
I really don't wish to give up
on her like this.

452
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,040
I thought after going to the ER,

453
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,890
your views would change a bit.

454
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm sorry, Mr Zhang.

455
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,520
Maybe I'm beyond saving.

456
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,320
But

457
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,120
you've convinced me.

458
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,680
The ECMO Team

459
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,200
had another discussion.

460
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,230
We decided

461
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,600
to give it a go.

462
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,680
Director Chen has agreed too.

463
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,040
Alright.

464
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,440
I respect everyone's decision.

465
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,550
Okay.

466
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,920
I'll get the equipment ready.

467
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,000
Xia Chu.

468
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,890
The possible complications

469
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,520
of installing ECMO

470
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,550
must be explained clearly
to Liu Ran's father.

471
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,310
He has to sign the consent form.

472
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,830
Will do.

473
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,800
[Dr Xia]

474
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,570
What happened?

475
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,770
How did the crash happen?

476
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,090
It's not my fault.

477
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,450
I was driving normally.

478
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,780
He appeared out of nowhere

479
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,170
and gave me a shock.

480
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,370
Ask them if you don't believe me.

481
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,640
Ask them. I really didn't do
anything wrong.

482
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,550
Xia Chu.

483
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,870
Has the parent signed the form?

484
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,580
I can't find Liu Ran's father.

485
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,320
Call him then.

486
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,730
I did.

487
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,230
No one answered.

488
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,400
Maybe he's gone to raise money.

489
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,390
Their hospitalisation
is put on credit, right?

490
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,570
No, he wouldn't run away.

491
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,880
He's not that kind of person.

492
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,550
Come on. How well do you know him?

493
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,370
He said, even if it's a sliver of hope,

494
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,680
he will not give up.

495
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,090
But he also said,

496
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,590
the medical fees are too expensive.

497
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,030
One day costs a few thousand yuan.

498
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,130
That was before he fully understood

499
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,920
the severity of paraquat poisoning.

500
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,200
Doctor, we just received a call.

501
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,960
A badly-injured traffic
accident victim nearby

502
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,130
is being sent to the hospital.

503
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,650
Notify Orthopaedics, Neurosurgery
and the blood bank.

504
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,970
Prepare for emergency treatment.

505
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,410
Okay.

506
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,530
I'll let you handle CS tonight.

507
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,760
-Call me if anything.
-Okay.

508
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,570
The victim was knocked by a car.

509
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,750
There's bleeding on the head.

510
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,360
[Emergency Department]

511
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,210
Blood pressure is 80/40.
Blood oxygen at 85.

512
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,050
Doctor, he's Liu Ran's father.

513
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,020
What?

514
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,000
I want...

515
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,680
to see my daughter.

516
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,440
My daughter.

Doctor.

518
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,210
A brain injury. He needs a ventilator.

519
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,420
To the EICU!

521
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,330
The patient's blood pressure is falling.

522
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,280
Is the blood here?

523
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,190
Chase them.

524
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,480
Transfuse the blood once it arrives.

525
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,670
Okay, I'm going.

526
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,210
Prepare for tracheal intubation.

00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,200
Got it.

528
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,930
No intubation!

529
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,450

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,040
200 joules fully charged.

564
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,030
Write it down.

565
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,160
200 joules, once more.

566
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,900
[Who]

567
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,530
[Who]

568
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,440
It's okay.

569
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,980
It's okay.

570
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,850
[Emergency Intensive Care Unit]

571
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,880
Dr Song.

572
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,730
Liu Ran's hypoxia is getting worse.

573
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,960
She may die at any moment.

574
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,130
We have to install the ECMO right away.

575
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,450
Whether or not we install it

576
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,290
will be decided after discussing
with her family.

577
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,630
First, fill up the emergency care report

578
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,050
for Liu Ran's father.

579
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,370
The traffic police and insurance company
are waiting for it.

580
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,080
-But Doctor, Liu Ran is...
-Xia Chu.

581
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,440
Be reasonable.

582
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,360
We are only doctors.

583
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,050
I have a patient.

584
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,600
Her father met with an accident

585
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,470
and died while trying to raise money.

586
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,010
Her condition is critical,

587
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,520
but I'm not willing to give up just yet.

588
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,870
However,

589
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,960
the treatment requires
a lot of investment.

590
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,200
Her family

591
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,030
has no means to cover the cost.

592
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,600
Is it possible to get the TV station
to come do a report?

593
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,360
[Okay. I'll make arrangements.]

594
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,390
Thanks a lot, Mi Gu.

595
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,250
Liang Mu Ze.

596
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,910
Did your back grow eyes?

597
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,000
No.

598
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,320
But I had hoped it was you.

599
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,420
What's the matter?

600
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,480
Liu Ran's father...

601
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,780
I know.

602
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,440
I saw him being carried into the hospital.

603
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,680
Before the accident,

604
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,040
I had told him

605
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,910
that installing the ECMO

606
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,480
was Liu Ran's last chance to live.

607
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,290
That's why he rushed to raise the money.

608
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,950
Who would've thought...

609
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,880
It was an accident, Xia Chu.

610
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,690
My superiors

611
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,550
all think that the treatment plan
is too radical,

612
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,900
with high risks.

613
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,530
There was no point

614
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,360
in mentioning it to the family.

615
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,430
I insisted on telling him.

616
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,920
I firmly believed

617
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,480
that Liu Ran's father had

618
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,290
the right to know of her condition

619
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,880
and to decide what happens.

620
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,600
But now,

621
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,870
I'm not so sure.

622
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,160
Not sure of what?

623
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,640
If

624
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,170
the pressure of the treatment plan
on the family

625
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,120
is more than the actual final benefit,

626
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,450
should I have just

627
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,000
shielded them from the risks?

628
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,680
Or maybe

629
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,480
I should've just decided on their behalf.

630
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,800
Then it wouldn't have come to this.

631
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,240
This outcome...

632
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,430
Perhaps I was wrong.

633
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,900
You weren't wrong.

634
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,240
Timing.

635
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,400
Topography.

636
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,590
Comparison of fire power.

637
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,960
And the final goal.

638
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,840
Only when you're there in person,

639
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,630
can you make the best decision.

640
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,480
When you have to decide,

641
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,470
you can only choose to believe in yourself
at that moment.

642
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,800
Even if you regret if afterwards,

643
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,990
it's okay.

644
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,320
You did your best. You were not wrong.

645
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,080
This is what the psychiatrist told me

646
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,790
after coming back from my first mission.

647
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,870
You've seen a psychiatrist?

648
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,260
Yes.

649
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,290
Why did you think

650
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,120
I was so against you telling me
to go see one before?

651
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,920
What the psychiatrist said makes sense.

652
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,970
But I still don't get it.

653
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,270
From the first mission until now,

654
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,640
it's been eight years.

655
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,160
I'm still suffering from insomnia.

656
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,950
Xia Chu, I know full well how you feel.

657
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,650
What I've been through,

658
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,150
I rather you not go through it.

659
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,150
What I couldn't do,

660
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,870
I hope you'd be able to.

661
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,360
Believe in yourself and
the decision you've made.

662
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,450
You've done your best.

663
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,760
You were not wrong.

664
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,390
Do you have money, Liang Mu Ze?

665
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,840
However much. Lend it to me.

666
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,800
Are you paying for her out of your pocket?

667
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,600
Never mind.

668
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,030
I'll think of a way.

669
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,310
Xia Chu.

670
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,650
The passcode is at the back.

671
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,970
Why? You don't want it?

672
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,990
-I'll take it back.
-No!

673
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,830
I put the cake on the table.

674
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,270
Thank you.

675
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,940
I spoke with Liu Ran's uncle.

676
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,490
He said he'll take her back.

677
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,960
As for the ECMO preparation,

678
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,690
it's a no-go.

679
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,960
They're giving up?

680
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,040
Mr Zhang.

681
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,320
Liu Ran's uncle has agreed
to install the ECMO.

682
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,080
How did you persuade him?

683
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,679
I'll pay the advance.

684
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,010
You'll pay?

685
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,980
Yes.

686
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,770
Before the driver compensation
comes through,

687
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,639
I'll pay for the ECMO installation
in advance.

688
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,760
The TV station will continue
to follow up on the case.

689
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,710
I will also start a crowdfunding online
for them.

690
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,850
For the rest of the fees,

691
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,250
hopefully the compensation
and crowdfunding

692
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,710
will cover them.

693
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,320
Xia Chu...

694
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,199
I know I'm being silly.

695
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,040
I also know that there are
many more such patients.

696
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,199
I'm not some rich heir.

697
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,510
I can't help them all.

698
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,560
But since we've met each other

699
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,840
and Liu Ran's father

700
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,429
accidentally died because
of my suggestion,

701
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,310
I think

702
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,510
I should bear the responsibility.

703
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,610
In the future,

704
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,170
if I happen to look back at this,

705
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,520
I can confidently tell myself
that at this moment,

706
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,790
I had done my best.

707
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,670
I was not wrong.

708
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,230
Xia Chu.

709
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,020
I want you

710
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,200
to remember this passion
you've shown today.

711
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,640
In future,

712
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,280
don't ever be so easily beaten.

713
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,060
I won't.

714
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,050
Okay.

715
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,240
Count me in for the crowdfunding.

716
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,790
Me too.

717
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,990
Thanks.

718
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,000
When you wake up,

719
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,460
make sure you live a full life.

720
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,710
Together with your father's life,

721
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,400
live to the fullest.

722
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,810
Missy.

723
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,600
[Miss Lan.]

724
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,970
[What are you doing?]

725
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,120
[Nothing in particular.]

726
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,710
[There's nothing much to do at home.]

727
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,970
[I took out the wool and washed them.]

728
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,770
[I'm thinking of knitting
your dad a scarf.]

729
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,390
[The weather's getting cold.]

730
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,530
It's already night, and you're
still performing such a loving act.

731
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,450
Are you trying to kill us with kindness?

732
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,200
You never listen to me.

733
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,240
If you were here with me,

734
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,160
you'd already be married with kids.

735
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,810
[You could be eating
my home-cooked meals every day.]

736
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,960
[Wouldn't it be nice?]

737
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,700
Miss Lan.

738
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,050
Are you envious of the women

739
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,480
who are already carrying
their grandchildren?

740
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,640
I don't envy them one bit.

741
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,790
I'm just worried about you.

742
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,890
[You're out toiling away on your own.]

743
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,610
[There's no one to take care of you.]

744
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,760
[How am I supposed to feel at ease?]

745
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,700
Sorry, Miss Lan.

746
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,560
[Sorry for worrying you.]

747
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,850
[But I'll give you my word.]

748
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,990
I will take good care of myself.

749
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,840
Every day, I will

750
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
wake up on time, take my meals on time

751
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,840
and continue working

752
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,280
towards becoming a beautiful
and smart lady.

753
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,520
All right?

754
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,270
Missy.

755
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,400
In the past,

756
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,560
I worked as a medical care provider too.

757
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,720
Those ridiculous aspirations.

758
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,510
Did you think I'd believe them?

759
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,480
Where's Dad? How is his health?

760
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,990
[He's doing okay.]

761
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,480
What about you?

762
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,920
How are your legs?

763
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,680
It's a persisting problem.

764
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,850
I feel fine whenever the weather changes.

765
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,350
But it's nothing. I can handle it.

766
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,800
Make sure you both take care.

767
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,360
Out here,

768
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,960
no matter how tired I am

769
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,580
or what I come across,

770
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,960
as long as I know you two are fine,

771
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,340
our family is fine,

772
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,960
I will think that...

773
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,130
I will know that I have the energy

774
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,720
to keep moving forward.

775
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm able to live wilfully,

776
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,790
not because of my own courage.

777
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,120
[It's because I have you guys.]

778
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,920
[Because I know]

779
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,760
when I turn around,

780
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,560
you will be there.

781
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,840
You guys have always supported me
from behind.

782
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,950
Missy.

783
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,630
Don't you worry about your dad and me.

784
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,260
We're doing fine.

785
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,320
Worry about yourself instead.

786
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,640
[Make sure to look after yourself.]

787
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,870
[You hear?]

788
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,810
Sure, Miss Lan.

789
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,910
I'm hanging up.

790
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,440
[Emergency Intensive Care Unit]

791
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,960
Xia.

792
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,000
Go to bed.

793
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,960
What exactly happened?

794
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,440
Something wrong with the project?

795
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,680
Or are you not feeling well?

796
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,030
I'm fine.

797
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,090
Fine? I can tell right away

798
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,870
whether or not you're truly fine.

799
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,920
Since New Year,

800
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,040
you haven't been sleeping well.

801
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,960
Just look at your face.

802
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,470
Go look in the mirror.

803
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,480
Xia.

804
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,410
We've been married a long time.

805
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,370
Why can't you be frank with me?

806
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,200
Why must you endure it alone?

807
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,440
If you buckled,

808
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,310
what would happen to Xia Chu and me?

809
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,240
Fine.

810
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,560
So you won't say?

811
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,640
Go get your daughter.

812
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,950
What is the matter?

813
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,030
Don't worry.

814
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,870
Don't worry.

815
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,960
Is it the Department of Security?

816
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm Xia Guang Yuan.

817
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,240
You're back.

818
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,730
I got my team to finish a short video
last night.

819
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,930
I'm going to promote it
on the program's official site.

820
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,960
Take a look.

821
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,240
Looks good.

822
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,840
Thank you.

823
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,080
Xia Chu.

824
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,260
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

825
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,720
Three days ago?

826
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,520
Are you still a woman?

827
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,780
It's not that bad, is it?

828
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,080
Try taking a whiff.

829
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,760
It's not that bad.

830
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,180
The ER shift is one day of work,
one day off, right?

831
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,770
How come you don't even have time
to wash your hair?

832
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,890
Yes, it's one day work, one day off.

833
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,410
But I work like a dog during my shift

834
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,860
and so on my day off,

835
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,060
I literally pass out.

836
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,130
There's no time

837
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,710
to think about washing my hair.

838
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,910
You're done for.

839
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,410
If you continue like this,

840
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,690
I can tell you now that all men

841
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,120
will avoid you like the plague.

842
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,230
Thank you.

843
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,230
What is it?

844
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,710
I gave Liang Mu Ze a hug yesterday.

845
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,760
Do you think he smelled it?
