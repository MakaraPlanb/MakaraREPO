00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,680
Xiao Jun.

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,800
Do you still like

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,110
Xuan Xuan from your school?

7
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,960
What do you like about her?

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,509
I like everything about her.

9
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,120
Why?

10
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,000
Is she the prettiest girl

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,440
in your school?

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,350
I don't think so.

13
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,720
Then why do you like her?

14
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,229
Why did you suddenly ask me this?

15
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,760
Luo Xiao Jun.

16
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,800
How do you feel?

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,240
What say you?

18
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,840
I think you're doing really well.

19
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,000
Xia Chu.

20
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,920
Change his dressing.

21
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,890
Yes.

22
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,550
What are you doing?

23
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,360
We're discussing about the next step.

24
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,120
You're really in the mood.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,790
All right. Let's go to Room 3.

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,680
Is it so difficult to see a doctor?

27
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,510
Let's go.

28
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,040
Let's go. It's time
to see the psychiatrist.

29
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't mess with me.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,950
I'm not messing with you.

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,560
-It's your turn.
-It's my turn.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,490
Liang Mu Ze.

33
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,640
The  white blood cell count
of patient no. 18 is still low.

34
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,590
Pay attention to him.

35
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,570
If your family like it,

36
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,340
just let me know.

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,720
I can bring more for you.

38
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,870
Don't be shy.

39
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,480
What are you doing?

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,540
Dr Zhang.

41
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,520
Don't sell it too hard.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,180
You're going to make our nurses

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,490
go bankrupt soon.

44
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,920
That's impossible.
These handmade reusable bag

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,600
are designed by me.

46
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,790
-It's a present for the nurses.
-Is it?

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,510
It's to thank them
for taking care of my son.

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,030
Thank you so much.

49
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,240
We're getting back to work.

50
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,750
Thank you for the present.

51
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,680
You should get back to work. By the way,

52
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,010
-it's for everyone.
-Thank you, Ms Meng Zhen.

53
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,220
The patterns and designs
are my ideas.

54
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,340
You won't find it anywhere else.

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,620
I hope you like it.

56
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,810
Thank you.

57
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,000
You're welcome.

58
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't get one?

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,850
It's rare to see men buying reusable bag.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,530
Hence, I didn't make one for you.

61
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,680
However,

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,980
I know that doctors are hygienic.

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,890
Therefore,

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,870
I made you a soap.

65
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,040
I hope you like it.

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,440
You made a soap for me?

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Look,

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,750
my surname is carved on the soap.

69
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,290
Thank you so much.

70
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380
You're welcome.

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,240
It's personally customised
and it's the only and only in the world.

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,470
I'll keep it well.

73
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,350
Sure.

74
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,600
By the way, we just checked on Xiao Jun.

75
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,750
He's recovering well.

76
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,360
We changed his dressing today.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
If everything goes well,

78
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,640
he can be discharged on Monday.

79
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,680
Really?

80
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,620
Thank you so much!

81
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,640
Okay, got it.

82
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,159
I'll come now.

83
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,720
There's a patient in the emergency ward.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,230
A metal pierced through his chest.

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm going down to have a look.

86
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,730
Take care of your respective patients.

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,030
-Call me if anything.
-Yes.

88
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,340
Okay, you go ahead.

89
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,170
Ms Meng Zhen, we're getting back to work.

90
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,550
Okay, go now.

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,270
Have you fallen in love with someone?

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
No.

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,460
Say it.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,510
It's a secret between us.

95
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,160
I won't tell Ms Zhen.

96
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,820
I'm not you. I'm not scared of your mum.

97
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,880
Who are you scared of?

98
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm scared of you the most.

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,780
Xiao Jun.

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,510
It's time to change dressing.

101
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,650
Here.

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,060
Pull your shirt up.

103
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,730
Let me help you.

104
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,860
Go away!

105
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,270
Don't touch me. Get out now!

106
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,720
I'll leave after changing the dressing.

107
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,760
Here, be good.

108
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,900
I don't want you to do it.

109
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't want you to do it.

110
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,760
Get out!

111
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,400
Get out!

112
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,210
Xiao Jun.

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,380
Xiao Jun, what's wrong?

114
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,640
Dr Xia, what's going on?

115
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,190
Nothing.

116
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,750
Dr Xia, you need to learn

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,610
how to respect your patient.

118
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,520
What if the patient is wrong?

119
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,200
If he stays stubborn,

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,040
he will bear greater pain in the end.

121
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,680
Dr Xia, it's just changing the dressing.

122
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,800
Why would he suffer from greater pain?

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
Nothing.

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll come again later.

125
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,970
Sure.

126
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,710
[Why hasn't medical order
for patient no. 17 here yet?]

127
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,670
[You're the slowest. Speed up.]

128
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,960
No...

129
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,620
My desktop went dead just now.

130
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,840
I just got it repaired.

131
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,400
[Explain to the patient!]

132
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,240
Can you please change dressing
for Luo Xiao Jun on behalf of me?

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,960
No, I'm occupied.

134
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,800
I'll prepare the medical order for you.

135
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,250
You can leave all the medical orders
that has to be done within this week

136
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,320
to me.

137
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,920
Two weeks worth of medical orders.

138
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,380
It's a deal.

139
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,120
It's done.

140
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,840
-Thank you, Dr Xiao.
-No problem.

141
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,710
Thank you.

142
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,350
By the way, Xiao Jun,

143
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,520
tell me the truth.

144
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,110
Why won't you let Dr Xia
to change your dressing?

145
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,720
It's none of your business.

146
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,360
It's none of your business too.

147
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,200
Luo Xiao Jun!

148
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
What's wrong with you?

149
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,850
You're being rude.

150
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,040
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,159
Will you take care of Ms Zhen forever?

152
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,120
It's none of your business.

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,330
Xiao Jun.

154
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,040
You haven't told me

155
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,480
what you want for lunch.

156
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,310
Will you, Liang Mu Ze?

157
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,920
Of course. Do you have to ask?

158
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,520
I want braised pork ribs.
Two portions please.

159
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,600
Ms Zhen, go with Liang Mu Ze.

160
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,320
Why are you so happy?

161
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,480
Liang Mu Ze promised
to take care of Ms Zhen forever.

162
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,540
What does that mean?

163
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,560
That means I took note of it.

164
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,360
I know why you hate me.

165
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,240
It's because of Liang Mu Ze, right?

166
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,040
Listen.

167
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,680
Ever since we met each other
for the first time,

168
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,400
I've always been your doctor.

169
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,039
Now, I'm still your doctor.

170
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,830
I'll be responsible of your health

171
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,559
until you're discharged.

172
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,559
Please don't hate me.

173
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,429
It's nothing to do with Liang Mu Ze.

174
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,919
It's for your own good.

175
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,390
If

176
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,560
you hold grudges against me for nothing,

177
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,760
you may hurt yourself in the end.

178
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,850
Please buy me a bouquet of flowers.

179
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,110
What?

180
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,940
In the name of Liang Mu Ze.

181
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,360
Send a bouquet of flowers to my mum.

182
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,960
That way, I'll believe in you.

183
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,240
Will you behave and receive treatment?

184
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes.

185
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,070
That's a deal.

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,360
That's a deal.

187
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,520
-Are you going back to the camp later?
-Yes.

188
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,640
Xiao Jun becomes more sensitive
after falling sick.

189
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,970
Don't take what he said just now

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,240
to heart.

191
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,270
Meng Zhen.

192
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,000
Xiao Jun is a kid but I'm not.

193
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,800
I'll honour my words.

194
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,520
You don't have to do that, Mu Ze.

195
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,000
It's been eight years.
It's more than enough.

196
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,380
I can take care of myself.

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
Xiao Jun has grown up.

198
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,680
I can take care of him by myself.

199
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,160
As for you,

200
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,880
you should move on.

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
You should go on with dating,
getting married

202
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,680
and have your own children.

203
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,990
You should find your own life purpose.

204
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,810
Taking care of you is my life purpose.

205
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,700
Do you plan to live like this
for the rest of your life?

206
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,350
Both of us know that
it shouldn't be like this.

207
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,980
Sometimes,

208
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,550
inappropriate promises
could be a form of disturbance

209
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,600
to a kid.

210
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,030
Mum.

211
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,440
Xiao Jun.

212
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,980
Xiao Jun, why are you here?

213
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,640
Didn't I tell you to wait in the ward?

214
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,110
It's for you.

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,190
Where did you get the flowers?

216
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,880
Liang Mu Ze got it in secret.

217
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
He wants to give you a surprise. Look.

218
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,750
It's a card with his name on it.

219
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,960
Hurry up, Liang Mu Ze.

220
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,620
Aren't you going to propose?

221
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,150
The flowers are so beautiful.

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,320
I like it.

223
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,110
I like it no matter who the sender is.

224
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,640
However...

225
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,600
We can't get married.

226
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,470
Why?

227
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,440
You promised
you will take care of her forever.

228
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,200
I'll take care of both of you forever.

229
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,960
However,
it's different from getting married.

230
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,160
Why?

231
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,360
Is it because you don't like my mum?

232
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,060
Here, come here.

233
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,050
Listen.

234
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,160
Come here.

235
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,230
Sit down.

236
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,990
Let me tell you.

237
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,670
Marriage is something important.

238
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,230
It's not as simple as you imagine.

239
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,790
It's not just about liking someone or not.

240
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,870
There are more elements to it.

241
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,240
Therefore,

242
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,450
I can't marry Liang Mu Ze.

243
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,350
It's not going to happen.

244
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,680
Can you understand?

245
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,630
He promised to take care of you forever.

246
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,470
He said that out of kindness.

247
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,280
However, taking care of us
is not his responsibility.

248
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,190
It's a success!

249
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,720
Stop crying, Xiao Jun.

250
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,480
Stop crying.

251
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,780
Xiao Jun.

252
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,940
What's wrong?

253
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,690
What's wrong?

254
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,160
Was it you?

255
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,920
Yes.

256
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,920
Are you crazy?

257
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,520
Ridiculous.

258
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,780
Yes.

259
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,100
I'm crazy.

260
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,120
Dr Xia.

261
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,120
You should apologise to her.

262
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,520
Dr Xia.

263
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,550
Dr Xia, sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

264
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,380
It's okay. I'm going to meet a friend
at the emergency department.

265
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,480
Be careful!

266
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,020
Dr Xia, are you okay?

267
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,160
Put up with it.

268
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,280
Your bone is fine

269
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,680
but the ligament is injured.

270
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,760
If it's not fixed,

271
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,280
it won't recover.

272
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,130
You're a doctor.

273
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,520
You should know the consequences.

274
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,060
How long will it take to recover?

275
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,470
It will take about a week.

276
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,510
Don't walk too much and rest well.

277
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,880
Can I go to work tomorrow?

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,000
Go to work?

279
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,480
Do you plan to give up
on conducting surgery?

280
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,060
We'll talk about it
when your leg has fully recovered.

281
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,400
You may get back to work.

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,980
I can handle it.

283
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm going back to the unit at 6 o'clock.

284
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,170
You should come back with me.

285
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,530
Why?

286
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,560
You'll be staying there for a few days.

287
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,630
Why?

288
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,080
Why? He's worried about you.

289
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,580
No.

290
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,840
I promised Zhang Yi Chi

291
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,500
to take good care of you.

292
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,810
It's done.

293
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,070
Go get a wheelchair.

294
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,100
It's not needed.

295
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,480
Liang Mu Ze!

296
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,230
Military officers have great stamina.

297
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,080
Liang Mu Ze, let me down!

298
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,300
Put me down!

299
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,100
Stop moving.

300
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,320
I won't be responsible if you fall.

301
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,530
Put me down!

302
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,260
We're in the hospital.

303
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,880
You're creating a scene.

304
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,080
Stop looking around.

305
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,270
-Look at them.
-You...

306
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,740
Let me down!

307
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Stop moving.

308
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,070
I...

309
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,900
Let go of me! I want to get down!

310
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,750
You're abducting me.

311
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm going to scream for help.

312
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,110
If you don't mind embarrassing yourself,
you may do so.

313
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,080
I don't mind.

314
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,170
Should we follow them?

315
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,800
Go back to the office.

316
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,590
Mi Gu?

317
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
Mi Gu!

318
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,540
Mi Gu!

319
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,920
Mi Gu!

320
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,700
I'll be there in half an hour.

321
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,440
Roll down the car window.

322
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,470
Mi Gu!

323
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,160
Mi Gu!

324
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,120
He's gone?

325
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,890
Yes.

326
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,780
He requested to be discharged.

327
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,960
Didn't you know?

328
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,640
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

329
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,030
One, two, three, four!

330
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,620
One, two, three, four!

331
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,380
One, two, three, four!

332
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,360
One, two, three, four!

333
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,120
I think I just saw Captain Liang's car.

334
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,790
Stand still!

335
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,200
Tian Yong.

336
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,420
Tian Yong.

337
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,890
Captain.

338
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,310
Dr Xia?

339
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,090
Yes.

340
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,480
Good day, Mrs. Liang.

341
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,750
Good day, Mrs Liang.

342
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,140
Good day, Mrs Liang.

343
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,240
Good day, Mrs Liang.

344
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,530
Good day, Mrs Liang!

345
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,660
Good day, Mrs Liang.

346
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,920
Good day, Mrs Liang.

347
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,569
What are you doing?

348
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,190
Who is Mrs Liang?

349
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,150
Brigade Commander.

350
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,150
Good day, Brigade Commander!

351
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,480
I told you to come back at 6 o'clock.

352
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,359
You're late 20 minutes.

353
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,339
What happened?

354
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,349
Reporting.

355
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,349
Chief.

356
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,250
Chief.

357
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,240
He was late because
he kept me company at the hospital.

358
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,480
Who are you?

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,700
Reporting to Brigade Commander.

360
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,160
She is a cardiac surgeon
from 109 Hospital.

361
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,250
Reporting.

362
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,630
Dr Xia was my saviour.

363
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,650
She saved me

364
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,920
when we were in Isaia.

365
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,680
It's you, Dr Xia.

366
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,450
Hello.

367
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,060
I have been wanting
to thank you face to face.

368
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,960
I didn't expect to see you today.

369
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,580
Chief, don't mention it.

370
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
You may call me Xia Chu.

371
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,200
Sure, Xia Chu.

372
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,120
What happened?

373
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,120
I accidentally fell down.

374
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,770
Captain Liang ran into me
in the hospital and hence,

375
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,240
he took me in.

376
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,940
Took you...

377
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,320
Look at me.

378
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,710
I got it now.

379
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,590
Xia Chu.

380
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,360
You're going to stay here
for a while, right?

381
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,870
-Yes.
-No.

382
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,500
She'll stay.

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,280
Chief.

384
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,040
The military camp
is full of confidential information.

385
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm an outsider.

386
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,230
You're not an outsider.

387
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,190
Xia Chu.

388
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,560
You're Tian Yong's saviour, right?

389
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,000
That means you're the saviour
of Special Forces Brigade too.

390
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,620
Am I right?

391
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,890
Yes!

392
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,450
-Liang Mu Ze.
-Yes!

393
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,870
-Take care of Xia Chu.
-Yes!

394
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,260
Chief.

395
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,720
I need to get back to the hospital.
I didn't apply for leave.

396
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,560
You don't have to worry about that.

397
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,280
Just stay here, relax

398
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,410
and nurse your wound.

399
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,400
I'll talk to your boss later.

400
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,300
-Liang Mu Ze!
-Yes!

401
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,680
Send Xia Chu to the guest house.

402
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,480
Yes!

403
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,360
-I'll send her there now.
-Go.

404
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,110
-Thank you, Chief.
-Goodbye, Xia Chu.

405
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm leaving, Brigade Commander.

406
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,640
-Tian Yong.
-Yes!

407
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,160
I've a meeting
at the Brigade Headquarters.

408
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,370
So, please send dinner
and daily necessities

409
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,680
to Dr Xia.

410
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,160
Get her a few pair of clothes too.

411
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,200
Will do, sir.

412
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,040
-Tian Yong!
-Yes!

413
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,080
Sing the cadence while marching.

414
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,520
Yes!

415
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,480
Turn to the rear and march!

416
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,680
♫ Unity is strength ♫

417
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,120
Ready, sing!

418
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:58,000
♫ Unity is strength ♫

419
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,560
Liang Mu Ze, I don't want to stay here!

420
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,340
You're not going to stay here.

421
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,670
I want to go home.

422
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,990
You'd better not do that.

423
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,200
Why?

424
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,050
Because I took you in.

425
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,280
I was giving you face.

426
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,200
I said that because he's your boss.

427
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,970
In fact, I'm kidnapped by you.

428
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,080
Don't act innocent.

429
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
Fine, no matter what,

430
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,440
you can only leave after you've recovered.

431
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,790
Liang Mu Ze.

432
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,250
Are you worried

433
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,160
it'd be difficult to explain
to Mr Zhang Yi Chi?

434
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,970
It's okay.

435
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,490
You don't have to take it to heart.

436
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,920
I can explain for you.

437
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,050
Just let me go, okay?

438
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,920
Let me survive on my own, okay?

439
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,380
What does that mean?

440
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Just how much do you loathe

441
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,600
military camp and Special Forces soldiers?

442
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,390
No matter how much you loathe us,

443
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,350
you have to put up with us.

444
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,530
It's nothing to do with military camp
and the Special Forces!

445
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,680
I just want to stay alone!

446
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,960
I just want to go home!

447
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,420
I don't want to stand in your way

448
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,020
and being called crazy.
Can't you just let me go?

449
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,220
No.

450
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,170
Why?

451
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,020
That's my house.

452
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,200
I have the final say on
whether you can go back.

453
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,360
Attention! At ease.

454
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,250
Xia Chu.

455
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,920
Stop crying.

456
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,590
Xia Chu.

457
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,490
Stop crying.

458
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,050
Stop crying.

459
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,230
Xia Chu.

460
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,230
Is the medicine not working?

461
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,240
[Yes, she's been crying.]

462
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,390
Where are you?

463
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,760
I'll check on her.

464
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,960
We're in the military camp.

465
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,520
Are you sure that her bone is fine?

466
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,560
Don't worry.

467
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,880
The diagnosis by Orthopaedic Department

468
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,480
is surely accurate.

469
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,910
[Furthermore, even if she injured
her bone,]

470
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,340
a minor outpatient treatment
wouldn't make her cry.

471
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,470
Be honest.

472
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,150
Did you bully her?

473
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,320
How is Xiao Jun doing?

474
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,690
[I've just done with my work.]

475
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,840
I'm going to check on him.

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,180
[All right, give me a call if anything.]

477
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,470
You should take care of yourself.

478
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,010
[Since you brought her back,]

479
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,310
[you should take care of her.]

480
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,890
[When you're dealing with a lady,]

481
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,280
you have to be gentle, okay?

482
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,880
She's injured

483
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,920
but her parents are not around.

484
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,170
[She must be fragile at the moment.]

485
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,970
[She can't take your cold treatment.]

486
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,520
All right, I've to go.

487
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,150
He brought her back.

488
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,050
[Outpatient Department]

489
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,240
Have some food.

490
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,390
Is it sweet?

491
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,240
Did I scare Liang Mu Ze away?

492
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,430
He's not made of paper.

493
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,920
He's gone back to the military camp.

494
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,300
No.

495
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,840
I almost died

496
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,810
from the illness.

497
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,140
I had two surgeries.

498
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,350
My heart is problematic.

499
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,120
You're all right.

500
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,080
You've recovered, okay?

501
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,960
Nothing will happen to you.

502
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,720
No one can predict the future.

503
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,260
If one day

504
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,990
I leave this world just like dad,

505
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,840
I hope

506
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,700
someone can keep you company

507
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,930
and take care of you.

508
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,720
Otherwise, you'll be lonely.

509
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,560
You'll be sad for sure.

510
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,570
That's why I lied to you

511
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,240
and claimed that the flower
was from Liang Mu Ze.

512
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,530
I like him.

513
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,960
I thought you liked him too.

514
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,790
I didn't lie on purpose.

515
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,870
I know.

516
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,060
You will be fine.

517
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,120
You will be fine.

518
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,720
You'll always be by my side.

519
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,900
Don't think too much, okay?

520
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,500
I know.

521
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,390
You will be fine.

522
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,680
Are you doing laundry?

523
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,360
Dr Zhang.

524
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,620
Done with work?

525
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,010
What's wrong?

526
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,880
Nothing.

527
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,590
The laundry detergent
accidentally got into my eyes.

528
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,780
That's a little far-fetched.

529
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,000
Did you cry?

530
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,680
Xiao Jun bought me a bouquet of flower

531
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,000
in the afternoon.

532
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,960
He told Liang Mu Ze to propose to me.

533
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,550
Propose to you?

534
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,360
Were you touched?

535
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,600
It's never crossed my mind that

536
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,520
my son would be the match-maker for me.

537
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,690
He said,

538
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,480
he's worried that if he left the world,

539
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,680
I would be lonely.

540
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,300
Actually that's a good idea.

541
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,960
Liang Mu Ze is a nice man.

542
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,840
I think you should consider him.

543
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,670
What? Liang Mu Ze?

544
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes.

545
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,280
How is that possible?

546
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,110
Listen.

547
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,160
I embroidered a piece of table cloth
a few years back.

548
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,990
It's a blue bird.

549
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,870
I really liked it.

550
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,910
However, one day,
I accidentally spilled juice on it.

551
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,920
It's tainted.

552
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,750
I couldn't get rid of the stain
no matter how hard I tried.

553
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,030
I thought

554
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,880
I could produce another one

555
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,670
but I couldn't do it.

556
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,140
When the patterns are similar,

557
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,460
I can't help but keep comparing the both.

558
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,840
Even if the new one is more delicate,

559
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,000
I would always miss the old one.

560
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,240
Mu Ze seems so familiar to me.

561
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
When he stood before me
in the army uniform

562
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,160
that I'm especially familiar with,

563
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,560
it's as if I could see the shadow

564
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,000
of Xiao Jun's dad.

565
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,580
Therefore,

566
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
I trust him.

567
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,820
I even relied heavily on him once.

568
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,470
However, I know that

569
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,360
I can't bring my feelings forward.

570
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,690
He won't do that.

571
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,670
I won't do that either.

572
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,780
There are many patterns I can do.

573
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,510
However, there is only one blue bird.

574
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,600
I get it.

575
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,770
I can totally understand that.

576
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,300
Stop thinking so much.

577
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,030
Xiao Jun will slowly grow up.

578
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,810
He won't let you live a lonely life.

579
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,600
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

580
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,530
See you.

581
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,110
Goodbye.

582
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,540
Xia Chu.

583
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,810
Have some water.

584
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,320
Listen.

585
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm sorry.

586
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,840
I shouldn't have had scolded you.

587
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,460
However, bringing you back to the camp

588
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,530
is for your own good.

589
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,720
Am I right?

590
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,780
Someone will take care of your meals.

591
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,030
You'll recover faster.

592
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,710
Just stay here with ease.

593
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,940
I'll always be in the camp.

594
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,990
You can reach me anytime

595
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,470
for anything.

596
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,570
Okay?

597
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,290
Xia Chu.

598
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,380
I'm hungry.

599
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,060
No problem.

600
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,760
Reporting!

601
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,270
Come in.

602
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,980
Captain Liang.

603
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,000
Why do you look troubled?

604
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,670
Look at the operational requirement
suggested by the sixth team.

605
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,850
How can I not be troubled?

606
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,990
I'm not talking about
operational requirement.

607
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,110
I'm talking about Dr Xia.

608
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,230
She's a lady after all.

609
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,620
She's staying at the guest house alone.

610
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,930
Do you think it's appropriate?

611
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,380
Dr Xia is a doctor.

612
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,180
She knows how to take care of herself.

613
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,350
Why are you doing this to her?

614
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,080
You're used to staying with her.

615
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,680
-Lieutenant Tian.
-Yes!

616
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
I think our platoon

617
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,000
is lacking vigour lately.

618
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,340
Is it?

619
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,950
I was receiving training elsewhere.

620
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,150
As the vice captain,

621
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,110
aren't you supposed to lead by example

622
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,430
and make sure everyone in the platoon

623
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,350
including yourself
to be disciplined in physical training?

624
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,840
Look at your
physical fitness test results.

625
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,910
What happened to you?

626
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,020
However, the overall performance
of our platoon has improved.

627
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Xiao Teng won the second runner-up

628
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,390
in 800m obstacle race.

629
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,580
-Is that good enough?
-No.

630
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,200
-Is that good enough?
-No!

631
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,720
From tomorrow onward,
train yourself to death.

632
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,810
Make sure you get number one
in the next assessment.

633
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,260
-Do you hear me?
-Yes!

634
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,540
Leave.

635
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,790
Yes.

636

He's showing off.

659
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,660
So?

660
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,740
Have you gotten any the idea
for the coming shoot?

661
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,590
Let me know if you have any ideas.

662
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,650
Boss, why don't we film
about internet entrepreneurship?

663
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,310
How about acting agencies?

664
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,980
Why don't we go for food column?

665
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,670
Mi Gu!

666
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,440
Are you okay?

667
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,850
What do you think?

668
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,139
I didn't mean it.

669
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,690
Something went wrong with your guest.

670
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,530
Not only did you not solve the issue,

671
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,159
you dozed off during the meeting.

672
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,560
Do you still want the job?

673
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,270
Boss.

674
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,280
I've completed the new proposal.

675
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,790
Please take a look.

676
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,639
Filming a doctor's daily life?

677
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,040
Filming a doctor's daily life

678
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,389
to present the doctor-patient relationship
which is a public concern.

679
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
We can also make the show stands out

680
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,600
by including all kinds
of eye catching rare diseases.

681
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,739
At the same time, we can instil

682
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,840
the correct values on health and death
in the public.

683
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,680
Not only is it evergreen,
it's also interesting to watch.

684
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,560
More importantly,
I have a good subject to feature.

685
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,040
What do you think?

686
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,760
Do you think it's doable?

687
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,250
Yes.

688
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,820
Lad.

689
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,720
Your mum is exhausted

690
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,120
from taking care of you.

691
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,490
Now that you're discharged,

692
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,440
you must listen to your mum.

693
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,420
Got it?

694
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,330
Yes.

695
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,760
All right, Dr Zhang.

696
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,080
You don't have to send us off.

697
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,960
Send me a message
after you've reached home.

698
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,290
Sure.

699
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,000
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Dr Zhang.

700
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,000
Goodbye.

701
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,970
Goodbye.

702
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,230
Let's go.

703
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,990
Dr Zhang, you're indeed

704
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,550
not picky at all.

705
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,170
My patient is discharged today.

706
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,840
Am I not allowed to send him off?

707
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,640
Why didn't you come that weekend?

708
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,840
You went there?

709
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,810
Of course.

710
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,370
I waited for you for the whole night.

711
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,480
No way.

712
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,240
I'm serious. Why would I lie?

713
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,830
I know you well.

714
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,230
Li Juan.

715
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,430
You...

716
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,610
You're anything but stubborn.

717
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,170
Even if you waited at the pub
for the whole night,

718
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,330
you're not just waiting for me, right?

719
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,400
We had a date.

720
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,350
Who else would I wait for
if it weren't for you?

721
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,280
Are you crazy?

722
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,750
Are you free tonight? Let's go together.

723
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,260
I'm sorry.

724
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,340
I already have a date.

725
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,680
Sure, can't wait to eat it.

726
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,900
See you tonight.

727
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,280
See?

728
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,530
I have everything in the world.

729
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,720
I took care of the surveillance system.

730
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,670
I'm ready.

731
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,540
Do you really want to do that?

732
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,030
["The Tokyo Zodiac Murders"
by Soji Shimada]

733
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,530
[Listen.]

734
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,750
I have a bad hunch.

735
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,550
You'd better be fast.

736
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,640
Are you done?

737
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,120
[Can you hear me?]

738
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,390
[Will you answer me?]

739
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,720
Can you hear me, Zhuo Ran?

740
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,640
Can you hear me?

741
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,800
Can you hear me?

742
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,340
Are you Xia Chu's pet?

743
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,800
What is your name?

744
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,830
Don't touch me.

745
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,760
I didn't know that you had a cat.

746
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,820
Can you hear me? Yang Mu Ze is back.

747
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,150
Zhuo Ran, can you hear me?
Liang Mu Ze...

748
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,460
Liang Mu Ze is back!

749
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,710
Can you hear me? Liang Mu Ze is back!

750
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:24,980
What's wrong?

751
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,080
Help!

752
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,640
A bad guy wanted to hurt me.

753
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,640
A bad guy is after me!

754
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,340
Are you missing your owner?

755
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,030
She'll be back soon.

756
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,870
That's enough. Go watch the door.

757
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,470
I don't care if she's coming back soon.

758
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,990
I want you to take me away from here.

759
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,600
Can we rewind to the earlier time?

760
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,800
Usually it works that way.

761
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,960
However, something is wrong

762
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,030
with the surveillance system.

763
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,790
There is no video signal.

764
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,370
No signal?

765
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,300
Yes.

766
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,160
We just got it repaired.

767
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,800
Hence,
the earlier recording is not available.

768
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:43,820
Sorry about that.
