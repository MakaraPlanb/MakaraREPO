[My Dear Guardian]

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,050
You hugged Liang Mu Ze?

5
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,580
Why?

6
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,820
It's to show my appreciation for him.

7
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,860
I borrowed money from him.

8
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,610
He paid for Liu Ran's medical fees.

9
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,560
He didn't say no?

10
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,280
He gave me his bank card.

11
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,250
I mean,

12
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,009
he let you hug him?

13
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,630
I did it in a blink of an eye.

14
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,950
He didn't have the time to react.

15
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,729
He just didn't want to react.

16
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,539
If he didn't want you to hug him,

17
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,220
I'm sure

18
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,090
you couldn't even get to touch his finger.

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,030
Really?

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,100
Of course, he's a Special Forces soldier.

21
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,810
Is it delicious?

22
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,300
Where did you get it?

23
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,490
He made it.

24
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,940
Here, have some water.

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,650
What's wrong?

26
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,370
Xia Chu.

27
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,970
Liang Mu Ze

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,410
is in love with you.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,250
But he didn't say anything.

30
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,990
This man

31
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,660
let you hug him

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,829
though you didn't wash your hair
for three days.

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,630
When you asked for a loan,

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,700
he gave you his bank card.

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,740
When you worked over time,

36
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:47,820
he delivered home-made cake

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,260
to your office.

38
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,870
Isn't it very obvious?

39
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,250
Does he really have to say anything?

40
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,810
Of course he has to say something.

41
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,100
We need to have a sense of ritual in life.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,420
In romance,

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,780
confession and promise
are part of the ritual.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,890
Therefore,

45
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,500
you admit that you're
romantically involved with him?

46
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,210
Actually,

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,130
the sense of ritual
doesn't have to come from men.

48
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,500
If you really like him,

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,430
you can confess to him
if he doesn't do so.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,340
It's just one step away.

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,860
Anyone can make the first move, right?

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,130
Between you and Zhuo Ran,

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,820
did you confess first?

54
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,130
It was me.

55
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,610
You're so brave, Mi Gu.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,650
After confessing to him, I realized

57
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,770
between me and him,

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,220
it's more than just one step away.

59
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,630
As per your instruction,

60
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,100
I've contacted the purchaser.

61
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,100
The remaining goods

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,660
will be sold out soon.

63
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,690
Is everything all right with the police?

64
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,340
[They came here before.]

65
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,530
That's quick.

66
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,770
Someone might have
provided information to the police.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,490
[Why are you so careless?]

68
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,590
We could have killed everyone
at the scene.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,610
However, Ling Mu Ze
appeared all of a sudden.

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,490
He messed up our plan.

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,180
[Liang Mu Ze?]

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,710
It's the military officer again.

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,500
Yes.

74
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,690
It's him.

75
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,839
[In comparison to those witnesses]

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,250
[who didn't even see our face,]

77
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,390
Liang Mu Ze

78
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,630
is the greatest obstacle

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,940
in our operation moving forward.

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,590

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,620
I don't want to bring up
unnecessary issues.

84
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,980
[If Gui's murder case]

85
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,890
is not supported by any evidence,

86
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,900
we shall leave it aside.

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,170
Xia Guang Yuan is our priority.

88
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,530
We need to win his heart
as soon as possible, got it?

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm trying

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,420
to befriend his assistant, Tang Lin.

91
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,980
She was the one
who prepared all the experimental reports.

92
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,510
She can expedite the process

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,580
of extracting the relevant information.

94
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,850
[You can't approach him
through his daughter anymore?]

95
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,170
Isn't it better
to do both at the same time?

96
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,050
Be immaculate.

97

Don't get into trouble again, got it?

98
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,380
Got it.

[Anything?]

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,770
Don't worry.

103

Your mum is doing well.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,820
I know.

105
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,350
You sent someone to take care of her.

106
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,350
I'm not worried at all.

107
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,730
Do you have any other question?

108
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,370
It's about my dad.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,570
How did he die?

110
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,260
I've told you about it long time ago.

111
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,190
Once, when we were collecting the goods,

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,420
the Police Force
barged in out of the blue.

113
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,780
Your dad refused to leave

114
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,409
insisting to guard the goods.

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,890
In the end, he was shot to death.

116
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,950
I see.

117
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,650
That's your version.

118
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,550
However, before Gui died, he said...

119
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,850
[Gui?]

120
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,510
Have you forgotten how Gui always behaved?

121
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,900
How could you believe in him?

122
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,100

[Tell me.]

125
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,450
Do you trust him or me?

126
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,810
I trust you.

127
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,530
I'm glad to hear that.

128
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,970
That's all.

132

If we can find a suitable lung,

133
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,970
the system
will automatically assign it to her.

134
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,800
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

135
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,770
But you need to know that

136
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,970
organ donation is full of uncertainties.

137
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,360
That's why I objected

138
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,310
installing ECMO in her.

139
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,200
It's torturous.

140
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,940
Since it's been installed,

141
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,570
we can only wait.

142
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,740
Otherwise, all the effort will be in vain.

143

All right.

149
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,510
Let's take a rest.

Do you have perfume?

156
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,500
I only have intravenous sugar solution.

157
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,690
Do you want it?

158
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,670

Do I look good?

163
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,570
It's on-trend.

164
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,250
Fine.

165
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,970
It's to cover up the ugly side of me.

166
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,770
I haven't washed my hair
for four days.

167
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,990
You're not ugly at all.

168
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,790
You're fair.

169
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,610
Fair complexion covers up
90 percent of the ugliness.

170
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,050
Really?

171
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,110
What about the remaining
10 percent of the ugliness?

172
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,410
As for the remaining 10 percent,

173
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,650
you need to leave a way out
for the other ladies.

174
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,490
Liang Mu Ze, you're abnormal lately.

175
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,289
You've become a sweet talker.

176
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,260
You used to be proud and aloof.

177
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,490
I guess it's because
I made too many desserts.

178
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,020
Hold on.

179
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,740
Take this.

180
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,350
Is there any difference?

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,310
Of course.

182
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,020
Look.

183
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,270
After being shaken up,
the bubbles are fine and dense.

184
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,190
Furthermore,
the bubbles stay for a long time.

185
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,730
Do you know what that means?

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,620
What does it mean?

187
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,710
It means it's high in amino acid.

188
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,190
It's also more nutritious.

189
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,750
Better yet, it's on sale.

190
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,250
It's cheaper by three bucks.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,900
We're out of oranges, right?

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,270
Let's get some fruits.

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,660
Sure, I'll listen to you.

194
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,640
What are you looking at?

195
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,950
I'm trying to tell its gender.

196
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,160
What?

197
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,470
Its gender.

198
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,180
Look.

199
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,670
If the pedicel is small, it's male.

200
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,910
If the pedicel is big, it's female.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,540
Female orange
is tastier than the male orange.

202
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,090
Ridiculous.

203
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,300
It's not as ridiculous as

204
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,410
reciting poem to a wound, right?

205
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,410
Xia Chu.

206
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,850
Yes?

207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,330
Your scarf is gone.

208
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,250
What did you smell?

209
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,970
The smell...

210
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,330
is a combination
of sanitiser and Formalin.

211
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,090
You've forgotten it.

212
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,310
Are you coming, Liang Mu Ze?

213
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,770
I'm starving!

214
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,450
I'm coming.

215
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,640
By the way,

216
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,030
take back your card.

217
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,790
I'll pay you back during weekends

218
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,250
when I get the money.

219
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,670
It's okay.

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,260
You can count me in for the donation.

221
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,340
No way.

222
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,950
I borrowed the money from you.

223
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,390
If you really want to donate,

224
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,410
you should donate it by yourself
when I pay you back.

225
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,750
Okay.

226
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,650
Let me know if you need money.

227
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,130
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

228
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,930
"Thank you"?

229
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,140
If you replace "thank you"

230
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,690
with three other words,

231
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,630
I'll be more happy.

232
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,370
Which three words?

233
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,520
I love you.

234
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,820
Let's eat together.

235
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,610
It's been a while since you said
"let's eat together".

236
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,650
It's been a long time
since I had home-cooked food.

237
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,410
No problem.

238
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,540
In exchange,

239
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,550
you have to tell me

240
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,100
how did you find out

241
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,990
the reason Liu Ran committed suicide

242
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,620
since you have never met her before?

243
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,530
I'm really curious.

244
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,050
Which novel gave you the inspiration?

245
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,100
Or

246
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,720
was it the instinct
of a special forces soldier?

247
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,810
Neither.

248
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,080
It happened to one of my relatives before.

249
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,370
[Do you still remember what I told you?]

250
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,700
[If you knew her from the past,]

251
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,020
[you would forgive the present her.]

252
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,640
Kindergarten?

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,970
[Those encounters are imprinted on her.]

254
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,320
[All her oddness and sensitivity]

255
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,780
[are the edges and corners
cut out of pain and suffering.]

256
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,610
When did you come back?

257
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,290
Aren't you having night shift today?

258
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,180
Mu Ze went to pick you up.

259
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,690
Did you see him?

260
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,330
He's at the parking.

261
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,610
He'll come up soon.

262
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,370
OK.

263
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,530
I want to pay OK a visit
at Special Forces Brigade.

264
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,710
The clothes that I have

265
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,490
are all too fashionable.

266
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,940
I bet they won't let me in.

267
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,450
That's why I decided
to borrow a few clothes from you.

268
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,620
No doubt your taste is no match for me

269
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,580
but I have to put up with it
because of OK.

270
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,470
You just want to see OK?

271
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,210
I also want to see Tian Yong.

272
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,050
I think this attire is not appropriate.

273
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,250
It's too thick.

274
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,380
You're just a young lady.

275
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,220
I think you should put on something light

276
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,770
so that you look cute and lively.

277
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,710
I'm not a young lady.

278
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,540
I'm already 21 years old.

279
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,250
I'm a mature lady.

280
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,690
I want to look mysterious and sexy.

281
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,540
Also,

282
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,110
don't put on too much make up.

283
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,260
Eye shadow, fake eyelashes and ear rings

284
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,390
should be removed.

285
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,340
Keep the eyeliners thin and delicate.

286
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,540
As for your lips,

287
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,350
go for a nude colour.

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,260
Keep your make up

289
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,380
natural and refreshing.

290
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,190
Make it look
as if you haven't put on any make up.

291
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,770
Wear a nude look, okay?

292
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,100
You don't have a choice.

293
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,860
That's the preference of a straight guy.

294
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,830
I don't want to do that.

295
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,820
I don't care about
the preference of a straight guy.

296
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,340
I want to be me.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
Well, suits yourself.

298
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,130
[Which one do you prefer?]

299
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,580
[You didn't tell us what the occasion is.]

300
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,980
[If you ask me,]

301
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,130
[the previous photo
that you sent us looks better.]

302
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,670
[Did you really have to ask?]

303
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,730
[Obviously she's going on a date.]

304
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,780
[My suggestion is]

305
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,010
[straight guys are simple-minded.]

306
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,460
[It's the best
to look natural and refreshing.]

307
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,210
[Don't make useless effort.]

308
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,980
Why do they share the same view
as Xia Chu?

309
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,050
That's what happened to the parrot.

310
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,590
According to the organisation,

311
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,940
in order to ensure its peace of mind,

312
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,900
we must not go against
the will of the adopter.

313
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,130
We can only slowly communicate
with the adopter.

314
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,740
Otherwise, things will backfire.

315
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,780
Therefore,

316
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,470
before she volunteers
to take the parrot with her,

317
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,730
we can take care of the parrot

318
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,310
and ensure its quality of life.

319
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,710
It seems that's the only way.

320
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,390
You'll have to

321
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,570
take charge of it.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,900
Work together with the organisation

323
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,340
to convince her.

324
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,530
Yes, sir!

325
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,240
You may leave now.

326
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:30,690
[Soldiers are sacred and inviolable]

327
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,590
Can't you recognise me?

328
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,450
No.

329
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,020
It's just that

330
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,820
you're a little different

331
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,010
from the last time I saw you.

332
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,580
[Soldiers are sacred and inviolable]

333
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,380
Do I look good?

334
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,140
Your skin is
as fair as congealed ointment.

335
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,880
Your neck is long and fair
like a tree grub.

336
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,600
Your teeth are like melon seeds.

337
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,430
Your eyebrows are like
the antennae of the silkworm moth.

338
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,030
When you smile, your dimples look artful.

339
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,450
Your eyes are so lovely.

340
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,970
Ex...cuse me?

341
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,770
You look very nice.

342
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,770
Thank you.

343
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,330
Let's go register.

344
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,170
Then, we'll pay Master Le Tian a visit.

345
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,780
Who is that?

346
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
Look,

347
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,050
who is here?

348
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,930
How are you doing, dude?

349
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,370
Now you know why it's known as
Master Le Tian.

350
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,760
Did it eat something wrong by mistake?

351
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,490
No.

352
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,330
Is its brain working?

353
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,750
Yes.

354
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,880
Don't worry.

355
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,350
It's just too good in imitating.

356
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
It stayed with Brigade Commander
for some time

357
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,810
and mastered the art of sardonic laugh.

358
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,380
It just can't stop laughing sardonically.

359
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,580
That's a weird way to laugh.

360
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,650
How scary.

361
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,030
How do you guys put up with it?

362
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,030
If only those

363
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,260
who are good looking

364
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,770
are allowed to laugh,

365
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,329
then this world would be a boring place.

366
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,890
What's wrong?

367
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,460
What's wrong?

368
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,770
You're nothing like a soldier.

369
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,770
What do I look like?

370
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,910
You're like a poet.

371
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,330
From what aspect?

372
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,360
That's because you're ugly.

373
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,610
I see.

374
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,710
But

375
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,260
you're glowing despite of your ugliness.

376
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,050
You're shining out with great brilliancy.

377
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,460
Mr Tian.

378
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,050
I want to be your friend.

379
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,060
Will you please move your hands?

380
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,290
Our posture

381
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,270
is not decent at all.

382
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,490
Not decent at all.

383
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,180
Not decent at all.

384
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,050
Okay.

385
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,010
So, are you going to scan the code?

386
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,180
Scan what?

387
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,110
I mean the code on WeChat.

388
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,540
Don't you have it?

389
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,330
I don't mind adding you
on Facebook or Weibo.

390
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,030
How about QQ?

391
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,490
You have an account on QQ, right?

392
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,700
So, you don't even send emails?

393
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,010
What is the point of having
a mobile phone?

394
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,190
It's to make calls.

395
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,100
What's wrong?

396
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,580
Isn't it meant to make phone calls?

397
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,390
Yes.

398
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,290
Yes, it's meant to make phone calls.

399
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,310
This is my mobile number.

400
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,810
Keep it.

401
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,280
Don't forget to call me.

402
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,970
If...

403
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,610
I mean if...

404
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,210
If you missed a phone call,

405
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,570
what would you do?

406
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,060
It's okay.

407
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,090
You can write to me.

408
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,030
What's wrong with you?

409
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,130
What a boring life you're living!

410
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,740
That's not right.

411
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,500
I have my own favourite pastimes.

[Three Hundred Tang Poems]

414
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,090
How did you convince Xue

415
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,280
to change her quirky costumes?

416
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,910
It's a secret.

417
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,250
If Uncle Rao saw her now,

418
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,860
he'd be happy for sure.

419
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,150
Girls should have the freedom
to choose their own outfit,

420
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,500
their make up,

421
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,290
and their lifestyle.

422
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,290
Their mindset is ever changing

423
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,820
constantly.

424
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,950
Don't push her too hard.

425
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,610
Let her grow freely.

426
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,410
How about you?

427
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,580
What kind of outfit do you like?

428
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,700
What kind of make up do you enjoy?

429
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,210
What kind of life do you want to live?

430
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,260
Now?

431
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,490
Yes.

432
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,610
I like the doctor's robe.

433
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,570
I'm fine with
either light or heavy make up.

434

Heal the wounded and rescue the dying.

435

I want to be with my lover.

436
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,970
Have you realised all of them?

437
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,410
I think

438
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,530
I'm almost there.

439
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,650
I'm going to do laundry.

440
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,610
Who is going to do the dishes?

441
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,820
It's you for sure.

442
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,780
I cooked the noodles.

443
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,970
You should do the dishes.

444
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,300
I'm your landlord.

445
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,540
I have the immunity.

446
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,170
I'm your girlfriend.

447
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,210
Though...

448
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,290
It's only in name.

449
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,840
How about this?

450
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,990
Let's play a pushing game.

451
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,760
The loser
will have to do the dishes, okay?

452
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,780
That's not fair!

453
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,660
It's literally an imparity clause!

454
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,100
No way I can defeat you.

455
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,380
Then, just leave it there.

456
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,060
Well...

457
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,400
It'll stink!

458
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,520
I don't care.

459
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,720
Hold on.

460
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,910
Fine, let's do it.

461
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,100
I'm not afraid of you.

462
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,410
Come on.

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,990
It's a game between two gentlemen.

I was worried that

485
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,170
you would think that
I brought negative impact on it.

486
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,810

What do you mean?

488
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,210
If there is a lady

489
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,260
who has a broken heart

490
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,530

is she allowed to laugh?

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,260
Why not?

493
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,890
Others think that she asked to be hurt.

494
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,140
They even attacked her.

495
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,460
All the mishaps

496
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,170
were caused by herself.

497
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,980

but the victim
still suffers from the torment.

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,130

Who are "the others"?

501
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,450
No matter who they are,

502
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,700
they don't have
the right to judge and condemn

503
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,490
because they've never
gone through the suffering.

504
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,690
Don't mind them.

505
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,850

Ever since it came into my life,

519
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,340
I haven't had to recite poems to myself.

520
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,670
You have me.

521
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,240

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,940

Bye, Mr Tian.

527
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,060
Why don't you sit at the back?

528
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,940
It's safer.

529
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,960

for organ donation

541
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,190

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,420
[I'll be waiting for you in the OR.]

561
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,610
Sure.

562
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,570
Hold on!

563
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,650
Let's go.

564
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,070
[SUV no. C55400, reward...]

565
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,750
Isn't Zhang Yi Chi

566
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,690
a cardiac surgeon?

567
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,730
Why is he in charge
in the lung transplant surgery?

568
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,230
Many cardiac surgeons

569
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,970
know how to conduct thoracic surgery.

570
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,300
Dr Zhang

571
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,940
transferred from cardiothoracic surgery

572
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,930
to cardiac surgery
which is even more challenging.

573
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,090
He stands out because

574
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,270
it's rare to find someone
who can handle cardiac surgery

575
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,460
and cardiothoracic surgery
at the same time.

576
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,670
It's not achievable with

577
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,860
ordinary effort and experience.

578
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,930
One has to be really talented
to achieve that.

579
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,410
What's wrong?

580
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,290
The lung was removed
from the body at 10 a.m.

581
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,270
The lung arrived
at the airport at 11: 30 a.m.

582
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,980
and the flight took off at 12:00 p.m.

583
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,890
If the flight took two hours,

584
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,160
four hours
have been wasted on journey alone.

585
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,730
How long can the lung be kept?

586
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,860
From removal to implantation

587
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,300
and to hemoperfusion,

588
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,060
there is
a safe cold ischemia time interval.

589
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,500
The optimal time is six hours.

590
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,180
The maximum can go up to 12 hours.

591
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,020
Ruling out the procedure

592
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,170
which will take more than five hours,

593
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,540
the transportation of the lung

594
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,290
has to be limited within six hours.

595
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,760
Therefore, we're only left with

596
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,250
a maximum of two hours.

597
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,590
We must deliver the lung to the OR

598
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,660
before 4 p.m.

599
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,850
Can we make it?

600
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,730
Send a text message
to the doctor from the other side.

601
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,460
Tell him after he alights,

602
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,430
he should go to
the departure floor right away.

603
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,390
We'll leave right after we get the lung.

604
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,510
It's to save time.

605
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,700
Sure.

606
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,580
Thank you.

607
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,890
Goodbye.

608
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,820
Dr Zhang, we have received the lung.

609
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,060
We have just left the airport.

610
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,300
The estimated time of arrival is...

611
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,910
An hour.

612
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,300
We'll reach the hospital in an hour.

613
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,580
[Okay, got it.]

614
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,730
Let's begin.

615
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,190
The air capacity of the right lung
is weaker.

616
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,180
We should remove the right lung first.

617
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,370
Yes.

618
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,380
Chest expander.

619
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,890
Tighten it.

620
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,770
It's going to be rush hour soon.

621
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,170
We may get trapped in traffic.

622
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,740
Hold the safe tight.

623
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,120
Be careful!

624
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,580
Call Rao Feng now. Hurry!

625
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,770
Sure.

626
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:13,980
Rao Zhi!

627
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,730
Got it.

628
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,120
I'll bring my people there.

629
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,690
The nearby traffic police
will be there soon.

630
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,179
Stay safe.

631
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,450
The first branch of pulmonary artery

632
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,040
is cut off.

633
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,870
[Xiao Wang.]

634
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,180
Dr Zhang.

635
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,410
[Ask Chu Xia where she is.]

636
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,600
Sure.

637
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,310
We're at the coastal road.

638
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,380
Something unexpected happened.

639
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,650
We're trying our best to rush back.

640
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,130
Liang Mu Ze.

641
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,270
I can't take it anymore.

642
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,330
Watch out!

643
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,450
Watch out!

644
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,760
Are you okay?

645
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,820
What is the time now?

646
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,130
Can we summon a taxi?

647
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,650
We need to rush back to the hospital.

648
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,930
We'll talk about it later.

649
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,760
Come on.

650
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Hello.

651
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,590
This is my military identity card.

652
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,260
We're executing an urgent mission.

653
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,820
We need to deliver the lung
to 109 Hospital

654
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,830
within half an hour.

655
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,270
Let me send you there.

656
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,710
We're running out of time.
We can't afford to be trapped in traffic.

657
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,810
Is this your motorcycle?

658
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,630
Can I borrow it?

659
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,660
Sure, no problem.

660
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,070
I'll come back within half an hour.

661
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,030
I'll give a statement when I'm back.

662
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,050
Okay.

663
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,230
[Mission failed]

664
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,330
Getting ready to cut off pulmonary vein.

665
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,780
Is Xia Chu here yet?

666
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,050
Not yet.

667
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,660
Call her.

668
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,940
We tried to call her

669
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,380
but we couldn't reach her.

670
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,670
[Outpatient Department]

671
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,210
I'm sorry.

672
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,410
Thank goodness you're here.

673
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,480
Xia Chu.

674
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,560
Why are you here?

675
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,330
I have something to give you.

676
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,700
[If the 3D gun belongs to Zhuo Ran,]

677
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,070
[it's not difficult
to solve your problem.]

678
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,670
I heard that
you're raising a surgery fund

679
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,530
for a patient of yours on the Internet.

680
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,330
I would like to donate some money.

681
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,480
Please pass it to them.

682
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,850
Thank you.

683
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,620
I just went through an episode.

684
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,760
That's why I'm shaking.

685
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,090
Xia Chu.

686
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,950
Dr Zhang wants you
to come in and observe the surgery.

687
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,140
Hurry up.

688
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,250
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,290
I need to get changed.

690
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,660
Go on.

691
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,490
Dr Zhang.

692
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,830
What took you so long?

693
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,250
I fell into the sea.

694
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,890
You've worked hard.

695
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,730
That's my duty.

696
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,870
All right.

697
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,410
Get ready for the lung implantation.

698
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,620
Yes.

699
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,450
I'm going to leave the office soon.

700
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,670
How about you?

701
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,690
Have you forgotten?

702
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,250
"The Penalty Zone"
will be premiered tonight.

703
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,820
We're going for the movie, aren't we?

704
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,250
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,670
Something came up.

706
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,850
I have to work on it.

707
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,320
I shall skip the movie too.

708
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,590
[I'll bring supper to your company]

709
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,760
[and I'll wait for you.]

710
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,080
[What do you want to eat?]

711
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,150
It's okay.

712
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,580
[I prefer to work alone.]

713
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,780
That's all.

714
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,290
I have to go.
