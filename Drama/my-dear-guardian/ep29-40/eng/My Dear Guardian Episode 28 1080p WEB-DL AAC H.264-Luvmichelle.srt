[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,530
[He's the drug dealer's son.]

5
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,360
[I saw him when I was compiling
the materials.]

6
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,520
[He resembles you.]

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,770
[You told me]

8
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,080
[you had no siblings.]

9
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,900
[But as you know,]

10
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,479
[we journalists]

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,650
[have wide open minds.]

12
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,560
[For the whole afternoon,
I asked myself,]

13
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,570
[who was the man?]

14
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,200
[How is he related to you?]

15
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,730
[Perhaps]

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,010
[he was the reason you left
without a word.]

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,560
[Or perhaps]

18
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,800
[it was merely a coincidence.]

19
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,080
So it is you.

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,160
Zhuo Ran.

21
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,560
Uncle Rao.

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,650
You're awake.

23
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,720
Where's Xiao Xue?

24
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,890
She went to grab some breakfast.

25
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,960
Is Li Lei alright?

26
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,060
He's fine.

27
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,200
You may see him once you recover.

28
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,560
And the suspect?

29
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,240
Dead.

30
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,530
Take it easy.

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,890
You need rest.

32
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,160
Just lie down.

33
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,960
Dr Xia.

34
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,240
When can I get discharged?

35
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,770
You've suffered a serious concussion.

36
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,250
You need time to recuperate.

37
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,380
When you're ready to be discharged,

38
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,850
we'll let you know.

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,040
Be patient.

40
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,810
I have to go now.

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,440
I'll see you again.

42
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,200
Xiao Xue.

43
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,480
Rao's team has suffered
no serious injuries.

44
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,440
But you should remind him
to get more rest.

45
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,190
Got it.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,760
One more thing.

47
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,159
What is it?

48
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,280
Ke Wei's family

49
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,320
would like to visit the injured policemen.

50
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,080
That's not necessary.

51
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,330
I know it's a lot to ask

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,290
at a time like this.

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,330
But I have a feeling

54
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,920
the explosion

55
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,400
wasn't simply the act of a youngster.

56
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,280
Perhaps

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
there's a deeper reason behind it.

58
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,120
What reason?

59
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140
Ke Wei's screensaver

60
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,960
is a picture of a suicide victim

61
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,080
with the words, "The City of Desire."

62
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,490
The City of Desire?

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,960
Are you sure?

64
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,960
I've seen that picture.

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,010
Does "The City of Desire"

66
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,360
bear any significance?

67
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,640
Do you remember the assassin

68
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,130
who went after us last time?

69
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,159
His smartphone

70
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,320
had a picture of a dead body, too.

71
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,610
And the words, "The City of Desire."

72
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,520
The City of Desire is

73
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,400
a dark and unfathomable world.

74
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,409
How did you know?

75
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,640
Does your wound

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,400
have something to do with him?

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,810
Maybe.

78
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,320
Is it done?

79
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
Does it happen very often?

80
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,010
Not too often.

81
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,370
About as often as violence
against doctors.

82
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,280
Given our predicaments,

83
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,640
it'd be difficult

84
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,440
for us to be together.

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,440
We'll only know if we try.

86
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
Have you said that

87
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,450
to your language instructor?

88
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,420
No.

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,000
What about the nurses at Isaia?

90
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm going to see Rao Zhi.

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,560
It's not just the two of them, is it?

92
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,520
I only say that to you, Da Miao.

93
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,840
Dr Xia...

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,770
Dad?

95
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,160
What brings you here?

96
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,720
Hi, Mr Xia.

97
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,680
What's the matter?

98
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,440
Can't I visit you?

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

100
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,000
I'd like to speak with my daughter.

101
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,000
Go right ahead. I was
just about to leave.

102
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,200
Are you going to just stand there?

103
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,840
I'm worried you might not
want to see me.

104
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,130
Come here.

105
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,840
What did you get?

106
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,210
Sweet soy milk,

107
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,450
vegetarian noodles,

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,760
chicken potstickers,

109
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,080
and cold shredded potato.

110
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,960
That's a lot of food.

111
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,520
They're all your favourites.

112
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,360
You remembered.

113
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,400
I didn't.

114
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,760
I asked my mum.

115
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,240
She knows I'm injured?

116
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,280
Good.

117
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,600
What do you mean "good?"

118
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,680
It's not good at all.

119
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,640
I told my mum

120
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,930
I was getting all these goodies

121
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,580
to fatten you up

122
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,210
like a pig.

123
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,800
So you can't be a cop anymore.

124
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,930
That's so mean.

125
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,560
But

126
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,840
after I told that lie,

127
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,280
I realised something.

128
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,520
What did you realise?

129
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,640
I realised

130
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,800
why you wouldn't let me be with you.

131
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,090
Why you always tried to get rid of me

132
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,920
and told people I wasn't your daughter.

133
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,280
But it seems

134
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,920
you don't hate me all that much.

135
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,040
So are you going to listen
to me this time?

136
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,880
Never.

137
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,320
Xiao Xue.

138
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,590
By the way,

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,530
I finished the portrait

140
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,920
and gave it to your colleague.

141
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,780
That night,

142
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,690
I walked along the highway
by the coast.

143
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,090
When I entered the tunnel,

144
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,280
I saw a man driving past.

145
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,920
Did he see you?

146
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,420
No.

147
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,880
The tunnel was pitch black.

148
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,720
What happened next?

149
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,400
Then I fell asleep.

150
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,980
When I woke up, I was already
in the ER.

151
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,370
A man named Zhuo Ran
brought me there.

152
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,740
He's Xia Chu's first boyfriend.

153
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,050
You know that, don't you?

154
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,530
As for what happened between

155
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,840
the tunnel and the ER,

156
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,720
I haven't the slightest impression.

157
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,410
Around what time was it?

158
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,620
I mean

159
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,800
when you saw the man in the tunnel.

160
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,250
Nine.

161
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,800
I was listening to a music station.

162
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,090
There was a time announcement.

163
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,680
Nine o'clock.

164
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,040
A man.

165
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,680
Zhuo Ran.

166
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,690
The suspect

167
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,080
has a history of substance abuse
in the public.

168
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,360
During his rehabilitation,

169
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,010
he would often

170
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,480
log in to the City of Desire,

171
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,560
exposing himself to the temptation
of drugs.

172
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,500
He received

173
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,260
a list of instructions for a game.

174
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,340
The instructions

175
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,900
are linked to the explosion.

176
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,210
The man who gave the instructions

177
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,490
is none other than the elusive

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,420
Scary Pirate.

179
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,440
The only person

180
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,820
who may have had dealings

181
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,460
with the Scary Pirate

182
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,460
is the drug dealer

183
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,860
who transacted with him
in Yunshan Tunnel.

184
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,000
According to the sketch
provided by witnesses,

185
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,400
we've ascertained

186
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,400
the suspect's identity.

187
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,540
Well?

188
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,680
I am

189
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,970
of some use to you, aren't I?

190
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,480
To me,

191
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,720
you're more than just a useful companion.

192
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,200
Xiao Xue,

193
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,280
go back to the US.

194
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,040
I don't want to.

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,400
I want to stay by your side

196
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,760
at least until you've fully recovered.

197
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,680
What are you writing?

198
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,840
How's your dad?

199
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,800
He's fine.

200
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,040
Good.

201
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,040
Are you

202
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,200
writing a love letter for me?

203
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,580
No.

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,440
Liang Mu Ze.

205
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,560
Where did you get this?

206
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,970
I met a woman,

207
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,420
an ex-accountant

208
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,840
who is now a transplant coordinator.

209
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,410
She was talking about

210
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,800
the importance of organ donation.

211
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,560
So I got a copy from her.

212
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,290
Are you going to donate your organs?

213
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,290
Ever since my near-fatal experience

214
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,560
with the gunshot wound,

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,680
I've been thinking about it.

216
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,970
You were shot before?

217
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,100
Here.

218
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,790
Xiao Xue.

219
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,240
Xiao Xue.

220
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Xiao Xue.

221
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,930
Xiao Xue, don't...

222
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,560
Let me hear

223
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,360
what your heart

224
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,080
has to say.

225
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,080
People are looking.

226
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,880
This is embarrassing.

227
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,480
I get it now.

228
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,400
Your heart told me everything.

229
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,680
It knows you're accustomed to being alone

230
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,240
and watching "Aberdeen"

231
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,200
and it's all for it.

232
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,290
Send me to the subway station.

233
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,680
The Captain isn't around.

234
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,560
I can't leave my post.

235
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,970
Sorry.

236
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,360
You may go.

237
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,050
Captain.

238
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,330
Don't go home.

239
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,760
Come to the guest house

240
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,280
and have a good night's sleep.

241
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,480
Send her to the subway.

242
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,160
Okay.

243
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,690
Go on.

244
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,760
Thanks, Captain.

245
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,770
You came here just for this?

246
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,240
Do you think it's a small matter?

247
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,450
It's no big deal, really.

248
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,140
See?

249
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,690
I'm still alive and well.

250
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,120
Rest assured.

251
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,800
I can't.

252
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,040
The explosion incident aside,

253
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,760
you should count your lucky stars
that you're still alive.

254
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,410
When I heard you were

255
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,690
fooling around with that military guy,

256
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,920
a hundred fears came to my mind.

257
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,260
Dad,

258
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,660
how can you say that?

259
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,360
What do you mean "fooling around?"

260
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,570
Liang Mu Ze is

261
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,890
an upright soldier.

262
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,700
During my stay at his house,

263
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,020
he treated me with the utmost respect.

264
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,330
And we're getting along happily.

265
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,850
Honey,

266
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,320
that's just a man's trick.

267
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,900
If he doesn't throw you a bone,

268
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,120
how can he trick you
into becoming his girlfriend?

269
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,250
We've been over this.

270
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,330
I only pretended to be his girlfriend

271
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,860
to appease his mother.

272
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,830
Wait...

273
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,850
That's even more absurd.

274
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,050
Why is he using my daughter

275
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,570
to appease his mother?

276
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,320
You call that respect?

277
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,640
Happily, you say?

278
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,980
I think,

279
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,740
just like me,

280
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,440
you've let all the studying
mess you up.

281
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,690
I can't speak for you,

282
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,360
but I'm sure I'm not messed up.

283
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,180
I know better than anyone

284
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,840
what kind of person Liang Mu Ze is.

285
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,770
I admit I've mishandled

286
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,210
the whole girlfriend charade.

287
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,050
But

288
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,970
now,

289
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,130
I'm seriously considering

290
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,840
becoming his girlfriend for real.

291
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,100
Do you dare?

292
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,180
We're both single adults.
What's there to be afraid of?

293
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,400
You...

294
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,960
Change careers.

295
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,760
What?

296
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,200
I want you to change careers
and come back to Dong'an with me.

297
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,500
Is this a joke?

298
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,810
I'm not joking.

299
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,579
You encouraged me to study medicine.

300
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,970
You encouraged me to come
to Ningjiang.

301
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,980
You encouraged me

302
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,220
to see the world.

303
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,329
Now look what happened.

304
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,130
The daughter I worked so hard to raise

305
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,770
is going to become a wife
of a soldier

306
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,490
and a slave to his lifestyle.

307
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,650
I won't.

308
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,900
If you choose Liang Mu Ze,

309
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,130
that will be your future.

310
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,920
You'll be wasting your life!

311
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,770
Then

312
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,180
why can't I be selfish

313
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,640
and keep you by my side?

314
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,260
At least I can

315
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,770
give you a peaceful life

316
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,240
and you won't have to live in fear
with him.

317
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,840
I have work to do.

318
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,230
Dad,

319
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,530
let's talk

320
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,090
later.

321
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm off.

322
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,650
Goodbye.

323
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,800
Can't you send me to the camp?

324
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,050
The Captain only let me send you
to the subway station.

325
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,400
It's not like he'll know.

326
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,280
But I do.

327
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,760
Can't you pretend you don't know?

328
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,360
I can't.

329
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,280
Bullheaded fool.

330
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,250
What did you say?

331
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,210
I said you're bullheaded.

332
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,880
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,280
The Captain said I could send
you to the subway station.

334
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,240
But he didn't say whether
it's the starting station

335
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,680
or the destination station.

336
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,440
What are you, my chauffeur?

337
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,950
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

338
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,440

♫ Every minute, every second,

You gave me an hourglass,

349
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,240
so I'm giving you a watch.

350
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,530
This way, we'll

351
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,000
live in each other's pockets.

352
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,880

Right here?

364
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,530
Yes.

♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

366
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,490

That's not I mean. I...

368
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,980
I mean, isn't it

369
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,220
a little crowded here?

370
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,450
You're too self-conscious.

371
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,620
Everyone's looking at their phones.

372
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,000

Do a blood test first.

378
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,420
Come back to me

379
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,600
once you have the results.

380
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,330
Thanks, doctor.

381
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,300
You're welcome.

382
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,840
Next.

383
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,920
What seems to be the problem?

384
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,930
I have a heart ache.

385
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,330
What are you doing here?

386
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,080
What do you mean?

387
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,810
I got a number.

388
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,330
I can't see my daughter

389
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,160
and I can't see a doctor?

390
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,690
After such a dire experience,

391
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,820
if he really loves you,

392
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,530
he should

393
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,480
try to get recalled.

394
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,370
Instead of making you

395
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,840
endure danger here.

396
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,810
I'm not staying here

397
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,050
because of him

398
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,740
but for my job.

399
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,010
Think,

400
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,380
what has he ever done for you

401
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,730
while you were together?

402
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,720
What about you?

403
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,410
You've been married to mum
for so many years.

404
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,090
What have you done for her?

405
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,330
If women were rational,

406
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,120
all men would be single forever.

407
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,320
I treat your mum just fine.

408
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,960
This is the EICU. No entry.

409
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,680
[Emergency Intensive Care Unit]

410
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,450
Honey.

411
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,610
Honey.

412
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,850
I'll send you the photo
once I've cleaned it up.

413
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,720
No need to.

414
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,930
All I did was kiss you.

415
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,360
Don't be mad.

416
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm not mad.

417
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,130
Then I'll kiss you again and see.

418
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,040
Xiao Xue.

419
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,880
Knock it off.

420
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,170
I'm just pulling your leg. Come on.

421
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,400
Do you remember the way home?

422
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,400
Sure.

423
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,240
Get off at the third bus stop,
take a rickshaw,

424
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,930
walk for around ten minutes,

425
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,680
and I should be there by sundown.

426
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,000
Why don't I give you a ride?

427
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,600
Lieutenant, you're the best!

428
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,840
Let's go.

429
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,220
You walk in front.

430
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,600
I'll follow behind you.

431
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,760
Okay.

432
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,770
♫ All I need ♫

433
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,860
♫ Is a plain old hug ♫

434
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,870
♫ But I am too shy ♫

435
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,980
♫ I hide behind formalities ♫

436
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,370
♫ Politely greeting you in my soft voice ♫

437
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,780
♫ I wave goodbye, trying to run away ♫

438
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,980
♫ I can't avoid it, it wraps around me
like the wind ♫

439
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,490
I have a gift for you.

440
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,480
A gift? What kind of gift?

441
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,570
But I'm afraid you might
scoff at it.

442
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,700
Fret not, I'll definitely scoff at it.

443
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,080
So just let me see it.

444
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,440
What's this?

445
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,440
Last time, you said the heart protector
was too ugly.

446
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,740
I got some Dyneema

447
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,410
from an old army friend

448
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,260
who works at a defence manufacturer

449
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,440
and made a bulletproof vest for you.

450
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,010
Is the look

451
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,440
acceptable for you?

452
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,480
No.

453
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,890
Xiao Xue.

454
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,610
This is made from the most advanced
bulletproof material in the world.

455
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,800
It's incredibly light

456
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,170
and soft.

457
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,820
Of course, on such short notice,

458
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,640
the workmanship may be a little sloppy.

459
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,480
But I hope you'll accept it.

460
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,410
Stop laughing.

461
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,640
You must wear it when you go out.

462
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,920
Promise me

463
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,680
you'll wear it when you go out, okay?

464
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,040
That way,

465
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,120
Officer Rao can have peace of mind.

466
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,200
Is that the only reason?

467
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,480
Don't move!

468
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,570
What's that sound?

469
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,690
Stay here.

470
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,880
Tian Yong!

471
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,230
Don't move!

472
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,120
Stand right there!

473
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,840
Tian Yong!

474
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,080
What happened to you?

475
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,560
Wake up, Tian Yong.

476
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,520
Wake up, wake up.

477
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm okay.

478
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,370
You gave me such a fright.

479
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,920
I wasn't lying.

480
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,930
It is handy.

481
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,360
But it's so ugly.

482
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,130
It's alright.

483
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,560
Just relax.

484
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,200
Relax, take a deep breath.

485
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,960
Come on, breathe in.

486
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,400
Relax. Everything's alright.

487
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,250
What's the situation?

488
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,440
The pregnant lady is having a severe
haemorrhage due to trauma.

489
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,570
She had five years of substance abuse,

490
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,330
one ectopic pregnancy,

491
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,170
two successful labours.

492
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
This is her third pregnancy,

493
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,040
but we've lost the baby's heartbeat.

494
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,730
Ask the anaesthesiologist and the
Neonatology Department

495
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,930
to prepare for surgery.

496
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,610
Leave it to me.

497
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,580
Okay.

498
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,120
Dr Xia.

499
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,240
Coming through! Please move aside.

500
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,330
Can you hear me?

501
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,210
If you can,

502
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,440
grab my hand.

503
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,090
Set up the blood transfusion.

504
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,410
Ask Orthopaedics, General Surgery,

505
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,410
and ICU for a treatment plan.

506
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,580
And call Dr Song.

507
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,550
Okay.

508
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,930
Ye Feng's family?

509
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,240
That's us.

510
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,680
Foot the bill.

511
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,170
Doctor,

512
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,040
how's his condition?

513
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,130
Don't worry,

514
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,760
we'll do our best to save him.

515
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,640
Captain.

516
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,120
Are you okay?

517
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm okay.

518
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,140
Xiao Xue is back at the camp.

519
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,970
I know.

520
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,360
She phoned me.

521
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,290
What about Boss?

522
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,680
He's inside.

523
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,490
What are they discussing?

524
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,920
I don't know.

525
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,080
Liang Mu Ze

526
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,650
comes from a long line
of soldiers.

527
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,560
He certainly has the discipline
of a military man.

528
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,380
Not only was he trained

529
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,440
in the Hunter Military School in Isaia,

530
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,640
he was

531
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,480
one of the top scorers among the fourteen

532
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,840
who graduated.

533
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,730
As Commandos Team Thunder's captain,

534
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,010
he has extensive experience

535
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,250
on the battlefield.

536
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,200
To be honest,

537
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,650
I'd like to have

538
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,280
someone who's as capable
as him

539
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,010
but less conspicuous.

540
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,810
This officer named Tian Yong,

541
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,780
why are his place of birth
and family details

542
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,970
unspecified?

543
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,760
He's an orphan.

544
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,250
He'll be discharged this year.

545
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,840
The paperwork is underway.

546
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,680
What happened to the pregnant woman?

547
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,880
She's in the ER.

548
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,570
She's well into her term.

549
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,680
Tian Yong.

550
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,120
I...

551
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,080
I feel I could've stopped her...

552
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,130
She was bleeding badly.

553
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,680
What if

554
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,480
she gives birth prematurely?

555
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,640
She's a drug dealer.

556
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,400
She shot at you.

557
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,380
You did nothing wrong.

558
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,570
If it weren't for you,

559
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,580
it'd be Xiao Xue

560
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,770
who's in the operating room
right now.

561
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,440
I understand.

562
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm just worried about her baby.

563
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,880
Whether it'll

564
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,040
see its mother

565
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,760
when it comes out.

566
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't take it.

567
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,160
Lieutenant Tian.

568
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,890
Here.

569
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,860
Please come in.

570
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes.

571
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,530
[General Conference Room]

572
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,400
Chief.

573
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,449
That was a good showing today.

574
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,250
Sir,

575
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,659
I was merely helping
a fellow law enforcer

576
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,840
on the arrest.

577
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,920
Do you know who you arrested?

578
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,330
His name is Li Zhi Peng.

579
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,260
In name,

580
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,460
he's the owner of a youth hostel.

581
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,340
But behind the curtain,

582
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,409
he's a drug dealer.

583
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,320
Do you still remember

584
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,530
the mission at the bar?

585
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,500
I do.

586
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,170
Both parties did not show up
for the deal

587
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,280
and the mission was called off.

588
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,480
Wrong.

589
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,659
They completed their transaction

590
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,850
in Yunshan Tunnel instead.

591
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,280
One of the parties was Li Zhi Peng.

592
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,520
The other party, whom he had
contacted online,

593
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,960
goes by the online ID

594
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,719
of Scary Pirate.

595
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,290
Ever heard of the City of Desire?

596
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,850
It's the biggest

597
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,480
online drug trading platform.

598
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,060
Director,

599
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,330
Tian Yong seldom uses the internet,

600
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,760
let alone the dark web.

601
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,400
So are you familiar with
the Old Master?

602
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,120
Who is that?

603
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,920
Remember the villagers

604
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,810
you captured at the border

605
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,570
with the Border Armed Police?

606
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,080
According to them,

607
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,690
they were coerced into
drug trafficking

608
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,850
by someone

609
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,240
called Old Master.

610
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't know him.

611
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,640
Nobody knows who he is.

612
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,730
The man

613
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,200
is highly elusive.

614
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,040
His power spreads across
Southeast Asia.

615
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,170
He's now

616
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,740
the true leader of the

617
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,450
international mercenary group, T4.

618
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,420
Explosives.

619
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,460
Drugs.

620
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,450
Human

621
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,600
and organ trafficking.

622
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,930
If there's money in it,

623
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,040
they'd do it.

624
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,050
They've become a cancer

625
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,360
upon the border.

626
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,620
Three months ago,

627
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,210
we arrested a drug dealer.

628
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,810
His name was Liu Zheng Min.

629
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,160
And it's all

630
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,010
related to the Scary Pirate?

631
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,980
That's right.

632
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,490
We've been

633
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,130
having trouble figuring out

634
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,320
the Scary Pirate's real identity.

635
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,920
But recently,

636
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,460
one of the Old Master's henchmen

637
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,360
approached the police

638
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,320
and offered to become an informant.

639
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,160
Is Old Master the Scary Pirate?

640
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,360
We're still verifying it.

641
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,690
We're going to use

642
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,980
Li Zhi Peng, whom we've captured today,

643
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,520
to contact the Scary Pirate

644
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,860
through the City of Desire,

645
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,000
and tell him

646
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,730
we have a huge amount of cash

647
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,480
that we need moving.

648
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,020
Then?

649
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,100
Then once the target takes the bait,

650
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,320
you'll be their point of contact.

651
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,490
Me?

652
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,480
Yes.

653
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,960
They need someone

654
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,100
with the single combat skills
and field experience

655
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,330
of a special forces soldier

656
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,730
yet do not belong

657
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,000
to the police force.

658
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,720
And my mission is?

659
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,690
Your mission is

660
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,280
to find evidence

661
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,640
that can prove the Scary Pirate's
real identity.

662
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,380
At the same time,

663
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,680
find out the Old Master's whereabouts.

664
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,680
Tian Yong,

665
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,250
any questions?

666
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,490
Feel free to ask.

667
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,980
Chief,

668
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,620
are they the culprits

669
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,760
behind today's incident?

670
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,640
In a certain way,

671
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,900
yes.

672
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,000
I have no other questions.

673
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,440
You must not fail!

674
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,480
Captain,

675
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,450
has Rao Feng come to?

676
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,260
He has.

677
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,760
Take me to him.

678
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,920
What about Tian Yong?

679
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,570
Tian Yong stays here.

680
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,850
He has a new mission.

681
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,200
Alright.

682
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,720
Why did they release me?

683
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,900
They don't have

684
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,800
solid evidence of your crime.

685
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,640
Besides, you're a foreign citizen.

686
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,930
Did you think they were

687
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,320
going to keep you for the New Year?

688
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,650
Even though I'm free,

689
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,320
it doesn't mean I'm safe.

690
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm guessing

691
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,440
they'll be watching me 24-7.

692
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,850
We've received the order

693
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,640
to form

694
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,040
a joint task force with
your police department.

695
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,640
The idea

696
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,600
is to cast a wide net,

697
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,240
so we can catch him and the mastermind

698
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,690
in one go.

699
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,200
I'll ask my informants

700
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,160
to give their full support.

701
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,520
Good.

702
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,000
Relax.

703
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,370
We've been under their surveillance

704
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,920
for a couple of days now

705
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,520
and we're perfectly fine.

706
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,600
Any news from Old Master?

707
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,610
Do you know

708
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,200
what happened while you were in

709
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,640
the Public Security Bureau?

710
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,840
Somebody blew up

711
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,280
Liang Mu Ze's neighbourhood.

712
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,240
The Old Master ordered it

713
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,800
despite knowing you were there.

714
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,920
What are you getting at?

715
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,370
Of course, he did it

716
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,520
to get back at the police
for taking his goods.

717
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,890
He doesn't need to care

718
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,320
about the consequences

719
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,920
of ruffling the police's feathers.

720
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,640
After all,

721
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,880
he's abroad.

722
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,170
And to him,

723
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,960
your life

724
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,280
isn't worth a penny.

725
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,900
Guess

726
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,440
what the police

727
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,730
are going to do next?

728
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,320
I'm not going to guess.

729
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,850
And you can stop

730
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,560
trying to turn me against Old Master.

731
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,400
Do you think I'm stupid?

732
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,770
When I joined Old Master,

733
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,400
you were just a little baby.

734
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,280
Let me tell you,

735
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,340
if Old Master finds out

736
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,120
what you're doing behind his back,

737
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,400
you're dead meat.

738
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,390
[Rescue Room]

739
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,010
Why don't I book a flight

740
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,720
back to Dong'an for you?

741
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,240
No.

742
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,450
Are you okay with

743
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,450
leaving Miss Lan alone at home?

744
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,160
Your grandma and grandpa
are there.

745
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,410
They'll keep her company.

746
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,800
Listen here,

747
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,930
you can't come to Ningjiang
and ruin my day

748
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,680
just to avoid Grandpa, can you?

749
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,260
Why would I avoid him?

750
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,570
It's my house.

751
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,480
Sure, it's your house.

752
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,000
What about your department?

753
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,520
And your project?

754
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,740
You're always here with me.

755
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,650
Don't you have work?

756
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,250
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

757
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,100
Look,

758
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,290
this is about you.

759
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,800
Don't talk about me.

760
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,930
Let me tell you,

761
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,200
ever since you were little,

762
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,410
I've fulfilled every promise

763
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,140
I've made to you, haven't I?

764
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,600
So today, you must promise

765
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,340
to quit right now and move back

766
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,250
to Dong'an.

767
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,720
I will not allow you to see
Liang Mu Ze.

768
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,200
Hey,

769
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,740
what's gotten into you?

770
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,480
Are you having difficulties?

771
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,970
Why are you so stubborn?

772
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,660
Because we're old

773
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,360
and we can't have anything happen to you!

774
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,840
I'll go back to the hotel.

775
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,120
We'll talk when you're off work.

776
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,480
Dad...

777
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,040
Dr Zhang.

778
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,080
Xia Chu.

779
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,450
What happened to the pregnant woman

780
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,570
who lost her baby's pulse yesterday?

781
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,360
The caesarean caused too much bleeding.

782
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,690
The mother passed away,

783
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,320
leaving behind a pair of twins.

784
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,640
Twins?

785
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,580
Yes.

786
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,800
And they're adorable.

787
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,540
But they're showing signs

788
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,010
of neonatal withdrawal syndrome.

789
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,250
We're keeping them in an incubator

790
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,890
and giving them intensive care

791
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,040
and withdrawal treatment.

792
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,010
You may visit them when you're free.

793
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,140
Alright.

794
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,720
I know.

795
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,130
Don't worry.

796
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,360
I've taken the immunoglobulin shot.

797
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,200
Once the results are out,

798
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,640
I'll let you know.

799
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,720
I have work to do.

800
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,440
I'll talk to you later.

801
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,720
Bye.

802
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,320
Xia Chu?

803
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,880
What happened?

804
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,260
The other day

805
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,970
we were operating on Ke Wei.

806
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,880
Turned out

807
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,600
that he had Hepatitis B.

808
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,650
He was writhing about during the surgery,

809
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,680
so we went up and held him down.

810
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,930
His blood was everywhere

811
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,600
and we were close to his body.

812
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,440
Did you get tested?

813
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,760
I had my blood taken.

814
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,900
But the doctor at the
Pathology Department said

815
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,020
even if it turns out negative,

816
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,600
we can't be 100 percent sure.

817
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,200
I have to get tested a few more times.

818
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,600
I was on the phone with my parents.

819
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,170
I couldn't hold it anymore

820
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,890
and told them everything.

821
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,290
But after I did,

822
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,840
I really wish I hadn't.

823
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,890
Ever since I went to university,

824
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,560
I haven't done a thing for my family.

825
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,890
If I'm infected,

826
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,650
what will become of them?

827
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,720
Actually, it could be worse.

828
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,570
After all, during the surgery,

829
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,490
I didn't contact the wound directly.

830
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,610
It's mainly psychological damage.

831
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,560
But poor Dr Zhang,

832
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,400
he was the one who conducted
the surgery.

833
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,490
And

834
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,770
I think he pricked his fingers
with the haemostatic forceps.

835
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,360
What happened to him?

836
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,200
Nothing serious.

837
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,400
But he's always in the operating room
or by the patient's bed.

838
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,520
He's been seeing more patients
than usual.

839
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,100
We're really worried

840
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,560
that he might break down.
