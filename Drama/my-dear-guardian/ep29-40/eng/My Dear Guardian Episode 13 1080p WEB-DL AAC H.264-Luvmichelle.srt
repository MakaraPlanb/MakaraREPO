00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,770
[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,280
[She has her own reason.]

5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,690
[The medicine she replaced]

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,650
[did not cause major harm]

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,160
[to the person who took it.]

8
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,870
[It is not poisonous,]

9
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,280
[but it's not completely safe either.]

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,520
[The most important thing]

11
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,970
[is there's an overdose of adjuvant,]

12
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,840
[called Aristolochia.]

13
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,200
[Long-term use of this medicine]

14
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,640
[will increase the risk of liver cancer.]

15
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,200
[The inside of the tablet is porous,]

16
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,810
[it dissolves easily in water]

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,370
[and is convenient
for patients to swallow.]

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,560
[This is the characteristic
of a medicine produced by 3D printing.]

19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,110
Medicine produced by 3D printing?

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,720
[In 12th grade,]

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,000
[there was a transfer student
in our school.]

22
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,640
[He was sitting beside me.]

23
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,250
[One day,]

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,079
[he disappeared from our school.]

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,870
[I couldn't find him anywhere.]

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,810
[All I could do]

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,079
[was reading all the detective novels
he gave to me.]

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,230
[I even hoped]

29
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,890
[that one day,]

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,970
[I'd see his name]

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,480
[on the cover of a detective novel,]

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,320
[Zhuo Ran.]

33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,410
[He's neither a writer]

34
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,720
[nor a soldier now,]

35
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,160
[but running a 3D printing company.]

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,520
[He's a boss now.]

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,160
[Is this man from your hospital?]

38
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,210
[No.]

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,130
[Their company]

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,430
[set up a foundation ]

41
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,130
[called Public Interest Research Fund
in our hospital.]

42
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,150
[That day,]

43
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,120
[Xia Chu's friend wanted to interview me.]

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,410
[So she filmed some stuff.]

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,990
[I didn't know
that she'd use all the contents.]

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,190
[Xia Chu's friend?]

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,560
[Mi Gu?]

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,760
[Yes.]

49
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,790
We have an answer
regarding the medicine swap.

50
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,170
[There's a problem with the medicine,]

51
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,600
[but it is not fatal
in a short period of time.]

52
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,370
So right now,

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,360
we can't determine
the nature of this matter.

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,010
I need you

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,360
to investigate someone for me.

56
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,110
Is it related to the medicine swap?

57
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,090
[Yes.]

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,970
Okay.

59
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,690
Send me his basic information.

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,660
Okay.

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,610
Brigade Commander,

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,330
this is the summary report
of the previous anti-flood rescue,

63
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,640
please have a look.

64
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,200
Leave it here.

65
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,800
This is an urgent task
the superior has just assigned.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,950
Security at a medical conference?

67
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,150
Isn't the Public Security Bureau

68
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,880
in charge of security?

69
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,960
This is a special case.

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,010
It's related to the international
terrorist organization, T4

71
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,370
which you and Tian Yong

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,640
met in Isaia.

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,000
Attention!

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,970
Commandos Team Thunder is ordered
by the superior

75
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,370
to send elite personnel

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,680
to the hotel to facilitate their security.

77
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,200
Liang Mu Ze will be the captain.

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,320
With the anti-terrorism experience we have
over the years,

79
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,920
we will assist the police's deployment

80
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,390
by supplying technology and workforce,

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,000
to ensure the safety of the guests.

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,600
If you find
any suspicious situation or person,

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,320
you can take action

84
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,840
before reporting.

85
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,610
I'm Liang Mu Ze,
captain of Commandos Team Thunder,

86
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,120
Code name, Whale.

87
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm in charge

88
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,159
of the command and operations
in this operation.

89
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,390
Lieutenant of Thunder, Tian Yong
will assist the police

90
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,970
in monitoring the vehicles

91
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,240
entering and exiting
the hotel and parking areas.

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,810
Our team members, Xiao Teng
and Xiang Yang

93
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,640
will work with the security personnel

94
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,610
and watch the people

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,030
in the hotel.

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,360
All teams of Thunder 99
will stay at their current positions.

97
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,250
Two people will take lunch break
at a time.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,560
Take turns
and eat in the in-house restaurant.

99
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,070
Mu Ze,

100
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,270
I've sent someone
to check with the front desk.

101
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,730
This man has booked a long-term stay

102
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,230
in a suite in this hotel.

103
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,490
Every week,

104
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,430
he'd stay here for three to four nights.

105
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,720
Is this the man you asked me

106
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,800
to investigate?

107
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

108
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,990
What a coincidence.

109
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,310
He's also here today.

110
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,920
If you're concerned about him,

111
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,080
we can go on the intranet

112
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,400
and look for his information again.

113
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,880
Okay.

114
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,680
[Zhuo Ran, where are you?]

115
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,370
[I'm at the door of the hotel,]

116
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,409
[I'll go through the security check
in a while.]

117
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,120
[Wait for me at the lobby.]

118
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,670
Sure.

119
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,440
Let's start.

120
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,460
Wen.

121
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,970
Qin, film the cars first.

122
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,929
Go to the banquet hall
and secure a good position for us.

123
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,080
Alright, got it.

124
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,950
Zhuo Ran!

125
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,930
You will be the press too for today,

126
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,160
but just an intern.

127
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll be learning from you.

128
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,310
Fox here,

129
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,890
target met someone

130
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,880
[and got a press pass.]

131
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,960
Copy that.

132
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,610
In the database,

133
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,510
there is not much information
about Zhuo Ran.

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,440
From what we found,

135
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,590
he appears to be

136
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,790
an average Vitalik businessman.

137
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,650
He studied industrial design in Germany.

138
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,690
After he graduated,

139
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,000
he started his own 3D printing company.

140
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,410
The headquarters

141
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,830
is also based in Vitalik.

142
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,030
Recently, he's expanded his business
in Chinese mainland.

143
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,170
Why would he need a press pass

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,110
for a summit meeting?

145
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,370
Judging from this,

146
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,510
he sure has some motive.

147
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,040
However,

148
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,370
he might share the same motive

149
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,230
with all the other businessmen,

150
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,770
that is to take this opportunity

151
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,130
to get more insights and information.

152
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,480
At the same time,

153
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,520
expanding his network and social circle.

154
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,800
What's wrong?

155
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,250
Xiao Xue has landed.

156
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

157
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay.

158
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,090
Dad.

159
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,130
Cheeky girl,

160
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,760
why is it so noisy over there?

161
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,090
[I'm at the airport.]

162
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,690
[I'm picking someone up for my friend.]

163
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,120
You're at the airport?

164
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,470
I've just left the airport.

165
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,690
Was it Ningjiang Airport?

166
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,160
Yes,
I came to Ningjiang for a business trip.

167
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,450
Do you have time

168
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,440
to have dinner with me?

169
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,130
I'm afraid I can't.

170
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,810
I have to be on duty today.

171
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,440
On duty again?

172
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,320
Staying up late is bad for your health.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,090
I'm fine. Don't worry.

174
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,450
How long will you be here?

175
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,650
Over a week.

176
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,610
I'm here for a conference

177
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,640
and giving speeches
at several partner universities.

178
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,030
So I'm not in a hurry.

179
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,210
Perhaps I could make time

180
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,560
and visit you in the hospital.

181
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,770
Sure.

182
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,490
Dad, I need to hang up.

183
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,090
The person I'm picking up
should come out anytime soon.

184
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,280
See you.

185
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,470
Alright.

186
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,110
Don't always stay up late,
drink more water.

187
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,280
[Got it. Bye-bye.]

188
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,000
Cheeky girl.

189
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,520
She's even busier than I am.

190
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,230
[Liang Shao Xue]

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,170
[Liang Shao Xue]

192
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,120
Liang Mu Ze,

193
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,240
has Liang Shao Xue contacted you?

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,250
[Liang Shao Xue]

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,250
Is this Liang Shao Xue?

196
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,590
Where are you?

197
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,080
What?

198
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,640
You know what?

199
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,650
I came in to clean this cubicle,

200
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,200
who knows
she's sleeping on the toilet seat.

201
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,890
She didn't even close the door.

202
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,050
She never reacted.

203
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,330
If you hadn't called,

204
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,240
I would've called the police.

205
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,510
Thank you.

206
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,840
However,

207
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,670
now I'm not sure

208
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,080
if she's the person
I'm supposed to pick up.

209
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,960
Aren't you picking up Liang Shao Xue?

210
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah.

211
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,470
She is Liang Shao Xue. Look.

212
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,790
This is unbelievable.

213
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,400
She's had work done, hasn't she?

214
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,510
Why are you staring at me?
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,270
Where is my cellphone?

216
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,920
It's here. Give me.

217
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,870
Thank you.

218
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,760
Are you Xia Chu?

219
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,920
What took you so long?
I've waited forever.

220
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,850
I'm the one who waited forever.

221
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,970
You fell asleep on the toilet seat.

222
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,930
Really?

223
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,640
Fine. I forgive you.

224
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,040
Hang on.

225
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,800
Are you really

226
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,960
Liang Shao Xue?

227
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,000
Otherwise,
who would want to be this unlucky girl?

228
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,840
Don't get me wrong.

229
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,560
I just think

230
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,710
that you look different from the photo.

231
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,530
I'm afraid I might pick up
the wrong person,

232
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,320
so I need to confirm.

233
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,610
Don't worry, you're not wrong.

234
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,850
People grow up.

235
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,510
You donâ€™t look like the fertilized egg
you used to be now.

236
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,600
That's me.

237
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,550
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

238
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,970
Have a pleasant trip.

239
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,000
Sure.

240
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,530
Hi, I'm Liang Shao Xue.

241
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,160
It's the one
that Dr Letney asked me to adopt.

242
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,560
Its quarantine should have ended today,
right?

243
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,800
I have arrived in Ningjiang.

244
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,400
I can pick it up now.

245
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,890
What?

246
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,360
It's lost?

247
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,250
How could you lose such a big parrot?

248
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,400
Are you not
a professional pet care agency?

249
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,520
When did this happen?

250
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,850
Did you look for it?

251
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,030
Send more people to look for it!

252
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,090
Where is it now?

253
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,290
Hold on! Your luggage!

254
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,840
You guys are unreliable!

255
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,950
Your luggage!

256
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,520
Come back! Where are you going?

257
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,040
Come back!

258
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,950
Your luggage!

259
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,540
[Liang Shao Xue]

260
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,440
[The number you have dialled
is not available.]

261
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,520
[Braised Egg]

262
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,640
[Mr Zhang]

263
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,640
Mr Zhang.

264
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,870
Okay, I'll be right there.

265
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,650
Liang Shao Xue has left.

266
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,240
There's definitely
something wrong with her.

267
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,000
But I'm out of my mind as well.

268
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,450
I was on a night shift
and I haven't even slept a wink.

269
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,930
But I came to the airport
to pick up your sister.

270
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,730
Now I have to go back to the hospital.

271
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,520
Clean up the mess yourself.

272
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,960
Are you okay?

273
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,040
Okay, okay.

274
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,190
Call the police.

275
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,530
Okay, okay.

276
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,490
Okay, I'm fine.

277
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,359
Okay? I'm asking you to call the police.

278
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,430
My phone is dead,
you should make the call.

279
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,690
It's okay.
It was nothing, don't call the police.

280
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,130
Just go, miss. Go.

281
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,730
No way! My car is rented.

282
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,320
I must file a report with the police.

283
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,490
No.

284
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,290
What are you doing?

285
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,830
I told you to call the police!

286
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,050
No, miss.

287
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,370
You hit me,

288
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,850
you take full responsibility.

289
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,170
Why should I call the police?

290
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,250
I know I should take full responsibility,

291
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,370
but you still need to call the police.

292
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,320
This is the rule, do you know that?

293
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,830
Mr Policeman!

294
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,680
Where is he?

295
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,560
Jerk, stop the car!

296
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,640
Attention to all units.

297
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,050
[Five minutes later,]

298
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,830
[the cars will reach the hotel entrance.]

299
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,610
[After they get here,]

300
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,080
[all the guests will get off the car
one by one for photographs.]

301
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,720
[It takes about three minutes.]

302
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,630
[I'm ready.]

303
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,400
Why don't you go up first?

304
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,770
It's fine.

305
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,740
I'll wait for you.

306
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,240
Professor Xia is here.

307
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,430
You should know
that he's the father of Xia Chu, right?

308
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,680
I know.

309
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,440
He has entered the hall.

310
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,160
[Play it by ear.]

311
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,600
WIT120 is a new technology.

312
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,290
In this era,

313
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,000
this is a product which we were expecting.

314
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,170
Fox here,

315
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,080
the target
is staring at one of the guests.

316
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,370
Calling Fox.

317
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,730
Before the guest enters the halls,

318
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,000
follow the main target closely.

319
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,520
Roger.

320
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,670
Send the photo of target number one
to Koala.

321
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,850
[Calling Koala,]

322
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,640
[receive the photo of target number one.]

323
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,650
[Keep a close watch on him.]

324
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,920
Copy that.

325
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,380
That's him.

326
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,090
That's a VIP lane.

327
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,430
The press lane is over here.

328
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,720
Let's go, then.

329
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,170
Yes.

330
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm at the door of the hotel now.

331
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,000
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

332
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,990
Back off. You can't enter without a pass.

333
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,880
What's going on?

334
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
What is she doing here?

335
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,840
Gopher, Gopher.

336
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,890
Bring me the girl in the parking lot

337
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,720
to the command room.

338
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,870
Copy that.

339
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,410
Don't move!

340
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,400
[Right now,]

341
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,730
[an unprecedented profound change]

342
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,190
[is taking place in this world.]

343
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,830
[I am a professor at a university,]

344
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,050
[at the same time,]

345
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,560
[I am also]

[a researcher
who performs scientific research.]

[I know]

348
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,840
[I am responsible
for meeting new challenges]

349
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,410
[and encouraging mankind]

350
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
[to take the next giant leap.]

[In the next two days,]

352

[we will]

353

[carry out a multi-disciplinary
and effective conference]

[which covers medical and health,
education and finance,]

[and also other fields.]

356
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,110
[I believe
that the discussion between experts]

357
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,600
[will give us a broader vision
and a clearer understanding]

358
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,970
[of the development pattern]

359
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,320
[of the entire world.]

360
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,360
Stand right there!

361
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,780
Are you alright?

362
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,830
-Watch her.
-Yes!

363
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,160
Go over there to stop him!

364
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,590
He's so cool.

365

Freeze!

[Found a gunman in parking lot B2.]

[A lone armed man.]

00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,950
[go inside the hotel
and wait for my order.]

374
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,490
[All the other units,]

375
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,400
[block all passages including
the basement,]

376
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,910
[ensure the safety of the conference.]

377
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,410
[Attention to Team Thunder,]

378
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,640
this is a Code Red situation.

379
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,200
[Koala, keep an eye on the conference.]

380
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,040
[Fox, watch target number one closely.]

381
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,250
[I hereby]

382
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,760
[propose]

383
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,790
[for a toast together,]

384
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,370
[for the success of the summit,]

385
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,800
[and also the well-being
of you and your family.]

386
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,450
[Cheers.]

387
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,590
Cheers!

388
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,990
Professor Xia is quite a visionary.

389
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,490
Are you still interested

390
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,890
in attending such forums in the future?

391
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,880
Sure. Thank you.

392
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,560
Gopher, please answer.

393
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,920
Gopher, Gopher, answer if you hear me.

394
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,930
Professor Xia,

395
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,450
regarding the progress
of new tranquillisers...

396
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,290
Sorry,

397
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,360
Professor Xia needs some rest.

398
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,410
Sorry, sorry.

399
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,380
Please make room.

400
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,970
Professor Xia.

401
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,680
Congratulations. Here's to you.

402
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,180
Thank you.

403
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,720
Professor,

404
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,440
Mi Gu,

405
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,680
she's Xia Chu's best friend.

406
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,930
She'd like to interview you.

407
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,840
Do you have time?

408
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,450
Sure, sure.

409
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,710
-I'll call her over here.
-Okay.

410
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,000
Mi Gu.

411
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,720
I'll go over there.

412
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,080
Okay.

413
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,250
Uncle Xia, nice to meet you.

414
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,440
I am Mi Gu.

415
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,880
Nice to meet you.

416
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,000
Fox's here.

417
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,210
I suspect target number one

418
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,720
is hiding something in his pocket.

419
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,400
Calling Whale.

420
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,440
We've tied down the target.

421
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,360
Preliminary assessment suggests

422
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,000
a drug deal.

423
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,790
Copy that.

424
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,360
[As for the girl,]

425
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,270
[we've got her under control.]

426
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,910
[I'll take her to you
after she comes round.]

427
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,320
Copy that.

428
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,840
Thank you.

429
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,270
Xiao Xue is fine.

430
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,320
[Gopher, the driver committed suicide
by taking poison.]

431
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,670
I'll be right there.

432
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,960
Watch him.

433
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,360
Gopher's here.

434
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,760
[The driver committed suicide
by taking poison.]

435
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,200
Rescue him immediately.

436
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,200
I won't let him die so easily.

437
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,010
Should we terminate the conference

438
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,240
and evacuate the crowd?

439
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,360
As I see it,

440
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,730
the drug dealer wanted
to slip through the cracks

441
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,960
and sneak in under our nose.

442
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,990
Don't terminate the conference first.

443
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,920
Xia Chu always talked about you.

444
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,440
Thank you for taking care of her.

445
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,630
No, we're just helping each other out.

446
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,920
I appreciate it.

447
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,410
Uncle Xia,

448
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,410
I would like

449
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,010
to conduct an exclusive interview with you
on this forum.

450
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,230
Is it convenient for you?

451
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,600
No problem.

452
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,280
It's noisy in here, isn't it?

453
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,040
Let's talk over there.

454
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,400
Wen.

455
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,290
That cheeky girl,

456
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,160
I can hardly see her these days.

457
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,800
Xia Chu got her good qualities from...

458
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,410
Why?

459
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,800
Why do you never talk to me?

460
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,200
Go to hell!

461
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,400
Professor Xia!

462
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,020
You toy boy!

463
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,520
Put down the knife!

464
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,760
Li Lei, Li Lei,

465
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,730
there's an attack on the corridor

466
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,570
outside the banquet hall,

467
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,920
bring some men and check on it.

468
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,310
[Copy that, Rao Zhi.]

469
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,850
Something is wrong with this man.

470
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,030
I'll go check on him.

471
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,940
Are you okay?

472
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,639
Professor, easy.

473
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,719
Uncle Xia.

474
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,480
[I'll kill all of you!]

475
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,960
What's going on over there?

476
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,870
The target has escaped. Execute Plan B.

477
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,040
Got it.

478
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,290
I'm just a waiter,

479
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,679
you can't sue me!

480
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,790
Who are you?

481
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,989
You can't sue me!

482
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,170
Ren hasn't texted me yet,

483
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,679
the deal has probably failed.

484
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,360
Drive the car to the meeting point,

485
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,670
I'm coming down.

486
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,640
Hi,

487
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,660
please hold on.

488
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,610
There's a sniper.

489
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,080
Inside a high-rise building
on the west side of the hotel,

490
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,650
about ten stories high. Go get him.

491
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,830
[Copy that.]

492
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,610
Attention to all units.

493
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,490
Target number four
is in a black Chevrolet,

494
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,690
license plate number unknown.

495
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,560
Located on the south of the hotel,
heading towards the east.

496
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,960
Whale, the target has escaped.

497
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,930
Captain.

498
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,770
Where is Rao Zhi?

499
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,730
He's inside.

500
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,910
It's none of your business!
Just leave me alone!

501
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,220
Rao Zhi.

502
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,910
Send her home for me.

503
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,350
Yes.

504
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,330
What about you?

505
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,450
The conference hasn't ended.

506
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,160
There is still a lot of work to be done.

507
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,320
Rao Zhi,

508
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,200
I've gone through
the hotel's surveillance cameras,

509
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,280
I still

510
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,530
find Zhuo Ran suspicious.

511
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,040
He had been following the man.

512
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,680
It was the man I fought with.

513
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,120
Plus the sniper opposite the hotel,

514
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,120
I think it is not as simple as it seems.

515
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,640
I knew these.

516
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,890
I've sent someone

517
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,280
to find out Zhuo Ran's real intention.

518
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,130
As to Xiao Xue...

519
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,890
I'll take care of her.

520
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,860
It'll be fine.

521
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,320
Thanks.

522
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,320
I'll check it out.

523
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,670
How dare he throw my phone?

524
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,920
How dare he!

525
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,360
You should be glad
that he didn't throw you out.

526
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,200
Tyrant.

527
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,570
You almost ruined their whole plan,

528
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,170
you know?

529
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,680
So what?

530
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,320
What's so great about solving a case?

531
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,050
He kept asking me

532
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,890
why I came to this hotel,

533
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,440
or if I knew that driver.

534
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,730
I'm like a disaster to him
after I came back.

535
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,410
You couldn't find the suspect,

536
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,770
so it's my fault now, isn't it?

537
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,690
This is not what he meant.

538
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,280
This is exactly what he meant!

539
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,880
I lost my best friend!

540
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,600
That jerk almost ran over me,

541
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,440
but I still have to compensate
that car dealer.

542
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm the most unlucky one!

543
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,000
But you still interrogate me like that.

544
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm already unlucky enough, Mu Ze.

545
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,280
How could you do this to me?

546
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,000
If you

547
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,240
want him to care more about you,

548
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,280
you should do something else.

549
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,720
Yelling is useless.

550
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,400
There's nothing else I can do.

551
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,430
He's a robot.

552
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,000
That robot is your father.

553
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,650
He is not my father!

554
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,400
He's a complete stranger!

555
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,970
He's not my father!

556
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,530
He's not my father!

557
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,400
He's a stranger!

558
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,350
No, he is not!

559
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,340
Are you done?

560
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,710
No.

561
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,240
I'm taking a break.

562
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,490
I'm done.

563
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,280
Did you say you lost your best friend?

564
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,560
Do I know him?

565
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,280
Of course you don't.

566
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,720
It is an animal therapist

567
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,040
introduced to me
by my friend who is a doctor.

568
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,270
We've been together for a few years.

569
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,960
I asked them to deliver it here,

570
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,810
but the agency lost it

571
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,360
before it even left
the quarantine centre.

572
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,280
Animal therapist?

573
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,330
Just adopt another one.

574
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,200
I can't adopt another one!

575
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,800
It is my one and only!

576
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,290
Do you even know what is one and only?

577
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm sure you don't know.

578
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,140
In that case,

579
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,800
regarding the compensation
for your rental car,

580
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,880
take care of it yourself.

581
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,680
Mu Ze.

582
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,840
I have my phone here.

583
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,520
Either Wechat or Alipay is fine.

584
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,630
That'll be 2,300 yuan.

585
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,640
Thank you, Mu Ze.

586
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,670
We can also go home and get the cash.

587
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,250
Tian Yong.

588
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,220
Yes!

589
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,170
Here's a task for you.

590
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,010
Yes.

591
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,170
Send her to my house.

592
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,730
You were that guy who flung me

593
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,190
in the basement parking, weren't you?

594
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,380
Yes.

595
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,880
I'll remember you.

596
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,240
It's too risky. I'll take her home.

597
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,600
Thank you, captain.

598
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,760
Attention to all units,

599
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,960
this is Whale.

600
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,410
Gopher will be in charge of site command.

601
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,560
Over.

602
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,600
I will complete the mission!

603
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,760
I'll leave now.

604
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,450
Captain,

605
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,690
-Zhuo Ran has been taken
-He's the captain now.

606
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,000
by the police...

607
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,760
Not bad, lieutenant.

608
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,600
When did you take over his position?

609
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,390
What are you staring at?

610
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,230
This girl is dangerous.

611
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,070
Slow down.

612
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,400
Dad!

613
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,200
Dad.

614
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,560
Tang Lin called me and said
you were injured.

615
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,490
How are you? Is it serious?

616
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm fine.

617
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,890
I hurt my back.

618
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,080
It's nothing major.

619
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,260
Is it true?

620
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,750
It is.

621
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,330
It's true.

622
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,830
After that, Mr Zhuo...

623
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,470
Mr Zhuo?
