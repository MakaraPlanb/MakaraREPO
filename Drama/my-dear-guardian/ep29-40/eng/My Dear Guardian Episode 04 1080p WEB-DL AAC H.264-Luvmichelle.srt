00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,770
[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,509
Why

5
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,750
did such a dramatic matter happen to me?

6
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,430
[I'm sorry, Mi Gu.]

7
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,350
[I've just found out
that I left you behind.]

8
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,230
[You had already left
when I went back for you.]

9
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,579
[Where are you now?]

10
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,630
[Did you return home?]

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,910
[Please don't be mad at me.]

12
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,070
[Too many troubles happened tonight,]

13
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,710
[my mind went blank.]

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,110
[Forgive me, Mi Gu.]

15
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,070
Silly girl, I've reached home.

16
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,510
Rest assured.

17
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,230
Get some rest too.

18
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,790
Everything

19
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,590
will be better tomorrow.

20
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,510
This is my name card.

21
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,310
Remember to call me if Xia Chu

22
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,710
goes to this kind of place again.

23
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,030
[Miss Mi Gu?]

24
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,030
[Do you know me?]

25
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,310
[You took the wrong luggage.]

26
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,030
[That's yours.]

27
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,070
[We've never met before.]

28
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,230
[Never.]

29
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,110
Halt!

30
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,270
Turn to the left!

31
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,780
Face forward!

32
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,190
The destination is TSC base.

33
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,870
Run and go!

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,470
One, two, one...

35
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,030
-Xiao Teng!
-Yes!

36
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,909
Lead the team!

37
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,390
Captain!

38
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,550
Welcome back!

39
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,030
How's the water temperature?

40
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,510
It's too cold.

41
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,950
That's why I lead the team back.

42
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,950
What's wrong?

43
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,150
Do you want to try?

44
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,910
Yes, I do.

45
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,700
Report!

46
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,870
Captain, the Brigade Headquarters want you

47
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,070
in the Brigade Commander's office
at eleven o'clock.

48
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,430
Okay, noted.

49
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,390
Yes!

50
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,390
Is Xiao Jun hospitalised?

51
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,030
Yes.

52
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,030
His operation is tomorrow, I wish

53
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,510
to take leave.

54
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,910
No.

55
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,070
Someone from the higher unit
is coming tomorrow.

56
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,750
Thunderbolt Commando

57
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,540
was picked to take
the comprehensive assessment.

58
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,670
As usual,

59
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,870
every participant's result

60
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,060
will be recorded.

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,909
The team will fail

62
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,390
if any one of you gives up.

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,990
So

64
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,350
think thoroughly

65
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,950
whether to put Tian Yong on.

66
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,350
I don't have to think.

67
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,470
Just let him decide.

68
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,590
It's a matter of the honour
of the Special Forces Brigade

69
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,470
and your future.

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,070
Liang Mu Ze,

71
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,390
don't let me down.

72
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,710
Yes!

73
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,260
Luo Xiao Jun's condition is complicated.

74
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,750
A simple interventional surgery
can only cure ASD,

75
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,420
but it's useless
to the left inferior pulmonary artery.

76
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,790
It's the same to thoracotomy,
the wound is large

77
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,710
and it damages the patient's
cardiopulmonary function.

78
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,150
So I think

79
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,550
the most secure way is

80
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,030
to have a hybrid operation by combining
medical and surgical treatment.

81
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,310
You, cardiologists perform
the blocking of ASD.

82
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,070
We, cardiac surgeons operate
on the pulmonary artery.

83
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,950
The operation duration
can be shortened in this way.

84
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,590
And extracorporeal circulation
is not needed either.

85
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,750
The post-operative survival rate
will be improved.

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,190
If the interventional surgery fails,

87
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,180
we can still perform

88
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,500
surgical repair of ASD.

89
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,910
In this way,

90
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,270
we can avoid a second surgery situation.

91
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,110
This will put forward higher requirements

92
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,870
for our performance.

93
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,230
I hope that everyone

94
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,710
can work together.

95
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,150
Okay, you're dismissed.

96
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,180
This case

97
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,470
can be written in the SCI case.

98
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,510
Guess whom Zhang will take
to enter the operating room.

99
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,990
May I have your attention?

100
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,470
Xiao Xiao.

101
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,740
Yes.

102
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,790
From now on,

103
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,070
you're in charge of Luo Xiao Jun.

104
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,230
Tomorrow,

105
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,350
you're going into the operating room.

106
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,060
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

107
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,110
I'll work hard

108
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,350
and get the job done.

109
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,710
Hand over the information to her.

110
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,990
If anyone wishes to observe my surgery,

111
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,510
I hope that you guys

112
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,030
can impress me with your performance.

113
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,710
Teacher,

114
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,980
I'd like to talk to you.

115
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,230
What's the matter?

116
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,070
I was the one discovering
Luo Xiao Jun's condition

117
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,270
and

118
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,990
I'm in charge of communicating
with his mother.

119
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,870
So what?

120
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,270
That's why you thought

121
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,270
you could daze and desert at will

122
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,390
during today's preoperative

123
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,510
discussion meeting?

124
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,390
You can do whatever you want

125
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,030
because he is your loot, right?

126
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,230
No.

127
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,990
Let me tell you this.

128
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,860
There are only two results
of saving lives.

129
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,100
Either

130
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,270
a promise success,

131
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,430
or zero failure.

132
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,510
There's no other choice.

133
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,590
Do you know how complicated

134
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,310
Luo Xiao Jun's surgery is?

135
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,630
Do you know how risky his surgery is,

136
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,310
how high the risk is?

137
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,830
If you have never
thought about what I said,

138
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,910
I'll never allow

139
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,510
an unprepared resident

140
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,310
to enter my operating room.

141
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,310
I'm sorry, Teacher.

142
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,790
I'm extremely disappointed

143
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,790
with what you did today.

144
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,610
[Miss Lan]

145
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,780
[Miss Lan]

146
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,510
[Miss Lan.]

147
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,430
Girl,

148
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,790
why didn't you answer my video call?

149
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,150
Are you working overtime?

150
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,950
No, no overtime today.

151
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,270
My internet is down.

152
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,070
I don't want to waste my internet data.

153
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,430
Have you eaten?

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,540
[Yes.]

155
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,030
What did you eat?

156
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,550
I ate

157
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,140
my homemade sweet and sour ribs.

158
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,750
[I cooked vegetables too.]

159
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,030
And a bowl of millet congee
with half a steamed bun.

160
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,670
Not bad.

161
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,430
You have made yourself a hearty meal.

162
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,910
[Of course.]

163
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,150
A healthy body leads to a healthy life.

164
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,780
That goes without saying.

165
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,630
[Right.]

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,350
You need to take care of yourself.

167
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,310
You're out there.

168
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,310
[I don't request anything,]

169
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,580
but you need to eat well

170
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,390
and take good care of yourself,
do you hear me?

171
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,670
[Girl,]

172
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,430
[how is]

173
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,380
Liang Mu Ze's house?

174
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,750
Do you still want to move out?

175
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,350
I do.

176
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,220
[When are you going to move out?]

177
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,070
[How's your house-hunting?]

178
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
I can come over to help you

179
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,870
if you're not free.

180
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,910
[Never mind.]

181
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,950
[The house...]

182
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,070
I've already found one.

183
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,990
It's very near to our hospital

184
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,430
[and the environment is good.]

185
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,310
[I like the renovation as well.]

186
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,420
[The point is]

187
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,700
[the landlord is not in the country.]

188
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,350
He is unfamiliar with the domestic market.

189
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,430
The fee is over

190
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,790
one-third below the market rates.

191
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,390
It's cost-effective.

192
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,790
I see.

193
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,030
That's great.

194
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,270
Then I'll tell Mu Min.

195
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,870
No, don't...

196
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,820
Mum.

197
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,230
[Son, what are you doing?]

198
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,070
I'm going to sleep.

199
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,550
Sleep?

200
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,980
Are you sleeping alone

201
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,430
or sleeping with someone?

202
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,390
Mum, I'm in the unit.

203
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,190
I know that.

204
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,900
How is it?
What progress are you two making?

205
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,990
It's good.

206
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,030
How good is it?

207
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,030
How good is it?

208
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,150
When we're at home,

209
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,660
she cooks,

210
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,830
I wash the dishes.

211
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,510
[And then,]

212
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,390
[we go for a ride.]

213
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,310
[Both of us]

214
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,630
[know each other's job.]

215
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,870
[What a relief!]

216
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,110
We talk every chance we have.

217
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,150
[Move out]

218
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,670
[from my house in one week.]

219
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,100
It's very good.

220
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,070
Really, very good.

221
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,270
[Is it?]

222
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,590
Yes, we're good.

223
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,110
[Then why did her mother tell me]

224
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,630
that she found a rental

225
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,710
and that she's ready
to move out to live alone?

226
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,580
[Really?]

227
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,710
What do you mean?

228
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,190
Stop playing dumb!

229
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,190
She didn't tell me that.

230
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,230
What's going on?

231
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,830
[Did you tell her]

232
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,910
[that you have a son?]

233
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,430
Did you?

234
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,230
Liang Mu Ze,

235
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,910
I think you're crazy.

236
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,150
I'm not... I...

237
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,060
I... My reception... I...

238
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,510
[Hello, Mum,
I've got bad reception here. Hello?]

239
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you this.

240
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,670
If you dare to kick her out,

241
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,630
I'll find you a new tenant right away.

242
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,830
Too much noise, I can't hear you.

243
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,350
I can't hear you.

244
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,030
[You wait and see!]

245
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,590
The reception is bad.

246
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm sure

247
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,820
I can still deal with you.

248
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,190
I can't hear you.

249
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,390
Mum...

250
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,150
[Liang Mu Ze!]

251
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,070
Mum...

252
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,030
This brat!

253
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,990
[Old lady]

254
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,830
You had trouble sleeping too?

255
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,750
What do you mean?

256
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,910
You can't sleep,

257
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,030
but I'm just waiting to sleep.

258
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,350
How's your preparation
for the assessment?

259
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,550
I'm a bit cringed but
I don't want to give up.

260
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,790
Then just go on.

261
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,270
But I'm afraid that
I'll affect the result of the team.

262
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,350
"Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share".

263
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,630
Is this how they said?

264
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,550
The recruits line up,
the Special Forces Brigade

265
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,510
Hunter Military School, Isaia,

266
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,270
we are brothers.

267
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,540
I leave my life to you,
the result means nothing.

268
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,310
What's after that?

269
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,340
What do you mean?

270
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,510
How does the poem continue?

271
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,990
Captain Liang,
I wish you could hear yourself.

272
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,710
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

273
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,910
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

274
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,910
We move forward, your hand in mine.

275
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,470
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

276
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,150
Our Sire sends the troops, let’s make
our armour suit and spear shine.

277
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,820
We move forward, your hand in mine.

278
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,900
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?

279
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,470
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

280
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,950
Our Sire sends the troops,

281
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,420
let’s make our armour suit
and spear shine.

282
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,950
We move forward, your hand in mine.

283
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,910
The age of death of the deceased is

284
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,790
in the range between 40 to 45 years old.

285
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,340
The cause of death

286
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,550
is haemorrhagic shock

287
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,110
due to the gunshot wound on the chest.

288
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,630
From the deceased's skin wound

289
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,870
and the residue,

290
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,350
the deceased was

291
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,430
bitten by a large dog after he died.

292
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,470
But this is not the most crucial point.

293
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,580
The most crucial point is that

294
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,540
from the pathological anatomy,

295
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,630
I found

296
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,830
the deceased had suffered

297
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,950
from a very severe kidney disease.

298
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,750
He even needed a kidney transplant.

299
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,980
Transplant?

300
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,950
Yes.

301
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,910
Moreover,

302
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,670
the deceased and the data

303
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,910
sent by the Interpol

304
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,590
of the seriously wounded person

305
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,030
who was almost kidnapped

306
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,790
in Isaia Joint Medical outpost,

307
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,070
are highly matched,

308
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,790
no matter if it's their
ABO RBC blood group

309
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,910
or MHC antigen.

310
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,700
[Rao Zhi,]

311
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,590
there's been a murder
in Jiaotong University's district.

312
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,790
Okay, noted.

313
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,070
I'm going to the scene.

314
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,780
We'll talk about it later.

315
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,750
Okay.

316
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,150
Let's go.

317
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,990
Take a look in there. Yes.

318
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,660
Rao Zhi,

319
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,230
how is it?

320
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,140
It's in there.

321
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,350
Rao Zhi.

322
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,980
Rao Zhi, over here.

323
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,510
[In the operation]

324
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,830
The blood vessel of the kid is fine,

325
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,980
it might be difficult.

326
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,670
Okay, noted.

327
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,550
Go a little further.

328
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,910
How is it? Are you okay?

329
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,830
Gearing up, I can't wait.

330
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,150

331
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,940
Yes!

How is Xiao Jun?

366
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,990
I just received the news.

367
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,390
The operation didn't work.

368
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,150
[Bradycardia!]

369
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,780
[Stop!]

370
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,750
[Withdraw the anaesthesia!]

371
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,590
[0.5mg atropine, quick!]

372
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,670
[Yes!]

[Let me do it.]

374
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,870
[I think we should repair the ASD.]

375
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,310
[No.]

376
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,230
[The heart rate and blood pressure
of the patient are unstable.]

377
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,270
[He can't undergo cardiac surgery.]

378
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,870
Why did it fail?

379
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,230
How could it fail?

380
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,750
There shouldn't have been no problem
about the surgical plan.

381
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,590
What's the problem?

382
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,230
I don't know.

383
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,710
It would be great if I knew it.

384
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,990
Xia Chu,

385
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,190
do you know that?

386
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,510
The responsibility of a doctor

387
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,420
is to relieve often,

388
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,070
to comfort always,

389
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,670
to cure sometimes.

390
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,190
It means that

391
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,470
medicine

392
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,260
has boundaries that we can't reach.

393
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,340
Doctor is not God.

394
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,470
I've tried my best.

395
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,630
Really.

396
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,270
Perhaps the God of Fortune

397
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,190
is not on our side this time.

398
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,230
Then...

399
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,870
Then what should we do next?

400
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,390
When he has recovered,

401
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,230
we'll repair the atrial septal defect

402
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,870
and the surgery of the pulmonary artery.

403
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,380
But

404
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,230
his cardiopulmonary function
was seriously damaged.

405
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,870
Can he really withstand the trauma?

406
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,470
I hope so.

407
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,510
How's your wound?

408
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,190
It's fully recovered.

409
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,750
Then why did you act like
you were dying during the assessment?

410
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,870
Why would your strength
be reinforced otherwise?

411
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,550
Xiao Jun's condition is not good.

412
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,950
Have you asked the doctor?

413
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,670
No.

414
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,390
What about giving a call?

415
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,950
I'm scared.

416
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,870
13944822375

417
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,670
It's Dr Xia's number.

418
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,710
I have Zhang Yi Chi's number,
why would I ask her?

419
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,660
Dr Xia is prettier.

420
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,910
You're shallow.

421
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,350
I can get over it.

422
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,230
You can do it too,

423
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,110
sooner or later.

424
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,340
[Mu Ze.]

425
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,950
What would you do

426
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,470
if you knew Xiao Jun's operation

427
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,230
didn't work?

428
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,310
Call the doctor

429
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,470
to ask about the reason why it didn't work

430
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,270
and the next arrangement of the operation

431
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,750
to start an early preparation.

432
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,470
Right, it should be like this.

433
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,510
And you'll comfort
Xiao Jun and your sister-in-law.

434
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,110
You'll tell them

435
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,110
that you'll protect them,

436
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,220
even if the sky falls.

437
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,950
You've always been like this, right?

438
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,630
What are you holding back for?

439
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,590
I'm not sure.

440
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,430
I'll be scared

441
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,510
if it's a very bad result.

442
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,510
Will you?

443
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,070
I will.

444
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,070
Then what should I do?

445
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,910
I dare to stand in front of you

446
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,670
because I know

447
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,110
you're right behind me.

448
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,110
You too.

449
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,470
Go find your comrade

450
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,900
and fight with them.

451
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,630
[It's me.]

452
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,310
I'm looking for the house.

453
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,910
[It's not about the house.]

454
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,510
It's about Xiao Jun.

455
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,950
So you know.

456
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,270
The reason of the failure

457
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,190
is not known yet.

458
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,030
I have no idea

459
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,790
why it became like this.

460
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,350
Perhaps that's what
clinical practice is like.

461
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,989
[Even if]

462
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,550
[we're well-prepared,]

463
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,909
[there might still]

464
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,590
[be a probability to fail.]

465
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,429
[We are making the second surgical plan.]

466
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,550
[It needs some time.]

467
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,310
No matter if you believe it or not,

468
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,909
I still want to say

469
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,750
actually,

470
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,350
we, the doctors, are the ones who wish

471
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,389
more than anyone else
that the patient could be safe

472
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,670
every time we send them
to the operating room.

473
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,190
We...

474
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,500
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,590
Anything else?

476
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,790
If you have nothing to ask, I'll...

477
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,030
[800-meter road with obstacles.]

478
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,590
When I reached two-thirds of it,

479
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,670
I thought I couldn't do it.

480
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,540
8000-meter mazy run.

481
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,670
When I reached the final mile,

482
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,870
Tian Yong was hurt.

483
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,950
I carried him.

484
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,830
I knew he was hurt.

485
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,870
And he knew I was exhausted.

486
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,830
[But the reason I carried him
and ran to the finish line]

487
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,710
was only because he wished

488
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,670
to be on the field.

489
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,710
What are you trying to say,
Liang Mu Ze?

490
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,910
Xiao Jun is only eight years old.

491
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,830
I know the hospital is not my battlefield.

492
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,950
Now I also know that

493
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,030
[doctors]

494
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,270
[are irreplaceable.]

495
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,710
So I ask you

496
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,590
not to give up

497
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,190
on Xiao Jun

498
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,630
no matter what,

499
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,110
[okay?]

500
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,230
I got it.

501
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,190
I'll pass your message to Dr Zhang.

502
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,430
Thank you.

503
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,230
Dr Zhang.

504
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,910
I just finished an operation
and came here to see Xiao Jun.

505
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,790
You've worked hard.

506
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,030
What did you buy?

507
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,030
A customer ordered a bracelet from me.

508
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,590
She was eager to get it so I went out

509
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,270
to buy some accessories.

510
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,910
I heard it from Mu Ze

511
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,670
that you've opened a book store.

512
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,310
Opening a book store is my hobby.

513
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,190
I sell some clothes

514
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,780
designed by me
and some freelance designers

515
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,830
in the store.

516
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,190
And I sell some
cultural and creative products too.

517
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,470
Dreaming is important,

518
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,150
but it's important to earn a living too.

519
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,110
Don't you think, Dr Zhang?

520
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,150
Dr Zhang,

521
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,870
does Xiao Jun still have a chance?

522
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,030
Will you be willing to try

523
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,590
if we arrange a cardiac surgery

524
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,870
for Xiao Jun?

525
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,830
For his current situation,

526
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,110
it might be hard

527
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,870
to proceed with an interventional surgery.

528
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,430
I think

529
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,150
we're more confident

530
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,350
on performing a surgery.

531
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,510
I follow your decision.

532
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,830
I feel bad for him

533
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,910
as he has to suffer a lot

534
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,510
at this young age,

535
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,750
but you are a doctor.

536
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,220
I believe in your choice

537
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,750
as long as Xiao Jun can be cured.

538
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,870
I trust you, Dr Zhang.

539
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,190
I understand.

540
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,950
Who is it?

541
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,990
It's early.

542
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,030
Coming!

543
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,910
Why have you come here?

544
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,270
I want to sleep on my half Tatami.

545
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,270
Have you had breakfast?

546
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,470
Yes.

547
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,070
Don't mind me, carry on.

548
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,870
There are food and beverages
in the fridge, help yourself.

549
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,550
Okay.

550
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,150
Didn't you tell me that

551
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,110
you're really busy
preparing for the surgery?

552
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,110
The surgery didn't work.

553
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,230
Why?

554
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,470
I don't know.

555
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,110
Perhaps it's often the case.

556
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,630
The patient whom the doctors

557
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,750
pay a lot of attention to

558
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,670
might not have a positive outcome.

559
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,710
I increasingly find that

560
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,790
what we can do is very limited.

561
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,110
I think

562
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,550
something's wrong
with the Feng Shui of your house.

563
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,350
Did you get someone
to read the geomancy?

564
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,270
Why don't

565
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,750
you move out?

566
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,830
I wish too.

567
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,110
But the other houses are more terrifying.

568
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,230
Come to our district.

569
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,990
There's a unit in our district,

570
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,150
it has the same layout as mine.

571
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,100
It's right above us.

572
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,870
Does it have
a floor-to-ceiling window too?

573
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,310
It does.

574
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,030
That...

575
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,020
He gave me this at that day

576
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,900
after you left.

577
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,350
To get your news.

578
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,740
I was thinking

579
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,270
to throw it away,

580
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,230
but then I thought

581
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,830
he might not mean any harm.

582
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,230
It's been years after all.

583
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,780
I'll just throw it away.
