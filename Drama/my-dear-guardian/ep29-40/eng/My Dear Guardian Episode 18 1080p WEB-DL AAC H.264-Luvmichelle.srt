[Episode 18]

4
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,430
I'll do it myself.

5
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,750
Don't move. Let me do it.

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,330
Let me see it.

7
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,010
Fortunately,

8
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,910
it's not serious. It's just a scrape.

9
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,870
Let me dress your wound.

10
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,340
Don't move.

11
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm covered with dust.

12
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,440
It's okay.

13
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,680
Hold it.

14
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,110
Where is Xue?

15
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,030
I asked her to go back with Rao Zhi.

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,510
Weren't you with her?

17
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,670
I had something to do.

18
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,750
What was it?

19
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,460
To pursue you.

20
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,829
Did you see the plate
number of that car?

21
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,320
No.

22
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,600
Did you see what the driver looks like?

23
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,440
No.

24
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,400
It was dark.

25
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,630
He flipped on the high beam

26
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,070
and I was scared.

27
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,070
I just kept on running.

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,200
I didn't even see

29
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,670
if the car was coming for me.

30
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,390
There is a lot going on.

31
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,510
My patient passed away.

32
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm terribly upset.

33
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,079
I don't know...

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,720
It's fine.

35
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,440
Everything will be fine.

36
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,230
Done. Look.

37
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,640
Good bandaging technique.

38
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,840
Of course.

39
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,280
I learned from the best.

40
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,240
I'm flattered.

41
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm not as good as you in bandaging.

42
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,390
The tutor I said is not you.

43
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,690
It's the nurse from Isaia.

44
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,750
You've met her.

45
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,750
So she was the lady

46
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,959
who drank in the bar last time.

47
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,950
Yes.

48
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,000
Your acquaintance is quite extensive.

49
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,670
Do you know

50
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,080
what the passing rate
of Hunter Military School is?

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,930
I heard

52
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,600
it's a hell-like training.

53
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,510
It's 90 percent.

54
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,890
Only 14 persons

55
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,590
in our class passed.

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,720
I would've been the first in my class

57
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,070
if you hadn't reported me.

58
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,680
I always got hurt

59
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,950
during training.

60
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,960
I always ended up in the infirmary.

61
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,870
That nurse and I were
nearly the same age.

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,340
She patched me up
very earnestly every time.

63
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,950
The gauze she cut was nice too.

64
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,150
She even read poetry to my wound.

65
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,560
Read poetry?

66
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,530
Yes.

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,670
Love is so short.

68
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,280
Forgetting is so long.

69
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,710
Acacia ashes, ashes are Acacia.

70
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,150
These were the poem I heard from her.

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,040
She liked Neruda.

72
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,050
She was clearly flirting with you.

73
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,560
I don't know.

74
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,470
You liked her too.

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,790
I liked seeing her when
she was bandaging.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,870
I liked the gauze she cut.

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,830
I liked her tone when
she was reading poetry.

78
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,480
She believed that reading poetry to the

79
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,200
wound could speed healing.

80
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,040
Nonsense.

81
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,360
Right, no medical grounds at all.

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,800
But she had no doubt on that.

83
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,230
Every one

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,640
has their own belief.

85
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,800
It makes no sense to others.

86
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,030
Just like the way you treat Zhuo Ran.

87
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,750
You left

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,070
because you were afraid
that I'd say his name.

89
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,630
You weren't willing to suspect him.

90
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,120
That's why you escaped, right?

91
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't want to discuss
about this topic.

92
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,950
You're escaping again.

93
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,510
Where are you trying to escape?

94
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,920
If that gun on the boat

95
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,750
really was his,

96
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,830
will you still believe in him?

97
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,970
Yes, Brigade Commander.

98
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,750
That was how it was today.

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,430
[So you're saying]

100
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,640
[Xia Chu]

101
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,240
[is home alone.]

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,350
It's quite worrying.

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,620
[Yes.]

104
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,770
Right.

105
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,790
Have you taken your annual leave?

106
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,850
I haven't.

107
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,820
[Why don't you]

108
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,390
[take this opportunity to]

109
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,520
[take your annual leave?]

110
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,590
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,400
Why did you let her go?

112
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,370
Didn't you see the car
behind was following us?

113
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,050
The fact that she came

114
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,170
meant she probably already recognized

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,390
your back when you took
Gui away from the hospital.

116
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,870
It was just a silhouette.

117
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,990
She has no favourable statements.

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,620
And you hesitated while
you were pointing

119
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,240
the gun at Gui on the boat.

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,660
Because I wanted to clarify

121
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,550
whether the police had
interrogated him.

122
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,680
This is more important
than putting a bullet in him.

123
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,510
You wanted to clarify?

124
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,830
You delayed our evacuation
just because of this.

125
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,310
We almost encountered
the police and that girl.

126
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,040
Her name is Xia Chu.

127
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,550
I know what's on your mind.

128
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,480
Just like what Gui said.

129
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,120
You wanted to use him
to pin down Old Master.

130
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,270
I'm warning you.

131
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,480
Do not challenge Old Master's authority.

132
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,590
Don't even think about
taking me down with you.

133
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,400
You saw what happened to Gui.

134
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,280
And that girl must die too.

135
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,270
I repeat.

136
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,260
Her name is Xia Chu.

137
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,640
Only Zhuo Ran can decide her fate.

138
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,790
Do you understand?

139
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm asking if you understood me!

140
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,080
Get rid of the car.

141
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,870
Zhuo Ran.

142
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm back. Where are you?

143
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,570
Zhuo Ran?

144
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,230
Can you hear me?

145
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,240
Zhuo Ran!

146
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,110
Bang on it!

147
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,390
Zhuo Ran!

148
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,240
Zhuo Ran!

149
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,080
Can you hear me?

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,870
Is it 120?

151
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,520
Liang Mu Ze!

152
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,160
Liang Mu Ze!

153
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,630
Liang Mu Ze!

154
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,480
What kind of concept is that?

155
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,720
What are you doing?

156
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,830
Durian?

157
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,910
You bought durian?

158
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,990
Oh my god!

159
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,760
Don't tell me you're
making durian cake.

160
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,590
I failed.

161
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,510
This isn't right.

162
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,250
I followed every step on the website.

163
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,390
What went wrong?

164
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,810
180 degree average
heating on both sides.

165
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,720
Bake it for half an hour.

166
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,910
You chose single side, Captain Liang.

167
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,870
No wonder.

168
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,280
Aren't you going to return to the unit?

169
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,370
I took leave.

170
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,720
What's wrong?

171
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,390
I don't want to admit it,

172
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,160
but it's quite reassuring

173
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,520
with your presence

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,480
at a time like this.

175
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,870
I knew that.

176
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,800
But

177
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,550
why did you want to make durian cake?

178
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,870
I think

179
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,710
you should eat something sweet

180
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,910
as compensation.

181
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,450
Uncle Rao.

182
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,330
I'm at home.

183
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,740
Okay.

184
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,810
I'll be right over.

185
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm going to pick Xue up
at the police station.

186
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,560
I'll go with you.

187
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,560
I need to talk to Rao Zhi.

188
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,420
[Case Analysis Room]

189
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,210
Forensics extracted
DNA of the deceased

190
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,650
and compared it with the DNA of

191
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,440
Sang Kun, the deceased at the villa.

192
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,970
They found that their gene sequence

193
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,240
closely coincide.

194
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,490
Basically, we can conclude

195
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,690
that the deceased in the shipyard

196
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,840
is Gui, Sang Kun's little brother.

197
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,210
And apart from the lethal shot

198
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,090
and the oozing drainage port,

199
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,410
his other wounds

200
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,750
were treated in the hospital.

201
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,320
We didn't discover any new wound

202
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,880
and any signs of struggle.

203
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,750
From the autopsy report alone,

204
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,990
basically, there's no
possibility of homicide.

205
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,830
What about the boat owner?

206
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,990
The boat owner admitted

207
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,850
that he concealed the

208
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,630
existence of the
secret compartment because

209
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,390
he was afraid that the matter
of hunting wildlife would be disclosed.

210
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,270
But he said he didn't
know the deceased.

211
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,170
He was unsure when
and what the deceased

212
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,630
put in the secret compartment.

213
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,930
I looked up the background
of this boat owner in detail.

214
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,920
No problem was found.

215
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,840
Xiao Qiang,

216
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,440
any progression in the
physical evidences?

217
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,410
No usable fingerprints,

218
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,730
footprints and hair at the scene

219
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,880
were found.

220
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,640
By analyzing the
fingerprints on the gun

221
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,720
and ballistics,

222
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,840
and from the wound that caused by the

223
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,800
burning of gunpowder,

224
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,650
we can confirm

225
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,200
the deceased shot himself.

226
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,880
After the verification of
the firearm department,

227
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,560
the gun and gunpowder which were found
at the scene had been proven that

228
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,330
they were made by
3D printing technology.

229
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,910
Only the deceased's
fingerprints were on it.

230
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,990
What conditions are
needed for 3D printing?

231
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,350
There's a download
program on City of Desire.

232
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,890
With a 3D printer

233
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,160
and respective materials,

234
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,550
a gun could be manufactured.

235
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,610
And the power of this

236
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,640
3D printed gun

237
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,040
isn't as strong as the traditional gun.

238
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,350
It has the advantages
such as easy fabrication,

239
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,690
and it can avoid radiation scan.

240
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,530
Which means

241
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,800
it can allow the gun holder

242
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,750
to pass security checks.

243
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,930
Peng Fei,

244
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,290
can you check the information

245
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,550
of the downloaders?

246
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,810
So far, we've found

247
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
only one account, named Scary Pirate,

248
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,230
had downloaded this program.

249
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,890
But we have not been able to

250
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,080
identify the person.

251
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,100
Rao Zhi,

252
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,080
Zhuo Ran started a 3D printing company.

253
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,380
Then why did he use a 3D printed gun?

254
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,670
Isn't that causing us to suspect him?

255
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,990
I think he's not that stupid.

256
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,750
He might not be stupid.

257
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,370
Perhaps it's a kind of

258
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,000
outrageous provocation.

259
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,760
He made it look like suicide.

260
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,310
Even if he was caught,

261
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,520
he could make us negate his suspicion

262
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,150
by using his sheer exposure.

263
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,530
He might have strong
anti-reconnaissance capability.

264
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,590
He knew our state of
mind in handling a case.

265
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,390
If it's that case,

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,720
then this Scary Pirate
is very terrifying.

267
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,460
It's more than being terrifying.

268
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,400
In my view, the previous crimes

269
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,410
he committed

270
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,560
point to him being a sociopath

271
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,110
doing an aimless performance art.

272
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,910
It might be a performance art.

273
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,340
It could never be aimless.

274
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,130
But how are we supposed to unmask him?

275
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,430
So,

276
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,760
let's go through

277
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,810
every clue we currently have

278
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,640
after this meeting.

279
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,450
Especially the testimony
of the eyewitness.

280
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,490
Go through it again

281
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,690
and see if

282
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,160
we missed anything.

283
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,130
Rao Zhi,

284
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,430
it was my negligence
yesterday at the hospital.

285
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,190
I'm willing to accept my punishment.

286
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,080
You won't get away with it.

287
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,190
But this is not the time for you
to make self-criticism.

288
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,050
Let's go.

289
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,370
-Follow me to the boat.
-Yes.

290
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,330
Rao Zhi.

291
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,590
Rao Zhi,

292
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,200
the deceased didn't kill himself.

293
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,040
So how did you know?

294
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,079
On first look,

295
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,450
the deceased did indeed
use his thumb to

296
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,710
pull the trigger and shot himself.

297
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,190
But the deceased's
posterior skull was pierced.

298
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,970
So?

299
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,010
I compared

300
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,470
lots of suicide cases.

301
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,710
In the cases which
the posterior skull was pierced,

302
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,420
the trigger was pulled
by the index finger.

303
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,560
In the cases which the
trigger was pulled

304
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,670
by the thumb,

305
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,420
it should be the neck
which got pierced.

306
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,150
If it wasn't a coincidence,

307
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,200
then it means...

308
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,920
Then it means it wasn't suicide.

309
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,900
It was made to look like

310
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,510
a suicide scene after he was killed.

311
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,710
Immediately conduct a thorough search in
all 3D printing companies in the city.

312
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,200
Focus on talking with Mr Zhuo.

313
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,230
Yes.

314
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,220
She really is Officer Rao's daughter?

315
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,440
Yes.

316
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,430
It's surprising.

317
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,230
You'll forgive the person
that she's become

318
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,390
if you knew her before.

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,860
Maybe.

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,090
How did you know

321
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,750
there was a problem with the suicide?

322
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,250
Have you forgotten I like
to read detective novels?

323
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,710
Those experiences that
we once thought were useless

324
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,040
will eventually show their value

325
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,640
in an inadvertent moment.

326
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,690
And

327
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,850
this habit of mine

328
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,440
was influenced by Zhuo Ran.

329
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
Then?

330
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,730
So I think there's no
such thing as your

331
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,520
assumption last night.

332
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,840
If he really was the gun holder,

333
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,130
he wouldn't have
neglected this lethal flaw

334
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,470
when he falsified the suicide scene.

335
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,430
Having said all that,

336
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,150
it turned out you did it all for him.

337
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,070
I did it for myself.

338
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,280
I have my past.

339
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,600
But I won't lose my sense

340
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,750
of judgement because of my past.

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,120
I wish the police could solve
this case as soon as possible.

342
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,430
To prove with facts that

343
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,900
you're wrong.

344
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,110
I hope you could win.

345
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,480
I hope this past won't hurt you.

346
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,490
I've told you all I
care about is the people,

347
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,510
not about winning or losing.

348
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,600
What are you doing?

349
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,910
What happened?

350
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,650
I didn't expect to witness public

351
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,410
display affection when I woke up.

352
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,160
I have to go.

353
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,390
[Outpatient Department]

354
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,950
Brother,

355
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,400
you're like an embarrassing youth.

356
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,430
I've always been a youth.

357
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,930
Aunt asked me

358
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,640
how the progress between
you and Xia Chu is going.

359
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,880
What should I say?

360
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,160
The photo you took just now...

361
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,360
I won't delete it.

362
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,510
You send it to her.

363
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,470
Send it to her

364
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,710
and send it to me too.

365
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,920
I never thought this day would come.

366
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,330
Yesterday, a patient who
was admitted to our department

367
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,640
was taken away by a man

368
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,590
who was masquerading as a
doctor during treatment.

369
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,080
About what happened next,

370
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,030
I believe that everyone already knows.

371
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,600
I don't want to talk about

372
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,450
the patient's past and background

373
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,030
or the police investigation.

374
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,250
I wish to emphasize that

375
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,870
our responsibility as medical personnel.

376
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,270
Who was arranged to be on duty

377
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,960
on the rota when this happened?

378
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,830
It was me, chief.

379
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,560
Were you in the on-call room
or the wards at that time?

380
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,570
I

381
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,870
was at home.

382
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,380
Why?

383
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,720
I exchanged my shift with Xiao Xiao.

384
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,990
Who requested it?

385
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,590
I... I wished to rest.

386
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,930
Had this been approved

387
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,380
by the superior doctor?

388
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,350
No.

389
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,800
Do you know the behaviour
of having unauthorized shifts

390
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,750
is violation of the

391
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,460
department's management regulations?

392
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,130
I know.

393
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,790
So you knowingly did it!

394
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,350
Chief, here's the thing.

395
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,050
Xia Chu was on a mission

396
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,240
with special forces brigade

397
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,570
the night before.

398
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,550
She had been up all night.

399
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,790
We're talking about
rules and regulations now.

400
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,290
What is regulation?

401
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,220
It's the organizational
discipline beyond

402
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,580
individual will.

403
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,230
In a huge environment
like the hospital,

404
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,610
every trivial regulation

405
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,690
is set at the cost of human lives and

406
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,960
blood and tears.

407
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,560
You may exchange the shift
after staying up all night.

408
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,480
You can even take your
day off when necessary.

409
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,370
But this must be done under the

410
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,390
premise of complying with
the rules and regulations.

411
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,600
Or else

412
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,590
whoever violates the regulations

413
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,020
must bear the consequence.

414
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,460
You

415
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,510
took them from me, right?

416
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,950
You might complete you rotation
at the Emergency Department

417
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,710
when you lose all these pens.

418
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,850
Rest assured.

419
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,420
I'll talk to chief

420
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,310
and try to have you back.

421
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,400
It's really the first time I've been

422
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,840
so eager to lose them all.

423
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,060
Xia Chu,

424
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,630
no matter where you are,

425
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,360
no matter what you're doing,

426
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,000
you have to remember

427
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,020
you have the potential
to be a good doctor.

428
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,200
Thank you, Mr Zhang.

429
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,570
Only potential.

430
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,510
Dr Xia will do her best!

431
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,870
Xia Chu.

432
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,910
Are you going there now?

433
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,170
I was punished by the chief
to write self reflection paper.

434
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,990
Actually...

435
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,930
Actually, aren't you close with that

436
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,230
Brigade Commander Dong?

437
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,070
You can ask for his help.

438
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,140
It's not necessary.

439
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,280
I have no objection about

440
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,670
the result of this matter.

441
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,270
I only have one question

442
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,810
to ask you.

443
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,630
What is it?

444
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,740
You were sincere

445
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,510
about taking my shift, right?

446
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,630
Of course.

447
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,660
That day after you left,

448
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,980
I'd been sorting the medical charts

449
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,320
and the laboratory documents.

450
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,440
I was thinking to tell teacher after I

451
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,840
finished the works.

452
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,160
Who knew such accident
would happen at that time?

453
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,640
I was busy looking for the patient

454
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,070
and checking the footage.

455
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,370
That's why I forgot

456
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,200
to tell teacher about this matter.

457
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,260
I admit it was remiss of me.

458
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,500
But you can't put all the blame on me.

459
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,910
I already took your shift.

460
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,260
It's unreasonable to accept
the punishment for you.

461
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,290
You can call me selfish, petty

462
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,550
or irresponsible.

463
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,220
I don't want to go to the
Emergency Department anyway.

464
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,070
I didn't say a word in the meeting.

465
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,830
Not that I wanted to mess with you,

466
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,830
I did it out of self-protection.

467
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,430
Of course.

468
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,650
You don't have to trust me.

469
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,680
I trust you.

470
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,400
You're selfish, petty
and irresponsible.

471
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,630
But you're not a jerk.

472
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,050
Xia Chu,

473
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,390
you can ask for
Brigade Commander's help.

474
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,770
It would be useful if he could

475
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,960
help you.

476
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,280
It was my fault.

477
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,490
I should accept it.

478
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,830
Good luck to you.

479
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,180
You too.

480
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,700
Explain clearly to the family
of the patient in bed number seven.

481
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,360
I understand, Miss Song.

482
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,190
Hello, teacher.

483
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm the resident from
the Cardio Surgery,

484
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,890
I'm here for the rotation.

485
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,120
My name is Xia Chu.

486
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,830
Input these medical
advices into the computer.

487
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,680
These...

488
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,150
Sorry.

489
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,240
Look at me.

490
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,490
I forgot

491
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,560
you have heart problems.

492
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,390
How could I leave you alone at home?

493
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,050
I'm really sorry.

494
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,320
It's not your fault.

495
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,760
It's my problem.

496
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,400
I understand.

497
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,360
Can you go to my company with me?

498
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,120
I have a favour to ask.

499
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,500
Let's go.

500
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,960
Step aside!

501
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,710
Hang in there! Step aside!

502
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,910
Family, stop there!

503
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,180
No, this is my child!

504
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,670
Child, I'll wait for you out here!

505
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,440
Don't touch me!

506
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,470
Don't touch me!

507
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,960
What's wrong with her?

508
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,180
It's paraquat intoxication.

509
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,530
Don't touch me!

510
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm dirty! Don't touch me!

511
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,090
Don't touch me!

512
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,530
Be quiet! Listen to me!

513
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,720
Be quiet!

514
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,790
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

515
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,760
Can I help you?

516
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,800
There was a homicide

517
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,120
in Xiang Sheng Shipyard last night.

518
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,150
Homicide?

519
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,030
Yes.

520
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,830
Homicide.

521
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,380
Does it have anything to do with me?

522
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,200
The gun he used is made with

523
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,520
3D printing technology.

524
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,050
I don't think my company is the only

525
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,560
3D printing company in this city.

526
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,010
We know that.

527
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,830
That's why we are conducting searches

528
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:28,810
in the entire city,

529
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,930
including every staff's
computer of your company.

530
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,040
Please cooperate with us.

531
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,720
No problem.

532
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,700
You set it up.

533
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,250
Okay.

534
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,590
Officers, this way please.

535
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,910
This way please.

536
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,970
Have a seat.

537
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,050
It's fine.

538
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,050
Come.

539
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,430
I'm sorry

540
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,160
to waste your time.

541
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,910
It turned out to be of little help.

542
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,200
I heard from your secretary that

543
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,550
you didn't come to the
company yesterday.

544
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,370
Yes.

545
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,910
Something came up.

546
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,960
He rested at my house.

547
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,830
And ended up with
stress cardiomyopathy.

548
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,490
He almost died.

549
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,940
I was in and out of consciousness
for two days at home.

550
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,000
Luckily, she came in time

551
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,100
and took me to the hospital.

552
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,240
We just came from the hospital.

553
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,690
Okay.

554
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,910
Sorry for bothering you today.

555
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
Let's go.

556
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,520
Take care.

557
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,730
The police left?

558
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,120
They left.

559
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,060
What did they say?

560
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,630
There was a homicide
in Xiang Sheng Shipyard.

561
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,390
They came to check so soon.

562
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,080
Yes.

563
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,010
And

564
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,320
they said it was homicide not suicide.

565
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,160
The police

566
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,670
already got suspicious.

567
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,370
Impossible.

568
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,590
Didn't we falsify the scene?

569
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,310
Under that urgent situation,

570
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,290
I can't guarantee

571
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,160
there was no flaw
even if it was falsified.

572
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,540
The police already got
suspicious anyway.

573
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,780
You can evacuate first if you're afraid.

574
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,150
What about you?

575
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,960
I have to complete my mission.

576
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,060
Have you forgotten

577
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,110
Xia Guang Yuan is the
final target of this operation.

578
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,460
Perhaps

579
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,520
we can go after another person.

580
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,160
From the first day you
joined the project,

581
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,330
the first thing I emphasized was
information security!

582
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,840
The information security!

583
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,630
You're experienced too.

584
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,660
It's not that you don't
know how rampant

585
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,130
those economic espionages are!

586
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,790
Do not use the
Internet if it's a secret!

587
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
This is the basic working principle!

588
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,150
How could you violate it?

589
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,890
I'm sorry, sir.

590
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,180
The email was indeed yours.

591
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,020
You should reconfirm
it with me as well!

592
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,900
Moreover,

593
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,060
when did I ever ask you

594
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,200
to send the data of the project
to my personal email?

595
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,390
Sorry, sir. It's my fault.

596
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,840
That was when we were in Ningjiang.

597
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,920
I thought it was urgent,

598
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,200
so I sent it to you.

599
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,430
You...

600
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,220
Get out.

601
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,340
[Surprise.]

602
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,030
I went to Mi Gu's
neighbourhood to verify.

603
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,310
According to the property staff,

604
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,870
he saw a man like Zhuo Ran

605
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,960
appeared at Mi Gu's door

606
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,420
at the night of the case.

607
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,650
So he has an alibi

608
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,500
on the night of the case.

609
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,480
Yes.

610
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,190
Rao Zhi,

611
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,960
do we have to bring
him over to interrogate?

612
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,880
This person

613
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,760
keep popping up in the case,

614
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,440
but there has been no direct evidence

615
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,639
pointing to him.

616
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,690
Either

617
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,560
it's true that he is innocent

618
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,110
or he is an expert of
avoiding detection.

619
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,130
There's nothing we can get

620
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,770
if we question him now.

621
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,040
Then what should we do now?

622
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,230
Just keep an eye on him

623
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,760
and see what his next move is.

624
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,910
Understood!

625
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,150
[Are you free?]

626
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,090
[Tang, here's another toast for you.]

627
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,900
Mr Zhuo, taste this.

628
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,170
Mr Zhuo,

629
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,950
it's true.

630
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,070
I really appreciate
that you could come.

631
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,080
I'm really upset today.

632
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,040
It's true.

633
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,560
I really appreciate

634
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,310
you could come and accompany me.

635
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,520
Here,

636
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,280
I drink to you.

637
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,490
Is this 110?

638
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,390
I want to file a report.

639
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,740
[Mr Zhuo, I am Tang Lin.]

640
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,330
[I'm at Xia Guang Police Station.]

641
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,970
[Can you come and pick me up?]

642
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,150
Okay.

643
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,890
Mr Zhuo,

644
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,300
yesterday after you left,

645
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,730
I shouldn't have gone up to sing.

646
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,840
I had a few drinks after that.

647
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,070
Then I didn't remember

648
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,200
what happened after that.

649
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,580
When I woke up,

650
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,580
I was on the bed in a hotel

651
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,840
and there was a lady
sleeping beside me.

652
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,250
After that, the police came and said

653
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,440
I was suspected of prostitution.

654
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,550
I didn't even remember

655
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,620
how I went to the hotel

656
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,340
and how I checked in.

657
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,120
Why did you drink that much?

658
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,490
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

659
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,420
I shouldn't have drunk that much.

660
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm doomed if the institute

661
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,490
finds out.

662
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,300
How could the institute know it?

663
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,590
But if teacher knew it...

664
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,390
Rest assured.

665
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,600
I won't say a word to

666
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,950
Professor Xia.

667
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,180
It's not what I meant.

668
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,950
I know what you're afraid of.

669
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,590
Dr Tang, actually,
you can take it easy.

670
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,790
With your qualifications,

671
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,950
you won't run out of options

672
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,940
even if you leave the institute.

673
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,730
Instead,

674
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,140
you might have more room
for development if you leave,

675
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,460
comparing to the

676
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,210
fixed wage you currently get.

677
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,510
I would never

678
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,930
even think of this.

679
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,120
Think about it.

680
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,290
If you own a private jet,

681
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,390
you could date your girlfriend

682
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,530
at any place in the
world and enjoy

683
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,040
the fun of scientific research
and financial freedom.

684
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,950
You will have the means

685
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,380
to make a bolder choice.

686
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,280
Mr Zhuo,

687
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,510
do you have connections?

688
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,610
For a person who burnt seven cakes

689
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,270
in one night,

690
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,390
the success just now

691
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,270
was destined to be an
unforgettable moment.

692
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,580
Do you have anything
to tell me and Er Miao?

693
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,880
The ninth wonder of humanity!

694
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,830
Put me down. There's some
crumbs on the table.

695
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,640
Where are you going?

696
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,310
Put me down!

697
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,740
He left us behind.

698
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,510
Put me down. There's some
crumbs on the table!

699
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,510
Perhaps the only thing a man in a rut

700
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,310
could see is love.

701
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,370
Take it easy.

702
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,510
Dr Zhang.

703
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,230
I'm sorry.

704
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,260
How could someone show interest

705
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,090
in a rough guy like you?

706
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,250
The does anyone show interest in a

707
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,480
gentleman like you?

708
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,060
Man,

709
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,110
can you not poke at my sore spot?

710
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,530
Are you bringing food for her?

711
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,790
Yes.

712
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,860
Where is Xia Chu?

713
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,090
She is at the Emergency Department.

714
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,210
Does she have a patient?

715
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,040
You didn't know?

716
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,400
What happened?

717
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,520
The person you guys saved

718
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,680
went missing

719
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,950
during her shift.

720
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,830
Chief Chen is very mad.

721
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,630
So she was sent to
the Emergency Department.

722
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,200
Just consider it

723
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,910
as a training.

724
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,570
I'll go and visit her.

725
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,230
You have no hesitation in

726
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,560
pursuing a girl.

727
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,920
Being a soldier is busy,

728
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,470
I have no time to hesitate.

729
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,920
I should learn from you.

730
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,880
I know you doctors are neat,

731
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,760
so

732
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,750
I made you a handmade soap.

733
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,900
I hope you like it.

734
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,310
You specially made it for me?

735
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,340
It's me.

736
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,030
[Can I help you?]

737
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,550
I just used the soap you gave to me.

738
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,510
You just used it?

739
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,930
I'm not willing to use it.

740
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,190
It'll be gone if I finished it.

741
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,930
Do you like it?

742
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,340
It's good.

743
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,930
It has a faint fragrance

744
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,600
[and]

745
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,880
[it's not stimulating.]

746
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,490
It doesn't hurt my hands.

747
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,220
It's great.

748
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,340
[Do...]

749
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,390
[Do you have time on weekend?]

750
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,410
I would like to go see you.

751
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,990
Didn't I say I wanted to buy books

752
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,230
but I didn't?

753
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,080
Mum, I'm going to school.

754
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,160
I love you.

755
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,610
Stay safe!

756
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,800
It might not work on weekend.

757
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,750
[I promised Xiao Jun to
fly kite with him.]

758
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,500
How about this?

759
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,400
I'll go with you guys, can I?

760
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,130
[The playground is not ours.]

761
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,400
Why do you need my permission?

762
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,950
You can go if you want.

763
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

764
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,580
That's the deal.

765
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,580
See you this weekend.

766
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,720
Okay, goodbye.

767
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,930
[Goodbye.]

768
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,960
Doctor,

769
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,160
doctor, listen to me.

770
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,130
What's going on?

771
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,550
When can we leave?

772
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,300
Doctor!

773
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,480
Give me a reply!

774
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,080
When can my daughter recover?

775
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,090
Didn't you hear what I told you just now?

776
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,400
Your daughter is in a
very dangerous situation.

777
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,560
We'll keep on

778
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,080
treating her after the hemoperfusion.

779
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,430
It's a difficult process.

780
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,760
So we need you, her family,

781
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,930
and the patient to cooperate.

782
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,510
It's too hard.

783
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,480
I already spent more than 5000 dollars.

784
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,920
What should I do next?

785
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,250
Moreover, isn't she already awake?

786
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,830
Why can't she be discharged?

787
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,230
Do you really have to drain us

788
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,360
before you let her go?

789
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,480
Do you know what paraquat is?

790
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,960
Isn't that just herbicide?

791
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,670
I heard that it's not even poisonous.

792
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,110
Who did you hear from?

793
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm the doctor.

794
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,420
Can you listen to me?

795
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,440
Ten milligrams of
paraquat can be fatal.

796
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,150
Your daughter's current situation
is very dangerous.

797
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,370
Do you know that?

798
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,930
Senior,

799
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,970
was the paraquat
poisoned patient who got

800
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,760
admitted to the
gastroenterology department

801
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,590
of your hospital cured?

802
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,020
[Fourteen days after admission,]

803
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,370
[the blood oxygenation began to drop.]

804
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,950
[It was at 60 percent.]

805
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,520
[The oxygen partial
pressure was bad too.]

806
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,940
[We put the patient on a respirator.]

807
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,350
[It resulted in aggravating
the alveolar damage.]

808
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,720
[It started a vicious cycle.]

809
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,750
[He passed away last week.]

810
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,570
Didn't I tell you...

811
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,830
Tell me what?

812
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,090
I thought you were
the patient's family.

813
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,320
You're really close to
the patient's family now.

814
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,240
They even bring you food.

815
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,950
You succeeded?

816
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,860
Have a taste.

817
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,340
I'm hungry too.

818
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,660
Let me taste it.

819
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,070
It tastes good.

820
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,040
You said it tastes good without

821
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,350
knowing what taste it is?
