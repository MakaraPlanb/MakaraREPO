00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,600
Mi Gu.

5
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,410
Boss.

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,200
The...

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,490
The clip is almost ready.

8
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,850
I'll send it to your office

9
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,370
once I've reviewed the captions.

10
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm not here for the clip.

11
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,940
This.

12
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,650
My nephew

13
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,130
studied documentary making
in Bristol.

14
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,880
He wants to do a project of his own.

15
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,740
If you're free in the
next couple of days,

16
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,970
get in touch with him.

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,130
He's a nice kid.

18
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,440
You two will get along well.

19
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,960
Think of it as making a new friend.

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,620
[Liu Song]

21
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,640
Thanks, boss.

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,780
That's right.

23
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,920
Friends and family

24
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,360
should look out for each other.

25
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,960
Contact the buyer.

26
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,350
[Okay.]

27
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,640
Alright, thanks.

28
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,380
Rao Zhi.

29
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,630
Do you know him?

30
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,760
No.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,080
We found this in his phone.

32
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,880
Is this the dead man in the villa?

33
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,210
That's right.

34
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,320
Is he the killer?

35
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,800
We're not sure yet.

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,130
I've asked my colleagues
in the technical department

37
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,440
to do a DNA test on the body.

38
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,640
I've also contacted the
telecommunications operator.

39
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,550
We need to confirm his identity first.

40
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,670
If he's not the killer,
how do you explain the photo?

41
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,090
Ever heard of the City of Desire?

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,220
What's that?

43
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,770
It's a website.

44
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,130
But it's a little different

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,480
from the websites we're used to.

46
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,480
It's a trading platform hidden deep

47
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,000
within the Dark Web.

48
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,490
[The founder could be related]

49
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,079
[to an account named Scary Pirate.]

50
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,810
[It was Scary Pirate]

51
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,850
[who first posted this photo]

52
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,280
[on the City of Desire.]

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,720
[Before this, a female suicide victim]

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,950
[had downloaded the photo
onto her computer.]

55
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,340
Now, it seems

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,110
this photo

57
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,800
didn't pop up by pure chance.

58
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,050
I suspect it's

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,160
some form of invitation.

60
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,130
A means to identify
an in-group member.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,330
Behind it all,

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,610
there may very well

63
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,800
be a deeper, darker secret.

64
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,750
The Scary Pirate,

65
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,079
what's his aim?

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,170
Our colleagues at the
Psychology Department

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,550
put together a profile
of the Scary Pirate.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,340
We learned that he's probably

69
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,510
an anti-social militant anarchist.

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,909
Those types are characterised

71
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,560
by their aggression

72
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,790
and lack of remorse.

73
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,310
Their crimes

74
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,050
tend to appear coincidental.

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,400
How can we find him?

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,480
It's difficult.

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,260
The Dark Web is notorious
for its anonymity.

78
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,090
Those who dwell within it

79
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,950
are akin to masked men

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,550
moving in the shadows.

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,240
They're very hard to catch.

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Perhaps this Scary Pirate

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,210
is the culprit behind the dead man
in the villa?

84
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,930
Not only that.

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,220
There's also Sang Kun's

86
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,390
borderland organ harvesting case

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,950
and his brother, Gui's death.

88
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,160
He may very well be a key lead.

89
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,280
All we can do now

90
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,610
is use the Scary Pirate's

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,440
online activity pattern

92
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,710
to perform a stake-out.

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,090
Hopefully, we'll get some clues

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,480
or his personal information.

95
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,080
But because of the Dark Web's
peculiarities,

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,450
even if we spend an inordinate amount

97
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,360
of manpower and money,

98
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,730
we might still lose track of him.

99
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,840
Progress will be slow.

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,620
Rao Zhi.

101
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,640
The Network Security Centre just called.

102
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,580
Gui's cargo has surfaced.

103
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,640
Lieutenant.

104
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,150
Come play with us.

105
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,570
If you don't,

106
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,550
Xiao Teng is going to wipe the floor
with me.

107
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,760
What are you saying?

108
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,050
Lieutenant.

109
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,190
You're holding the book upside down.

110
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,470
It's called being a proficient reader.

111
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,890
Lieutenant,

112
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,180
whose call are you waiting for?

113
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm not waiting for anyone's call.

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,750
Even Xiang Yang could tell.

115
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,880
Quit being so secretive.

116
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,950
You must be waiting for a girl
to call you.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,890
Last time, at the New Year dinner,

118
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,010
I overheard the Brigade Commander's

119
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,440
conversation with the chief of delegates.

120
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,570
He was asking him to
watch over a certain nurse

121
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,700
in the medical corps for you.

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,630
Could something have turned up?

123
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,960
Xiao Teng.

124
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,350
Your ears sure are sharp.

125
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,360
How come I didn't hear that?

126
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,650
I can't help it.

127
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,360
Collecting intel is my speciality.

128
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,680
Attention!

129
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,660
Commander!

130
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,300
Which ones of you

131
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,660
have been to a bar?

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,810
Commander.

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,810
You have?

134
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,960
I was going to say
I've never been to a bar.

135
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,890
Xiao Teng!

136
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,990
Yes, sir!

137
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,130
Have you?

138
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,800
Commander,

139
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,659
I've never set foot in one of those

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,130
cesspools of debauchery.

141
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,290
You haven't?

142
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,880
Then how do you know
they're cesspools of debauchery?

143
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,600
That's ancient history, way before
I joined the force.

144
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,159
Who else?

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,180
Commander!

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,230
Me.

147
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
There's no need to tell me
you haven't been to one.

148
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,920
I have.

149
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,280
Before I joined the force,
I worked in a bar.

150
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,190
Well I'll be.

151
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,710
You. And you.

152
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,720
Change into some civilian clothes

153
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,720
and follow me.

154
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,790
Yes, sir!

155
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,840
Once you've reached the destination,

156
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,160
go straight upstairs.

157
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,080
Someone will be waiting for you.

158
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,240
Commander, what's the mission?

159
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,360
You'll know when you get there.

160
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,970
Remember,

161
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,600
you must follow

162
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,020
our command.

163
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,230
Wipe the sweat.

165
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,840
Whale?

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,200
Aren't you supposed to be
on break?

167
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,480
Let's talk over there.

168
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,070
Well, Gopher?

169
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,270
Don't I look dashing?

170
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,370
Have you ever seen

171
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,560
a more dashing waiter?

172
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,020
I say,

173
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,530
what's with the heart armour?

174
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,800
I crafted it out of a used
bulletproof vest.

175
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,970
Seriously?

176
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,720
It's better than having nothing at all.

177
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,960
Impressive.

178
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,480
Tell me,

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,590
is there anything you can't do?

180
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,720
Once you've had your heart
pierced by a bullet,

181
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,520
let alone heart armour,

182
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,280
you'll learn how to crank out
chain mails.

183
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,680
I guess you're right.

184
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,980
Alright.

185
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,840
Have you suited up?

186
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes.

187
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
Captain.

188
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,790
We've coordinated with the bar.

189
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,330
Let me remind you,

190
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,640
these aren't run-of-the-mill
drug dealers we're arresting.

191
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,740
They all have a long list
of murder charges

192
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,630
as well as T4's backing.

193
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,510
[They are the shadow.]

194
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,240
[And we're the shadow's shadow.]

195
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,010
[Our mission]

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,390
[is to apprehend the middleman]

197
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,800
[as soon as the deal takes place.]

198
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,510
[Try not to use bullets]

199
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,150
[or create a huge racket.]

200
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,610
[Wouldn't want to hurt the innocent.

201
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,710
Suspect spotted.

202
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,090
Fox.

203
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,090
Try to approach his backpack.

204
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,950
Sorry, sir.

205
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,470
Let me wipe that for you.

206
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,160
Whale, follow him.

207
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,030
[Calling all teams. This is a trap.]

208
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,060
What's going on?

209
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,040
The City of Desire has changed domains.

210
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,000
Into the deeper Dark Web.

211
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,080
[The Scary Pirate posted
a wanting-to-sell ad]

212
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,810
[the day after Gui was murdered.]

213
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,050
[Later, he got in touch]

214
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,540
[with a buyer called Franster]

215
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,550
[and agreed to deal in Yunshan Tunnel.]

216
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,560
[The bar is probably a diversion.]

217
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,210
Ask the City Bureau

218
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,170
to deploy its people

219
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,910
to set up blockades along
the roads connected to Yunshan Tunnel

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
and check all vehicles.

221
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,860
Okay.

222
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,720
[Have you checked the suspect]

223
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,880
[in the bar?]

224
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,380
[The stationed officers
have checked them.]

225
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,910
[The backpack contained only
some daily necessities.]

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,690
[Nothing suspicious was found.]

227
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,940
Criminals these days sure
are tricky.

228
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,340
What did you expect?

229
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,920
Why did you think we set up
such an elaborate stake-out?

230
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,440
Too bad we didn't catch him.

231
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,840
We will.

232
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,040
That's right.

233
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,920
Nothing is perfect.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,980
Once something goes down,
there's nowhere to hide.

235
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,120
You should have confidence

236
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,530
and be brave.

237
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,450
No matter how many times you fail,

238
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,910
you must pick yourself up.

239
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,600
What are you talking about?

240
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,880
Aren't we talking about

241
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,080
busting crimes?

242
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,280
Why do I feel you're talking
about relationships?

243
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,250
Get out of here.

244
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,160
About your experience in
finding love.

245
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,480
I was talking about busting crime.

246
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,720
Do you understand?

247
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,550
Really?

248
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,360
Something's not right here.

249
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,540
What's going on, Gopher?

250
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,450
Don't touch me.

251
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,050
Look...

252
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,240
[Calling all teams.]

253
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,590
[You can pull back now.]

254
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,780
Roger that.

255
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,700
Let's change and get out of here.

256
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,850
Okay.

257
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,560
Sir.

258
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,750
What is it?

259
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,900
Thank you for letting me
observe the operation.

260
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,200
You're too kind.

261
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,640
You deserved it.

262
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,990
Remember,

263
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,520
even if they're off life support,

264
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,060
one in four patients

265
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,150
may still die of infections.

266
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,420
Understood.

267
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,760
Get some rest.

268
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,310
Sir.

269
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,710
Can I borrow your phone?

270
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,150
What about yours?

271
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,910
Mine is sodden.

272
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,920
I would like to use yours

273
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,440
to call Liang Mu Ze.

274
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,610
Thanks to him,

275
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,510
we were able to get
the replacement lung.

276
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,660
You ought to.

277
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,520
But I'm sorry to tell you,

278
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,680
look,

279
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,230
my battery's dead.

280
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,090
I was just about find a place
to make a phone call.

281
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,950
Never mind.

282
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,180
I'll charge it.

283
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,670
You can use mine.

284
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,720
Thanks.

285
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,210
Captain,

286
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,480
you had a long day.

287
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,750
Why don't you let me drive?

288
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,690
It's okay.

289
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,840
I'm good.

290
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,620
Letting my captain chauffeur me.

291
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,630
How is this appropriate?

292
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,390
With your driving speed? Forget it.

293
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,619
I want to live.

294
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,480
That was because

295
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,599
we were chased by enemies
during the drill.

296
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,960
A good soldier never falls back.

297
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,369
That's what Lieutenant taught me.

298
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,550
Right, Lieutenant?

299
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,069
What's on your mind?

300
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,359
What do you mean?

301
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,569
Look at you.

302
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,109
And you say it's not love?

303
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,089
Are you kidding me?

304
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,030
That's my phone.

305
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm just checking the time.

306
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,790
[Liang Mu Ze.]

307
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
My phone is sodden.

308
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,460
I'm calling you from
my colleague's phone.

309
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,830
How come your phone
is working just fine?

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,070
Yeah, it's fine.

311
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,010
If your phone is wet,

312
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,450
you can try putting it

313
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,830
in a bag of rice.

314
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,480
[Got it.]

315
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,550
So is Liu Ran alright?

316
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,040
The surgery was a success.

317
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,760
Her lungs are starting
to function again.

318
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,560
Good.

319
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,380
[But there are more challenges
down the road.]

320
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,890
Rejection and infection

321
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,240
being the two major hurdles

322
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,080
to sustained lung function.

323
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,250
Under your care,

324
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,760
it shouldn't be a problem, right?

325
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,410
[Actually,]

326
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,910
I'm not that great.

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,060
It was the effort of the whole team.

328
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,220
Including you,

329
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,290
[Liang Mu Ze.]

330
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,740
[Today,]

331
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,400
[I can't thank you enough.]

332
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,290
Thank me for what?

333
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,290
[Thank you for recovering
the replacement lung.]

334
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,420
And

335
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,530
thank you for saving me underwater.

336
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,570
Because of the
incident with Zhuo Ran,

337
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,070
I was a little emotional

338
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,350
[and spoke harshly to you.]

339
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,450
[I'm sorry.]

340
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,140
[Actually...]

341
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,570
Actually, you're alright.

342
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,250
[More and more, I feel that]

343
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
[at the brink of life and death,]

344
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,570
as long as I have you,

345
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,700
I don't need to be afraid.

346
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,660
[It's quite reassuring.]

347
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,730
Who's with you?

348
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,400
It's just Tian Yong and Xiao Teng.

349
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,620
[I'm sending them back
to the camp.]

350
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,120
And

351
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,790
my phone is still connected
to the car's

352
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,220
[Bluetooth speaker.]

353
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,680
[Xia Chu.]

354
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,690
Xia Chu.

355
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,240
Liang Mu Ze, I hate you so much!

356
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,520
What's going on?

357
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,540
Is Dr Xia...

358
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,620
Is she that petty?

359
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,920
Now what, Lieutenant?

360
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,820
What should we do?

361
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,890
How would I know?

362
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,370
Captain, wait for me!

363
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,930
Me, too!

364
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,630
Rao Feng filled me in
on last night's situation.

365
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,570
You guys were responsible
for execution,

366
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,690
not strategy.

367
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,190
So the blame for the failure

368
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,410
doesn't rest with you.

369
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,410
Pull yourself together.

370
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,740
In the future,

371
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,340
we'll work on many more
missions together.

372
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,370
Yes, sir.

373
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,470
How many leave days do you have left?

374
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,500
Three days.

375
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,070
Do you want to spend them?

376
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,390
I do.

377
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,020
Good.

378
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,860
Are you spending it with your cousin?

379
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,110
With

380
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,690
Xia Chu.

381
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,240
Who?

382
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,240
Xia Chu.

383
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,100
Are you having so much fun here
that you forgot about your family?

384
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
Do your parents know?

385
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,210
It was my mother who arranged it.

386
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,890
I knew it.

387
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,050
That's wonderful.

388
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,810
Feel free to use my car

389
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,030
until yours is fixed.

390
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,110
You'll need it

391
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,350
for your date.

392
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,790
We haven't gotten that far, Commander.

393
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
Then get on with it.

394
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,980
Listen here,

395
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,100
Xia Chu is a good girl.

396
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,670
She's presentable

397
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,200
and cheerful.

398
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,510
She has the makings
of an officer's wife.

399
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,230
Hurry up. Make her your girlfriend.

400
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,400
It can wait.

401
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,370
What do you mean it can wait?

402
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,420
You can wait,

403
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,070
but the girl can't.

404
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,580
After you make her your girlfriend,

405
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,450
you'll have to wait at least
six months

406
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,760
before you can propose marriage.

407
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,100
Think of all the time

408
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,650
you're wasting.

409
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,850
Get to it.

410
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,180
But I don't know where I stand with her.

411
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,000
What have you been doing

412
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,430
throughout your long break?

413
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,120
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze,

414
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,840
with regards to your love life
and marriage,

415
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,210
I don't want

416
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,200
any screw-ups from you.

417
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,380
If you truly love Xia Chu

418
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,790
and want to share a life with her,

419
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,100
you should let her know
as soon as possible.

420
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,850
You want me to confess to her?

421
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,510
She should confess to me.

422
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,180
What are you on about?

423
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,750
Commander,

424
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,390
Xia Chu

425
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,390
is not like other girls.

426
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
Don't compare her to others.

427
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,690
She has an attitude.

428
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,250
I wonder who it was that bragged

429
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,570
about frequenting women's bedrooms

430
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,190
and having problems

431
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,060
saying no to their adoration?

432
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,870
Well?

433
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,030
Can't handle it

434
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,480
this time?

435
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,520
It's not that I can't handle it.

436
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,040
I just don't want to rush it.

437
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,100
Commander,

438
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,770
there are many ways

439
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,280
to a woman's heart.

440
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Countless ways.

441
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,870
But on Xia Chu,

442
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,600
I can't use any of them.

443
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920
Especially at a time like this.

444
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,280
What's wrong?

445
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,910
What are you hesitating for?

446
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,500
Have they decided who's
going to be transferred?

447
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,570
Captain!

448
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,050
Didn't the Brigade Commander
give you a half-day leave?

449
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,040
You're up early.

450
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,000
It's in my habit.

451
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,790
Didn't run enough yesterday?

452
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,890
Captain,

453
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,520
I'd like to ask you

454
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,510
a question,

455
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,240
but I'm not sure if I should.

456
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,050
You shouldn't.

457
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,100
Captain.

458
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,590
How is your sister?

459
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,890
Xiao Xue?

460
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,100
I'm so tired.

461
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,480
Er Miao,

462
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,010
I'm so tired, I can't even take a shower.

463
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,800
You chose this path.

464
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,000
You'll have to walk it
even if it's on your knees.

465
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,990
I must've been crazy when I decided
to study medicine.

466
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,340
Er Miao,

467
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,950
are doctors this miserable

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,850
or is it just the resident doctors?

469
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,380
All of them, of course.

470
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
Let me get my phone.

471
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,730
[Braised Egg]

472
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,580
[Is Xiao Xue there?]

473
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,660
Why should I tell you?

474
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,350
We haven't settled last night's score yet.

475
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,140
[She's not here.]

476
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,160
Liang Mu Ze, will you ever quit?

477
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,840
I told you she's not home.

478
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,080
Why must you call me?

479
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,200
Can't you call her phone?

480
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,440
I don't want to speak to you,

481
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,740
do you hear me?

482
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,480
Xia Chu.

483
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,780
It's me.

484
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,760
[Zhuo Ran]

485
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,660
Sorry.

486
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,870
What's up?

487
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm at the hospital.

488
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,380
Can you come over?

489
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,710
[Why?]

490
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
Just come.

491
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,700
I'll be waiting.

492
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,710
[Do you know where she is?]

493
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,380
She was going to visit the parrot
at the Special Forces Brigade.

494
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,780
Didn't you see her?

495
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,860
That's right.

496
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,980
She took a ride around 1 p.m. yesterday.

497
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,780
The license plate number...

498
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,310
Bin C49058.

499
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,950
[She smiled at me
when she got into the car.]

500
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,600
[And then she cried.]

501
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,160
[She said she didn't want to
go home]

502
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,280
[and asked me to take her
to Yunshan Tunnel.]

503
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,270
[Then as soon as we reached
the coastal road,]

504
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,700
[she asked me to pull over,]

505
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,530
[telling me she changed her mind.]

506
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
[So I pulled over]

507
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,550
[to let her decide where
she wanted to go.]

508
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,760
[She stared blankly out of the window,]

509
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,830
[then told me to continue on
to Yunshan Tunnel.]

510
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,120
[This went on several times.]

511
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,160
[Finally,]

512
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,170
[I dropped her at the entrance
of the tunnel.]

513
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,410
[I'm telling you,]

514
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,080
[in all my years as a driver,]

515
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,160
[I've never come across such
a fussy customer.]

516
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,650
[She was erratic.]

517
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,870
[Is she mentally ill?]

518
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,510
Xiao Xue!

519
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,950
Xiao Xue!

520
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,070
Xiao Xue!

521
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,430
Xia Chu.

522
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,420
[Where are you?]

523
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,060
Yunshan Tunnel.

524
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,480
Is Xiao Xue back yet?

525
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,040
[No.]

526
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,990
[She's in the Emergency Department.
Please come right now.]

527
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,430
Xiao Xue.

528
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,710
Xiao Xue.

529
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,150
Xiao Xue.

530
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,990
Why are you with her?

531
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,870
I bumped into her.

532
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,840
Where?

533
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,310
Is this an interrogation?

534
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,870
I'm asking you, where?

535
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,550
Yunshan Tunnel.

536
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,320
Last night?

537
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,470
That's right.

538
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,070
I was on my night jog.

539
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,720
I thought it dangerous
for a girl to be sleeping there.

540
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,460
There was a case
at Yunshan Tunnel yesterday.

541
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,260
All the cops were there

542
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,390
and none of them saw you?

543
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,630
A case?

544
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,690
I have no idea.

545
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,270
Maybe I missed it.

546
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,670
How lucky for you.

547
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,110
Even if they saw me, so what?

548
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,950
I'm sure your country's policemen

549
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,080
will take good care

550
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,270
of a friendly foreigner's
rights and well-being.

551
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,110
We only protect allies.

552
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,950
The dress your sister is wearing

553
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,630
belonged to Xia Chu, isn't that right?

554
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,800
I remember the first time

555
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,270
Xia Chu and I kissed,

556
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,620
she was wearing this very dress.

557
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,310
After all these years,

558
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,770
she still kept it.

559
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,190
Otherwise, I wouldn't have recognised

560
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,710
your sister and saved her.

561
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,790
I called Xia Chu, and it turned out
I was right.

562
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,790
You should thank me.

563
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,250
No.

564
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,260
You should thank that kiss.

565
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,380
Now that I think of it,

566
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,940
it kind of left me wanting more.

567
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,020
Liang Mu Ze!

568
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,300
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

569
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,070
Such a temper, Officer Liang.

570
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,960
Do all soldiers have such
violent tendencies?

571
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,720
Liang Mu Ze, let go.

572
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,560
Let go right now.

573
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,140
This is a hospital, Liang Mu Ze.

574
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,900
Liang Mu Ze.

575
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,060
Listen here,

576
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,260
no funny business.

577
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,990
Xiao Xue's report!

578
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,820
Xia Chu.

579
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,520
You're staying under one roof
with a guy like that.

580
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,490
Aren't you scared?

581
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,740
How did you know?

582
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,830
Know what?

583
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,010
I never told you

584
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,260
I'm staying in Liang Mu Ze's house.

585
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,990
How did you know?

586
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,220
Mi Gu.

587
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,660
She told me.

588
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,390
I'm really worried about you.

589
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,390
I apologise

590
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,150
for Liang Mu Ze's behaviour just now.

591
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,450
I'm sorry.

592
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,670
Please forgive him.

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,840
One more thing.

594
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,520
The Liang Mu Ze I know

595
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,140
isn't the Liang Mu Ze you know.

596
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
So

597
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,590
please don't say things like that again.

598
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,950
[Tang Lin]

599
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,420
[Hallo, Mr Zhuo,]

600
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
[are you in Dong'an?]

601
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,300
[Let's meet up.]

602
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,620
Sure.

603
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,870
Let's meet up.

604
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,630
Lower your head.

605
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,870
Drive.

606
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,950
Liang Mu Ze!

607
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,880
Liang Mu Ze!

608
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,230
Liang Mu Ze!

609
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,600
Liang Mu Ze, who are you
throwing tantrums at?

610
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,880
I've just finished a 14-hour shift.

611
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,320
I was supposed to rest today.

612
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,200
But because of your sister,

613
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,240
I had to rush to the hospital

614
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,380
before I got one minute
of shut-eye.

615
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,920
If you don't want to thank me, fine.

616
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,320
But why are you
giving me the cold shoulder?

617
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,630
Liang Mu Ze!

618
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,100
Liang Mu Ze, come out!

619
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,270
Come out, Liang Mu Ze!

620
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,310
Liang Mu Ze!

621
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,840
Liang Mu Ze, open up.

622
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,540
Come out, Liang Mu Ze!

623
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,550
You really went off the rails today,
you know that?

624
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,350
Why did you hit him?

625
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,760
No matter how contemptible
you find him,

626
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,790
no matter how scornful you are,

627
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,830
you shouldn't have hit him
at a place like that.

628
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,110
You made a brute of yourself

629
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,110
when you're clearly not.

630
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,990
Liang Mu Ze, is something wrong
with your brain?

631
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,320
Say something, Liang Mu Ze.

632
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,910
He's jealous.

633
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,990
When did you wake up?

634
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,360
When we were at the hospital.

635
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,159
Your ex said you were wearing
this dress

636
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,030
when you first kissed him.

637
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,159
Your ex even said

638
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,880
the kiss left him wanting more.

639
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,560
Sure enough, my brother took offence

640
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,590
and gave him a punch.

641
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,870
But you, of all people, saw it.

642
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,230
You even pushed my brother aside

643
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,199
and stood in between

644
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,420
him and your ex.

645
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,409
That made my brother angrier.

646
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,239
He walked past me

647
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,000
as if his feet were on fire.

648
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,630
I thought he would knock me over.

649
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,350
Given the

650
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,360
complicated and dangerous
circumstance,

651
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,040
I decided to feign unconsciousness.

652
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,310
Until just now,

653
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,820
when I heard you reproach my brother,

654
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,120
I thought if didn't wake up

655
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,840
and tell his side of the story,

656
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,070
this argument would never end.

657
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,719
Arrogant guys like my brother

658
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,989
don't feel like they have
to explain anything.

659
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,620
Right, Mu Ze?

660
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,520
Is what

661
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,580
she said

662
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,630
true?

663
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:21,240
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

664
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:28,200
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

665
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:35,400
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

666
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:43,500
♫ To relive the moment
my heart skipped a beat ♫

667
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,640
♫ Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you ♫

668
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,750
Children, please look away.

669
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,510
♫ If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

670
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:07,140
♫ I can't remember when
I fell in love with you ♫

671
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,060
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

672
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:21,170
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

673
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,220
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

674
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:36,610
♫ To relive the moment
my heart skipped a beat ♫

675
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,950
What was that about?

676
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm feeling blue. Can't you see?

677
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,950
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

678
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:14,060
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

679
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:21,110
♫ I can't help but look forward

680
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:30,010
♫ To relive the moment
my heart skipped a beat ♫

681
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,470
Where are we going?

682
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,620
Where do you want to go?

683
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,460
You're the one who dragged me along.

684
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,460
I don't feel like going anywhere.

685
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,850
I just want to sleep.

686
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,150
Let's go to the mall.

687
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,470
What for?

688
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,020
To buy dresses.

689
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:49,120
♫  The sky is smiling
and my heart is fluttering ♫

690
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,400
♫ Time stops as we're surrounded
by happiness ♫

691
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,470
Hey buddy, you're not married, are you?

692
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,070
How can you tell?

693
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,390
I could tell at a glance.

694
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,500
You're like me when I was younger.

695
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,740
Full of pep.

696
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,470
What about after marriage?

697
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,950
Observe.

698
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,740
Honey, what do you think of this dress?

699
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,920
Looks good.

700
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,500
At least take a look first.

701
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,750
Sure, it's nice.

702
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,540
Liang Mu Ze.

703
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,690
I'm sure you'll do better than
us after you get married.

704
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,700
♫  We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

705
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,380
♫ We chit-chat the whole night through ♫
♫  ​The sweetness is just right ♫

706
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,310
♫ We share the same taste in food ♫
♫  The sweetness is just right ♫

707
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,830
♫  No one knows what
triggered our first fight ♫

708
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,320
♫  When we think back, love is a wonder ♫

709
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,090
♫  Our encounter is not too old school ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

710
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,200
♫  Our connection is not too boring ♫
♫  The amount of happiness is just right ♫

711
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,850
♫  No one ever notices
your smiling lashes ♫

712
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:27,410
♫  We don't have to think about it
as we are destined to meet ♫

713
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,670
Smells delicious.

714
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,630
Have another bite.

715
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,520
What's wrong?

716
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,830
I'll help myself.

717
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,880
Don't you want to eat?

718
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,750
I don't like sweets.

719
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,240
Then you're

720
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,380
missing out on the
great pleasures of life.

721
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,470
Try some.

722
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't want to.

723
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,080
Just one bite.

724
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,040
Just try it.

725
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,360
Durian is delicious.

726
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,600
It smells a little funky, that's all.

727
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,870
It's really yummy.

728
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,520
Take a bite.

729
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,870
No, thanks. Save it for yourself.

730
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,120
-Just one bite.
-No.

731
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,590
-Liang Mu Ze.
-I don't want to.

732
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
Try some.

733
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,640
-No.
-Just one little bite.

734
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,750
I don't want to.

735
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,840
Seriously.

736
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,740
Just one bite, come on.

737
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,310
You actually ate durian?

738
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,530
Are you blind?

739
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,040
For the first time in his life,

740
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,350
Liang Mu Ze actually tasted durian.

741
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,360
Well?

742
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,470
How did it taste?

743
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,600
Nothing special.

744
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,440
That's beside the point.

745
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,340
What matters is you ate durian.

746
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,660
Liang Mu Ze ate durian!

747
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,250
Are you nuts?

748
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,990
The first taste of durian.

749
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,480
The first taste...

750
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,690
♫ Liking what you like,
sensitive to every detail ♫

751
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,750
♫ My heart is at peace when I'm near you ♫

752
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,470
♫ Liking your habits,
remembering small moments ♫

753
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,820
♫ Infecting sorrows with smiles ♫

754
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:13,110
♫ Getting used to what you like,
trying to be brave ♫

755
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,590
♫ Liking becomes natural
and turns into a habit ♫

756
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,280
I'm serious, Aunt.

757
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,960
They were kissing so passionately.

758
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,780
I was stunned.

759
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,520
My pictures

760
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,720
don't show a tenth of the passion.

761
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,940
They don't do it justice.

762
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,320
Yes.

763
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,960
At that moment, it felt as though

764
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,600
the house might've been set on fire.

765
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,880
[The house was on fire?]

766
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,640
No,

767
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,740
it wasn't on fire.

768
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,560
Not literally.

769
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,380
It was only a figure of speech.

770
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,760
[And now?]

771
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,730
[Are they gone?]

772
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,270
Now? I don't know.

773
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,500
[Where are they?]

774
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,240
Well,

775
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,030
they went out right after the kiss.

776
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,020
Who knows where they were off to?

777
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,870
Could they have gone to register
as a couple?

778
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,100
[What?]

779
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,120
Anyway Aunt,

780
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,120
your wish has finally come true.

781
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,310
Congratulations, your grandson
is on the way.

782
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,380
Just you wait. It's going to be awesome.

783
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,110
Are you sure, Lieutenant?

784
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,630
No backing out.

785
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,700
Just make the move.

786
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,430
Check mate!

787
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,060
Take it back.

788
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,150
Are you trying to weasel
your way out?

789
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,290
What's that for?

790
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,040
I'm not.

791
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,040
My hand slipped.

792
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,880
Honestly.

793
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,850
No backsies.

794
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,860
-Xiao Teng.
-"Xiao Xue"?

795
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,390
Xiao Teng.

796
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,030
Tian Yong!

797
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,360
Yes, it's me.

798
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,070
Attention!

799
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,230
Give me the phone.

800
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,180
[Give me the phone!]

801
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,200
Xiao Xue, are you alright?

802
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,990
[I'm fine.]

803
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,430
[I'm just calling to let you know
I'm safely back home.]

804
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,680
That's one day later than
I expected.

805
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,940
Were you waiting for me to call you?

806
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,320
That's right.

807
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,340
What if I didn't call?

808
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,660
I'd keep waiting.

809
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,240
[You idiot.]

810
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,230
Can't you call me?

811
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,160
I can?

812
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,590
Of course you can.

813
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,570
[Xiao Xue.]

814
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,940
What's this about?

815
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,670
I'm taking the initiative.

816
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,300
Are you some kind of dolt?

817
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,750
I'm glad you're okay.

818
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,430
Yes, I'm quite okay.

819
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,760
[Well, then...]

820
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,020
Don't hang up just yet.

821
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,980
Why don't you

822
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,110
recite a poem to me?

823
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:09,240
Okay.

824
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,240
Which one would you like
to hear?

825
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,440
Whatever you like.

826
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,780
It's not like I'd get it anyway.

827
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,710
[A promise for life.]

828
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,060
[A meeting under the bridge.]

829
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,140
[The tide came before the lady.]

830
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,070
[Hugging the pillar, the man died.]

831
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
[This is an excerpt from
Zhuangzi's "The Bandit".]

832
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:26,680
[It means...]

833
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,860
I like you.

834
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,520
Tian Yong!

835
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,020
[I like you! Do you hear me?]

836
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,240
I hear you.

837
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,230
This is so embarrassing.

838
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,060
Lieutenant.

839
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,190
We like you, too!
