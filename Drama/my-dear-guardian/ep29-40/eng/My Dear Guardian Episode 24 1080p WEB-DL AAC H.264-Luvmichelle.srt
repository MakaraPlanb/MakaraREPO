[Episode 24]

4
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,770
A good young man is wooing.

5
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,410
A fair maiden he loves.

6
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,930
Who am I?

7
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,970
Who am I?

8
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,790
Xue.

9
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,640
Fortunately, you didn't bump your head.

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,560
Why are you here?

11
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,600
You're here to visit
Master Le Tian?

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,970
I want to hear you read poetry.

13
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,900
I tried to call you but
couldn't get through.

14
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,620
And I don't have any
other form of contact.

15
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,090
I didn't want to write you a letter

16
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,210
so I could only come here in person.

17
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,329
What do you want to listen?

18
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,680
I'll read it for you.

19
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,370
Actually,

20
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,360
after meeting you,

21
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,930
I find that I don't want
you to read me the poetry.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,930
Then what do you want?

23
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,210
I want to date you.

24
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,930
The... My... Where're my shoes?

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,660
They are here.

26
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,810
Where are my shoes?

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,740
Thank you.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,270
Right.

29
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,530
Where are the others?

30
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,980
They're in training.

31
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,290
They're in training, right?

32
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,570
Where are they training?

33
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,970
I guess they're on the field.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,290
Tian Yong, wait for me!

35
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,970
Why do you do this again?

36
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,840
The suspect had evacuated when the

37
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,400
police and I reached the scene.

38
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,620
The police are
currently searching for him.

39
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,930
Why is your cousin only one here?

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,010
What about Xia Chu?

41
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,070
She couldn't come.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,470
I'll call her hospital.

43
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,050
She is not used to living
in the military camp.

44
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,480
Moreover, she can't leave her work behind.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
What to do?

46
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,570
She's alone out there.

47
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,440
Aren't you worried?

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,570
I asked Rao Zhi to

49
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,970
send someone to look after her.

50
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,650
And she should be
fine as she's staying

51
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,720
in the hospital in these days.

52
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,860
Okay, then.

53
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,990
Right,

54
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,780
have you told Xia Chu about her

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,209
first love visiting the

56
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,250
police station?

57
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,260
No.

58
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,040
I don't want to stress her out.

59
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,750
Don't go so fast.

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,890
I just confessed to you.

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,090
Why are you so
vulnerable to confession?

63
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,730
Just walk slowly, it's not like
I'm going to eat you.

64
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,120

65

66
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,270
Mu Ze, persuade him for me.

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
Persuade him on what?

68
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,040
She wants to persuade me
to get some rest.

69
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,750
No!

70
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,450
Persuade him to date me.

71
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,750
What?

72
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,610
Who are you?

73
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,870
Who am I?

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm the Brigade Commander.

75
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,120
Is his rank higher than yours?

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,270
Don't embarrass yourself, okay?

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,530
Brigade Commander,
help me to persuade him.

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,970
You want me to persuade him to date you?

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,730
What's the reason?

80
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,210
I'm outstanding!

81
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,450
Liang Shao Xue!

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
Let her continue.

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,290
I'm starting to wonder how outstanding

84
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,900
this young lady is.

85
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,890
Say it.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,360
Actually,

87
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,540
about being outstanding,

88
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,290
most of the time,
it's a kind of self-perception.

89
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,450
More like a delusion.

90
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,000
Are you really my brother?

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,270
Tian Yong,

92
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,220
do you like this kind of feeling?

93
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,250
Comrade Liang Shao Xue,

94
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,470
stop messing around.

95
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,590
I'm not messing with you.

96
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,300
I really do like you.

97
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,980
I want to be with you.

98
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,210

99
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,500

Where are you going?

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm going to the Martyrs Cemetery,

104

108
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,240
are the predecessors and
comrades of our army

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,909
Luo Liang.

114
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,190
He was born in 1986.

115
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,340
He's young.

116
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,320
Was he married?

117
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,180
He had a child

118
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,610
that lost his father
before he was born.

119
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,290
Sister-in-law has been

120
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,290
raising him all these years.

She runs a book store.

122
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,350
It's hard for her.

123
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,810
But this is her own choice.

124
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,530
At the moment she chose this man,

125
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,830
she had already prepared for the worst.

126
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,010
Xue,

127
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,170
you don't understand.

128
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,360
I understand.

129
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,290
Are you not trying to tell me that

130
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,200
you have a dangerous job

131
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,180
so that I can give up on you?

132
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,050
Aren't you afraid after
seeing these tombstones?

133
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,409
I'm not afraid.

134
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,050
When I was studying in Paris,

135
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,890
there was a graveyard
beside the neighbourhood.

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,330
People will have a walk there
after having dinner

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,450
and chat with their deceased relatives.

138
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,180
The graveyard at sunset

139
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,210
is the most beautiful moment in a day.

140
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,450
Just like now.

141
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,670
Why me?

142
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,750
Because you worship soldiers?

143
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,410
I hate men in uniforms

144
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,890
before I met you.

145
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,120
They could be someone's son,

146

147

and father.

148
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,640
But after putting on the uniform,

149
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,250
all that is left is the role

150
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,720
behind the uniform.

151
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,550
They didn't look like
themselves anymore.

152
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,490
Then you shouldn't like me.

153
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,450
I have nothing left except

154
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,720
this military uniform.

155
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,200
But you care about my loneliness,

156

happiness and safety.

157
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,080
You care about my vulnerability

158
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,390
that others couldn't see.

159
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,490
That meant more
than everything put together.

Tian Yong,

161
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,250
death can't confine our affection,

162
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,450
it can't scare me either.

163
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,370
Death can't scare you, right?

164
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,610
Right.

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

167
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,250
What about this?

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,260
What do you mean?

169
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
You're back.

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,090
What is this?

171
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,440
You rejected my

172
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,380
little sister?

173
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,410
No.

174
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,230
I just told her

175
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,690
to understand my spiritual world

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,980

Three Hundred Tang Poems

177

before deciding whether
she likes me or not.

178
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,160
You ask her to memorize
Three Hundred Tang Poems?

179
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,540
You ask a classic literature
illiterate who can't tell

180
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,990
Li Bai from Du Fu to

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
memorize Three Hundred Tang Poems.

182
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,300
You're not rejecting her

183
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,530
but humiliating her!

184
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,630
I don't believe that
I'm worse than a parrot!

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,090
Is that your book?

How did she force you?

191
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,560
She didn't force me.

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,110
Just that

193
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,860
something strange would happen

194
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,680
every time I came across
character with radical of female

195
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,870
when I was reading this book recently.

196
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,870
Every radical of female

197
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,240
would turn into her face.

198
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,830
Captain,

199
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,070
if I have no strange disease,

200
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,080
this only shows that

201
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,600
she is fated with the book.

202
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,610
Tian Yong.

203
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,930
Tian Yong.

204
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,080
Captain!

205
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,810
I can't control my feelings.

206
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,330
But I guarantee that

207
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,240
my every thought

208
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,120
begins with affection

209
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,460
and ends with virtue.

210
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,450
It's definitely pure.

211
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,120
Tian Yong.

212
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,180
Tian Yong!

213
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,690
Take care.

214
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,090
Take care?

215
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,290
You can stay here

216
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,170
but we need to have an agreement.

217
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,500
You need to follow the rules.

218
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,540
Like what? What are the rules?

219
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,330
For example,

220
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,380
you must not mess with Tian Yong.

221
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,930
Why?

222
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,600
What why? Sit down!

223
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,780
You're back for vacation, right?

224
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,360
You'll return to the
United States after the vacation.

225
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,760
Is it appropriate to
date Tian Yong at this point?

226
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,130
It will work if he likes me.

227
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,220
And then?

228
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,310
And then we'll be together.

229
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,570
How can you guys be together?

230
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,050
The Pacific Ocean separates you two

231
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,680
and you're 12 hours apart.

232
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,820
Then I can stay in China

233
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,330
or take him back to the United States.

234
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,800
He's on active duty.

235
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,050
What do you mean
back to the United States?

236
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,500
Won't he be discharged?

237
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,890
I can wait for him.

238
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,170
You wait for him?

239
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,130
How many times have you guys met?

240
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,570
Three times.

241
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,740
You just met him three times
and you want to wait for him?

242
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,140
It's normal to have
love at first sight,

243
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,970
why is it abnormal to wait for him
after meeting him three times?

244
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,520
Can you sit down?

245
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,970
Xue, let me tell you.

246
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,960
Tian Yong has been reading that

247
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,690
Three Hundred Tang poems
every day

248
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,660
since I first met him.

249
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,240
I asked him if he'd get tired of it.

250
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,440
He said he could read
this book for his entire life.

251
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,920
Look at you!

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,190
You had no fewer than

253
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,060
50 interest classes since childhood.

254
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,860
How many times have you changed

255
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,170
your major through
your four years of college?

256
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,500
You always act first, think later.

257
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,810
You only have a three-minute
passion for everything.

258
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,250
You said you like Tian Yong.

259
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,680
I think you're just being impulsive.

260
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,900
You even want to wait for him?

261
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't believe that.

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,290
So that's how you see me?

263
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,340
I tell you what.

264
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,660
Lacking self-awareness is

265
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,720
the biggest obstacle in growing up.

266
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,810
I say that applies to you too.

267
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,530
Don't disagree with me.

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,260
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you what.

269
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm being serious with you.

270
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,440
You don't think it's love because
we've only met a few times.

271
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,620
You think the geography and time
difference are the obstacles of love.

272
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,710
You think love

273
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,820
only exists when on the same land.

274
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,050
You're wrong!

275
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,480
I tell you what.

276
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,820
Your biggest mistake is

277
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,690
to foist your cognition on me.

278
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,490
Just like Aunt
foist her cognition on you.

279
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,580
Congratulations, brother!

280
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,980
You eventually
turned into the kind of adult

281
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,650
you used to hate
when you were little.

282
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,890
But it's your business, not mine.

283
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,570
Based on my cognition as a 21-year-old,

284
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,280
love is just love.

285
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,350
Everything else means nothing.

286
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,860
So

287
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,740
Just because

288
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,570
you dare not doesn't mean I don't dare.

289
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,680
Nothing is immutable.

290
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,310
Not love

291
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,320
nor my personality.

292
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,010
As for the variables,

293
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,610
you don't have a say,

294
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,100
neither do I.

295
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,970
But

296
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,920
right now, I want to date him.

297
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,290
Xue,

298
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,970
listen to me.

299
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,170
Tian Yong

300
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,580
is not as happy as he looks
on the surface,

301
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,850
get it?

302
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,880
You are not as strong as you seem.

303
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,240
So you have be more
discreet about this.

304
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,950
You have to reconsider it.

305
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,290
This is very important.

306
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,760
Tian Yong is not someone
you can flirt with.

307
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,070
Right?

308
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,920
It's unacceptable

309
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,250
to me in either side.

310
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,770
What's that sound?
I'm talking to you.

311
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,980
You just envy me!

312
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,200
Why would I envy you?

313
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,600
Of course you'd envy me.

314
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,170
You're envious that me and Tian Yong

315
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,330
are determined to stay together
throughout all eternity.

316
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,850
But your Dr Xia

317
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,180
only puts her heart and soul
in her medical career.

318
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,790
You're no match

319
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,100
to even a pinky finger.

320
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,390
Okay.

321
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,860
If Tian Yong still likes
you after wrapping

322
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,890
his head around that,

323
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,230
I'll read my name backward.

324
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,620
What's wrong with that?

325
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,540
He'll like me.

326
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,700
He should like me.

327
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,940
I'm so cute.

328
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,450
Moreover, we...

329
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340
We...

330
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,880
[Can you stay by her
side for 24 hours a day?]

331
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,470
[When I show up on her side,]

332
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,120
[what can you do for her]

333
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,880
[as you're in the military camp?]

334
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,000
Hello.

335
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,980
[Hello, Uncle Rao.]

336
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,190
Xue came to my unit.

337
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,250
You don't have to worry.

338
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,760
[I know.]

339
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,170
How did you know?

340
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,880
I installed a tracking
program on her phone.

341
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,100
[Really?]

342
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,530
Here's the thing.

343
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,570
[Peng Fei and Xiao Qiang are
guarding at the hospital.]

344
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,490
[Xia Chu is currently fine.]

345
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,670
[You can rest assured.]

346
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,090
[And]

347
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,730
[we found through street surveillance]

348
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,160
[that Long Yi had fled to the border.]

349
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,360
We already informed
the frontier armed police

350
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,450
to cooperate in the manhunt.

351
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,910
But so far,

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,140
we've got nothing.

353
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,880
What about Zhuo Ran?

354
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,200
Is he still at the police station?

355
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,940
No,

356
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,910
he's in the detention centre.

357
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,609
We'll take him to the police station

358
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,910
when we need to talk to him.

359
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,060
[Uncle Rao,]

360
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,420
did he explain

361
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,849
why Long Yi came after Xia Chu?

362
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,670
[He said he didn't know why.]

363
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,130
Do you believe that

364
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,329
he's innocent in T4

365
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,569
criminal chain?

366
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,540
Of course I don't.

367
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,460
This is not my first day as a police.

368
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,210
I've seen many deceptive

369
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,760
criminals with
antisocial personality disorder.

370
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,080
[They will go to any lengths]

371
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,550
[to achieve their objectives.]

372
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,030
[There must be a deeper reason]

373
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,540
[why that man named Old Master]

374
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,770
[went to such lengths for Xia Chu.]

375
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,110
One thing's for certain.

376
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,370
The division within T4

377
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,360
is getting deeper as Zhuo Ran

378
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,390
chose to cooperate with us

379
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,160
[at this point.]

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
[That Old Master
behind this organization]

381
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,870
[must be related to the]

382
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,300
[murders of Sang Kun and Gui.]

383
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,330
We don't care about
Zhuo Ran's intention.

384
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,350
Our intention is to find

385
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,600
the murderer and
establish the truth.

386
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,570
Since he wants to use the police,

387
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,550
in return, we can use him as well.

388
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,660
Okay,

389
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,210
as long as you know what you're doing.

390
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,930
Uncle Rao,

391
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,570
I want to ask for a favour.

392
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,270
Go ahead.

393
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,350
Can you get me a tracker which you

394
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,270
installed for Xue?

395
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
[Outpatient Department]

396
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,750
We should just eat out.

397
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,800
Never mind.

398
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,600
Just eat at the canteen.

399
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,610
There's no much left
in the canteen at this time.

400
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
We shouldn't eat so full at dinner.

401
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,420
People used to say,

402
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,500
it's better to dine like

403
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,690
a pauper.

404
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay, you guys

405
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,900
have been very tense these days.

406
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,380
That's all for me,

407
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,380
you guys can go.

408
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,690
Okay, go ahead.

409
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,620
Okay.

410
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,730
-Yi Chi,
-Yes.

411
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,380
keep the former
leader company for us.

412
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,570
Rest assured.

413
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,340
Okay, then we'll leave first.

414
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,820
Okay.

415
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you.

416
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,360
You've worked hard.

417
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,940
Take care.

418
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,030
Well, sir,

419
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,950
this way, please.

420
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,910
Okay.

421
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,060
You brat.

422
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,490
Enough, let's go.

423
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,770
The resuscitation of this patient with

424
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,550
paraquat poisoning is a valuable case.

425
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,220
You have to summarize the

426
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,380
problems encountered in

427
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,180
the operation and
treatment procedures.

428
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,920
It would be nice to
write them up after that.

429
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,780
I have no time to write papers.

430
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,770
Moreover,

431
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,630
my theoretical level is limited.

432
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,240
That's why I leave it to Xia Chu

433
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,720
and another resident.

434
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,320
Please recommend it

435
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,900
when the paper is completed.

436
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,870
Okay.

437
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,750
Xia Chu is a sweet girl.

438
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,860
You're right.

439
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,820
She is not only pretty

440
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,640
but smart too.

441
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,960
The most important is

442
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,320
her ability.

443
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,550
Do you like her?

444
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,650
Of course I do.

445
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,120
I like a smart and

446
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,960
hardworking resident like her.

447
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,190
I mean outside the professional realm.

448
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,500
Don't make a crazy match.

449
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,880
I just cherish

450
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,370
Xia Chu's talent.

451
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,680
There's no love sentiment.

452
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,180
Mainly,

453
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,780
she is not my cup of tea.

454
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,180
I think you've tried many types

455
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,790
but still haven't found
the one that fits your taste.

456
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,810
Dad,

457
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,420
to be honest with you.

458
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,850
I already found one.

459
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,220
Uncle,

460
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,620
it's been a long time.

461
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,650
Li Juan.

462
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,590
I wouldn't even know you were here

463
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,230
if I didn't run into
Xiao Zhai down the hall.

464
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,590
I happen to bring you lunch.

465
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,660
Okay.

466
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,420
Thank you.

467
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,420
You're welcome.

468
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,220
Thank you.

469
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,210
You're welcome.

470
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,250
Right, Zhang Yi Chi,

471
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,630
what did you say

472
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,140
just now?

473
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,110
Right,

474
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,520
you said...

475
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,050
I already found a suitable partner.

476
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
Really?

477
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,180
You didn't tell me that.

478
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,380
I didn't get a chance.

479
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,330
This is your fault.

480
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,340
You knew that

481
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,570
uncle and aunt are
worried about your marriage.

482
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,080
Why didn't you

483
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,750
notify them as soon as you found one?

484
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,170
We just met.

485
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,490
That's perfect.

486
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,750
You should bring her
to uncle and aunt sooner.

487
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,110
So that you won't have to waste

488
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,200
time and effort like we did before.

489
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,010
Right, uncle?

490
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,490
All experience is a lesson in life.

491
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,920
It won't be wasted.

492
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,350
But

493
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,820
it would be best if I could meet her.

494
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Let's make it on weekend.

495
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,960
My friend is opening a restaurant.

496
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,630
The environment is good,
the food taste delicious.

497
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,260
I'll ask him to reserve a room for you.

498
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,620
We wouldn't want to trouble you.

499
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,460
Not at all.

500
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,050
It's his pleasure to
have you as his guest.

501
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,350
Please help him

502
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,860
to promote his restaurant on

503
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,290
among your friends.

504
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,310
Okay.

505
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,370
His mother and I are okay with that.

506
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,410
But Dr Zhang is busy,

507
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,050
it's all up to him.

508
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,340
Okay.

509
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,640
Then I'll leave you here.

510
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm going to check my
schedule this weekend.

511
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,690
Uncle, I'll go check him.

512
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,270
This brat is already 38 years old,

513
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,490
but still can't act serious.

514
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,620
Zhang Yi Chi, why are you mad?

515
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm helping you.

516
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,360
I have no idea why you

517
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,870
make all this ruckus.

518
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,090
I'm jealous.

519
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,170
I wonder

520
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,300
what kind of woman she is

521
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,090
could make you protect her this well.

522
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,340
Is that funny?

523
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,300
No.

524
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,010
I have to make myself give up on you.

525
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,140
Otherwise, I would be tired to leave

526
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,380
with your bond to me.

527
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,300
Don't act like you love sincerely,

528
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,370
okay?

529
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,630
We've known each other for years.

530
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,990
We know each other well.

531
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,250
What's with your attitude?

532
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,240
Enough.

533
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,180
[Dr Zhang,]

534
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,300
[Liu Ran isn't doing good.]

535
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,690
[Come and check on her!]

536
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,530
Okay, I'll be right over.

537
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,300
Mr Zhang.

538
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,670
How's Liu Ran doing?

539
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,670
Her fever is up to 39.8 degrees and
is severely dehydrated.

540
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,570
Dr Zhang, this is Liu Ran's
blood results three days ago.

541
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,330
Acinetobacter Baumannii.

542
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,490
Based on previous experience
of anti-infective treatment

543
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,600
and some survivors' cases,

544
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,870
I suggest

545
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,170
we use

546
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,210
polymyxin E for treatment.

547
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,050
This is the oldest top antibiotics.

548
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,730
There's no

549
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,360
turning back once we use it.

550
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,210
I know.

551
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,710
Just use it.

552
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,770
Monitor the usage and

553
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,960
the drug reaction.

554
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,270
Use it as soon as possible.

555
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,770
Old Master.

556
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,910
You're not in the office?

557
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,850
[I went out to contact the business.]

558
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,950
No problem with the buyers, right?

559
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,150
We have a deal.

560
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,190
No problem.

561
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,490
I already arranged the delivery guys.

562
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,280
What about the drop spot?

563
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,670
[It's in Black Maplewood.]

564
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,210
[We'll use T4 logo as a mark.]

565
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,560
Tell those villagers that

566
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll wait for their return

567
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,020
with their families.

568
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,100
Yes.

569
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,720
Old Master,

570
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,320
he's here.

571
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,140
Send him in.

572
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,110
Yes.

573
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,790
Captain Rao, we lost him.

574
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,490
[Somewhere in South-East Asia 
Willick, T4's headquarters ]

575
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,450
Many people recommend you to me.

576
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,170
I've seen your profile.

577
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,790
You're good.

578
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,230
Tell me your requirements.

579
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,250
I only want money.

580
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,460
You're straightforward.

581
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,980
I got plenty of money.

582
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,290
The amount you get
depends on your ability.

583
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,060
Deal.

584
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,810
Are you sure Long Yi
is going to that place?

585
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,690
We'd agreed to meet there.

586
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,890
[I have to go help them.]

587
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,080
[Or else Old Master
will get suspicious.]

588
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,660
He already has his guard up

589
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,020
against me.

590
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,690
If I don't show up this time,

591
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,250
he'll quickly assume

592
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,220
I've betrayed him.

593
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,610
He still has my mother.

594
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,100
I'll do whatever you want as long as

595
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,490
you can save my mother.

596
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,680
I'll cooperate fully with the police.

597
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,040
Please believe me.

598
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,740
Chief,

599
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,050
we can't hesitate.

600
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,010
This is the best time

601
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,410
to infiltrate T4.

602
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,430
If we let him leave the country,

603
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,570
we'll lose our

604
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,060
only lead if he doesn't return.

605
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,470
I have a plan to contain him.

606
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,060
Furthermore,

607
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,520
after a few days of observation,

608
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,080
I found that, for whatever reason,

609
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,270
there must be some

610
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,930
conflict between him and old master.

611
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,790
So we are on the same page

612
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,660
regarding Old Master.

613
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,650
Chief,

614
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,170
he is our only way to get in.

615
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay, then.

616
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,380
You send someone to follow him.

617
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,730
I'll ask for instructions
from the superiors.

618
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,450
Inform Interpol for assistance.

619
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,190
Conduct an immediate capture

620
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,380
if things go wrong.

621
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,360
Yes.

622
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,900
[Based on the information]

623
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,770
[provided by the source
and armed police,]

624
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,380
[a group of well-trained
cross-border drug dealers]

625
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,250
[with mercenary-related background,]

626
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,760
[is using the border population
as cover for drug trafficking]

627
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,530
[to bring in major]

628
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,790
[shipment of drugs.]

629
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,370
[This morning,]

630
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,410
[the frontier armed
police has captured]

631
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,530
[a few villagers who carried drugs.]

632
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,550
[But]

633
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,410
[they found no trace of T4.]

634
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,890
[Based on the comprehensive information,]

635
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,460
[T4 should be hiding in the jungle]

636
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,620
[near boundary pillar number 17,]

637
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,810
[waiting for opportunities.]

638
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,780
[The superiors order us
to dispatch Team Thunder to]

639
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,130
[assist in searching and
catching the criminals.]

640
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,610
[Take action now!]

641
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,190
Are you sure

642
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,780
it's safe?

643
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,580
Safe?

644
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,730
In this world,

645
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,110
there's no such thing.

646
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,670
This is the Chinese
People's Liberation Army.

647
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,980
You have illegally entered
the territory of China.

648
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,480
Put your weapons down
and prepare to be inspected.

649
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,410
Open fire!

650
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,300
Go, go, go!

651
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,490
We've been exposed!

652
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,300
Repeat, we've been exposed!
Team B, evacuate!

653
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,240
Be careful! They have snipers!

654
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,310
The target is

655
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,530
at ten o'clock.

656
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,320
He's out of effective range.

657
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,210
Covering fire,
I'll take the guy down!

658
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,210
What are you doing?

659
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,320
Who will lead if you're dead?

660
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,290
It's fine.

661
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,670
I'll go.

662
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,090
I'll go.

663
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,140
Cover me.

664
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,180
All units,

665
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,090
lay down suppressing
fire at ten o'clock!

666
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,409
Follow me!

667
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,310
Songpaisarn!

668
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,780
Medic! Medic!

669
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,890
I need a medic!

670
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,130
Songpaisarn!

671
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,910
Songpaisarn!

672
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,390
Hands up!

673
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,180
It's a bomb!

674
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,950
Is everyone all right?

675
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,950
I'm fine!

676
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,130
I'm fine!

677
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,650
Tian Yong, control the villagers!

678
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,690
-Keep searching!
-Yes!

679
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,200
Turn around!

680
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,740
What are you doing?

681
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,330
Why did you run?

682
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,710
I...

683
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,740
Are you Long Yi?

684
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,930
It's me, why?

685
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,080
Take him!

686
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,030
No.

687
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,500
I...

688
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,940
What did I do?

689
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,190
What's going on?

690
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,910
Someone shot at me just now.

691
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,200
I chased him down here.

692
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,470
But seems like it wasn't him.

693
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,580
We found this in the jungle.

694
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,760
3D printed mask?

695
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,020
Captain Liang,

696
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,210
thank you.

697
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,910
Just leave the rest to us.

698
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,260
Thank you.

699
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,170
Let's go.

700
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,690
[Long Yi is arrested.]

701
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,790
[I understand.]

702
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,420
[I'm going to Old Master now.]

703
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,650
[Keep in touch.]

704
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,250
[Somewhere in South-East Asia 
Willick, T4's headquarters ]

705
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,700
[Based on the latest information
our reporter received,]

706
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,070
[our national army had recently
conducted a joint operation]

707
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,690
[and took down a group
of armed drug dealers]

708
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,780
[who entered our country
illegally at the border.]

709
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,930
[They confiscated a large quantity
of firearms and drugs.]

710
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,280
When I reached the jungle
near Black Maplewood,

711
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
I found that our people
and goods were gone.

712
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,890
What about Long Yi?

713
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,850
I haven't heard from him.

714
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,410
I'm thinking

715
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,570
if his disappearance

716
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,850
is related to what happened today.

717
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,320
Whether it's related or not,

718
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
China's military police
have to pay for the price

719
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,690
as they touched my goods.

720
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,760
It's a shame that we
lost him in Willick.

721
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,340
He's again the leader.

722
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,280
We must find a way to mess with him.

723
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,560
Instead of messing with him,

724
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,110
let's go after those around him.

725
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,580
He has a sister.

726
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,010
That Xia...

727
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,090
What is the doctor's name?

728
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,400
Xia Chu.

729
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,210
Is she still staying with him?

730
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,180
Yes.

731
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,560
Get her.

732
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,950
Old Master.

733
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,710
Xia Guang Yuan adores his daughter.

734
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,910
Isn't that perfect?

735
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,250
We can punish Liang Mu Ze

736
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,310
and crush Xia Guang Yuan
into submission

737
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,290
by kidnapping Xia Chu.

738
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,400
It's not hard to do this job
with the effort you've put into

739
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,920
the father and daughter, right?

740
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,270
It's not hard.

741
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,520
Do you recognise this?

742
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,360
3D printed mask.

743
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,010
If I'm not wrong,

744
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,540
your company

745
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,640
[provides 3D printing service.]

746
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,580
[You should be]

747
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,630
[familiar with its function.]

748
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,210
This mask was

749
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,530
thrown at the river beach

750
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,570
near Black Maplewood.

751
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,530
And you happened to
appear at that place.

752
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,710
[What were you doing there?]

753
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,270
[Did you throw away this mask?]

754
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,770
On the afternoon on 23rd of January,

755
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,740
it was you again

756
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,540
who appeared at the underground
garage of Jianqiaolan Bay

757
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,090
[and followed]

758
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,540
[a female named Xia Chu]

759
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,860
to the building

760
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,080
and intended to kidnap her.

761
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,540
Where were you and what were

762
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,510
you doing on

763
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,200
the night of Jan 2?

764
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,350
Don't think that you'll
be fine just because

765
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,460
you say nothing.

766
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,200
I tell you what.

767
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,550
We can still sentence you

768
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,980
without a statement.

769
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,430
I want to see my lawyer.

770
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,620
Rao Zhi.

771
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,600
We'll talk about it after getting the
report from the laboratory.

772
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,130
I understand.

773
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,080
We used every antibiotics we had.

774
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,390
The Acinetobacter Baumannii
in the patient's body

775
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,370
has become
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

776
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,120
It's hard to redress the septic shock

777
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,650
that it causes.

778
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,160
It's meaningless to

779
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,590
keep reviving her.

780
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,000
Is her family here?

781
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,270
Not yet.

782
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,780
Xia Chu!

783
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,940
Where are you going?

784
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,100
I have to search

785
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,860
the prior cases.

786
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,430
Perhaps there're other ways.

787
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,610
Calm down.

788
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,820
Sir, I want to give it a try.

789
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,260
You are a professional doctor.

790
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,290
How can you be this irrational?

791
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,660
I want to try again.

792
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,020
There's got to be another way.

793
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,060
It's impossible,
there's got to be another way.

794
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,950
Xia Chu!

795
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,790
Mr Zhang!

796
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:08,730
-Enough!
-Dr Xia.

797
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,170
Liu Ran is calling for you.

798
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,430
Liu Ran,

799
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,810
I'm here.

800
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,380
Don't be afraid.

801
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,290
We just got news from the police.

802
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,740
The criminal has been arrested.

803
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,480
You're amazing.

804
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,250
You're doing great.

805
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,660
Hang in there.

806
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,960
Fight.

807
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,400
Fight.

808
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,610
Thank... you.

809
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,690
There's a letter I wrote

810
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,730
for you under the pillow.

811
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,410
Make sure to read it.

812
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,880
Okay, I'll read it for sure.

813
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:15,730
Liu Ran.

814
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,260
Hold still.

815
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,230
You'll be fine.

816
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,820
Hang in there.

817
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,690
Sister...

818
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,870
Thank you.

819
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,300
Thank you.

820
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,530
I'll go inform her family.

821
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,300
Have you reached them?

822
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,820
No one answered.

823
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,200
Then just send him a message.

824
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,860
Tell him that Liu Ran
has passed away.

825
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,620
He'll call us back.

826
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,720
Why is that?

827
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,310
The operation went well

828
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,650
and every index was normal.

829
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:22,770
What's with the sudden...

830
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,290
Don't forget about the dinner appointment.

831
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,160
My friend has reserved a room for you.

832
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:28,700
Can you not talk about

833
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,620
the appointment at this time?

834
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,740
What's with this time?

835
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,980
My patient passed away.

836
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,010
Zhang Yi Chi.

837
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,330
This is not your first day as a doctor.

838
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,560
From the moment you
took over this patient,

839
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,730
you should've visualized the worst result.

840
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,240
The relationship between you and her

841
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,600
should be limited
at this consulting room,

842
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,920
operation room and the ward,

843
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,120
these three dimensions.

844
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,410
After you leave these dimensions,

845
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,730
you should have your life,

846
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,410
your friends and family.

847
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,470
Your emotions shouldn't

848
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,620
be affected by a patient.

849
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,530
If you were to be affected by

850
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,400
every death of your patient,

851
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,650
you would soon be knocked over.

852
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,210
Enough.

853
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,370
I'm here to remind you

854
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,660
not to forget about
the serious matter.
