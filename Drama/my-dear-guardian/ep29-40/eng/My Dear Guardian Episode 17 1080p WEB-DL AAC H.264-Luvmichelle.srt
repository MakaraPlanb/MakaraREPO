[Episode 17]

4
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,190
So long as I'm in my uniform,

5
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,710
I must adhere to my
professional values.

6
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,630
This is my principle.

7
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,789
So

8
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,030
you've never had any regrets?

9
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,110
Never.

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,670
That's one thing we have in common.

11
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,750
And insomnia.

12
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,750
I recovered a long time ago.

13
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,940
Really?

14
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,910
Of course.

15
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,390
How did you recover?

16
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,460
There are 24 hours a day.

17
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,060
I've been working and
studying for 20 hours.

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,110
The remaining three to four hours
is my nap time.

19
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,110
I naturally recovered.

20
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,100
Why do you set yourself a rule

21
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,670
not to date a special forces soldier?

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,630
Why do you keep
asking me this question?

23
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,670
Because you've never answered me.

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,630
I want to know

25
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,710
whether your insomnia

26
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,150
is cured

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,910
or just temporarily suppressed.

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,380
What does it have to do with you?

29
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,710
Until yesterday, maybe nothing.

30
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,790
What about now?

31
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,870
What about now?

32
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,350
Liang Mu Ze.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,030
Dr Xia!

34
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,430
I can't sleep as the
rain is pouring.

35
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,540
Why don't you go and take a rest first?

36
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,670
I'll be here with the captain.

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,140
You don't have to be sorry.

38
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,620
Go and take a rest. It's okay.

39
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,710
Go.

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,940
Thank you!

41
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,980
Keep off the rain!

42
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,550
Don't move! Seize him!

43
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,710
Don't move!

44
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,950
Sit tight! Don't move!

45
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,590
-Don't touch me.
-Hang in there!

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,630
Don't touch me.

47
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,390
Don't move!

48
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,340
What's wrong?

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,180
He wanted to extubate
when he woke up! Don't move!

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,020
Don't be afraid.

51
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,950
This is a closed thoracic drainage.

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,230
Don't touch me!

53
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,270
-Calm down!
-Don't touch me!

54
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,470
It won't do! Press him down!

55
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,830
-Let me go!
-Don't move!

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,670
Hold his legs steady! Good!

57
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,670
Let me go!

58
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,620
-Let me go!
-Hurry up!

59
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,830
Let's transport him

60
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,230
while he's sedated.

61
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,430
Yes!

62
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,830
[Only one trapped victim
was discovered?]

63
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,950
This man's injury is a bit strange.

64
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,710
He claimed that he
was kidnapped to the island.

65
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,500
But the response situation

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,420
was critical,

67
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,470
we have no time to
conduct a full search

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,660
so the police have to follow up the

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,030
following specific situation.

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,230
Okay, we'll meet
you at the hospital.

71
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,390
Okay.

72
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,470
Easy!

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,790
Slow down!

74
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,670
Dr Zhang.

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,060
We just finished up.

76
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,070
Brigade Commander said
you were trapped overnight

77
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,270
and have just escaped.

78
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,740
I'm fine, sir.

79
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,550
You performed a
closed thorax drainage for him.

80
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,030
He had a hemothorax.

81
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,630
His situation was bad
when we found him.

82
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,830
So I can only perform it on the spot.

83
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,030
Seems like you really
are the best doctor

84
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,150
under field conditions in our hospital.

85
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,620
Here, give a hand!

86
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,820
The patient needs further inspection.

87
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,990
Okay.

88
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,909
Wait.

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,990
What's wrong?

90
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,190
During the last medical forum,

91
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,070
the man who escaped with
a broken leg after the fall

92
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,470
was him.

93
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,460
Are you sure?

94
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,430
I'm sure.

95
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,430
Sir,

96
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,860
there's a problem
with the data set

97
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,580
that I sent to your email.

98
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,710
I already resent it.

99
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,670
Please check your email.

100
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,909
Okay.

101
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,270
What data is it?

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,870
It's the clinical trial data set.

103
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,430
Didn't you ask me to send it to you?

104
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,460
Coming.

105
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,750
Coming, Xia.

106
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,870
Change your shoes!

107
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,230
Didn't you see I'm mopping the floor?

108
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,260
Why do you do this every time?

109
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,380
Can't you appreciate

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,630
my hard work, Xia?

111
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,140
You haven't been home for three days.

112
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,750
And you're like a bandit entering the
village once you reach home.

113
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,260
Listen,

114
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm not letting you in next time.

115
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,510
You'll live on the streets.

116
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,470
Do you hear me?

117
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm doomed.

118
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,670
Mi Gu?

119
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,140
[I'm off to edit the clips.]

120
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,270
[I might work all night.]

121
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,150
[I left you some breakfast
in the microwave.]

[when you leave]

124
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,660
[because it's the only one key.]

125
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,820
[I need you to send it to me.]

126
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,790
[Mi Gu.]

127
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,070
[Gui was wounded.]

128
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,550
He was sent to the hospital
for rescue treatment.

129

[Emergency Department]

130
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,790
Cardiac Surgery, Ward 13.

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,150
The doctor in charge is Xia Chu.

132
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,710
You take the 3D projection equipment

133
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,110
and come to Mi Gu's house.

134
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,990
Then meet me at the hospital.

Rao Zhi.

136
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,350
Where is he?

137
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,310
He is sent to the ward.

138
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,390
This is a sample of blood
collected from his body.

139
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,390
Send it to the technical team
for examination immediately.

140
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,430
Yes.

141
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,190
Is there anything else on him?

142
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,430
Nothing for the time being.

143
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,030

Officer Rao.

145
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,430
How is he?

146
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,110
His health is very frail now,
he needs to rest.

147
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,860
Can I take him back?

148
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,830
Now?

149
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,190
I'm afraid you can't.

150
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,900
Here's the thing.

151
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,510
A fisherman filed a
report yesterday.

152
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,540
Saying that the fishing boat
he had moored

153
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,190
at Xiangsheng Shipyard
for repair was stolen.

154
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,180
It's similar to

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,470
the boat we found on the island.

156
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,590
I wish to take him back

157
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,830
to cooperate with the investigation.

158
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,030
Since we can't take him back,

159
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,070
can I ask him a few questions right now?

160
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,390
Wait a little longer.

161
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,830
He is in a coma now.

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,030
I'm afraid he can't
answer your questions.

163
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,150
Dr Xia.

164
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,950
Listen to the doctor.

165
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,590
Thanks for understanding.

166
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,110
You and Xiao Qiang stay here.

167
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,910
Inform me immediately if he's awake.

168
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,950
Yes!

169
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,470
You've worked hard, Mu Ze.

170
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,870
It's my job, Rao Zhi.

171
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,780
We'll head back to the camp

172
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,150
if there's nothing else.

173
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,230
Okay.

174
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,830
We're going to the island.

-Let's go together.
-Okay.

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,550
Okay, I'll be right there!

177
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,830
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

178
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,470
Get going, I'm fine.

179
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,110
I'll be right there!

180
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,030
Why do you help?

181
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,670
This is the time for
our captain to show himself.

182
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,310
What's your involvement there?

183
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,150
Don't you think you're an extra?

184
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,670
Thank you.

185
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,070
Why aren't you leaving?

186
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,550
I'm about to leave.

187
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,510
Right, the...

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,460
About the patient, I tell you...

189
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,430
No matter what,
I have to get him cured.

190
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,390
Only then he can promptly cooperate
with the police investigation.

I believe in your
professional judgement.

What I mean is,

193
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,350
that patient is suspicious.

194
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,990
So be wary when you treat him,

195
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,150
understand?

196
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,030
I understand.

197
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,430
I'll leave first.

Cherry paste.

You made it?

204

I was so busy in the last few days.

205

I've wanted to give it to you.

You only bought a few cherries.

210
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,180
They were only enough for one jar.

211
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,110
It's been nice to make a jar for you.

ask me this question?

Do you?

I do.

Go on in.

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,510
You invited Xia Chu
but you didn't invite me.

376
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,780
Of course.

377
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,220
A party for the elders like this,

378
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,550
I wouldn't come too if you asked me.

379
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,630
But you didn't ask me a thing.

380
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,150
I'm sad about it too.

381
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,830
Liang Mu Ze.

382
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,900
Xue, it was remiss of
me not to invite you.

383
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,300
But I didn't invite Xia Chu.

384
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,670
She was here to work.

385
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,670
No one loves me anyway.

386
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,820
No one likes me anyway!

387
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,790
Everyone hates me!

388
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,990
-Report!
-Come in!

389
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,910
OK!

390
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,750
How's your hand?

391
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,030
It's fine.

392
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,630
Really, it's fine.

393
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,030
So this is your parrot.

394
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,660
Right, the one I adopted.

395
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,350
I told you that, you forgot it again?

396
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,430
That animal assisted therapist?

397
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,550
Yes.

398
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,910
Are you sure?

399
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,550
I just got a call from
the Forestry Bureau.

400
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,780
They contacted an animal

401
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,990
adoption agency in Ningjiang.

402
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,910
The headquarters of this agency
is based in the United States.

403
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,740
They cooperate with
the University Hospital

404
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,070
through some charities

405
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,100
to provide specialized
animal escort service

406
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,940
for the needy.

407
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,340
Right, I applied to adopt it.

408
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,670
My healing partner.

409
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,830
Are the procedures of
the agency complete?

410
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,110
They are complete.

411
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,420
I've checked with the
Forestry Bureau

412
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,390
and the Forest Police.

413
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,830
I contacted the head
of the agency as well.

414
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,790
The information they gave matched.

415
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,150
They gave me permission

416
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,550
to hand this parrot over to her.

417
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,870
Okay, then.

418
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,990
The wise ancestors are long gone,
there is no future emperor in sight.

419
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,350
Across the vast land I sing this song,
weeping alone for my sad plight.

420
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,750
What did it say?

421
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,270
This is a poem

422
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,700
by Tang Dynasty poet,
Chen Zi Ang. "Song..."

423
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,180
-"Song of the Youzhou Exile."
-Right.

424
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,580
You knew it too!

425
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,950
Did you guys teach it?

426
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,430
He taught it.

427
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,540
What is this?

428
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,750
This is not my bird!

429
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,910
Report!

430
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,030
Captain, I'll leave first
if there's nothing else.

431
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,750
Come back!

432
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,380
Keep an eye on her.
I'll go look for the Brigade Commander.

433
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,630
-Captain!
-This is an order!

434
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,230
I hate you guys!

435
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,310
You want to take a leave?

436
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,220
Yes.

437
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,190
What's wrong?

438
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,580
My cousin is here.

439
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,590
I need to send her back.

440
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,950
How old is she?

441
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,230
Is she mobility-impaired?

442
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,180
Why must you send her?

443
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,870
Let me tell you, Liang Mu Ze.

444
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,470
The camp is not your house!

445
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,950
You come and go as you wish
all day long.

446
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,150
Are you a citizen or a soldier?

447
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,620
Right.

448
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,910
Was it your cousin
who fought the sentry

449
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,110
at Gate One?

450
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,190
Yes.

451
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,420
She knows nothing.

452
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,470
I already lectured her.

453
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,470
I can understand

454
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,540
that she knows nothing.

455
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,180
But you, as a military officer,

456
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,430
should know the confidentiality and
safety regulations of the brigade.

457
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,550
Can people who returned from overseas

458
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,590
like them casually enter the barracks?

459
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,630
Where is she now?

460
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,350
She is at my place.
Tian Yong is keeping an eye on her.

461
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,350
Isn't Tian Yong supposed be on duty?

462
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,790
Is he a bodyguard?

463
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,220
Tian Yong is off duty.

464
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,270
It won't do either!

465
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,190
-Quickly send her back!
-Yes!

466
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,150
Ridiculous!

467
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,230
Are you done?

468
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,310
You did all the good things.

469
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,620
My brother would have told me off

470
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,030
if I didn't distract him by crying.

471
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,190
Does your hand still hurt?

472
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,470
It's fine.

473
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,910
Really? Then I'll bite it again.

474
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,190
That won't be necessary.

475
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,470
I'm just kidding.
Why are you so nervous?

476
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,510
You're boring.

477
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,470
Why did you adopt a parrot?

478
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,270
It's none of your business.

479
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,700
If you're sick, I think you...

480
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,510
It's you who are sick
and your family too!

481
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,740
Sorry, I...

482
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,670
I didn't mean it.

483
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,310
I just want to express my concern.

484
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,430
I don't need your concern.
I have no shortage of love.

485
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,390
Then why did you adopt this parrot?

486
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,620
Are you done?

487
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,870
You're nagging like the Longevity Monk!

488
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,740
You can't say that.

489
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,270
The Longevity Monk is
a monk and I'm a soldier.

490
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,910
You haven't taken your parrot.

491
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,550
I don't want it, you can have it!

492
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,990
Didn't you come here for it?

493
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,510
The OK I'm looking for is

494
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,980
a parrot that can talk smack with me.

495
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,350
It's obvious that this is not the one.

496
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,990
Cursing is not chatting.

497
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,020
-Why do you care?
-I don't.

498
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,060
I'm just reminding you

499
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,460
that cursing is not chatting.

500
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,350
Are you done? You're so annoying!

501
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,910
You can't leave until
your brother comes back.

502
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,110
Okay, I won't leave.

503
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,070
Who will talk with you?

504
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,590
What?

505
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,670
I'm thinking

506
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,310
who will talk with you

507
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,390
if you leave it here?

508
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,390
Won't you feel lonely?

509
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,270
The...

510
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,390
What...

511
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,590
Thank you.

512
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,630
What do you mean?

513
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,230
Thank you

514
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,390
for asking me such a question.

515
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,500
The clinical laboratory has confirmed

516
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,550
that the victim who was hospitalized
was the fugitive, Gui.

517
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,710
He was involved in a
drug-trafficking case.

518
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,950
The whereabouts of the drugs
had yet to be found.

519
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,950
Team 1 is going to
the hospital to back Li Lei up.

520
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,670
Li Lei, Xiao Qiang,

521
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,820
keep an eye on the suspect.
Take a look over there.

522
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,750
Sun Xiao Mo, take Team 2 and
search the island with me.

523
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,990
Everyone, stay safe.

524
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,150
Do not miss any clues.

525
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,110
The family of patient in bed number 16.

526
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,310
They are not here. We're in charge.

527
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,350
Take this receipt

528
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,500
and go to the
radiology department downstairs to

529
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,030
make an appointment for the patient's
afternoon X-ray examination.

530
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,030
It's invalid.

531
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,190
Invalid?

532
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,300
It can't be found in the system.

533
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,470
We can't make an appointment for you.

534
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,870
Come back after you ask the doctor.

535
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,310
Thank you.

536
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,860
Xiao Qiang! Xiao Qiang! Wake up!

537
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,270
Xiao Qiang!

538
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,510
Where is he?

539
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,150
Doctor.

540
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,030
It's the doctor.

541
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,790
Xiao Xiao, what's wrong?

542
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,070
[Xia Chu, the patient
in bed number 13 is missing.]

543
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,140
What?

544
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,340
How is Xiao Qiang?
Is he all right?

545
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,790
Have the backup reached?

546
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,470
I got it.

547
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,150
Immediately notify the
Traffic Control Center

548
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,470
to block the roads out of the town.

549
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,620
You guys stay put

550
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,630
and wait for our further information.

551
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,470
Okay.

552
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,310
Something happened in the hospital.

553
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,470
The suspect was kidnapped.

554
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,430
Who did that?

555
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,110
It's not known.

556
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,830
He was taken away alive.

557
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,550
It's mostly about the drugs.

558
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,270
Seems like

559
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,590
the drugs we confiscated last time
during the medical forum

560
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,630
was only a part of it.

561
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,710
We can find the person
if we find the supply.

562
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,380
So far,

563
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,470
nothing has been found.

564
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,110
Where did they hide the drugs?

565
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,580
Where's the boat?

566
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,750
It's been sent to
Xiangsheng Shipyard for repair.

567
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,740
Notify Li Lei and the others

568
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,110
to meet us at Xiangsheng Shipyard.

569
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,150
Yes.

570
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,030
Who is he? Do you recognize him?

571
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,750
The patient's drainage tube
wasn't extubated yet.

572
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,590
Right.

573
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,100
Where were they going?

574
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,230
He didn't even want his life.

575
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,580
[What's wrong?]

576
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,670
[He wanted to extubate when he
woke up. Don't move!]

577
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,870
Do you think the police can find him?

578
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,380
Will they hold us

579
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,790
accountable if they can't find him?

580
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,150
-Where are you going?
-Look for the patient.

581
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,870
Is Tian Yong married?

582
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,670
Does he have children?

583
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,830
What does he like to do?

584
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,670
What is his zodiac?
What is his blood type?

585
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,190
Does he snore when he sleeps
or smack his lips when he eats?

586
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,710
Two things.

587
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,590
Liang Shao Xue might be heading
to your camp.

588
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,790
I know that, I'm sending her back.

589
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,390
And about the fishing boat last night.

590
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,350
Did the officer in charge say

591
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,510
it'll be sent back to the shipyard?

592
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,260
Yes.

593
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,910
Do you still remember
the name of the shipyard?

594
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
Why do you ask this?

595
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,590
Hurry up and tell me.

596
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,100
Xiangsheng Shipyard.

597
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,150
[Why? Do you want to go there?]

598
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,350
Xiangsheng Shipyard?

599
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,110
Driver, to Xiangsheng Shipyard.

600
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,790
Why do you want to go there?

601
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,260
Brother, I'm asking you
about Tian Yong's birthday.

602
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,950
Quickly tell me.

603
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,350
This is not the way back home.

604
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,510
Where is the thing?

605
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,670
The thing

606
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,390
was discovered by the police.

607
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,310
It was confiscated.

608
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,820
Where is it?

609
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,470
It's in the secret compartment...

610
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,909
Don't kill me. Listen to me.

611
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,750
I found a channel.
I have another investor.

612
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,429
[Beware of falling objects]

613
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,620
Watch your step.

614
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,670
Slow down.

615
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,179
Officer,

616
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,060
I found the gauze

617
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,630
covered with blood over here.

618
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,790
Xiao Mo, Lei Zi,

619
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,070
take everyone to search everywhere.

620
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,630
Yes, let's go.

621
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,310
Let's sell it and make money together.

622
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,310
It's better than following Old Master.

623
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,110
Don't you want to
get rid of Old Master?

624
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,630
Zhuo Ran, I know that

625
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,870
you let me go on purpose at the hotel.

626
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,470
You want to join forces with me and

627
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,750
take down Old Master, right?

628
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,740
How is it?

629
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,710
Not found.

630
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,550
Chief,

631
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,910
try to think.

632
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,940
Is there any

633
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,270
secluded spot in your shipyard?

634
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,710
Anyway, I found these gauzes over here.

635
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,100
Other places...

636
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,900
Right.

637
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,830
Did you check the watertight
compartment of the boat?

638
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,820
Watertight compartment?

639
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,390
Usually, a bulk carrier

640
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,110
has double-layered bilge and walls.

641
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,390
The space between the two layers

642
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,350
serves as a watertight compartment,

643
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,270
a food storage, and a fuel storage

644
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,990
while maintaining the stability
and buoyancy of the ship.

645
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,620
But this watertight compartment

646
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,710
can be easily changed
into a secret compartment.

647
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,350
Those unlawful boatmen

648
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,180
will hide the seabirds

649
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,870
they captured on the island

650
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,940
and some smuggled goods in it.

651
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,780
Where is the boat?

652
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,460
Boat?

653
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,150
The boat is at the
new shipyard over there.

654
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,220
Let's go to the new shipyard.

655
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,110
Let's go. I'll take you there.

656
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,430
It's about a mile away.

657
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,670
What I said was true.

658
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,350
Zhuo Ran,

659
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,670
I can cooperate with you.

660
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,590
Please trust me.

661
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,350
Don't kill me.

662
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,110
Sang Kun didn't believe that

663
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,750
the one who wanted him dead

664
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,670
was his own brother.

665
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,790
For that alone,

666
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,590
you shall die.

667
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,420
No!

668
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,430
You can't kill me...

669
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,550
Zhuo Ran.

670
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,590
Old Master

671
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,630
has never wanted to
cure your mother's illness.

672
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,510
He has been

673
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,350
using your mother to control you.

674
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,190
And...

675
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,820
And

676
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,270
do you know how your father died?

677
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,830
I know.

678
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,070
Old Master told my brother.

679
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,510
I know

680
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,710
it was my fault to set my brother up.

681
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,070
I deserve to die.

682
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,510
But what about you?

683
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,230
Aren't you the same as me?

684
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,750
You're a betrayer too.

685
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,110
Do you want to know the truth?

686
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,550
Do you?

687
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,030
Tell me, do you?

688
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,270
Let me go.

689
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,790
Then I'll tell you how
your father died.

690
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,750
Do you want to know the truth?

691
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,590
How did your father die?

692
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,790
This is an order from Old Master.

693
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,180
We need to evacuate now.

694
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,830
The thumb.

695
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,030
It sounds like a gunshot just now.

696
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,140
Follow me!

697
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,860
Break it up! Be safe!

698
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,510
Rao Zhi!

699
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,590
How is it?

700
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,590
Just finished asking.

701
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,750
You go ahead.

702
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,270
You said you were here

703
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,790
to look for your patient?

704
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,630
Yes.

705
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,110
How did you know he
was going to come here?

706
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,100
I remember

707
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,700
his reaction

708
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,900
when I was reviving him.

709
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,070
I guess he will be here.

710
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,460
Can you tell me

711
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,950
what his reaction was?

712
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,630
He refused to leave after he woke up.

713
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,150
His eyes fixed in the direction
of the secret compartment

714
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,390
and he wanted to
reach out his hand to it.

715
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,380
I guess it must be
something important to him

716
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,990
hiding in there.

717
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,510
So he'll definitely return
and look for it.

718
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,460
How is it?

719
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,430
What's the situation on
the secret compartment?

720
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,540
We managed to open it

721
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,830
but nothing was found inside.

722
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,750
Someone might have transferred
its contents.

723
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,550
Rao Zhi.

724
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,780
There were no signs of struggle

725
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,910
at the scene or on the body itself.

726
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,030
Our preliminary findings

727
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,260
suggests that is it possible

728
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,750
that he caused his own death.

729
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,350
But he was seriously injured.

730
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,340
It was impossible

731
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,990
for him to come here
alone from the hospital.

732
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,910
So, further evidence
collection is needed to

733
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,670
confirm whether it was suicidal.

734
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,300
This is the evidence bag.

735
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,990
This gun is made of plastic.

736
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,550
A plastic gun?

737
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,590
It was 3D printed, right?

738
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,030
Why are you here?

739
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,940
Xue went to the camp
to find me.

740
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,780
I was sending her home

741
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,990
and decided to drop by.

742
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,190
Mu Ze,

743
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,310
you said this is a...

744
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,950
3D printed gun.

745
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,070
3D printed gun?

746
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,540
Have you seen it before?

747
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,030
Didn't my medicine get changed

748
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,260
to the 3D printed one?

749
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,150
So I did lots of research and

750
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,350
read many materials about
3D printing technology.

751
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,150
Like this kind of gun,

752
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,990
it can only be made by 3D printing.

753
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,070
So I suspect...

754
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,030
Liang Mu Ze,

755
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,870
I don't want to hear it now.

756
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,990
I want to leave for a while.

757
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,030
I need to be alone, can I?

758
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,990
Where do you go?
I'll give you a ride.

759
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,310
Never mind.

760
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,230
-Then I'll leave with Xue.
-I don't want to leave.

761
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,390
What do you want?
Uncle Rao is busy.

762
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,910
What are you doing?

763
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,580
Just do his job.

764
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,230
I'm not here to watch him work.

765
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,630
Xue,

766
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,030
it's getting late.

767
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,510
Go back with your brother.

768
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,470
I don't want to!
I want to stay here!

769
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,950
Don't try to get rid of me!

770
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,550
[Liang Mu Ze]

771
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,310
[Our preliminary findings]

772
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,540
[suggests that it is possible]

773
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,110
[that he caused his own death.]

774
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,470
[The first thing you do ]

775
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,270
[when you're in danger is run, get it?]

776
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,300
Liang Mu Ze!

777
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,190
Liang Mu Ze!

778
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,700
Xia Chu!

779
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,260
Let me go! Don't come near me!

780
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,230
It's me!

781
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:46,910
Are you hurt?

782
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,710
I'm here, don't be afraid.

783
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,630
Don't be afraid. It's fine.

784
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,100
I'm here, don't be afraid.

785
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,870
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

786
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,510
It's fine. There, there.
