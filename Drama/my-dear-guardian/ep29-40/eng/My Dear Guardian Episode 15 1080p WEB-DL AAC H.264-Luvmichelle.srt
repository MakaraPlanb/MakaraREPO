-Hi.

Zhang Yi Chi.

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,520
It's durian cheese roll.
I bought it from Joy Bakery.

7
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,100
Try it and see
if the taste is still the same.

8
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,160
Thanks for helping out the foundation.

9
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,820
When the application is approved,
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

11
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,470
Dr Zhang, please take a seat.

12
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,940
Which one do you think

13
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,900
is tastier?

14
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,940
Let me try it.

15
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,520
No need.

16
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,980
Just take a guess.

17
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,140
Judging from the look,

18
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,320
durian cheese roll

19
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,940
is more appetising.

20
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,250
However, no doubt
the combination of durian and cheese

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,890
is going to take your breath away
at the first bite.

22
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,330
However, after some time,

23
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,300
you'll get bored of the taste.

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,660
Steamed cake is different.

25
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,930
No doubt it is not delicate,

26
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,260
but it has a light taste

27
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,400
and the chewiness is on point.

28
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,660
Many restaurants serve it
as a main course.

29
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,530
Hence,

30
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,200
in comparison to durian cheese roll,

31
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,180
steamed cake is more practical.

32
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,380
The chewiness is on point?

33
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,140
It has

34
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,900
a light taste.

35
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,820
Well said.

36
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,380
Dr Zhang.

37
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,440
The steamed cake and durian cheese roll

38
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,400
is not a matter of life and death.

39
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,920
Why do you get into a dilemma?

40
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm not in a dilemma.

41
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,170
By the way,

45

Sure, Dr Zhang.

46
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,680
Give him some liquid and IV fluids.

47
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,680

48
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,520

50

Okay.

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,180
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

52
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,240
The pen belongs to me.

53
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,020
It's the last pen I have.

54

It looks like you're a practical person.

58

59

It's too sweet and I'm bored of it.

I find that I prefer

62
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,220

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,880
The torch is everything.

186
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,040
The rest is nothing!

187
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,870
The battle is to the strong!

188
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,780
The battle is to the strong!

189
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,340
Stop him!

190
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,020
Grab it!

191
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,920
It's Gopher! Throw it to the back!

192
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,860
Pull away! They're not good
at throwing grenades!

193
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,660
No!

194
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,150
The winner is China!

195
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,340
Salute!

196
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,960
Dr Zhang.

197
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,000
Patient number nine who had a
heart transplant has been discharged.

198
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,090
He bought all of us burgers.

199
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,660
I got one set for you.

200
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,540
To relieve often, to comfort always,

201
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,300
and to cure sometimes.

202
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,180
Those are the duties of a doctor.

203
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,980
You taught me that.

204
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,220
For that patient,

205
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,260
you've done your best.

206
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,940
I didn't do my best.

207
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,380
In fact, the last time I saw him,

208
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,360
I'd already noticed

209
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,260
his aortic regurgitation.

210
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,940
His condition was really bad.

211
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,110
However, I didn't admit him
to the hospital immediately.

212
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,620
I didn't conduct surgery on him either.

213
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,830
Why?

214
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,960
Why do some people

215
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,940
not bother with their own health?

216
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,460
They think that work
is more important than their lives.

217
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,900
Why didn't I stand my ground?

218
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm a doctor.

219
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,010
I know what the right thing to do is.

220
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,100
I know what the best treatment plan is.

221
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,860
However,

222
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,180
I didn't stand my ground.

223
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,900
I caved in to his negligence.

224
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,460
Darn it.

225
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,980
You respect your patients.

226
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,620
Nonsense!

227
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,740
The greatest respect a doctor has
for his patient

228
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,450
is saving the patient's life at all cost.

229
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,980
However, I didn't do that!

230
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,380
I was scared.

231
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,700
I was worried that if I insisted,

232
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,820
he would misunderstand my intention.

233
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,160
I didn't want to get into trouble.

234
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,480
I didn't want to put the hospital
into trouble.

235
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,170
I didn't want to ruin my livelihood!

236
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,940
That's why I didn't insist.

237
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,420
However,

238
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,140
when I heard his wife crying,

239
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,140
I felt really guilty.

240
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,860
Slow down. You might choke.

241
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,110
Do you know?

242
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,460
I've been a doctor for so many years

243
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,500
but I don't care for writing papers
or conferring academic titles.

244
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,180
Only one thing has kept me going

245
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,900
at the operating table.

246
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,820
I wish the sick would get treatment

247
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,940
and doctors would be respected.

248
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,220
However,

249
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,300
at times like this,

250
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,860
I always feel that I'm completely useless.

251
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,940
Why didn't I stand my ground?

252
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,310
Do you regret it?

253
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,180
I'm in the hospital. What is it?

254
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,740
Okay, I'll come now.

255
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,800
There is a patient
at the emergency department

256
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,200
with dissecting aneurysm.

257
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,590
He needs to undergo surgery.

258
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,260
The Head of Department will be the surgeon
and I'll be assisting him.

259
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,180
I'll leave the other patients to you.

260
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,120
Keep a close eye on patient number three

261
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,060
who got hit in the chest
in a car accident.

262
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,030
Got it.

263
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,340
He doesn't look remorseful at all.

264
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,020
[I don't like either of them.
I like the multigrain steamed buns]

265
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,020
[that you make.]

266
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,400
I didn't know
you only buy the winner a drink.

267
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,240
I don't know. They're having
their own party with the other teams.

268
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,440
We are different.

269
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,880
We are friends

270
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,420
and rivals.

271
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,350
So, this is our private invitation.

272
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,480
You want to fight again?

273
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,620
Sure thing.

274
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,920
Only in the field, bro.

275
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,290
Do you know? I've never lost
since I joined the army.

276
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,760
Even back then in the hunter school,

277
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,960
I was always the best.

278
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,920
How should I say it? That is true

279
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,920
but this time, it's different.

280
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,800
Now it is teamwork.

281
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,680
We're drawn.

282
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,300
So, in the army, it's the same.

283
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,660
I think in the hunter school,
you're lucky.

284
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,010
Lucky?

285
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,410
You're not the first one
to say that I'm lucky.

286
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,740
Who else?

287
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,280
He was one of my comrades.

288
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,890
Actually, before you,

289
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,820
he was my only failure.

290
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,420
What is he doing now?

291
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,340
Making money.

292
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,000
Making money?

293
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,260
PMC?

294
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,570
Later on, he helped a drug dealer

295
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,580
escape from the police.

296
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,790
He let me have a bullet.

297
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,690
I don't know.

298
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,620
Maybe one day,
I'll join the private sector too.

299
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,550
Who knows?

300
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,700
This is our life.

301
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,620
I mean,

302
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,940
that's not private military service.

303
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,400
It's mercenary.

304
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,820
Whatever, man.

305
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,650
When you take off the uniform,

306
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,340
what are we going to do?

307
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,080
There are many ways to make money.

308
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,450
If it's just for money,

309
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,990
why would you wear this uniform?

310
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,780
Money?

311
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,620
When I heard about the money
they're paying in the private sector,

312
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,400
I regretted so much

313
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,400
wasting all these years.

314
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,140
Far away from home, family, love,

315
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,000
from a normal life, you know?

316
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,330
And for what? What do we get?

317
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,280
Nothing except wounds and useless

318
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,440
medals.

319
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,460
It's to save the world. It's different.

320
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,920
Why far from my family?

321
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,560
Why far from my family, my love

322
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,820
and my normal life?

323
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,670
I feel good.

324
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,300
If more people have happiness,

325
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,240
all the pain and the medals are worth it.

326
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm sorry
but that is nonsense brainwashing.

327
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,380
You're also brainwashed for money.

328
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,280
Listen.

329
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,480
This is an old saying in China.

330
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,620
"Different people
have different aspirations."

331
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,200
Please respect mine.

332
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,050
I just want to be a real soldier.

333
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,700
That's weird.
You remind me so much of him.

334
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:42,960
Who's him?

335
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,100
You mean that mercenary?

336
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,680
You both are the same.

337
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,340
You're born soldiers.

338
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,980
What's his name?

339
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,930
Pei Yu.

340
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,140
Pei Yu?

341
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,060
Okay.

342
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,740
I need to use the toilet. I'll come back.

343
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,660
No!

344
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,980
Is this the one?

345
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,700
The lady in your memory.

346
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,140
She used to smile at you.

347
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,460
She used to act cute too.

348
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,100
She was obsessed with you.

349
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,940
That's how she should look.

350
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,100
She should treat you that way.

351
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,820
What say you?

352
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,140
The mission failed.
He's gone back to China.

353
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,580
Rao Zhi.

354
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,540
What's going on?

355
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,180
It's entangled with a kite string.

356
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,580
Captain, it just scolded you.

357
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,140
Why are you so happy?

358
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,640
Whose bird is this?

359
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,160
How did it get entangled by a kite string?

360
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,560
Is it wild?

361
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,180
How is it possible?

362
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,120
It could speak English fluently.

363
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,500
Its English is more fluent than yours.

364
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,300
You can tell it was trained.

365
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,260
Here.

366
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,960
Can you see that?

367
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,540
RPO? What is this?

368
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,420
It could be the name of an organisation.

369
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,740
Little bird, you have a code name.

370
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,400
Take it away.

371
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,780
It's not a problem.

372
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,660
Don't bite me!

373
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,340
Here, let me try.

374
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,320
Let me do it.

375
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,340
Can you do it?

376
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,780
Both of you get along so well.

377
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,490
My goodness. It's quite...

378
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,590
Here.

379
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,500
-That's good.
-It likes you.

380
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,180
What is going on?

381
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,000
That's enough. Okay.

382
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,060
Don't be so close to me.

383
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,180
The parrot is so cool.

384
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,680
Perhaps

385
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,330
it will turn into a lady
to repay my kindness.

386
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,660
You're thinking too much.

387
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,780
You don't say, Lieutenant Tian.

388
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,620
Both of you look cute together.

389
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,400
We need to dream sometimes.

390
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,060
Am I right?

391
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,340
Through the joint training,

392
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,220
I believe that everyone

393
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,550
has gained a better understanding

394
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,580
of combat techniques
in different terrains.

395
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,540
-Okay.
-Next...

396
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,300
Next up,

397
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,440
we need to address all the issues

398
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,540
found during the joint training

399
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,500
so that we can improve ourselves

400
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,220
in the coming training.

401
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,100
Be disciplined
as if you're on the battlefield.

402
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,860
Hone our weaknesses

403
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,980
into our armour!

404
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,220
Never expose any exploitable opportunity
to your rivals.

405
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,540
-Got it?
-Got it!

406
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,620
Okay.

407
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,820
Who is that?

408
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,580
Who talked in a strange way?

409
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,700
Can't you talk properly?

410
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,360
Come forward!

411
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,580
Report!

412
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,500
What is going on?

413
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,620
Where did you find it?

414
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,690
Report!

415
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,780
It fell from the sky.

416
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,740
Did the "okay" come from it?

417
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,290
Yes.

418
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,940
Idiot!

419
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,180
What did it say?

420
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,980
It just called you an idiot.

421
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,180
What?

422
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,500
Report!

423
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,740
Brigade Commander.

424
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,280
This bird scolded everyone.

425
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,010
Please don't take it to heart.

426
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,800
Nonsense!

427
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,140
Of course I won't be bothered by a parrot.

428
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,060
It's injured.

429
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,780
Yes.

430
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,900
It was entangled with a kite string.

431
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,600
Send it to the medical room.

432
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,190
Let Dr Wu give it some treatment.

433
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,160
Later,

434
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,120
inform the Forestry Bureau
and the  Forestry police.

435
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,460
Tell them to send someone here.

436
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,660
Yes!

437
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,580
Xiao Teng!

438
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,800
Yes!

439
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,960
Lead everyone else back to the camp.

440
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,680
Yes!

441
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,920
Turn to the left. Go!

442
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,300
Brigade Commander.

443
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,220
Let's go to my office.

444
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:12,960
The Embassy of Vitalik

445
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,580
got in touch with us.

446
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,700
Now,

447
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,780
have we found the murderer?

448
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,880
No one survived.

449
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,090
Before we left,

450
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,360
the local police hadn't

451
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,860
found any useful evidence.

452
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,760
It's said that it's committed by
the armed forces

453
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,420
which goes against the local government.

454
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,800
However, they didn't say that

455
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,540
they'll be responsible for the incident.

456
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,220
How did they know your identity?

457
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,370
We had a gathering

458
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,100
at a local club.

459
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,580
If they didn't come for us,

460
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,220
then we must have had the worst luck.

461
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,900
Is it possible that

462
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
you guys offended some locals?

463
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,600
The moment we reached there,

464
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,220
we received closed training.

465
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,980
We didn't have the chance
to offend anyone.

466
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,090
All right.

467
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,860
You've worked hard.

468
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,420
Don't think too much.

469
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,880
As for New Year's Day,

470
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,070
let's do the usual.

471
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,660
Invite Meng Zhen and Xiao Jun.

472
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,810
Invite them over for a short stay.

473
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,460
Let's gather and have fun.

474
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:15,940
Yes.

475
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,260
-Xia Chu.
-Mr Ma.

476
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,660
New Year's Day is just around the corner.

477
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,880
We may get a red packet
from the department.

478
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,860
Really?

479
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm just kidding.

480
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,580
Why were you looking for me?

481
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,040
The head of department asked me to arrange

482
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,240
the holiday work schedules.

483
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,240
Do you plan to go on duty
for one day or two?

484
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,490
Of course one day.

485
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,960
Then, you'll have to go the
Special Forces Brigade on another day

486
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,500
to perform checkups on the soldiers.

487
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,450
Special Forces Brigade?

488
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,480
It's quite far.

489
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,530
You need to go there by bus.

490
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,000
If you're reluctant to go there...

491
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,660
I want to go there. I'll do it.

492
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,280
Since it's New Year's Day,

493
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,820
I'll think of it as an excursion.
It's quite nice.

494
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,090
In that case,

495
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,760
I'll arrange it for you.

496
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,200
Sure. Thank you, Mr Ma.

497
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,180
Goodbye.

498
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,860
Have you signed it?

499
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,650
[Outpatient Department]

500
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,420
Xia Chu.

501
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,540
It's you.

502
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,920
If it's not me,

503
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,260
who do you wish to see?

504
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,620
How is your arm?

505
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,920
The stitches were removed.

506
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,380
It's as good as new.

507
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
That's great.

508
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,130
There is a new Japanese restaurant nearby.

509
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,500
The reviews are not bad.

510
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,900
Let's give it a try.

511
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,180
Tonight?

512
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,020
Think of it as a celebration
for my recovery

513
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,060
as well as an early New Year's Day.

514
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,100
Okay?

515
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,460
Hold on.

516
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,860
[Do you prefer cherry or grape?]

517
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,340
I love both.

518
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,140
Xia Chu.

519
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,250
Japanese cuisine.

520
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,500
Do you want to go?

521
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,220
No.

522
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,820
Do you have any plans?

523
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,060
No.

524
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,300
However,

525
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,310
my taste has changed.

526
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,260
There are hundreds of flavours
in the world.

527
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,260
Besides Japanese cuisine,

528
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,980
I wish to try some other food.

529
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,580
Is it because of Liang Mu Ze?

530
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,020
Goodbye, Zhuo Ran.

531
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,420
Xia Chu.

532
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,420
Let me send you.

533
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,160
No need.

534
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,460
I want to go for a walk.
