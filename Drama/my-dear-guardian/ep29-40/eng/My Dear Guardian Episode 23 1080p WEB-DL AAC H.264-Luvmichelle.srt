[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,000
Where were you?

5
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,750
Dong'an.

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,920
Liang Mu Ze found the tapping device.

7
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,380
Okay.

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,700
"Okay"?

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,590
We need to retreat right away.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,270
If we go back empty-handed,

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,940
do you have a good explanation
for Old Master?

12
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,230
Old Master.

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,200
Old Master.

14
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,860
[The money Gui accepted for the goods,]

15
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,230
[I've received it.]

16
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,380
The transaction went smoothly?

17
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,270
Yes.

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,020
Any progress with Xia Guang Yuan?

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
His assistant, Tang Lin,

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,460
has accepted the 100,000 I offered.

21
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,490
She also agreed

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,380
to provide us with more research data.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
[Good.]

24
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,560
Make full use of this opportunity.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,680
On a side note,

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,420
in a few days,

27
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm going to release more goods.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,590
For this batch,

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,140
[you'll still be in charge
of the transaction,]

30
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,900
from start to end.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,710
Old Master.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,750
Any problem?

33
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,950
Old Master,

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,420
didn't you say that

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,829
once you get the formula for the sedative,

36
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,990
you'll be able to come back

37
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,360
with Xia Guang Yuan in tow?

38
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,750
There have been some changes.

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,600
The Chinese market had previously been

40
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,820
[under the control of Sang Kun and Gui.]

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,550
[Now, we finally found a way in.]

42
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,460
[I want you guys to expand
on the network there,]

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,750
[find new business channels.]

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,790
[Particularly the youth in China.]

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,620
[Knowing what they like
and their preferences]

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,460
[is key to securing future markets.]

47
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,670
This is T4's real opportunity.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,200
Understood, Old Master.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,500
And you, Zhuo Ran?

50
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,090
Understood.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,829
But as for my mother's transplant...

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,500
[Zhuo Ran.]

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
[Zhuo Ran.]

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,110
Old Master has never intended
to treat your mother.

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,500
He's only using her to control you.

56
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,140
Old Master isn't going to save my mother.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
Is he?

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,420
When will we ever be able
to obtain all the data?

59
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,220
The police would've probably
found us by then.

60
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,840
Not probably,

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,540
but definitely.

62
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,880
Since the medical forum,

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,070
they've already been keeping an eye on us.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,120
So what now?

65
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,480
What do you think?

66
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,830
I think

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,620
we should just take the man away.

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
If we can't have Xia Guang Yuan,

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,810
at least we can get the daughter.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,710
You're right.

71
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,910
Doing things step by step like this
is too slow.

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,410
Some things

73
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,930
need to be wrapped up.

74
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,100
I'll leave Xia Chu to you.

75
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,860
I'll sort out

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,260
the production.

77
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,720
In two days,

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,470
we'll meet at the same place.

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,030
Commander Dong,

80
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,570
Based on the comprehensive clues
we've gathered,

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,150
the prime suspect

82
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,630
should be Xia Chu's first boyfriend,

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,700
Zhuo Ran.

84
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
That man

85
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,390
has had numerous altercations with Mu Ze.

86
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,659
It looks like

87
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,620
he still hasn't gotten over Xia Chu.

88
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,920
So you think he has a clear motive?

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,900
That's right.

90
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,430
I've sent men

91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,690
to conduct surveillance on him.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,750
If this case

93
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,270
is indeed related to him,

94
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,100
he should've known

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,620
that the tapping device was discovered.

96
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,700
We're expecting him to take action.

97
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,990
[Long Yi]

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,100
[I've arrived at her neighbourhood.]

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,820
We'll act in one hour.

100
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,380
What's happening, Lei?

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,670
You may go in, mister.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,760
Call the captain.

103
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,720
Okay.

104
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,060
I got the picture now.

105
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,850
What do you want our unit to do?

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,580
The two people living at Mu Ze's house

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,660
are the witness of the case, Xia Chu,

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
and

109
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,510
Mu Ze's cousin, Liang Shao Xue.

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,480
I propose that before things
are sorted out,

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,390
they be moved

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,700
to somewhere more secure.

113
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,730
No problem.

114
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,760
The Special Forces Brigade

115
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,740
can provide shelter and security.

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,510
Mu Ze.

117
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,110
Any other concerns?

118
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,660
-Let me take this call.
-Okay.

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,340
Where?

120
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,130
Okay.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,740
Got it. I'll be right there.

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,659
Zhuo Ran turned himself in.

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,180
Yes.

124
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,860
I installed the tapping device.

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,430
Why did you do it?

126
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,780
Because I wish to get Xia Chu back.

127
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
[I wanted to know]

128
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,270
[what she's doing at home]

129
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,870
[every moment of the day.]

130
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,470
[I want to know everything about her.]

131
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,670
[To make up for the eight years]

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,980
[that I wasn't with her.]

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,770
[Do you know who that house belongs to?]

134
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,230
[I didn't know at first.]

135
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,670
[The day I installed the device,]

136
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,740
I almost ran into him.

137
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,430
[Meaning to say,]

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,429
[through the tapping device,]

139
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,580
[you learned that Xia Chu wanted
to give Liang Mu Ze tranquillisers.]

140
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,950
So you purposely switched it.

141
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,620
Right?

142
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,110
Yes, it was overheard on the device.

143
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,340
But I wasn't the one who heard it.

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,540
It was Long Yi.

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,780
He's my assistant.

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,840
He was the one who switched the pills.

147
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,350
Why would he do that?

148
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,120
Because Old Master told him to.

149
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,350
"Old Master"?

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,130
He's the founder of T4.

151
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,510
The terrorist attack

152
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,030
that happened at the medical
headquarters in Isaia,

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,670
that was T4's doing?

154
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,380
[Back then,]

155
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,880
[he smuggled into Willick from China.]

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,940
[Under the code name T4,]

157
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,690
[he set up his own army of mercenaries.]

158
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,680
[On the surface, he operated
under the pretence of trade investment,]

159
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,260
[but in actual fact,]

160
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,360
[the things he did were illegal.]

161
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,330
What is his real name?

162
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,530
I don't know.

163
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,450
From the first time I met him,

164
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,780
I've been calling him Old Master.

165
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,640
[As for his history in China,]

166
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,510
[I do not know either.]

167
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,010
[How did you two meet?]

168
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,320
In my final year of high school,

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,250
a distant relative

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,620
had arranged for my mother
to be treated in Willick.

171
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,470
We ended up at an illegal factory.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,540
[There,]

173
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,240
[we endured a very dark time.]

174
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,390
We finally managed to escape.

175
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,870
But we ended up almost starving
to death on the streets.

176
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,120
It was Old Master that saved us.

177
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,920
He gave us a place to feel safe.

178
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,720
He even paid for my education.

179
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,210
So in the beginning,

180
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,020
[I was very grateful towards him.]

181
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,980
[You could say]

182
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,550
I relied on him.

183
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,230
Until...

184
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,580
Until what?

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,750
Until I graduated university,

186
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,630
he started to let me

187
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,830
take over some accounts of the company.

188
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,500
That's when I realised

189
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,170
the ugly truth behind
his so-called company.

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,580
[I didn't want to help him.]

191
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,640
[I tried to make him stop.]

192
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,950
But why would he listen to me?

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,220
If you are against his ways,

194
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,860
why do you still work for him?

195
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,500
He has my mother.

196
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,380
I have no choice.

197
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,680
He's been trying to groom me

198
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,060
as his right-hand man.

199
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,280
[I've done all I could]

200
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,030
[to not get involved in matters
outside of the finances.]

201
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,010
But knowing that
my mother's safety is at risk,

202
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,140
I'm not sure how much more I can take.

203
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,070
So you came to Ningjiang

204
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,220
because Old Master told you to?

205
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes.

206
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,310
He wants me to find Sang Kun's
younger brother, Gui.

207
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,300
Then he sent his underling, Long Yi,

208
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,350
[to become my assistant]

209
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
[in order to monitor me.]

210
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,080
So have you found Gui?

211
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,550
We have.

212
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,730
But I only found out later

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
that Long Yi had killed Gui

214
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,980
behind my back.

215
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,380
And on the day itself,

216
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,660
he almost went head to head
with you people.

217
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,540
[He downloaded a program online]

218
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,820
[and printed a 3D gun.]

219
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,750
And then,

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,460
he sneaked Gui out of the hospital,

221
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,650
shot him

222
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
and set up the crime scene.

223
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,860
What about you?

224
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,820
What was your role

225
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,150
in all of this?

226
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,110
I'm a victim.

227
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,150
I'm bearing the risks of being found out

228
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,330
and losing my mother

229
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,940
by coming here to tell you guys this.

230
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,630
You have to ensure my safety.

231
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,100
[I no longer want to live like a dog.]

232
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,670
[This isn't the kind of life I want.]

233
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,140
[I've had enough.]

234
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,040
Even in my dreams, I tried
to escape from the shackles he put on me,

235
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,300
but I couldn't.

236
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,160
Everything I do

237
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,460
[gets reported to Old Master.]

238
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,140
[My mother's life may be in danger.]

239
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,510
And Xia Chu.

240
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,390
What about Xia Chu?

241
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,750
[He knows]

242
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,590
[how much Xia Chu means to me.]

243
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,240
Just like how he's using
my mother to control me,

244
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,100
he wants to do the same with Xia Chu.

245
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,750
[Use her to force me]

246
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,660
[to establish drug trafficking
channels in China,]

247
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,310
[to be his accomplice in crime.]

248
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,590
I can only try my best

249
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,030
to buy time.

250
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,500
But with me...

251
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
By myself,

252
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,830
there's no way for me to stop him.

253
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,710
For the sake of the two most
important women in my life,

254
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,220
I'm begging you.

255
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,540
I'm willing to cooperate with the police

256
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,710
to bring Old Master to justice.

257
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,500
Officer Rao.

258
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,380
[I know you must be dubious]

259
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,500
[about what I just said.]

260
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,410
It's fine.

261
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,160
You can verify it later.

262
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,500
But right now,

263
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,930
you need to send men
to Liang Mu Ze's house.

264
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,990
[Because Old Master has given the order]

265
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,030
[for Long Yi to take care of Xia Chu.]

266
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,020
Is there no electricity?

267
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,480
I don't know. I was watching a drama

268
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,790
and the Internet suddenly stopped.

269
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,330
Hello.

270
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,560
[Hi, Ms Xia.]

271
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,280
[Please come to the building
management office.]

272
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,020
What's the matter?

273
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,050
[There's a problem
with your house's electricity meter.]

274
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,050
[We need to check with you]

275
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,440
[before we can fix the problem.]

276
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,870
What's the problem?

277
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,260
What's up?

278
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,440
Something is wrong with
the electricity meter.

279
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,760
No wonder the hair dryer
suddenly stopped working.

280
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm going to the management office.

281
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,950
Stay here and be good.

282
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Alright.

283
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,710
"Ms Xia"?

284
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,730
Liang Mu Ze!

285
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,820
[No matter how fast the lift is,]

286
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,000
[within three storeys,]

287
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,910
[a human running can easily
catch up to it.]

288
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,840
[So if there's an emergency]

289
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,350
[and you have to take the lift,]

290
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,960
[make sure it goes
more than three storeys.]

291
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,190
[If needed,]

292
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
[press a few more floors
to confuse the pursuer.]

293
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,030
[Anything you find around you]

294
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,090
[can be used as a makeshift weapon.]

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,840
[If you can't get away,]

296
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,740
[try your best to go somewhere
with people]

297
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,200
[and call for help.]

298
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,480
Fire! Fire!

299
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,630
Evacuate!

300
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,420
-Fire!
-Forget about the things!

301
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,140
Are you okay?

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,150
Someone's after me.

303
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,250
I didn't see his face.

304
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,839
He addressed me as Ms Xia on the phone.

305
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
But I never registered with
the building management.

306
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,230
So I'm pretty sure he came for me.

307
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
I was reaching the basement.

308
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,470
I turned and ran just like you taught me.

309
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,740
I pressed several floors in the lift.

310
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,240
I got off halfway

311
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,310
because I thought someone
might be waiting there.

312
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,990
You did good.

313
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,840
It's okay now.

314
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,430
I'm here.

315
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,300
When the incident occurred,

316
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,060
it happened to be the change of shifts.

317
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,250
There was no one
in the night shift office.

318
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,490
Rao Zhi.

319
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,850
Anything?

320
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,340
Li Lei and the rest are
at the basement car park.

321
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,780
The management staff and I

322
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,420
have checked the floors of the building.

323
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,800
We didn't find anyone suspicious.

324
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,710
The culprit probably sneaked out

325
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,410
in the minutes following the alarm.

326
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,690
We'd like to check the CCTVs.

327
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,000
Sure, come with me.

328
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,230
Alright, guys. Follow me.

329
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Okay, pay attention.

330
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,740
Thank you, everyone.

331
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,240
Please wait here for a bit.

332
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,890
Go with him.

333
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
Okay.

334
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,000
We're sorting it out.

335
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,830
Please remain calm.

336
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,800
Xue.

337
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,780
Do you have time?

338
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,550
I'd like to talk to you.

339
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,830
Thank you for your cooperation.
Please wait here.

340
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,670
Yes, I'm at home.

341
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,640
Okay, got it.

342
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,780
Okay.

343
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,340
Xue is with her dad.

344
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,390
That's good.

345
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,200
Did the police catch the culprit?

346
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,930
Who is he?

347
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,280
Why did he come after me?

348
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't ask.

349
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,260
Is that confidential?

350
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,410
Yes.

351
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,860
Alright.

352
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
Xia Chu.

353
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,100
I have to return to the unit
before lights-out.

354
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,960
Your break is over?

355
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,750
Come along with me.

356
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,980
I don't mean anything else.

357
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,020
It's much safer at the unit.

358
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,680
It will be the same as last time.

359
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,990
You'll stay at the guest lodging.

360
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,100
I'll be at the barracks.

361
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,070
Commander Dong has spoken to the chief.

362
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,990
You're welcome any time.

363
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,980
Thank you, guys.

364
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,940
I understand.

365
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,390
You're doing this for my own good.

366
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,590
Including your timely appearance today.

367
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,150
I'm very grateful.

368
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,290
Get to the point.

369
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,190
But I can't go.

370
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,800
At least not now.

371
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,330
The ER is short-handed.

372
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,880
If I leave without notice,

373
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,510
it will only cause more stress

374
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,020
to my colleagues.

375
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,050
Besides,

376
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,940
the patients I'm currently
looking after in ER

377
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,390
haven't been released to normal care.

378
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,750
I have to follow up
when I get back to work.

379
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,270
As for my personal safety,

380
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,390
don't you worry.

381
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,410
I'll protect myself well.

382
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,210
I'll carry pepper spray with me.

383
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,140
I won't take dark alleys,

384
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,200
won't go to secluded places,

385
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,350
won't simply open the door.

386
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,390
I won't give any chances

387
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,020
to the bad guys to get close.

388
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,300
Is that

389
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,770
okay with you?

390
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,490
Alright.

391
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,420
I have to go to the hospital.

392
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,410
I'll take you.

393
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,730
Okay.

394
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,630
Sun Xiao Mo,

395
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,120
you and Li Lei will split up.

396
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,860
You'll continue to locate Long Yi.

397
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,810
Ask Li Lei to send two men
to the hospital.

398
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,400
Before we find Long Yi,

399
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,930
he's in charge of Dr Xia's safety.

400
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,630
Alright?

401
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,040
Notify me if anything.

402
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,150
Get down here.

403
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,130
Leaning out like that is dangerous!

404
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,290
What if you fell?

405
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,880
I'm already 21.

406
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,520
I've come across countless
dangerous situations.

407
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,420
Since when have you come to my rescue?

408
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,930
Speak. What's the matter?

409
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,460
What do you mean?

410
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,120
Didn't you tell Mu Ze

411
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,750
that you'd only speak in front of me?

412
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,940
You escorted me to the police station
so early in the day

413
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,740
and disappeared with my bag.

414
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,560
I waited an hour here for you

415
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,860
and this is what it's about?

416
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,740
You could very well be a witness.

417
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,000
I have someone I like.

418
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm not asking about that.

419
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,930
But I want to talk about it.

420
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,250
Two nights ago,

421
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,800
you went to Yunshan Tunnel, right?

422
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,130
Why should I tell you?

423
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,110
What time did you go?

424
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,110
Did you see anyone there?

425
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,080
Take a guess.

426
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,310
Guess.

427
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,590
Xue.

428
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,850
This is very important.

429
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,100
I don't care a lick.

430
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,130
Mind your tone.

431
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,050
I'm not one of your suspects.

432
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,610
I don't have to be interrogated.

433
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,400
You want to talk to me? Sure.

434
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,240
Resign from this stupid job

435
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,570
and come to the US with me.

436
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,130
We'll have a meal with Mum.

437
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,130
While eating,

438
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,730
I'll be glad to chat with you.

439
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,130
But here,

440
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm not saying one word.

441
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,250
Xue.

442
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,050
Xue!

443
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,730
Who is the guy you like?

444
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,510
Liu Ran.

445
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,070
How do you feel?

446
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,750
Miss Xia Chu.

447
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,950
The doctor said my numbers

448
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,380
have returned to normal.

449
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,700
Am I going to be discharged soon?

450
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,340
That will depend on your overall recovery.

451
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,310
Dr Zhang will decide when you do.

452
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,760
What's on your mind?

453
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,000
If...

454
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,680
If my dad could see how

455
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,460
I overcame this,

456
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,430
he would be proud, wouldn't he?

457
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,440
From now on,

458
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,870
I will

459
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,710
do as you said.

460
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,230
I will live

461
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,110
for his sake as well.

462
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,820
You can cry.

463
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,700
Cry all you want.

464
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,340
You'll feel better after.

465
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,460
Dr Xia.

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,310
I want to make a police report.

467
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Are you

468
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,810
sure?

469
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,360
This is the hospital's

470
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,950
first successful case of saving

471
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,150
a patient poisoned by paraquat

472
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,070
with supplementary therapy using ECMO.

473
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,620
How long was ECMO

474
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,340
installed on the patient?

475
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,510
Including the waiting time
for the organ,

476
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,320
seven days.

477
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,560
I see. Seven days.

478
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,530
Okay.

479
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,760
Try to utilise ECMO outside
of the operating room

480
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,750
and into

481
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,710
the emergency care of severe cases.

482
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,950
It will be beneficial

483
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,950
to the establishment of the hospital's

484
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,700
emergency response system.

485
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,660
Xia Chu.

486
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,690
Mr Zhang.

487
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,320
Sir.

488
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,830
Let me introduce to you

489
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,880
Xia Chu.

490
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,430
A top student
from the Military Medical University.

491
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,050
She obtained her Physician's License
two years after graduating.

492
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,930
She's completed the regulatory training

493
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,360
and was previously stationed at
Cardiac Surgery Department.

494
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,260
Her performance has been outstanding.

495
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,430
Right, Dr Chen?

496
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,670
Now at ER,

497
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,270
she played a part in rescuing Liu Ran.

498
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,130
I know her.

499
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,610
For the past two months,

500
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,510
I've been conducting
experiential research

501
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,070
on the various departments
at the hospital.

502
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,740
I bumped into one time.

503
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,480
That day,

504
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,110
she was totally drenched.

505
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,800
[She was pulling a cooler box]

506
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,880
[containing an organ for transplant,]

507
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,390
[running towards the operating room.]

508
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,620
Do you remember?

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,120
So that was you.

510
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,260
That's right.

511
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,950
This young lady looks gentle and meek,

512
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,110
but when carrying out her duty,

513
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,430
she's full of vigour.

514
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
You know how things are at this hospital.

515
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,030
Over here,

516
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
women are treated like men,

517
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,870
men are treated like livestock.

518
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,140
You joke.

519
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,530
She's always the one going the distance.

520
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,170
Sir, you're exaggerating.

521
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,480
I am just carrying out my duty, is all.

522
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,440
Yes, good.

523
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,070
Let's go and check on the patients.

524
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
Okay. See you.

525
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,490
See you.

526
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,460
During lunch break,

527
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,180
come to see me in my office.

528
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,050
You're still here.

529
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,720
Yeah.

530
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,810
If the 4S shop calls,

531
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,200
go and get the car.

532
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,510
You're asking me to drive?

533
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,330
You need practice.

534
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,340
It's a necessary life skill.

535
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,970
Next time, you can run faster.

536
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
Okay.

537
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,290
I'm off then.

538
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,380
Liang Mu Ze.

539
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,620
From a professional standpoint,

540
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,100
I am considered half your comrade.

541
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,200
I know the meaning

542
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,910
of the military uniform to you.

543
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,140
In one's life,

544
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,570
how much they earn,

545
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,080
what kind of house they own,

546
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,590
what car they drive,

547
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,570
those are all done for others.

548
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,820
There's only one thing,

549
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,170
what kind of person you wish to become,

550
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,760
is done for yourself.

551
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,530
Staying true to oneself is hard.

552
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,530
Perhaps it's a life-long lesson
we continue to master.

553
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,510
I am still a newbie.

554
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,540
So I'm sorry.

555
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,890
I can't give you better advice.

556
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,240
But I'd like you to know

557
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,160
that your decisions
are always right, Captain Liang.

558
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,340
I believe...

559
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,060
Liang Mu Ze, this is the hospital.

560
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,980
You asked me before

561
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,250
if anyone's habit

562
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,800
is found in my life.

563
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,090
You said no.

564
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,230
Not at that time.

565
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,140
But now, I'm telling you

566
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm learning to eat durian.

567
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,770
I'm learning to omit the salt
when cooking soup.

568
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,670
I've gotten used to your taste buds.

569
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,860
I remember what you said about

570
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,760
the heart being on top of the stomach.

571
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,590
I no longer want to be
even with you, Dr Xia.

572
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,420
If you insist on getting even,

573
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,310
the next time we meet,

574
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,700
you can ask for it then.

575
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,660
Are you confessing
your feelings right now?

576
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,660
Will you say yes?

577
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,640
I have work to do.

578
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,100
I need to get back to it.

579
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,910
If the incident made you realise
my importance...

580
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,100
You're important.

581
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,540
But not because of the incident.

582
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,040
This is what I've been
wanting to tell you.

583
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,150
I like you too, Liang Mu Ze.

584
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,300
Although you're proud and snarky,

585
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,390
always wanting to win,

586
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,670
your intelligence and honesty
make me feel safe.

587
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,110
But most importantly,

588
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,320
you've got a good looking face.

589
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,930
Thanks.

590
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,180
Especially when you smile.

591
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,200
It's like the desserts you make.

592
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,360
It's rare,

593
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,530
but every time it's filled with warmth.

594
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,980
Living under the same roof
with such a guy,

595
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,330
after some time,

596
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,580
pink bubbles naturally emerge
in my heart.

597
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,750
I feel like I'm the female lead
in an idol drama.

598
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,400
I've even fantasised many times

599
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,790
about the moment when the two of us
took things off the screen.

600
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,720
You did?

601
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,460
Yes.

602
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,400
Especially yesterday.

603
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,890
You kissed me for the first time.

604
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,750
It was the climax of all my fantasies.

605
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,140
If you had professed your love to me then,

606
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,970
I would've agreed without thinking.

607
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,860
But now...

608
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,920
I know you're getting transferred.

609
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,360
To be honest,

610
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,290
I hate goodbyes.

611
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't like being left behind.

612
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,390
Because when the distance is too large,

613
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,110
you'll lose sight of it forever.

614
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
You may think my worries

615
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,700
are ambivalent,

616
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,270
but they are my honest thoughts

617
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,550
at this moment.

618
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,140
I need time, Liang Mu Ze.

619
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,770
I need to think this through,

620
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,670
whether or not I have the courage

621
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,360
to be in such a relationship.

622
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,690
Can I?

623
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,460
Take your time.

624
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,740
I'll wait.

625
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,970
♫ Exchanging everything, we'll become
each other's destiny ♫

626
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:23,700
♫ I'll make your heart my kingdom ♫

627
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,070
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

628
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:40,130
♫ You and I will make our dream
come true with our lives ♫

629
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,450
No way.

630
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,480
Listen.

631
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,040
I've seen too many long-distance marriages

632
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,430
that most often ended up broken.

633
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,760
A long-distance relationship

634
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,630
not only puts a strain on time
and money,

635
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,110
more importantly, it tests
one's character and dedication.

636
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,470
[We are already stretched thin at work.]

637
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,550
[So why choose]

638
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,510
[Hard Mode in our relationships?]

639
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
A companion.

640
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,560
It's not a companion
if they can't keep you company.

641
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,950
Spiritual companionship counts, right?

642
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,900
Spiritual?

643
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,740
Do you raise the next generation
with your spirit?

644
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,920
This scene needs voice-over.
Note it down.

645
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,890
Okay.

646
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,780
Don't be silly, girl.

647
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,070
If marriage is the grave of love,

648
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,460
then becoming a widow
is the abyss of hell.

649
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,740
[Either he stays or you resign.]

650
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,480
[Otherwise, be prepared]

651
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,000
[to eat and shop alone,]

652
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,410
celebrate festivals alone,

653
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,130
go for prenatal check-ups
and give birth alone,

654
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,380
handle both parents alone,

655
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,830
and endure a pitiful life
with no one to share your ups and downs.

656
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,180
I don't think it's as bad
as having to use "pitiful".

657
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,230
[Of course it is.]

658
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,700
[Think about it.]

659
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,520
Your "love rival" is our beloved nation.

660
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,530
Is your land bigger?

661
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,530
Do you have more people?

662
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,870
How can you compare?

663
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,710
[Right.]

664
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,910
[What you said is true.]

665
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,500
[It's an undeniable fact.]

666
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,270
But when he brought it up,

667
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,270
I couldn't turn him down.

668
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,280
Not only did you not turn him down,

669
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,800
you went ahead and divulged

670
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,620
your innermost thoughts, didn't you?

671
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,560
I'm dumb, aren't I?

672
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,750
Dumb and naive.

673
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,940
Would you have done that?

674
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,270
Me?

675
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,909
I'm even more dumb.

676
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,260
Because of Zhuo Ran?

677
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,030
Aren't things going well with you two?

678
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,150
Go and transfer yesterday's
B-rolls into here.

679
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,120
Okay.

680
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,300
Two days ago, we were supposed
to go and watch a movie.

681
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,940
But he said he was busy.

682
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,070
Where did he go?

683
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,340
[Supposedly for work.]

684
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,330
Anyway, the date was cancelled.

685
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,659
I haven't heard from him since.

686
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,860
Work?

687
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,900
What is it?

688
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,060
Nothing.

689
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,490
Yeah, it's nothing.

690
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,540
In a relationship,

691
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,140
it's either mutually showing love

692
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,190
or mutually giving or getting hurt.

693
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,300
We're adults,

694
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,000
not some young kid.

695
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,890
I'm fine with any outcome.

696
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,790
[Anyway,]

697
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,090
it's not like I have no suitors.

698
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,270
It doesn't have to be him, right?

699
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,270
If it really came down to...

700
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,080
[If I really had to let go,]

701
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,220
[promise me you'd drink with me then.]

702
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,340
Drink until we puke.

703
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,840
Drink until we pass out cold.

704
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,860
All right?

705
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,010
Mi Gu.

706
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,600
The fact that I'm living
at Liang Mu Ze's house,

707
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,510
did you ever mention it to Zhuo Ran?

708
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,680
No, I didn't.

709
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,040
Why do you ask?

710
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,520
[Xia Chu.]

711
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,780
You're living with that kind of man.

712
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
Aren't you afraid?

713
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,920
How did you know?

714
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,110
Mi Gu.

715
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,540
She told me.

716
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,220
[Hello?]

717
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,110
It's nothing. I'll leave you be.

718
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,140
[Bye-bye.]

719
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,200
Miss Gu, the producer wanted me

720
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,950
to remind you of the requests.

721
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,580
[Liu Song]

722
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,280
At the hallway today,

723
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,080
Mr Zhang specifically

724
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,110
introduced her to the visiting head of
the inspection.

725
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,360
That's right.

726
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,090
Director Chen didn't look too amused.

727
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,840
Mr Zhang did a splendid job
during the operation,

728
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,590
so Director Chen couldn't say anything.

729
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,520
Seems like Xia Chu was the most beautiful.

730
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,420
She even charmed Mr Zhang's soul away.

731
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,180
She deserves it.

732
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,860
Doesn't she?

733
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,460
Sorry, guys.

734
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,920
Mr Zhang asked me to come.

735
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,250
I overheard your discussion just now.

736
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,630
Sounded like I was the main star.

737
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,260
It was probably not the first time,

738
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,220
nor will it be the last.

739
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,120
Firstly, I'm thankful that you all
approve of my looks.

740
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,550
I know,

741
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
I am quite the looker.

742
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,470
No doubt about that.

743
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,940
Secondly,

744
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,980
Mr Zhang introduced me to the head

745
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,150
not because I am pretty.

746
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,180
It's because

747
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,300
I was involved with Liu Ran's treatment
from start to end.

748
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
I was the one who convinced her uncle

749
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,320
to install the ECMO.

750
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
I was also the one

751
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,070
who delivered the lung for transplant

752
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,100
from the airport to the operating room.

753
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,480
While you guys are busy chit-chatting,

754
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,320
I was in the EICU,

755
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,390
staying by the patient's side
through nights on end,

756
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,410
up until today when the ECMO was removed.

757
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,510
My effort should be remembered.

758
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,030
Lastly,

759
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I'd like to share my favourite motto

760
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,990
with you all as an encouragement.

761
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,270
Being professional and reliable

762
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,710
is the most cost-effective form
of socialising.

763
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,350
Let's work hard together.

764
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,640
Alright.

765
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,900
I should head back to the ER.

766
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,800
By the way,

767
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,600
please inform Dr Zhang when he's here

768
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,690
that I dropped by.

769
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,950
Next,

770
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,700
let's welcome the President
of Ningjiang's Hospital Association,

771
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,720
who was also our former dean,

772
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,480
Mr Zhang Li Fu, to brief us on his work.

773
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,500
Let's welcome him.

774
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,010
I'm glad to be here.

775
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,520
During the inspection,

776
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,090
I've seen a lot

777
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,600
and heard a lot.

778
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,370
But the thing that impressed me
the most is

779
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,460
that resident doctor

780
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,220
named Xia Chu.

781
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,410
Take a look.

782
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,830
This is a photo I took by chance

783
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,540
of her back.

784
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,040
In this photo,

785
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,480
I can see the most invaluable character

786
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,380
a young doctor should have.

787
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
[Simple.]

788
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,220
[Pure.]

789
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,980
[You could say that she's bordering]

790
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,380
[on naivety.]

791
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,600
[But I believe]

792
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,240
[that it's the same naivety
that has allowed her]

793
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,570
[to bravely speak her mind.]

794
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,180
[To fight for the patient]

795
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,910
[with good reason]

796
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,350
[She refused to become a vassal
for the more senior doctors.]

797
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,430
[Amidst the challenging
medical ethics environment,]

798
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,520
[she abided by
a doctor's code of conduct.]

799
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,180
Such a cute heart.

800
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,070
All better.

801
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,050
[We]

802
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,840
often talk about

803
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,920
good hospitals

804
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,080
and good doctors.

805
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,030
What does "good" entail?

806
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,390
Aside from having the best
medical technology,

807
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,530
most advanced equipment

808
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,440
and a huge number of case samples,

809
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,670
[I think a good hospital...]

810
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,520
Get ready 200 joules

811
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,660
[is not solely defined by
the responsibility and care for patients,]

812
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,700
[but more so]

813
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,310
[the way we treat the young doctors.]

814
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,440
[The bigger the hospital,]

815
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,460
[the more it should provide space
for young doctors to grow]

816
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,000
[and opportunities to improve.]

817
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,710
[Please remember this.]

818
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,960
[An industry without young blood]

819
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,020
[is one without prospects.]

820
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,020
[That is the reason why I decided]

821
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,720
[to share this photo with everyone today.]

822
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,710
[So, being straightforward]

823
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,430
[and not having to compromise]

824
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,670
[feels pretty good.]

825
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,500
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

826
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:39,880
♫ It could be the destiny
but it is not practical ♫

827
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,690
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

828
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:54,270
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

829
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,100
[Still reminiscing about my confession?]

830
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,040
[You're thinking too much.]

831
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,100
♫ Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you ♫

832
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,710
[Drive safe. No need to reply.]

833
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,730
♫ If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

834
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:10,220
♫ I can't remember when
I fell in love with you ♫

835
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,450
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

836
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:24,250
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

837
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:31,210
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

838
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:39,410
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

839
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,630
Is Xia Chu okay?

840
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,530
[Have you had lunch?]

841
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,640
Where's the coffee?

842
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,380
Just make do with that.

843
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,780
She being fine doesn't mean you're fine.

844
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,800
Worry about yourself instead.

845
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,410
[Regarding the tapping device,]

846
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,150
[I'm willing to bear the responsibility.]

847
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,740
And the rest?

848
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,880
The rest?

849
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,250
Rest of what?

850
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,810
Why did Long Yi target Xia Chu?

851
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,050
That's Old Master's order.

852
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,330
Why did Old Master give that order?

853
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,280
I don't know.

854
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,060
What exactly is your relationship
with Old Master?

855
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,220
[I've told you everything.]

856
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,500
In spite of the threats
from the evildoers,

857
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,230
I've come clean about my mistake.

858
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,340
I turned myself in

859
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,850
and am cooperating with you.

860
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,310
I'm not hoping for any recognition.

861
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,110
I just want to be reunited with my mother.

862
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,020
If you don't believe me,

863
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,780
go ahead and verify it.

864
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,560
But you better do it quickly.

865
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,090
Time is ticking.

866
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,180
[Of course we'll verify it
as soon as possible.]

867
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,330
Since you

868
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,310
are so willing to cooperate with us

869
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,070
and have provided us with important clues,

870
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,200
we will ensure your personal safety.

871
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,790
So,

872
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,360
I hope you don't mind

873
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,750
spending the night
at the detention centre.

874
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,560
Certainly, Officer Rao.

875
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,100
What are you doing here?

876
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,540
I came to visit the parrot.

877
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,120
Get in.

878
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,240
You get off.

879
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,990
Roger that.

880
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,620
Everyone, ready to deploy parachutes.

881
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,110
Stand up. Clip on the snap hook.

882
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,520
I don't understand.

883
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,820
Why is his job more important
to him than family?

884
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,610
Catching criminals is more important
than his daughter's happiness.

885
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,050
He's trying to destroy my confidence

886
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,850
towards men, love and marriage.

887
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,270
He hasn't had a wink of sleep
in three days, Xue.

888
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,540
Why is that my problem?

889
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,750
I don't care.

890
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,270
He asked for it himself.

891
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,110
He's forgotten that he's a husband
first and foremost,

892
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,520
and a father next,

893
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,150
and a police officer last.

894
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,700
Tell me then.

895
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,720
What about the way

896
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,280
you express your feelings
so heatedly and aggressively?

897
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,350
I did not.

898
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,590
Xue.

899
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,220
He is your birth father.

900
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,440
Right?

901
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,080
Just because he doesn't show

902
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,400
his emotions as openly as you,

903
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,150
doesn't mean you're not important.

904
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,620
I'm not important.

905
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,430
He's just cold-blooded.

906
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,530
Are you alright?

907
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,750
Tian Yong!

908
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,310
Are you okay?

909
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,160
Yeah.

910
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:07,920
You should be ashamed.

911
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,900
You're an experienced paratrooper
but still got caught in a tree?

912
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,090
It's not his fault.

913
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,510
He was trying to help the new recruit
open the parachute.

914
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,270
That's why he drifted off course.

915
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,520
Are you okay?

916
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,750
Reporting, sir!

917
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,730
I can still jump!

918
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,730
Still jump?

919
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,020
Look at the state you're in!

920
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,510
I'm fine.

921
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,270
Help him. Quick!

922
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,820
Get him to the infirmary.
