[Episode 6]

4
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,830
Sure.

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,200
Thank you.

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,479
How is it?

[Zhuo Ran]

8
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,310
I cooked seafood porridge.

9
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll turn off the heat
if you don't want to eat.

10
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,520
It's to save electricity.

11
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,430
Bring me some.

12
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,040
Such a brat!

13
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,120
"Bring me some."

14
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,350
Isn't that my book?

15
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,550
This is my house.

16
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,030
Did you prepare steamed bun?

17
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,230
No.

18
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,410
I've homemade whole grain pancakes though.

19
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,710
Do you want to try?

20
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,950
Bring it here.

21
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,590
It smells wonderful. I want to try it too!

22
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,480
It's quite delicious.

23
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,960
Of course.

24
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,230
It would go well with pickles.

25
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,290
Liang Mu Ze.

26
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,600
Have of you heard of a story before?

27
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,920
Long, long time ago, a man

28
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,090
kept bossing his housemate

29
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,670
who was a doctor around.

30
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,829
Finally, one day,

31
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,630
his housemate poisoned him to death

32
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,590
without anyone knowing.

33
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,950
Haven't you heard that story before?

34
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,150
I've heard about a story.

35
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,910
It's about a Special Forces soldier

36
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,670
who was poisoned to death.

37
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,370
Three seconds
before the poison came into effect,

38
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,930
he punched the person
who poisoned him to death.

39
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,159
Have you heard of the story?

40
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,210
What a coward.

41
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,750
Thank you.

42
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,710
The book is nice, isn't it?

43
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,630
Can you guess who the murderer is?

44
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,720
It's not Umeda Hachiro for sure.

45
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,150
It's not him for sure.

46
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,200
The story is like this.

47
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,390
Let me tell you.

48
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,640
In the end,

49
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,000
Mitarai was the one
who resolved

50
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,270
the Tokyo Zodiac Murders.

51
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,510
Isn't it interesting?

52
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,250
I have many detective novels on the shelf.

53
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,790
I can tell you the ending one by one.

54
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,510
Do you know what is

55
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,500
the most miserable thing in life?

56
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,210
Not having any canned food.

57
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,810
Misery is when you're reading the climax

58
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,200
of a detective novel,

59
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,320
someone breaks the ending to you
without warning.

60
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,610
Is detective novel
tastier than canned food?

61
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,670
I bet Liang Mu Ze

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,310
is as upset as
having constipation for five days.

63
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,270
He deserves it.

64
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,210
He was lazying in the sofa
like a braised egg

65
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,890
and bossing me around
as if I was his babysitter.

66
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,870
Let me tell you.

67
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,990
This is just a warning.

68
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,950
If he does that to me again,

69
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,270
You better shut up now.

70
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,230
I'll...

71
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,740
Have you finished taking a shower?

72
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,110
Hug me, handsome.

73
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,700
Do you want some tea?

74
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,670
Yes.

75
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,120
Sure.

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,280
Here you go.

77
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,470
Please try it.

78
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,280
What's that smell?

79
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,700
What's wrong?

80
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,350
Take it away.

81
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,909
Did you just bring my toilet bowl here?

82
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,210
Take it away.

83
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,690
Are you scared of durian?

84
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm not scared of it. I don't like it.

85
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,590
So you're scared of it.

86
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,070
Take it away!

87
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,450
Sure. Don't be scared.

88
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,260
Here.

89
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,240
Drink some tea to calm down.

90
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,530
Here.

91
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll finish all of it.

92
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,270
Are you done?

93
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,220
Liang Mu Ze, you're so sensitive.

94
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't go.

95
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,090
I'm just joking.

96
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,210
Take it away!

97
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,550
It's not easy to brew the tea.

98
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,680
At least take a sip. Don't waste it.

99
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,780
It's either I leave or you take it away.

100
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll take it away.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,860
I'll get lost.

102
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,800
Is it nice?

103
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,960
Is this Pre-Qingming Longjing?

104
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,560
Suitable for kids.

105
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,760
You know about tea too?

106
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,970
So what?

107
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,250
I swear I'm not secretly thinking that
you're old-fashioned.

108
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,670
My grandma loves drinking tea.

109
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,170
When I was young,
I always had Longjing, Pu'er

110
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,800
with her.

111
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,560
I see.

112
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
When you go back to
your hometown next time,

113
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll prepare some tea leaves for you

114
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,350
so that you can bring it back
for your grandma.

115
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,570
No need.

116
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,110
Don't be shy.

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,730
Before I left, I had stolen
quite a bit of tea leaves

118
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,080
from my dad's tea cabinet.

119
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,590
My home is near to Hangzhou.

120
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,850
I have quite many opportunities
to taste Longjing every year.

121
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,140
No matter how expensive tea is,

122
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,800
it is meant to be tasted by people.

123
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,970
Its value will only be reflected

124
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,240
when more people try it.

125
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,830
Don't feel sorry for me.

126
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,610
No need.

127
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,260
Don't be shy.

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,050
My grandma passed away long time ago.

129
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,310
My grandma passed away long time ago too.

130
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,950
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,680
I didn't know that.

132
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,190
My bed is not covered with bed sheets.

133
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,810
If you feel sorry for me,

134
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,670
lend me a bed sheet
and make the bed for me.

135
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,280
Sure, I'll do it.

136
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,340
Something is not right.

137
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,350
Why should I feel sorry for him?

138
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,370
He mentioned his grandma first.

139
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,640
I didn't know that.

140
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,810
Why should I contribute my bed sheet?

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,990
Why should I make his bed?

142
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,390
Who does he think he is?

143
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,230
He is your landlord.

144
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,550
It's either you put up with him
or you leave.

145
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,350
Make the bed for him, huh?

146
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,470
Sad story, huh?

147
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,710
Fine, let's make his wish come true.

148
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,360
I've a bad hunch.

149
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,820
And in the name of the Moon,
I will punish you!

150
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,240
Liang Mu Ze.

151
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,620
Poop-picker, wake up! You're getting late.

152
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,170
I'm going to be late.

153
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,590
Will you stop staring at me?

154
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong place.

155
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm doomed.

156
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,210
I'm leaving.

157
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,360
Finish it before you leave.

158
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,010
Thank you.

159
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,020
Did you go out to get milk
early in the morning?

160
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
I didn't buy it.

161
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,710
You left it in the fridge.

162
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,540
You got it from the fridge?
I didn't keep milk in the fridge.

163
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,700
It's here.

164
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,630
Why did you give it to me?

165
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,400
It's not expired. I've checked.

166
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,090
It's whipping cream.

167
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,200
Do you know

168
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,950
how many calories it contains?

169
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,010
I have no idea.

170
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,370
Why did you give it to me then?

171
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,680
You kind of enjoyed it.

172
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,160
-Liang Mu Ze!
-You're going to be late.

173
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,340
What did you say?

174
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,650
Forget it. I'll get another driver.

175
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,930
It's okay.

176
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,900
Are you having motion sickness?

177
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,760
It's gut fermentation syndrome.

178
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,950
I feel like vomiting.

179
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,190
It's okay.

180
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,480
Just put up with it.

181
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,480
It's not a serious problem.

182
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,640
Don't be dramatic.

183
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,310
You need to be strong.

184
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
Liang Mu Ze, you said that on purpose.

185
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,180
You're thinking too much.

186
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,890
I'm just an old hog.

187
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,590
I can't tell

188
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,530
whipping cream and milk apart.

189
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,750
They're the same to me.

190
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,730
You're talking nonsense!

191
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,720
You're angry at me

192
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,050
as I made your bed
with a printed Sailor Moon bedding set.

193
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,240
You're seeking revenge.

194
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,160
Listen.

195
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,280
You're a special forces soldier

196
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,710
and yet you're so petty.

197
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,240
For a man like you,

198
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,210
let alone insomnia,

199
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,160
you may drop dead one day soon.

200
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,150
Who is the petty one?

201
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,130
It's you.

202
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,990
We're here.

203
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,840
Good morning, Xia Chu.

204
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,190
Good morning.

205
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,440
He's my comrade.

206
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,790
Will you get down now?

207
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,590
Why are you here?

208
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,230
I'm here for something.

209
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,660
Have you eaten breakfast?

210
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,890
Yes, I've eaten.

211
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,840
Keep it for lunch.

212
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,960
What's wrong?

213
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,880
Take it away.
I can't look at it the same way anymore.

214
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,550
This is my comrade.

215
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,090
Find out someone for me.

216
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,560
It's one week after the patient,
Luo Xiao Jun underwent the surgery.

217
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,670
It's time for the review
of heart ultrasonography.

218
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,390
There's no blood clot on septal occluder.

219
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,250
The reading of blood cell count
and coagulation index are normal.

220
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,750
No active bleeding is found.

221
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,900
The drainage tube was removed last night.

222
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,660
That's great.

223
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,000
Dr Zhang

224
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,110
has completed yet another challenge.

225
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,150
The coagulation during the intervention

226
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,800
and the bleeding management
during thoracotomy

227
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,240
were managed well.

228
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't deserve all the credit.

229
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,090
Thanks to Xia Chu.

230
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,070
All right. Xia Chu should
come out with a case report.

231
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,550
She's pregnant!

232
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm not pregnant.

233
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,210
You're pregnant.

234
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,790
You almost puked.

235
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,020
So what?

236
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,650
That's the sign of pregnancy.

237
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,780
Xiao Jun, don't talk nonsense.

238
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,630
It's always shown on TV.

239
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,060
Stop talking.

240
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,480
Why are you laughing?

241
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,310
Yang Mu Ze is such a jerk!

242
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,660
If it ever happens again,

243
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,450
I'll poison you to death!

244
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,930
The military medical doctor

245
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,810
needs to attend to something urgent.

246
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,610
They need our help.

247
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,720
Get ready.

248
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,900
Why is it me?

249
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,290
As Mr Zhang said,

250
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,110
we need to send a houseman there.

251
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,200
You're not in.

252
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,140
All of us

253
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,450
unanimously recommended you
as the representative.

254
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,380
Are you really pregnant?

255
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,400
If you admit that you studied eight years
in medical school for nothing,

256
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll admit that I'm pregnant.

257
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,870
Are you pregnant
and he refuses to be responsible?

258
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,430
Isn't that the storyline?

259
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,400
Who refuses to be responsible?
What nonsense are you talking about?

260
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,710
That military officer.

261
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,360
If not so,
why would you poison him to death?

262
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,110
That's between him and me.

263
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,770
All right. I got it.

264
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,890
Go now.

265
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,880
The success of the surgery

266
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,320
has further strengthened our determination

267
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,650
to develop and produce

268
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,190
3D technology.

269
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,720
I hope we can start from
the department of cardiothoracic surgery.

270
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,010
We shall work together

271
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,250
to set up a special fund

272
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,750
for 3D Printing and hologram technology

273
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,160
which is non-profit making.

274
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,170
It's to expedite

275
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,310
the development of 3D technology.

276
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,360
From my personal view,

277
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,870
clinical technology innovation

278
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,030
is definitely a good movement.

279
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,280
We welcome such exploration.

280
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
However, as for the hospital,

281
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,840
we need further discussion on it.

282
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,310
We can do it.

283
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
However, as for the mode of operation

284
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,990
of the special fund,

285
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,680
we need further clarification.

286
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,970
Don't worry. I'll draft a

287
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,380
Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement
as soon as possible

288
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,680
and explain to all of you in detail.

289
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,370
That's great.

290
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,790
We'll wait for the good news, Mr Zhuo.

291
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,840
Dr Zhang.

292
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,760
Thank you for making the contact.

293
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,950
Sorry to have troubled you.

294
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,150
Don't worry.

295
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,950
Not to mention you're Xia Chu's friend.

296
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,960
Personalized medicine

297
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,420
is the trend.

298
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,110
3D printing technology

299
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,810
is an important element.

300
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,060
If the special fund

301
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,840
can go through smoothly,

302
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,950
I think

303
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,600
it's beneficial to everyone

304
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,270
be it your company,

305
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,260
our hospital and department

306
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,780
or our potential patients.

307
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,010
It's a win-win situation.

308
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,310
It's worth doing.

309
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,040
Do you have time for lunch?

310
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
I would like to treat you

311
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,790
and Xia Chu a meal.

312
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,200
I need to conduct a surgery
in the afternoon.

313
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,630
Furthermore, Xia Chu hasn't come back yet.

314
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,850
Where did she go?

315
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,230
She's gone to the military camp
for health security tasks.

316
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,790
Are you looking for her?

317
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,880
[It's such a hot day]

318
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,850
yet you guys have to work under hot sun.

319
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,990
Thank you for the hard work.

320
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,870
It's our duty.

321
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,440
It's mainly because

322
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,350
casualties have increased lately.

323
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,170
Not only do I have to manage equipment
and medicine supply alone,

324
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,480
I also have to take care of the patients.

325
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,870
I'm really up to my neck.

326
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,470
What are they doing?

327
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,590
Have you heard about
The Heavenly Maid Scatters Blossoms?

328
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,250
It's time for you to see new things.

329
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,240
Liang Mu Ze, can you do it?

330
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,100
He's Liang Mu Ze
of Special Forces Brigade.

331
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,270
His marksmanship

332
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,890
was made known in the division
during the training.

333
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,600
Some people call him

334
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,020
the God of Guns.

335
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,430
God?

336
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,730
He's just mental.

337
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,470
Get ready to shoot.

338
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,610
I injured my arm. I need treatment.

339
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,930
[Treatment Room]

340
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,420
The wound is not too bad.
No stitches are needed.

341
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,040
Stop moving!

342
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,300
It's too big.

343
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,650
What?

344
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,840
The plaster is too big.

345
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,900
It's not nice looking.

346
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,520
Everyone looks ugly when they're injured.

347
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't bolster yourself
if you want to look good.

348
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,330
Why did you fool around for no reason?

349
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,520
Do you really think that
I was fooling around?

350
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,660
Weren't you?

351
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,490
You shot down cans of beer in a row.

352
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,230
No doubt it's interesting to watch

353
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,130
but what can the tricks do

354
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,200
when it comes to actual battle?

355
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,760
A few years back,

356
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,800
there was a kidnapping case.

357
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,310
The Special Forces
had to assist the SWAT

358
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,690
in rescuing the hostages.

359
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,850
However, the kidnappers

360
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,270
threw a gas tank right off the roof.

361
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,600
Fortunately, an officer found out about it

362
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,120
and shot the gas tank with a gun.

363
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,900
The gas tank exploded in the air.

364
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,940
Not only did he save himself,

365
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,530
he also saved the hostages.

366
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,560
He also saved the onlooking crowd.

367
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,250
You're right.

368
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,390
It's not practical in war.

369
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
However, in a battlefield,

370
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,640
one will encounter more violent situations
with blood and gore.

371
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,030
Those situations can only be handled by

372
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,680
these unusual training.

373
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,840
It's done.

374
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,990
Where is the sink?

375
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,320
It's next door.

376
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you.

377
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
By the way,

378
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,730
take care of the wound hygiene.

379
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,970
Rest well.

380
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,890
-Keep the wound dry.
-Sure.

381
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,620
The kidnapping case that you mentioned

382
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,810
sounded dangerous.

383
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,450
Did you experience it on your own

384
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,760
or did you hear it from someone?

385
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,590
I made up the incident.

386
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,790
I just wanted to make a point.

387
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,130
That's smart.

388
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,920
Xiao Bai, I'm leaving.

389
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,980
Okay, bye.

390
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,200
Bai, I've reserved a table.
Pack up.

391
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,800
Sure, bye.

392
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,350
Is Mr Zhuo back yet?

393
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,800
He's not coming back today.

394
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,950
What?

395
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,790
[How is it going?]

396
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,830
Do you like her?

397
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm just looking around.

398
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,450
She's coming over to our office
for recording.

399
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,870
If you like her...

400
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,860
Really?

401
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,170
I'm obsessed with her.

402
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,490
Will you bring me to your office
to see her?

403
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,960
No problem.

404
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,920
This is my name card.

405
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,320
When Mr Zhuo is back,

406
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,590
inform me at the first instance.

407
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,620
No problem.

408
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,390
That's great!

409
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,000
Do you want some fish?

410
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,570
These snakeheads reached only today.

411
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,570
They're fresh.

412
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,680
Listen.

413
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,910
The snakehead is best for soup making.

414
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,620
It's good for muscles
and it helps in wound healing.

415
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,310
What do you think?
Will you buy a snakehead?

416
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,640
I'll get one.

417
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,860
Sure.

418
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,160
It's just a machine.

419
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,770
Can it print a weapon?

420
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,850
If we work on the materials,

421
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,080
any object

422
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,180
can be produced with data.

423
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,800
3D printing will rule the world soon.

424
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,900
We, on the other hand,

425
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,610
is changing the rules of the game

426
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,790
in the present world.

427
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,570
Are you trying to print weapons

428
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,230
because of the owner of that car plate?

429
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,740
What have you found?

430
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,310
It's not confirmed yet.

431
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,390
It's time for dinner.

432
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,610
Is this a new bowl?

433
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,100
Do you need so many bowls?

434
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,260
No, I don't need it.

435
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,900
Why did you buy it then?

436
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,010
You don't have to use all the tableware.

437
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,430
You can appreciate the beauty.

438
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,160
Can you see that?

439
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,840
I plan to buy more

440
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,270
beautiful tableware
and hang them on the wall.

441
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,820
It'd look nice in the photos.

442
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,650
You're just fooling around.

443
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,620
Life is all about
fooling around endlessly.

444
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,180
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

445
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:50,880
♫ It could be the destiny
but it is not practical ♫

446
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,410
♫ Your expression popped out on my mind ♫

447
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:05,270
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

448
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,230
Here.

449
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,740
The steamed dumplings are ready.

450
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,810
Have you taken a shower?

451
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,760
Didn't I tell you

452
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,270
you must keep the wound dry?

453
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,260
I didn't wet it.

454
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,820
Listen, take care of the wound.

455
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,090
Don't take it lightly.

456
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,640
If the wound is infected,

457
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,070
you'll ruin my reputation.

458
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,970
What reputation do you have?
The reputation of a houseman?

459
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,590
What's wrong with being a houseman?

460
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,960
A houseman can be passionate
and ambitious too. Okay?

461
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,950
Think about it.

462
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,410
All the experts

463
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,970
used to be a houseman

464
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,390
who had ascended with time.

465
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,210
If everyone treats us differently

466
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,110
just like you,

467
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,800
how do doctors become better?

468
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,190
How does medicine field develop?

469
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,430
The fish soup is bland.

470
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,120
What are you doing?

471
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,250
Don't add salt!

472
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,640
If you consume too much of salt at night,

473
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,970
it'll cause more burden to kidneys.

474
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,080
You will be at a risk of losing caesium.

475
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,440
Furthermore, it may trigger

476
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,400
tens of diseases including stomach cancer.

477
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,030
It's not good for wound healing too.

478
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,760
More importantly...

479
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,750
More importantly,
you're having an early menopause.

480
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,440
Premature menopause.

481
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,790
My mum used to have the same symptoms.

482
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,260
Liang Mu Ze!

483
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,190
Liang Mu Ze!

484
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,730
Give me back the fish soup!

485
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,760
Give it back to me!

486
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,410
Give me back the snakehead fish soup!

487
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,750
Give it back to me!

488
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,190
Oh no.

489
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,260
He is mental!

490
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,010
He insisted to add
so much of salt in the soup.

491
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,950
He ruined the soup.

492
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,600
Just let him be. It's not for you anyway.

493
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,750
Why are you so upset with him?

494
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,790
I bought the snakehead. I cooked the soup.

495
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,000
I even treated his wound.

496
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,130
I need to be responsible to my cooking

497
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,840
and my patient.

498
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,190
You're nothing but stubborn.

499
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,790
He just added some salt in the soup.
How is that a big deal?

500
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,240
Do you know?

501
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,530
Liang Mu Ze

502
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,190
did so many strange things.

503
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,030
[He doesn't sleep at night.]

504
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,880
[He's always posing
in the living room for no reason.]

505
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,720
[I saw that many times by chance.]

506
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,350
What's going on?

507
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,090
[He would just]

508
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,480
stare

509
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,500
straight into your eyes.

510
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,080
It's really scary.

511
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,360
You make a man

512
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,730
sleep on a bed covered
with Sailor Moon printed bedding set.

513
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,510
It'd be strange if he can fall asleep.

514
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,960
Also,

515
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,130
he insists to
close the curtain during day time.

516
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,390
The whole house is lifeless.

517
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,190
Liang Mu Ze, what are you doing?

518
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,670
I'm trying to avoid the light.

519
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
This is my curtain!

520
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,610
This is my house.

521
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,800
Is he a cactus monster or what?

522
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,500
He's full of thorns!

523
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,700
Being vigilant at all times

524
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,520
could be a conditioned reflex

525
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,050
as he's a military officer.

526
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,390
[Please let me know at first instance
when he's back]

527
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,310
It's nothing do to with being vigilant.

528
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,760
He's too bossy.

529
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,960
He wants to take control of everything.

530
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,510
He wouldn't even allow me to sing.

531
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,590
♫ Missing you so much ♫

532
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,540
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

533
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,700
Xia Chu.

534
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,890
-What's wrong?
-Will you stop singing?

535
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,030
Will you stop singing?

536
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,890
What's wrong?

537
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,410
My singing is not too bad.

538
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,470
Are you sure?

539
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,150
You must have misunderstood
the meaning of "not too bad".

540
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,010
I think it's all right.

541
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,470
You're asking too much.

542
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:14,590
♫ Thoughts of you are like a river ♫

543
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,510
♫ Protecting me at all times ♫

544
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,530
Xia Chu.

545
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,820
What's wrong?

546
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,880
Are you awake now?

547
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,910
-Liang Mu Ze!
-What?

548
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,460
That's too much, isn't it?

549
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,170
He's inhumane.

550
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,720
However, Dr Xia,

551
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,370
why don't you consider

552
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,850
some other hobbies?

553
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:40,810
After all, your singing

554
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,230
is truly annoying.

555
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,850
Who is annoyed?

556
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,630
I'm the annoyed one, okay?

557
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,650
Listen.

558
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,010
What drives me up the wall is

559
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,830
he caused harm to Er Miao!

560
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,870
Did you feed it raw meat?

561
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Yes.

562
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,800
It doesn't eat raw meat.

563
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,770
That's why it's yearning it. Am I right?

564
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,920
Of course.

565
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,110
I love meat. Especially ones like you.

566
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,110
Spend the rest of your life with him.

567
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,350
Spend the rest of your life with me.

568
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,930
Okay?

569
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,630
Sure.

570
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,270
You're a pervert cat!

571
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,900
Spend the rest of your life with me.

572
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,330
I'm dying.

573
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,040
You brought a female cat home.

574
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,570
If it's a male cat,

575
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,750
it would be following you around.

576
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,390
I'm so irritated.
How could you still laughing at me?

577
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,010
What is so irritating?

578
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,470
You didn't sell yourself to him.

579
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,930
If you can't put up with him,
just move out.

580
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,640
It's easy to say.

581
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,420
Moving out

582
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,350
means looking for a house
and redecorating the place.

583
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,460
I don't have the time.

584
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,430
Ladies, do you like the bed?

585
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,520
Thank you.

586
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,440
By the way, is your landlord

587
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,830
really so annoying?
Doesn't he have some plus points?

588
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,590
He's not really annoying.

589
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,790
He's just strange.

590
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,050
Speaking about plus points,

591
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,920
the training camp that he's in
is quite near to the hospital.

592
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,360
There were a few occasions
where he stayed at home

593
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,670
and he let me hitch a ride
to the hospital the next day.

594
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,540
Compared to most guys,

595
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,080
he's quite tidy and neat.

596
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,710
He is hygienic.

597
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,400
He always makes his bed.

598
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,020
It's as if no one has slept on it.

599
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,060
Furthermore...

600
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,720
What?

601
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,400
Come in.

602
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,080
Liang Mu Ze.

603
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,180
What's wrong?

604
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,070
Well...

605
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,660
I heard noises
coming from the living hall.

606
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,390
Can't you hear that?

607
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:26,930
No.

608
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,220
I think I must have heard it wrongly.

609
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,100
Well...

610
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,450
There are thunders and lightnings.

611
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,430
It's quite loud.

612
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,130
Are you scared?

613
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm not scared.

614
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,510
I'm a little scared.

615
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,660
Forget it.

616
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm going back to my room.

617
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,800
Let's go to the living room.

618
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,110
I can't sleep anyway.

619
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,370
Liang Mu Ze.

620
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,390
Are you having insomnia again?

621
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,170
If you can't fall asleep,

622
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,960
you can try meditation.

623
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,160
Firstly,

624
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,370
close your eyes.

625
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,890
Relax your body.

626
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,310
Then, starting counting.

627
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:53,220
One, two, three, four, five.

628
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,990
Inhale.

629
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,230
Count to five.

630
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,450
Exhale.

631
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,820
Inhale.

632
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,220
Exhale.

633
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,240
No matter what,

634
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,000
ever since we share a house,

635
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,370
my mum doesn't have to worry

636
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,550
about my safety anymore.

637
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,870
In that case,

638
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,590
he's not completely useless.

639
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,170
Then why are you picking on him?

640
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,490
Please know your position.

641
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,610
He's your landlord.

642
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,910
He's not your husband.

643
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,330
As long as
he doesn't install a hidden camera

644
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,490
to peek on you

645
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,250
or doesn't sell his house away,

646
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,980
all the other things
are not important.

647
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,570
Of course.

648
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,550
If you plan to move in with him,

649
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,900
then we shall adjust the standards.

650
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,330
I don't plan to move in with him.

651
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,530
Do you know?

652
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,600
Everything that you just complained

653
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,870
sounded as if both of you
are a little couple

654
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,380
trying to get along with each other.

655
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

656
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,970
It's quite good actually.

657
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,690
At least you have someone
to pick fight with at home.

658
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,070
You guys can take care of each other too.

659
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,720
It's better than living alone like me.

660
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,360
[Mr Zhuo is back in the office.]

661
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,770
[He wants to have dinner
with you tonight.]

662
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,830
I have to go.

663
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,070
Why are you in a rush?

664
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,000
Slow down.
