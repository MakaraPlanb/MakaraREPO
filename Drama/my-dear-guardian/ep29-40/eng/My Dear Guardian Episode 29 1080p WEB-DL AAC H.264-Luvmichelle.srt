[Episode 29]

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,009
Go and get a CT scan.

5
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,060
You might get the result
in the morning at the soonest.

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,180
Okay, thanks, doctor.

7
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,229
Doctor.

8
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,130
Why did you push me?

9
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm letting the doctor see my scans.

10
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,680
Well, get in line.

11
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,170
It's my turn.

12
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,670
Sir, wait outside.

13
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,820
After I'm done with him,

14
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,010
I'll talk to you.

15
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,990
Heard that?

16
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,400
The doctor told you to wait outside.

17
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,280
Doctor,

18
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,789
Director Yue introduced me
to come see you.

19
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,419
Who cares who introduced you?

20
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,210
I could say the hospital dean
introduced me.

21
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,160
Watch what you say, mister.

22
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,720
Are you a civilised human?

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,790
Are you even human?

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,670
What's this ruckus? Stop arguing!

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,100
Get out of here if you want to argue.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,630
Doctor!

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,500
Please get me a number.

28
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,390
Are you the patient?

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,579
The patient is outside.

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,579
Get them in.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,829
I can't. They can't walk.

32
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,660
I said, get the patient in here!

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,720
If they don't come in,

34
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,480
how am I supposed to check?

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,120
Argue here and there!

36
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,579
What is there to argue?

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,860
Doctor, are you okay?

38
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,960
Dr Zhang...

39
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,010
Doctor.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,060
You have a nose bleed, doc.

41
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,940
A nose bleed.

42
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,670
Don't just stand there. Get help!

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,079
-Doctor.
-Dr Zhang.

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,620
Shut up.

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,090
Get help!

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,710
I'm a military man.

47
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,900
I won't give up.

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,270
Chen Meng Zhen.

49
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,060
I won't give up on you.

Meng Zhen.

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,860
Is it about Zhang Yi Chi?

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,680
I can't stay put.

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,000
Who are you kidding?

56
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,150
I still have to do my rounds.

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,200
I need to operate.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Patients are waiting for me to save them.

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,200
-You people are interrupting my work.
-Son!

60
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,310
Yi Chi, your condition is serious!

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,430
You need to rest.

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,950
-You hear me?
-That's right, son.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,829
Listen to the doctor.

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,150
Take the medication first.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
Listen to the doctor.

66
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,120
I am a doctor.

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,260
I'm the chief physician.

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,550
I believe in science.

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,280
I only believe in hard data.

70
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,310
What illness do I have?

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,230
You have acute hepatitis.

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,829
Acute hepatitis?

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,030
You must be kidding me.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
Do you know what the symptoms are
for acute hepatitis?

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,070
Will a person with acute hepatitis
be as calm as me?

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,990
Acute hepatitis causes one
to lose judgement,

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,310
to be easily agitated!

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
They won't be able to think clearly.

79
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,070
The skin turns yellow.
Yellow like jaundice.

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,180
Do I look yellow?

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,200
-Is my face yellow?
-Take a look yourself.

82
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,110
Am I yellow? Am I?

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,540
Take a good look. I'm...

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,829
The mirror is yellow!

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,140
-Yi Chi.
-Son!

86
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,530
Ms Meng Zhen.

87
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,760
How is he?

88
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,220
He's not doing very well.

89
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,240
Dr Zhang cut himself during an operation

90
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,440
and was infected with Hepatitis B.

91
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,230
Despite getting an immunoglobulin shot
right after,

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,909
the virus is too toxic

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,100
and it caused the onset of severe
acute hepatitis just now.

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,630
There are signs of hepatic encephalopathy

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,830
and bleeding.

96
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,750
He's not thinking straight

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,500
and keeps resisting our help.

98
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,420
What do you need me to do?

99
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,470
Try and keep him calm.

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,940
Make him work with us.

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,500
Alright.

102
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,830
Will I be able to?

103
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,030
Of course.

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,320
When we were administering emergency care,

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
he kept calling your name.

106
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,990
Compared to others,

107
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm sure he's more willing
to listen to you.

108
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,540
That's why I asked Liang Mu Ze
to go and get you.

109
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,230
Okay, I understand.

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,990
-Let's go.
-Okay.

111
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
Yi Chi, you're now the patient.

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,910
You need to quiet down.
Don't get agitated!

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,970
-Dr Zhang.
-Dr Zhang!

114
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,500
You can't stop me.

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,670
I don't want this.

116
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,230
Stop holding me down.

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,460
Mr Zhang.

118
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,390
Look who's here.

119
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,650
Who asked you to come?

120
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,190
Xia Chu, get her out of here.

121
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,830
This is an infectious zone.

122
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,500
You, get out!

123
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,659
I'll keep you company.

124
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,620
I'll help you get treated.

125
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,850
No need to be scared.

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,700
I'm not scared.

127
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,100
I'll stay with you.

128
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
Lie down.

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
Yi Chi, listen to her.

130
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,630
Lie down.

131
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,020
Sir.

132
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,430
Do you have any other input

133
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,370
regarding Yi Chi's treatment?

134
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,450
No.

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
Well,

136
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,600
I've stopped practising a long time ago.

137
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,360
Besides,

138
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,200
internal medicine isn't my expertise.

139
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,950
We'll do as you see fit, all right?

140
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,260
Meng Zhen is here.

141
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,080
What about Xiao Jun?

142
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,430
He's with a neighbour.

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,130
He knows Dr Zhang is sick.

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,880
He told the mum

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,420
that he'll be good

146
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,930
and that he can take care of himself.

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,340
A mature boy.

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,909
When will Yi Chi

149
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,659
be able to wake up?

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,750
I don't know.

151
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,830
Acute hepatitis

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,190
has a survivability rate

153
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,140
of 50 to 70 percent.

154
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,390
Right now, we're using an artificial liver

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,750
to get rid of the toxins in his blood.

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
Currently, this is
the most effective method

157
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,270
to treat acute hepatitis.

158
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
But...

159
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,510
But what?

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
Each time, 50 percent of his plasma

161
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,660
has to be removed.

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,540
This means that

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,100
a series of allergic reactions

164
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,250
and potential risk of infection

165
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,880
are highly likely.

Wait here.

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,060
Assistance from
the Special Forces Brigade.

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Rao Feng.

192
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,100
Captain of the Criminal Investigation
Division of Public Security Bureau.

193
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,020
An experienced officer on fieldwork.

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,300
He's currently in charge
of the task force.

195
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,140
Good day, sir.

196
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,350
You've read the materials?

197
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,660
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,660
I also did some extra research.

199
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,670
On what?

200
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,630
Reporting.

201
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,550
Triad rituals and social network.

202
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,950
From now on,

203
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,270
you may skip the 'reporting'
when speaking.

204
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,020
Yes, sir.

205
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,240
No need for the 'yes, sirs' too.

206
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,100
Where's your hometown?

207
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,390
I don't know.

208
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm an orphan.

209
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,100
I grew up in an orphanage.

210
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,530
Are you married?

211
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,500
No.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,990
A girlfriend?

213
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,830
Do you have one?

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
No.

215
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,910
The bait we left

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,310
on the City of Desire

217
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,020
has gotten a response.

218
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,110
The Scary Pirate

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,300
has accepted our proposal for a deal.

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,790
We've confirmed a date and venue.

221
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,110
Bear in mind.

222
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,950
The goal of this operation

223
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,190
is not an arrest.

224
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,600
It is to assist our internal operations

225
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,600
set the trap.

226
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,490
to determine

227
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,560
Scary Pirate's real identity

228
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,710
and find the mastermind
behind the ID,

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,750
Old Master.

230
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,630
Any questions?

231
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,960
No.

232
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,930
Yes.

233
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,580
I'd like a smartphone.

234
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,840
I'm so tired.

235
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,460
I shouldn't have come back with you.

236
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,670
I didn't ask you to come back.

237
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,350
You yourself didn't want
to go to the unit.

238
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,590
If Tian Yong isn't there,

239
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,340
there's no point for me to stay there.

240
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,430
By the way, Tian Yong
was shot, right?

241
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,670
How is he now?

242
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,990
Did he get it checked?

243
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
He hasn't been going to the hospital.

244
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,860
He wouldn't answer my calls too.

245
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,440
Has he gone back to the unit?

246
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,760
Is there a new mission?

247
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,880
Can't you call him

248
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,390
and help me get in touch?

249
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,640
Just worry about yourself.

250
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,040
Don't bother Tian Yong unnecessarily.

251
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,850
When did I bother him?

252
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,570
I'm just concerned about him.

253
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,220
When are you going back to the US?

254
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm not.

255
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,140
Xiao Xue.

256
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,020
The explosion that happened

257
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,740
isn't as simple as it seemed.

258
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,860
The culprit dared
to do something so brazen.

259
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,530
It means they're prepared.

260
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,690
You get it?

261
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,880
Although the neighbourhood
is now under police watch,

262
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,110
but as long as you're here,

263
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,540
your dad must be worried.

264
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,160
So tell me where Tian Yong is.

265
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,110
I'll go to him.

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,750
No.

267
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Why?

268
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,120
What why?

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,920
Why should you go to him?

270
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm his girlfriend.

271
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,040
Has Tian Yong accepted you?

272
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,550
His girlfriend?

273
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,280
You're just a girl.

274
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,480
You can't decide on your own.

275
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,030
Well, has Xia Chu accepted you?

276
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,750
You're also pestering her.

277
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
Who said Xia Chu hasn't accepted me?

278
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,280
No need to pretend. I know the truth.

279
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,840
You two aren't really together.

280
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,540
You're just putting on a show for Aunt.

281
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,040
You guys live in one house

282
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,870
but sleep in separate rooms.

283
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
There's no tension either because
you're useless

284
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,740
or she's sick.

285
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,010
Listen up, Liang Shao Xue.

286
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
There are many types of love.

287
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,740
For Xia Chu and I,

288
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,920
we are...

289
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,020
the kind that love

290
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,410
with reason.

291
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,720
Well, Tian Yong and I are

292
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,830
the kind that doesn't need proclamation
to act on it.

293
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
He doesn't have to admit it.

294
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,430
I know I'm in his heart.

295
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,520
Where do you get the confidence from?

296
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
You're not

297
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,350
What's the matter with you?

298
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,310
Your love is real love,

299
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,390
but mine isn't?

300
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,880
It's my love, my feelings.
It doesn't concern you.

301
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,240
If you won't stop putting me down,

302
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,640
I might just tell Aunt

303
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,230
about your fake relationship.

304
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,110
I dare you to try.

305
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,590
I will. Try me.

306
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,030
Where are you going?

307
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,070
To the hospital.

308
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,660
Dr Zhang.

309
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,750
It's okay.

310
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,620
What do you need, Dr Zhang?

311
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,260
I want to check on the patients.

312
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,120
Dr Zhang, in your condition,

313
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,260
I don't think it's a good idea.

314
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,220
Don't worry.

315
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,180
I'll be careful.

316
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,470
I'll keep my distance.

317
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,460
What?

318
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,670
Face mask.

319
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,900
Here.

320
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,850
Okay.

321
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,200
Thanks.

322
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,860
Hello, Dr Zhang.

323
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,410
Is the director here?

324
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,470
Go and get him, quick!

325
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,300
Bed 21's patient's heart has stopped!

326
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,380
What's the situation?

327
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,550
Dr Zhang.

328
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,880
Doctor, he's in critical condition.

329
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,880
I've pressed the alarm.

330
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,460
Director Chen should be here.

331
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,220
Where do you feel unwell?

332
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm having shortness of breath.

333
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,060
The pressing is making it worse.

334
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,860
Stop pressing.

335
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,040
I can't stop, sir.

336
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,480
His heart will stop if I stop.

337
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,790
Listen to me and stop pressing.

338
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,400
You see this?

339
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,580
The electrode sheet fell off.

340
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,619
Okay, keep calm.

341
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,660
Relax.

342
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,920
You're okay.

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,880
Okay.

344
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,260
The signal is back, right?

345
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,710
I... I thought...

346
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,250
Sorry, doctor.

347
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,230
Don't be so absent-minded next time.

348
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,589
Yes, sir.

349
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,560
Okay.

350
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,580
Everything is fine.

351
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,630
I remember you.

352
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
You're the doctor with acute hepatitis.

353
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,870
What are you doing in our ward?

354
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,500
Acute hepatitis?

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,950
Hear me out.

356
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,230
Stay away from me!

357
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,040
Don't come close!

358
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,260
Is that true?

359
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,750
-Yes, it's him.
-Don't worry.

360
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,540
Don't come near. Stay away!

361
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,170
Stay away!

362
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,260
Don't come near.

363
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Xia Chu.

364
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,590
Ms Meng Zhen.

365
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,140
Yi Chi is missing.

366
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,830
Isn't he in the room?

367
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
I fell asleep.

368
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,750
He was gone when I woke up.

369
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,830
Don't be alarmed.

370
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,230
Dr Zhang is in

371
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,350
a stable condition.

372
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,950
He should be all right.

373
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,940
He probably stepped out
for some fresh air.

374
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,900
Xia Chu.

375
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,540
What is it?

376
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,360
Dr Zhang is in a bit of trouble
at the cardiovascular ward.

377
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,300
Director Chen wanted me to come get you.

378
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,140
Let's go there.

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,990
Director Chen.

380
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,350
We are sick people.

381
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
Our immunity

382
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,030
is at its weakest.

383
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,710
How could he simply enter
our ward like that?

384
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,780
What if we got infected?

385
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,710
He has Hepatitis B.

386
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,640
That's an incurable disease!

387
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,180
Don't you know that?

388
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
Now, now. Please calm down
and let me speak.

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,830
Yes, Dr Zhang did

390
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,710
contract the hepatitis virus

391
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,740
during an operation.

392
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,400
But after receiving treatment,

393
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,110
all of his vital signs

394
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,430
have returned to normal.

395
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,830
So you guys need not worry.

396
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,750
Moreover,

397
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,390
Hepatitis B is usually spread through...

398
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,700
No need for the useless explanation.

399
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,110
Once you have Hepatitis B,

400
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,420
there's no way to remain normal.

401
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,940
We need to trust in science.

402
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
Are you speaking for him

403
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,390
because you're a doctor too?

404
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,080
Not at all.

405
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,650
You should be thinking about the patients.

406
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,110
You have to be responsible
for our health and safety.

407
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
Yes, okay.

408
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,340
But we must have faith in science, no?

409
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,350
Just now, his spit

410
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
got onto me.

411
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,780
What if I contracted Hepatitis B?

412
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,870
Listen, don't worry.
His vitals are back to normal.

413
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,100
-Stop it!
-All right?

414
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
Sirs.

415
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,910
I think you're mistaken.

416
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Dr Zhang contracted Hepatitis B.

417
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,320
It doesn't make him a monster.

418
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,480
He went to the ward to treat patients,

419
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,070
not to spread the virus
to you and harm you.

420
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,710
If such simple contact

421
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
meant quarantine,

422
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,470
then my advice to you

423
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,370
is to just stay at home and
never go outside.

424
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,670
Or else you might get
into an accident on the road,

425
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,990
or get smashed to death
by a falling billboard.

426
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,240
The possibility of that

427
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,950
is higher than your chances
of getting infected by Dr Zhang.

428
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,590
Whatever!

429
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,550
You can stop your nonsense!

430
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,030
You guys are clearly accomplices.

431
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,030
You probably have Hepatitis B too.

432
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,100
Stay away from me!

433
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,080
What?

434
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,110
I'm going to sue you.

435
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,070
I'm going to sue you!

436
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,620
I'll get your license revoked!

437
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,670
Shut up!

438
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,140
Are you finished?

439
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,280
The doctor hit me!

440
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,990
The doctor hit me!

441
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,480
The doctor hit me!

442
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,940
Get lost with your nonsense!

443
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,820
You heard me?

444
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,790
They're doctors but I'm not.

445
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,660
One more word and I'll kick you out!

446
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,020
That patient

447
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,190
has been quite a handful.

448
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,750
Every time he's here for a check-up,
he wouldn't let resident doctors near him.

449
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,620
He always thinks the staff
are up to no good.

450
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,030
So the way he acted today

451
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,760
wasn't targetted at you specifically.

452
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,830
It was more

453
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,300
a purging of his emotions.

454
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,180
So don't take it personally.

455
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,020
No need to feel bad.

456
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,810
We should focus on your recovery instead.

457
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,900
Sir, can I still go back to operating?

458
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,620
With the proper treatment,

459
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,990
if the surface antigen
and E antigen are negative,

460
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,260
it means

461
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,930
there isn't inflammation
or infectiousness.

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,940
Then of course you can.

463
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,590
What if something like today

464
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,780
happens again?

465
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,870
Do patients know what E antigen is??

466
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,990
Or surface antigen?

467
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,540
Will they be able to trust me again?

468
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,500
Look.

469
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,740
Aside from cardiac surgery,

470
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,460
the hospital has the
administrative department.

471
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,030
I always believe that

472
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,200
a doctor's worth

473
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,950
isn't tied solely to doing surgery.

474
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,080
Right?

475
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,050
They can also...

476
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,940
You know I love the feeling
of holding the scalpel.

477
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,700
Straightforward.

478
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,180
Accurate.

479
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,070
Using the most direct way
to solve a problem.

480
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,150
Following a clear direction.

481
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,790
Be it good or bad,

482
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,020
there's always an answer at the end.

483
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,190
It's within my own control.

484
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,220
Of course,

485
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,840
the administrative department

486
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,180
plays an important role too.

487
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,740
But it's not what I want to do.

488
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,780
If it comes down to that,

489
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,540
I'd rather leave.

490
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,380
What are you talking about?

491
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,470
With the way you are now,

492
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,740
aside from the hospital,

493
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,710
where else can you get a similar job?

494
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,510
To me,

495
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,910
the doctor's coat

496
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,020
and the military uniform underneath

497
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,750
are not only

498
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,220
a representation of a job.

499
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,650
I mean it.

500
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,590
It's my fault.

501
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,540
I shouldn't have slept so soundly.

502
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,540
Ms Meng Zhen,

503
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,940
don't say that.

504
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,430
Nobody expected

505
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,940
such a thing to happen.

506
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,460
Life is unpredictable.

507
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,900
Zhang Yi Chi went to see me
at the book store recently.

508
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,140
He sort of confessed his feelings to me.

509
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,780
But I turned him down.

510
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,670
Because I felt that it would be too hard

511
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,510
for us to be together.

512
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,750
Thinking back now,

513
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,520
aside from death,

514
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,260
what else matters?

515
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,260
What can be more important?

516
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,350
Sometimes in life,

517
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,320
we should really be more upfront
with ourselves.

518
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,260
Otherwise, you'd unknowingly

519
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,620
leave behind a whole bunch of regrets.

520
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,110
Ms Chen.

521
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,020
Uncle, aunty.

522
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,340
You went through an ordeal.

523
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,460
It's nothing.

524
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,100
Where is Zhang Yi Chi?

525
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,350
Director Chen is having a word with him.

526
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,830
I'll go find him.

527
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
Doctor Li.

528
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,660
I think you shouldn't go.

529
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,540
Let's wait for him here.

530
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,440
Right, we should wait for him here.

531
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,110
Yi Chi.

532
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,860
Yi Chi, how are you?

533
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,500
I'm fine, Mum.

534
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,230
-I'm going to be discharged.
-What? No.

535
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,640
Yi Chi, don't be hasty.

536
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,980
You've just recovered.

537
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,800
You should be monitored a while more.

538
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,820
No need.

539
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,720
I want to go home.

540
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,030
Yi Chi.

541
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,260
Zhang Yi Chi.

542
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,740
Mr Zhang, Mrs Zhang.

543
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm truly sorry about what happened.

544
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,910
It's fine.

545
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,150
Director Chen,

546
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,590
we'd like to talk to

547
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,260
Yi Chi's supervising doctor.

548
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,510
Is that okay?

549
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,850
Sure, I'll arrange for it.

550
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,840
Okay.

551
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,300
Xia Chu.

552
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,620
You were the first doctor
to treat Dr Zhang.

553
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,670
Tag along.

554
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,780
Okay.

555
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,700
Meng Zhen.

556
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,180
Mu Ze.

557
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,400
Please go and buy some food for him.

558
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,300
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

559
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,100
Okay.

560
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,910
I was on leave for personal reasons.

561
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,590
I only just heard what happened.

562
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,790
What did I tell you?

563
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,400
If you had listened,

564
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,920
and waited for his test results

565
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,240
before you did the operation,

566
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,350
you wouldn't be in this situation now.

567
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,550
Now what.

568
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,680
You failed to save the patient

569
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,140
and put your health in jeopardy.

570
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,230
What was that for?

571
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,460
Nothing.

572
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,980
I'm just stupid.

573
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,870
Okay?

574
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,980
Yes, you're stupid.

575
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,020
I've told you many times.

576
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,280
A doctor

577
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,540
is just a profession after all.

578
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,140
You're not god.

579
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,920
Don't put all your hopes

580
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,310
on being able to change
the scheme of things.

581
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,570
Towards patients,

582
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,420
we can do our best to save them.

583
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,150
But we don't have to risk our lives.

584
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,100
Ms Li Juan.

585
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Do you remember when
we were in our second year

586
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,660
and had our first dissection lesson?

587
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,020
What did Dr Su write on the blackboard?

588
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,890
What?

589
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,020
Those who don't know the past and present

590
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,780
and don't understand heaven and humanity

591
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,060
will not attain immortal skills

592
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,860
or the heart of Buddha.

593
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,060
Better to focus on working the land
and weaving to make a living

594
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,460
than to partake in medical care

595
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,210
and cause trouble.

596
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,740
Any recollection?

597
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,020
None.

598
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,390
Did he write that?

599
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,460
Yes.

600
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,190
You forgot.

601
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,660
You're right.

602
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,080
I am not god.

603
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,120
I even made

604
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,230
such a rudimentary mistake
during an operation.

605
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,220
I am not a good doctor, even.

606
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,690
The reason why I give my all

607
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,060
not because I wish to change
the circumstance

608
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,350
with my own power.

609
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,140
It's because I rather not
be easily influenced by the surrounding.

610
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,420
That's all.

611
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,620
What about now?

612
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,800
Do you still think so?

613
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,770
Of course.

614
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,340
And it isn't just me.

615
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,500
I got the permit.

616
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,990
Really?

617
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,190
That's good news.

618
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,980
Your dream is finally coming true.

619
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,280
Congrats.

620
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,440
If you want me to stay,

621
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,780
I'd consider it.

622
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,160
Even though I don't like

623
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,030
changing my plans for others,

624
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,440
but you're an exception.

625
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,790
I'm willing to do it for you.

626
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,620
As long as you're willing.

627
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,760
Li Juan.

628
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,180
I'm sincerely wishing you the best.

629
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,100
You are finally able

630
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,740
go to where you want,

631
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,620
do what you love.

632
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,520
I'm happy for you.

633
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,830
You take care.

634
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:04,660
♫ The best would be mutual affection,
having good feelings, hiding nothing ♫

635
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,720
♫ The best would be not answering,
anticipating, avoiding misery ♫

636
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:21,120
♫ Whether we argue or show love,
it does not matter ♫

637
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,540
You too.

638
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,080
I will.

639
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,780
Take care.

640
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,700
Take care.

641
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,650
♫ The best would be
being on the same page ♫

642
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,510
♫ Occasionally romantic,
impervious to joy and sorrow ♫

643
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,300
♫ The best would be
getting along naturally ♫

644
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,000
♫ Sometimes curious, wanting
to learn about the word ♫

645
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:47,180
♫ Perhaps real happiness
is simple after all ♫

646
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,300
Chen Meng Zhen.

647
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,920
Do you have a minute?

648
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,180
I'd like a chat.

649
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,020
Come to my office.

650
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,990
Done packing?

651
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,800
You're here.

652
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,420
Meng Zhen asked me to get you porridge.

653
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,280
Where is she?

654
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,660
She went down to get some air.

655
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,900
Thank you.

656
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,420
What are you

657
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,100
planning to do now?

658
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,740
If this had happened

659
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,060
before I became ill,

660
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,260
I wouldn't care about her stance.

661
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,990
I'd press on.

662
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,220
But now...

663
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,760
Now you have a chance
to correct things, right?

664
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,460
We should always look at the bright side.

665
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,580
Do you know the consequences
of this illness?

666
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,700
Thanks.

667
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,000
I heard for the past days,

668
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,600
you had been the one looking after him.

669
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,570
Yes.

670
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,460
Back when you brought your son
here to seek treatment,

671
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,180
I never thought that

672
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,300
Zhang Yi Chi and you
would have an episode.

673
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,680
Do you think his parents
would accept you?

674
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,370
I get it.

675
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,750
For a single parent,

676
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,830
his career

677
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,340
and family background

678
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,740
are quite the draw.

679
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,980
Normally,

680
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,180
a person's judgement on others

681
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,270
directly reflect their own

682
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,700
inner thoughts.

683
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,240
Do you know my relationship with him?

684
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,220
I only care about
my relationship with him.

685
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,440
I must say you're more impressive

686
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,940
than I thought.

687
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,550
Zhang Yi Chi and I were together
for 10 years.

688
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,700
Aside from not having
a marriage certificate,

689
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,870
we were as good as a married couple.

690
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,620
No matter who ends up with him
in the future,

691
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,350
they will certainly find traces of me

692
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,390
on him.

693
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,250
It was I

694
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,620
who moulded him into who he is.

695
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,080
You were together for 10 years

696
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,170
but still ended up separating.

697
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,260
Aside from lack of love,

698
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,820
I can't think of any other reason.

699
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,060
He has Hepatitis B now.

700
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,180
Do you know what that means?

701
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,090
I mustn't be fatigued.

702
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,510
I have to always be careful

703
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,230
about my physical health.

704
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,310
Currently,

705
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,910
treatment of Hepatitis B
is much better than before.

706
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,850
But if it turns into chronic hepatitis,

707
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,400
that will be the end
of my clinical practice.

708
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,710
I have no idea what else I could do.

709
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,620
I'm afraid.

710
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,180
Dr Li.

711
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,820
You know what?

712
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,100
I've been the family of a soldier.

713
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,940
Do you know what being
a soldier's family entails?

714
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,740
No companionship,

715
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,100
no assurance.

716
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,100
No matter what happens,

717
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,840
you are alone in facing

718
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,060
whatever life throws at you.

719
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,120
From the moment I married a soldier,

720
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,960
until eight years after his demise,

721
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,179
I've been taking care of Xiao Jun alone.

722
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,290
Till I met Dr Zhang

723
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,639
and we had an episode.

724
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,030
Maybe in your eyes,

725
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,780
I have no strong suit.

726
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,900
But at least

727
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,870
I have what it takes

728
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,460
to take on whatever outcome
this episode gives me.

729
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,830
Be it love or separation,

730
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,219
joy or sorrow,

731
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,659
this is what I've decided.

732
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,780
I will not regret it

733
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,620
or be afraid.

734
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,700
I think I know

735
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,830
why it's you.

736
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,540
I'll go now, Dr Li.

737
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,380
Put it his way, buddy.

738
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,430
If it was you,

739
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,860
what would you do?

740
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,880
Knowing full well

741
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,350
that you can't give your all

742
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,820
in carrying out your duty
as a husband.

743
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,280
For instance, these dishes

744
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,140
might turn bad at any moment.

745
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,300
Will you still claim a free life

746
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,850
in the name of love?

747
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,420
I can't.

748
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,480
Thank you, Dr Hu.

749
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,120
Thank you.

750
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,550
Not at all. It's our duty.

751
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,670
Mr Zhang, don't worry too much.

752
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,990
Yi Chi is still young.

753
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,520
He has good bones.

754
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,340
Make sure he gets enough rest
when he gets back.

755
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,950
The condition shouldn't affect

756
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,790
his life and work too much.

757
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,490
How could it not?

758
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,180
Alright, now.

759
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,970
Let the doctors get back to work.

760
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm going to the Inpatient Department

761
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,850
to process the discharge.

762
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,730
Go an check on Yi Chi at the ward.

763
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,730
Okay, we'll go now.

764
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,260
I'll accompany you.

765
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,260
Okay, thanks.

766
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,030
Goodbye.

767
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,340
I'm off, Director Chen.

768
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,540
Dr Zhang

769
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,010
is an only son, right?

770
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,380
Xia Chu.

771
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,020
What is it, sir?

772
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,540
Do you want to go back
to Cardiac Surgery?

773
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,040
Yi Chi told me that

774
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,240
you're one of

775
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,110
the best resident doctors
under his mentorship.

776
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,680
If you wish to return,

777
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,140
I can arrange it with ER.

778
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,710
What about Dr Zhang?

779
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,030
Is he coming back?

780
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,870
He...

781
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,920
He will be transferred to
the medical school to teach.

782
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,270
Think it over.

783
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,700
Tell me your decision later.

784
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,470
Aunty.

785
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,160
You came to get Dr Zhang?

786
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,580
Can he go home?

787
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,340
Yes.

788
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,110
Thanks a lot,

789
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,690
for the past few days.

790
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,780
Thank goodness for your company.

791
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,970
Otherwise, Yi Chi's treatment

792
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,380
couldn't have gone so well.

793
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,380
Previously,

794
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,140
regarding you two's relationship,

795
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,340
I admit

796
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,860
that I was against it.

797
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,400
I believed that in terms of credentials,

798
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,500
you two weren't compatible.

799
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,660
I was afraid...

800
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,620
I was afraid that
you were in it for something.

801
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,220
I'm sorry, Ms Chen.

802
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,620
I was wrong.

803
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,110
You're not wrong, aunty.

804
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,010
I am in it for something.

805
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,270
I am after him.

806
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,430
His intelligence,

807
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,980
his humour.

808
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,350
His bright and calm demeanour.

809
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,200
If my admiration for him
comes across

810
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,320
as a selfish desire in your eyes,

811
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,540
I admit it.

812
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,360
But frankly speaking, isn't love

813
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,500
a form of desire anyway?

814
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,690
So are you

815
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,530
still...

816
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,150
I'm not thinking so far.

817
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,390
I just want to take care of him.

818
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,000
Consider it as repaying him

819
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,460
for saving my son.

820
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,630
Don't say that.

821
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,210
Let's be real.

822
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,810
A doctor is responsible for the patient.

823
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,920
The patient's family has no responsibility

824
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,920
towards the doctor.

825
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,220
You don't owe me anything.

826
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,820
No need to repay.

827
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,330
I'm not asking for it either.

828

Does anyone know

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,700
what those three are?

First happiness.

Have nothing to be ashamed of
