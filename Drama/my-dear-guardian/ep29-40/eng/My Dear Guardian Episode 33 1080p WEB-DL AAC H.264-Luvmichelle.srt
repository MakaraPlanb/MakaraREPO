[Episode 33]

4
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,910
How long do we have to wait?

5
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,110
Is it that hard to find
the building's information?

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,070
This structure was built by

7
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,350
the Chinese government.

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,509
It's for helping people
who are poor and have no money,

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,870
and then after a few years,

10
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,180
all files and all investments,

11
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,390
international investments are pulled,

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,470
and then this structure is frozen.

13
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,500
How about now?

14
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,100
Now, we need to find people
who know about this situation

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,310
and try to help us
make this great plan.

16
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,060
My father will be dead

17
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,630
before you finish planning!

18
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,140
Calm down! Calm down!

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,630
Hello.

20
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,270
What is it?

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,190
Okay, okay.

22
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,829
Now, we have good news.

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,300
In ten minutes, Officer Chen

24
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,870
from the Chinese government
will be coming,

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,350
and he has what we need.

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,310
Have a seat.

27
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,510
It's hard to get these blueprints.

28
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,140
It's a young officer named Liang Mu Ze,

29
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,270
who accidentally found

30
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,060
that the Corps of Engineers of his unit

31
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,980
was involved in

32
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,350
the construction of this structure when

33
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,430
they came to Isaia for a
peace operation a few years ago.

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,100
He insisted on digging out

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,670
the information about
the structure's construction

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,350
of the Corps of Engineer
from the mountain of papers.

37
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,990
But the blueprints were incomplete.

38
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,950
So

39
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,300
he spent time and found an

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,870
old soldier who's soon retired.

41
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,350
The soldier experienced the
reconstruction back then.

42
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,270
He helped Liang Mu Ze to

43
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,030
redraw the missing parts of the map.

44
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,110
He didn't tell you about this

45
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,590
in advance because

46
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,829
he was afraid that

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,270
you'd be disappointed

48
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,390
if no result was found.

49
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,110
He could've passed you

50
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,910
these blueprints by himself but

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,750
it'll gain more attention

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,750
from the police

53
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,950
of Isaia if it's submitted by me.

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,829
Thanks.

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,950
Thank you.

56
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,540
The embassy

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,430
has been closely following
the developments.

58
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,820
We'll try our best to

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,230
push them to act fast and

60

rescue your father

61

as well as solve the case.

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,910
You need to learn patience too,

63
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,630
do not panic.

64
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,310
Okay.

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,230
Where are you taking me?

66
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,870

67
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,070

Mahadi told me that

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,550

you've done for us.]

Then when are

76
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,590
you going to come back?

77
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,390
After taking care of
Tang Lin's funeral.

78
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,390
Who is Tang Lin?

lured my father to Isaia.]

He's fine.

86

He's currently cooperating with
the local police investigations.

87
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
I can see him tomorrow.

88
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,710
Okay, then.

89
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,990
Get some rest today.

90
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,230
We'll talk about it when you get back.

91

[Relationship status report]

94
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,230
I thought

95
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,550
I would never see you again.

96
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,310
Are you all right?

97

Nothing.

108
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,990

Have you come around?

122

Yes.

123
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,270
Redeployment is a problem

124
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,830
but it's hard to meet the right person.

125
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,110
I don't want to miss her.

126
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,910
But Xia Chu's father is the

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,180
major problem now,

128
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,230
not your redeployment.

129
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,860
Isaia police have found out that

130
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,990
her father was being framed.

131
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,070
But the matter of him
leaking information

132
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,790
has yet to be determined.

133
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,990
Leaking information?

134
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,750
He used his personal mailbox

135
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,190
to discuss work
with his assistant,

136
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,990
causing the leakage of information.

137
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,540
Now the Institute of Chemistry

138
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,150
has initiated the investigation.

139
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,390
There was no final outcome

140
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,790
before he went to Isaia.

141

What are you trying to say?

142
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,630
Okay.

143
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,710
Okay.

144
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,750
Stop pretending with me.

145
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,380
I know you must be

146
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,670
feeling bad now.

147
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,870
I was your age once.

148
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,820
I can see

149
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,350
you're currently very
confused about this.

150
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,550
You're mostly thinking

151
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,830
that you, as a soldier,

152
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,390
can't protect the one you love,

153
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,460
can't give her a decent family,

154
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,510
can't show up when
she needs you the most.

155
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,540
You must be very torn,

156
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,590
and very wrong.

157
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,580
Report!

158
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,550
Haven't you had this
kind of feeling before?

159
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,270
Liang Mu Ze,

160
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,980
the words that I'm about to say,

161
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,590
I'm saying them as a brother and

162
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,820
an old soldier instead of

163
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,430
as a Brigade Commander.

164
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,910
Let me tell you,

165
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,990
you and I

166
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,230
are professional soldiers.

167
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,830
Since we choose to put this uniform on,

168
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,350
we have to shoulder the
responsibility as soldiers.

169
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,950
Everything is non-negotiable

170
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,830
in front of the national interest.

171
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,910
What is professional

172
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,350
to a soldier?

173
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,510
This is professional.

174
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,510
I understand.

175
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,670
If there's nothing else,

176
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,390
I'll head back first.

177
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,550
Come back here.

178
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,270
You're being surly.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,910
I know

180
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,350
you still have a knot in your heart.

181
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,830
How about this?

182
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,910
I'll allow you to take a half day off.

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,470
Just go to the hospital.

184
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,900
And

185
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,190
submit your relationship status report
to the Special Branch for approval.

186
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,070
Adjust your form and

187
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,230
report to me!

188
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,470
Thank you, Brigade Commander!

189
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,030
This brat!

190
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,350
Stay for a few more days.

191
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,460
At least

192
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,270
wait until we obtain the
result of the medical checkup.

193
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,660
You're lying.

194
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,310
You didn't want me to stay here.

195
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,070
How am I lying?

196
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,790
I have to hurry back.

197
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,540
Your mother must've missed me

198
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,030
since I've left home for days.

199
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,470
I already called Ms Lan.

200
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,220
She said

201
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,980
just take your time.

202
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,990
Girl, I can't stay.

203
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,310
I miss your mother too.

204
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,470
Someone fainted!

205
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,020
Step aside! Step aside!

206
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,350
Don't touch her!

207
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,070
Go get the transfer bed.

208
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,420
Uncle Xia,

209
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,550
have you finished the medical checkup?

210
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,950
Yes, I have.

211
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,390
I'm here for Xia Chu.

212
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,670
She

213
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,230
is rescuing the patient.

214
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,540
I've called a cab.

215
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,070
It'll be here soon.

216
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,470
I'm leaving.

217
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,590
Where are you going?

218
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,750
To home.

219
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm going back to Dong'an.

220
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,590
Let me send you off.

221
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,030
No need for that.

222
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,070
I heard from them that

223
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,710
you played a big part in solving

224
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,390
the matter of Isaia.

225
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,150
I was saved, thanks to you.

226
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,590
Thank you.

227
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,950
Uncle Xia,

228
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,230
you're welcome.

229
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,740
But don't you think that

230
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,310
I'll let Xia Chu be with you

231
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,140
just because you helped me.

232
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,590
Uncle Xia,

233
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,070
case by case,

234
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,300
I'll help you whether

235
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,710
you approve or not.

236
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,150
Even if you don't approve,

237
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,230
I'll help you too.

238
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,950
But Xia Chu and I

239
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,190
will be together

240
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,310
no matter what.

241
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,630
Xia Chu.

242
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,630
Have you seen my father?

243
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
I've seen him, he just left.

244
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,110
Wait for me.

245
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,750
Dad!

246
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,350
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

247
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,350
Liang Mu Ze is here.

248
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,710
So what?

249
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,630
Are you afraid of meeting him?

250
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,830
A bit.

251
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,750
Perhaps it's the

252
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,740
legacy of the first meeting with your

253
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,830
grandfather back then.

254
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,550
I flinched when I saw someone

255
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,030
in a military uniform.

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,350
I doubt it.

257
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,070
Grandpa is such a kind man.

258
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,670
That's because you're
his granddaughter.

259
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,910
He is always rough on me.

260
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,510
He always thinks that

261
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,150
your mother loses out in marrying me.

262
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,350
You still remember how

263
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,580
Grandpa opposed

264
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,510
your marriage with Ms Lan back then?

265
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,510
Of course.

266
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,380
He always wanted to
find your mother someone

267
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,510
who's a soldier like him.

268
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,390
And he always persuaded
your mother to leave me.

269
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,750
He said that to my
face several times.

270
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,310
Can I forget such

271
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,390
hurtful words?

272
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,670
So

273
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,670
don't be like my grandfather.

274
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,910
Don't be rough on Liang Mu Ze and

275
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,270
persuade him to break up with me.

276
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,390
He'll remember you
for the rest of his life

277
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,990
if we become man
and wife in the future.

278
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,180
Don't you

279
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,940
think it'd be awkward?

280
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,150
Don't vent your anger on
Liang Mu Ze just because

281
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,470
my grandfather was hard on you.

282
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,270
I didn't vent my anger.

283
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,990
I just think that my
daughter is too excellent.

284
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,260
No one around you deserves

285
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,430
to have you.

286
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,430
Your grandfather might
think that too back then.

287
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,260
But I really like him,

288
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,190
I want to be with him.

289
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,630
The cab is here, I'm leaving.

290
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,550
Girl,

291
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,950
no parents in this world

292
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,230
could ever win their kids.

293
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,510
Your grandfather can't,

294
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,150
neither can I.

295
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,430
Dad, I love you!

296
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,510
She is my daughter.

297
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,470
I can see that.

298
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,270
She's like you.

299
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,900
She is a doctor from Hospital 109.

300
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,190
She is a heart surgeon.

301
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,470
She is glowing

302
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,550
like an angel when

303
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,470
she's rescuing the patients.

304
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,310
My daughter

305
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,460
has grown up.

306
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,990
I handed in the
relationship report.

307
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,550
But Dong said it can't be

308
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,230
approved at the moment.

309
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,190
Is it because of my father?

310
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,190
Yes.

311
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,270
The decision can only be made
after the result of

312
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,060
the investigation is obtained.

313
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,390
I thought it was a big deal.

314
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,150
We just have to wait.

315
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,780
We'll get the result no matter

316
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,750
how long it takes.

317
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,230
And I believe that

318
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,990
my father will be fine.

319
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,620
But I don't wish to wait any longer.

320
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,190
I'm soon to be redeployed.

321
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,420
I want to tell everyone

322
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,910
that Xia Chu is my girlfriend.

323
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,750
Don't be afraid, Braised Egg.

324
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,580
We pulled through when we

325
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,910
were in such a difficult
situation in Isaia.

326
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,270
Now, we just have to wait a little bit.

327
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,430
And I have a feeling that

328
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,790
we'll have a happy life

329
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,510
in the future.

330
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,070
You need to have faith.

331
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,260
I have faith!

332
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,100
Liang Mu Ze!

333
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,670
Xia Chu must be my girlfriend.

334
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,480
♫ Remembering your interests,
getting closer to you ♫

335
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,070
I love her!

336
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,030
♫ If I can't predict the future,
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

337
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,750
♫ I can't remember when
I fell in love with you ♫

338
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,200
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

339
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:42,310
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

340
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,670
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

341
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:57,690
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

342
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,140
I'll put those large

343
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,630
luggages over here first.

344
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,380
Send them back for us via air
transportation when you're free, okay?

345
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,020
Okay.

346
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,670
I'll send you the address later.

347
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,940
Xue,

348
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
can you put on your shoes?

349
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,340
Stop playing with your phone.

350
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,870
We still have to catch the plane.

351
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Honey!

352
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,860
Stop playing with your phone!

353
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,710
We still have to catch the plane!

354
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,100
[Is it you?]

355
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,190
Go back by yourself.

356
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,590
What?

357
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,870
Go back by yourself.

358
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,100
Impossible!

359
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,590
Mum!

360
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,020
I let you come back

361
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,820
as you said so!

362
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,790
How long has it been?

363
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,310
Look what you've been!

364
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,380
And you even want to stay?

365
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,540
Do you have a death wish?

366
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,270
This is an accident!

367
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,310
Accident?

368
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,470
Very well,

369
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,630
just stay here.

370
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,950
I don't care!

371
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,430
Aunt!

372
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,470
Seriously?

373
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,070
I didn't want to yell at her.

374
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,750
That wasn't yelling.

375
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,590
I wonder who she got

376
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,550
her stubbornness from.

377
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,260
Like father, like daughter.

378
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,230
Whom else could she like?

379
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,110
Xue's injury is still

380
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,470
recovering.

381
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,590
It's good to let her
stay here for a while.

382
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,470
Don't worry, I'll look after her.

383
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,630
Is he doing well?

384
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,870
It's just her temper.

385
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,350
She'll forget it soon.

386
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,700
No.

387
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm not asking about Xue.

388
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,750
I'm asking about...

389
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,910
He's doing fine.

390
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,910
Same as always.

391
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,950
Right, same as always.

392
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,260
Same as always.

393
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,830
He didn't even show up when his

394
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,230
daughter was in such big trouble.

395
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,390
He's on mission, he has no choice.

396
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,670
Right.

397
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,070
He's an excellent

398
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,790
police officer.

399
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,550
But we both fail

400
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,470
as parents.

401
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,180
Aunt,

402
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,190
go in and take a look.

403
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,260
I got to sign some paperwork.

404
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,270
Is it because of Tian Yong?

405
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,750
Liang Mu Ze told you that?

406
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,990
You'd been calling him
when you were comatose.

407
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,510
What is he like?

408
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,790
Are you willing to tell me?

409
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,310
He's a soldier.

410
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,750
My brother's lieutenant.

411
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,430
A comrade he knows well.

412
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,750
He's not right for you.

413
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,870
Why do you all say that?

414
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,910
I don't know what others say.

415
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,110
But my experience taught me

416
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,820
that a soldier is entirely

417
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,830
unsuited to you.

418
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,820
But you said

419
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,950
it's your experience.

420
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,990
Shouldn't I make my choice?

421
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,220
Your choice?

422
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,190
Yes!

423
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,470
Xue,

424
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,230
do you know what the future is like

425
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,510
if you're with that kind of man?

426
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,350
He is not that kind of man.

427
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,510
He is Tian Yong.

428
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,430
Well,

429
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,430
I might think it's fun

430
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,670
at the beginning.

431
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,790
I just want to conquer him.

432
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,790
Maybe any man will do.

433
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,430
All he has to say is,

434
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,110
Xue, you look good,

435
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,340
you're cute and pretty,

436
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,390
you're not sick.

437
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,070
And I'd be happy.

438
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,740
But I found that

439
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,030
Tian Yong isn't that kind of person.

440
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,190
Guess what.

441
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,150
I bit the back of his hand

442
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,350
when I first met him.

443
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,070
The trace was very deep.

444
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,950
But he told my brother

445
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,110
that he's fine.

446
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,420
As for this parrot,

447
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,590
I've been treating it as my brother.

448
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,470
Everyone thinks I'm a fool

449
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,390
but Tian Yong asked

450
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,670
if I'd feel lonely

451
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,070
if I lost this parrot.

452
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,430
He even told me that

453
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,070
this world would be boring

454
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,580
if only the birds with nice voices

455
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,550
were allowed to tweet.

456
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,430
The most important thing is

457
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,910
he's willing to hug me

458
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,830
after knowing my past.

459
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,540
He's multiple times better than

460
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,300
those jerks who bad-mouth me

461
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,670
after kissing me.

462
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,310
This is Tian Yong.

463
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,590
You know what?

464
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,390
He never tried to sweet-talk me.

465
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,350
I didn't even understand

466
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,590
what he said.

467
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,510
But he told me that

468
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,340
one could live a wonderful life

469
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,700
in this world

470
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,150
even if one's imperfect.

471
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,140
I don't have to care about
how they think of me.

472
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,660
I just have to live my life
the way I want it to be.

473
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,670
You and Dad

474
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,830
never taught me this.

475
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,030
Only he

476
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,910
can reassure me.

477
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,150
Mum,

478
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,630
I know you'll feel sad

479
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,270
as I said these.

480
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,670
But these are my true thoughts.

481
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,630
I

482
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,390
met your father

483
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,150
at age 21,

484
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,620
got married at age 23,

485
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,670
I had you

486
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,190
at age 25,

487
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,230
I divorced him

488
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,950
at age 40 and

489
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,790
took you to the United States.

490
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,350
This is your failed marriage.

491
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,950
I once strongly believed that

492
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,590
I could

493
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,390
grow old with him.

494
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,350
But

495
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,580
between family and his job
as a police officer,

496
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,670
he chose the latter.

497
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,070
This is not Dad's fault.

498
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,470
It's my fault.

499
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,550
You guys separated because
of my incident.

500
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,870
Shut up.

501
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,110
You don't get it.

502
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,700
You don't understand what I said.

503
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,510
Then do you get what I mean?

504
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,780
You've been avoiding this matter,

505
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,830
just like you protected me.

506
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,710
You organized my life

507
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,750
and wanted me to follow your path.

508
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,350
Have you ever thought about me?

509
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,700
It's like I can only live in

510
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,150
the year when the incident happened,

511
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,270
I can never be freed.

512
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,230
I...

513
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,830
I thought...

514
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,060
I thought you hate

515
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,150
to see me cry.

516
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,270
Mum,

517
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,070
I hate to see you pretend
to be happy even more.

518
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,030
Do you still love Dad?

519
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,550
Send me a message when you've arrived.

520
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,830
I love you, Mum.

521
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,030
I'll meet your parents

522
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,590
when I switch flights in Beijing.

523
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,820
Do you have anything

524
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,430
to give them or tell them?

525
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,420
Nothing,

526
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,550
just tell them I'm doing fine.

527
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,350
Okay.

528
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,230
Have a safe journey, aunt.

529
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,390
Have you made up your mind?

530
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,750
It's not too late to turn.

531
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,470
I want to wait for Tian Yong here.

532
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,910
Then you need to
follow me back to the unit

533
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,510
and you're not allowed to leave.

534
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,430
Report to me in advance
if there's anything.

535
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,870
Someone is going to follow you around

536
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,430
until it's all clear.

537
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,750
Is that all right?

538
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,150
Why?

539
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,510
This is the discussion
from all sectors

540
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,270
to ensure the safety
of yours and Tian Yong

541
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,950
and help in their operations.

542
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,230
You were thrown into the ocean by him,

543
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,510
you were dead,

544
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,510
understood?

545
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,310
How long do we need to stay here?

546
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,790
I don't know.

547
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,750
What are we waiting for?

548
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,670
Waiting for news.

549
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,950
You'll see the man
you want to see

550
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,430
when we get the news.

551
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,630
So

552
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,710
this is your

553
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,670
transit station.

554
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,110
It's one of them.

555
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
When can we get the news?

556
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,740
I don't know.

557
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,910
They will inform me.

558
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,870
So that means

559
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,030
his ranking is higher than yours.

560
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,390
We have different roles.

561
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,470
Then why do I think you are

562
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,940
always in the forefront

563
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,340
while he commands at the back?

564
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,150
You two are partners.

565
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,550
He is not your boss.

566
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,350
If I were you,

567
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,790
I wouldn't like his style.

568
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,750
I'm going to the washroom.

569
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,110
Remember to take your medication.

570
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,540
Immediately tell me

571
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,710
if you don't feel well.

572
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,430
And take good care of your friend.

573
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,830
I got it.

574
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,420
Just do your thing.

575
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:26,230
♫ There's something about you
that makes me strangely addicted ♫

576
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,350
♫ I keep wanting to open my heart ♫

577
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:38,909
♫ Afraid of your anticipation,
some things cannot be repeated ♫

578
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:45,170
♫ We can't reject it
when fate chooses us ♫

579
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:52,150
♫ I'll hesitate when I get close,
I'll be sad if I miss it ♫

580
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,739
♫ Your lovely smile, your pure heart ♫

581
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,580
♫ Are irreplaceable ♫

582
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,430
♫ Accustomed to your presence ♫

583
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,210
♫ Being loved every moment ♫

584
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,920
♫ Until the day we meet ♫

585
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,760
♫ Can the missing companionship
instantly fulfil ♫

586
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,830
[What do you mean?]

587
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,650
♫ Your love ♫

588
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,300
♫ There's something about you
that makes me strangely addicted ♫

589
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,590
[I couldn't hear what you said.]

590
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,730
♫ I keep wanting to open my heart ♫

591
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,050
♫ Afraid of your anticipation,

594
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,340
♫ Your lovely smile, your pure heart ♫

595
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,180
Can you understand

596
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,870
what language this is?

597
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,410
♫ Are irreplaceable ♫

598
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:18,480

♫ Your love ♫

603
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,190
Brigade Commander,

604
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,670
why are you up so late?

605
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,070
Nothing.

606
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm just thinking,

607
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,950
there was no Xiao Xiao yet
when I participated in

608
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,870
the tree planting here back then.

609
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,860
Years

610
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,670
have gone in a flash,

611
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,270
my daughter has grown up,

612
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,030
the tree has grown tall too.

613
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,870
What did Sister-in-law say

614
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,590
about the redeployment?

615
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,070
What can she say?

616
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,910
This is not the first time.

617
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,750
Your sister-in-law is a

618
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,540
strong person.

619
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,990
She had been running around with me

620
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,310
since she was young.

621
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,950
She never made complaints.

622
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,830
She cringed as she knew I'm

623
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,100
going to leave.

624
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,390
It's not a problem to relocate.

625
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,110
The only problem is

626
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,990
Xiao Xiao doesn't want
to leave her classmates

627
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,390
and friends.

628
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,590
She has been losing her temper.

629
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,470
If your sister-in-law hadn't

630
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,710
come up with so many ways
to cheer her up,

631
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,980
I wouldn't know what to do

632
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,630
with this girl's ideological work.

633
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,420
It's a complete waste

634
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,270
of such a nice woman

635
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,830
to marry me.

636
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,070
Brigade Commander.

637
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,420
Well,

638
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,340
stop talking about me.

639
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,310
Let's talk about you.

640
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,590
Have you set everything up for Xue?

641
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,630
Yes.

642
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,620
The superiors have given the orders.

643
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,350
The defence unit

644
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,070
will send someone to take care of Xue.

645
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,340
Moreover,

646
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,670
the families left behind

647
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,150
will come over to help too.

648
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,830
So you don't have to worry about

649
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,150
her living and safety.

650
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,910
I know.

651
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,310
Why?

652
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,870
Any other concerns?

653
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,350
Brigade Commander,

654
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,030
can you inform Tian Yong
to return and see Xue?

655
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,750
What do you say?

656
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,870
I have no idea

657
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,710
where Tian Yong is.

658
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,070
Right now,

659
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,870
this isn't what we should
worry about.

660
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,470
After redeployment,

661
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,630
joint military exercise
will be conducted right away.

662
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,070
By then,

663
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,270
the representatives of
the foreign militaries

664
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,510
have to attend it
except the captain of the war zone.

665
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,670
Be well-prepared

666
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,830
and do your best.

667
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,990
Yes.

668
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,510
As soldiers,

669
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,260
we can't choose the

670
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,070
region and era we're in.

671
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,670
The only thing we can choose

672
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,470
is loyalty to our era.

Goodbye, teacher!

720
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,830
Xia Chu?

721
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,190
You're here.

722
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,150
Where is Xiao Xiao?

723
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,030
Two patients came to the
emergency department abruptly.

724
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,830
I think she couldn't
get away at the moment.

725
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,110
So I come here by myself.

726
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,230
This is the honey from her.

727
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,340
Her father

728
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,940
bought this from the beekeeper.

729
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,910
It's all-natural.

730
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,580
That's great.

731
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,590
Thank her for me.

732
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,310
These are our thesis.

733
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,710
We had amended two drafts.

734
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,780
Okay.

735
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,790
Let me read them.

736
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,230
Are you still in touch with

737
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,150
Ms Meng Zhen?

738
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,310
I've been busy lately.

739
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,190
I have many works in school.

740
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,510
A little while ago,

741
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,750
she took Xiao Jun to our
hospital for medical checkup

742
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,590
and said she's going to Beijing.

743
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,390
Really?

744
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,910
By the way,

745
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,310
how is it?

746
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,740
How does it feel to be back

747
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,030
at the Cardiac Surgery Department?

748
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,070
I'm not used to stitch the patient up

749
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,030
during operation at first.

750
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,230
Never mind.

751
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,390
You'll get used to it.

752
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:07,710
You're like me.

753
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,700
I'm currently adapting to the life

754
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,230
which I don't have to
stitch patients up.

755
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,100
Everything will be fine.

756
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,510
I'm preparing to sign up
for the military exercise.

757
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,910
Is Liang Mu Ze going?

758
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,630
I don't know.

759
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,670
I think he'll go.

760
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,150
I can feel it.

761
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,790
Sir,

762
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,230
thank you.

763
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,310
About me returning to
the Cardiac Surgery Department,

764
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,710
things wouldn't be this smooth

765
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,270
if you hadn't talked to the chief.

766
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,470
Don't say that.

767
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,630
I think

768
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,190
you deserve this.

769
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,780
It's true.

770
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,110
If you really want to thank me,

771
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,110
how about this?

772
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,390
Clean the blackboard.

773
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,750
No problem.

774
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,670
Sir,

775
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:28,910
I'll keep that in mind.
