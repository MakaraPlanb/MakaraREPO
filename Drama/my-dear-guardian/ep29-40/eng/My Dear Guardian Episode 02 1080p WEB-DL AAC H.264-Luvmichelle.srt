[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,070
Do you think I'm short on cash?

5
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,660
If you can't afford a moving company,

6
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,700
I can sponsor you.

7
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,820
Don't be afraid to ask.

8
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,670
Look at him being all obnoxious.

9
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,509
That one, two, three, four, too.

10
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,300
He can't wait to see me

11
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,470
fall into despair.

12
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,190
Who gave him that confidence?

13
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,820
How hard is it to get a new place?

14
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,700
I can't believe

15
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,950
that in the entire Ningjiang District,

16
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,710
there's not a place for me.

17
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,280
Where do you usually crash at night?

18
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,180
The whole world belongs to me.

19
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,750
But I really hate moving.

20
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,020
I've got to go to work, look for a place,

21
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,220
then pack up and clean up again.

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,550
I'll really go mad.

23
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,990
Calm down.

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,070
It's okay. I must remain calm.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,310
As a modern lady,

26
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,380
I won't be defeated

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,670
by such a trivial matter.

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,829
Just focus on doing the laundry first.

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,990
He says a little pain in life
doesn't matter...

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,470
It's just moving to a new place, isn't it?

31
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,470
Anything on tonight?

32
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,840
Where did you come from?
You gave me a scare.

33
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,910
Do you have anything to do tonight?

34
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,390
I'll be looking for new places online

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
so I can move out soon.

36
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,510
I need you to come with me.

37
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,350
I'm not done hanging up my laundry yet.

38
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,510
It's for something more important
than this.

39
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,400
A kid was hurt,

40
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,579
but he refuses to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,550
I need a doctor.

42
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,310
So I'm needed only when something happens?

43
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,430
Isn't it a doctor's duty
to heal the wounded and save the dying?

44
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,190
Let's go.

45
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,030
Is that kid

46
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,590
-very important to you?
-Yes.

47
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,670
What if...

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,829
I'll do my best.

49
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,830
Xiao Jun.

50
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,110
Liang Mu Ze.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,110
Alright, let me see it.

52
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,020
Now you're embarrassed?

53
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,550
I just asked you to wash up
but you didn't.

54
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
He insisted on waiting for you.

55
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,030
You got hit?

56
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,870
I brought this madam doctor

57
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,990
to look at your injury.

58
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,670
Madam doctor?

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,270
Just call me sister.

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,430
Pretty please, handsome boy?

61
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,750
Let me have a look.

62
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,190
It's too dark in here.
Do you have a torchlight?

63
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,470
Yes. Mu Ze.

64
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,470
On the table over there.

65
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,480
[Just give up, Mu Ze.]

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,870
[I know you're almost out.]

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,440
[How would you know that?]

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,590
[If you can, so can I.]

69
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,510
[I can't do this anymore.]

70
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,790
[I can't.]

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,670
-[You lost.]
-[I lost.]

72
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,680
[I lost.]

73
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,910
[There's always a bigger fish.]

74
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,000
-[Let's continue this tomorrow.]
-[Sure.]

75
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,110
[I'm always up for that.]

76
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,960
[Anytime.]

77
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,790
[Don't move.]

78
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,230
[Let me try out my new camera.]

79
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,590
[Go away.]

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,150
[Three, two, one. Look up.]

81
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,710
Mu Ze.

82
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,390
Now close your eyes.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,550
Don't move. It's going to sting a little.

84
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,270
Hold on. It's almost done.

85
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,200
Hold on just a little bit more.

86
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,310
Xiao Jun is so brave.

87
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,030
Done.

88
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,320
Will there be a scar?

89
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,710
It probably won't.

90
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,790
A scar is nothing.

91
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,660
Am I right?

92
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,790
We're tough men.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,430
Mu Ze, you two have a seat.

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
I need to head out for a while.

95
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,830
Where are you going?

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
Look after the kid.

97
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,550
Liang Mu Ze.

98
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,780
Liang Mu Ze, don't leave.

99
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm not. I'll just go
to see where she's going.

100
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,310
You promise?

101
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,630
I promise. Don't worry.

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Have some fun with madam doctor.

103
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,910
It's sister.

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,790
How dare he.

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,790
What's your relationship
with Liang Mu Ze?

106
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,140
To be precise, we actually

107
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,470
have just really known each other today.

108
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,900
What about you and him?

109
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,600
We've known each other for many years.

110
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,310
He's my father.

111
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,800
Where are you going?

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm fine.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,950
Please head back first.
Your friend's still there.

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,590
I... I'll be back soon.

115
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,790
It doesn't seem like you're fine.

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
What's the matter?

117
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
I...

118
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,320
Xiao Jun got bullied in class today.

119
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,510
He panicked and banged his head
against the door.

120
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
After that, he fainted.

121
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,590
Although his father is dead,

122
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,950
Xiao Jun has always been very obedient.

123
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,560
I've never hit him.

124
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,070
I went through a lot to raise him.

125
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,550
Who are they to bully him?

126
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,870
They won't give me an explanation
so I'm getting it myself.

127
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,559
Please don't stop me, Mu Ze.

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,880
I don't mean to stop you.

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,940
Xiao Jun...

130
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,640
How much longer can you
defend him like that?

131
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,870
And you're going with a torchlight?

132
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,680
What can it do?

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,070
Stop touching it.
There are germs on your hand.

134
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,760
Let it heal on its own.

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,920
Why are your lips purplish?

136
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,790
They've always been that way.

137
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Do you usually feel dizzy

138
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,760
or experience chest tightness?

139
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,910
No.

140
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,160
No?

141
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,150
Well I... I've done my best.

142
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,160
The dressing isn't really that ugly,
is it?

143
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,710
Does it hurt?

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
Xiao Jun.

145
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,160
Listen to me.

146
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,510
In future,

147
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,000
if someone tries to bully you...

148
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,190
I was wrong.

149
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,790
Next time, I'll avoid it immediately.

150
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
No, it's not your fault.

151
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,470
You can't avoid it.

152
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,550
If someone bullies you,

153
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,110
you retaliate immediately.

154
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,190
You hear that?

155
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,360
You can't bully others,

156
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,910
but you can't let others bully you either.

157
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,030
Got it?

158
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,910
But I'm afraid.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
What are you afraid of?

160
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,720
Your bully feels afraid too.

161
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,950
He only has two fists and two legs
just like you.

162
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,240
As long as you fight back,
he'll be afraid too.

163
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,320
And he won't come at you again.

164
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,510
Got it?

165
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
Really?

166
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,790
Let me show you a few tricks.

167
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,600
-Okay.
-Come here.

168
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,840
Thanks for talking
to Miss Meng Zhen all night.

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
It's fine.

170
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Is Xiao Jun

171
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,320
really your son?

172
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Yes.

173
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,110
Your personalities are different.

174
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,830
What do you mean?

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,510
He really cares for you.

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,200
I know.

177
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,400
He'll believe and do

178
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,910
whatever you tell him to.

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,280
Is that a problem?

180
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,320
Do you really think the fighting skills
you taught him

181
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,400
will make him untouchable?

182
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,720
I never meant it that way.

183
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,200
Why did you teach him to fight then?

184
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,070
It's called resistance.

185
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,270
When you're bullied,

186
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
you won't necessarily win with your fist.

187
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
But at least,

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,910
it'll make sure

189
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,990
you won't become

190
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
a target of bullies anymore.

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,950
Is there really no other tactful way
to resolve this?

192
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,390
Must it be an eye for an eye?

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
He will have

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,400
to face this world by himself.

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,150
Thanks for sending me to the hospital.

196
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Go home and get some sleep.

197
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,950
I don't really need any sleep.

198
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Sleep probably doesn't need you.

199
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Is there a medical explanation for that?

200
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,590
Not that I know of.

201
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,710
But my woman's hunch says,

202
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,550
the body of a sleepless person

203
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,270
harbours

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
a battered and weary soul.

205
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,800
Did I get it right, Captain Liang?

206
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,390
Stop being conceited, Dr Xia.

207
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,560
Goodbye.

208
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,720
[Outpatient Department]

209
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,670
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

210
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,950
You have dark circles under your eyes.

211
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,310
Where did you party last night?

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,280
I had a vocational study.

213
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,910
Get changed quickly.

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
Dr Zhang will be here soon.

215
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,860
[Miss Lan]

216
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,070
Miss Lan.

217
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,780
[Hey, girl.]

218
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,360
How's the place?

219
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,240
[I'm getting ready to move.]

220
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,710
Why?

221
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,030
I was thinking of...

222
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,630
Hold your thought.

223
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,080
He has a son. Do you know that?

224
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,480
What?

225
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,180
A son?

226
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,520
What son? I didn't know that.

227
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,200
And yet you were so eager to push

228
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,550
your daughter into relationship hell?

229
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Are you even my biological mother?

230
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,120
I...

231
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,830
[Enough. I won't blame you for it.]

232
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,030
I need to work now. Talk again later.

233
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,230
Love you. Mwah!

234
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
Goodbye, Miss Lan.

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
Wait, girl.

236
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,310
A son?

237
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
Xiao Xiao, do you have
an extra pair of shoes?

238
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,870
Didn't you keep a pair here?

239
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,950
I forgot.

240
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,000
In that case, I can't help you.

241
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,000
To hell with it then.

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,030
A week ago, the patient did

243
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,190
a coronary artery bypass graft.

244
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,790
Since yesterday,

245
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,270
his fluid intake has been 2000 ml,

246
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,830
urine output has been 2100 ml.

247
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,870
Intake and output volumes are balanced.

248
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,230
The drainage tube was removed yesterday.

249
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
She is doing well so far.

250
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,950
You caught a cold?

251
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,710
No.

252
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,750
I'm just a little sensitive

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
to the perfume of this doctor.

254
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,520
My apologies.

256
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,560
You're doing good.

257
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,990
Rest well now.

258
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,840
Why are you back here?

259
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,360
Liang Mu Ze.

260
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,860
This will count as a reward

261
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,210
for treating Xiao Jun yesterday.

262
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,520
Must you draw a line in everything?

263
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,010
Yes.

264
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,370
Fine, whatever you say.

265
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,610
Things like bangles, rings,

266
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,480
brooches and earrings

267
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,890
that interfere with your work

268
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,490
and affect the recovery of patients
must all be discarded.

269
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,730
Keep in mind.

270
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,810
You're either a good or bad doctor,
regardless of gender.

271
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,160
Xia Chu is working
without her military outfit.

272
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,480
Why am I the only one being scolded?

273
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,760
Xia Chu.

274
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,730
I'm here.

275
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,170
Why are you so smug?

276
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,010
Why aren't you wearing the military outfit
during working hours?

277
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,370
No.

278
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,890
I'm properly attired. Look.

279
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm a professional military doctor.

280
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,640
How can I make

281
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,890
a rookie mistake?

282
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,760
Very good.

283
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,130
Correct mistakes if you've made any,

284
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,290
guard against them if you haven't.

285
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,720
Especially you.

286
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
By the way,

287
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,400
that young officer

288
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,560
who returned from Isaia with us,

289
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,210
how is he doing?

290
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,069
He was already discharged
from ICU yesterday.

291
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,319
According to the order of higher-ups,

292
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,170
he is now placed in the private wad.

293
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,490
Alright.

294
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,599
Let's check on him first.

295
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,560
Yes.

296
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,880
Captain Liang,
are you here to visit the patient?

297
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
I was initially here to deliver something.

298
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,770
I came to see Tian Yong since I'm here.

299
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,330
How are you feeling?

300
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,690
Is everything good?

301
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,810
Xia Chu.

302
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,600
Yes.

303
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,760
Describe the patient's condition.

304
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,090
Patient's name, Tian Yong.
Age, 32 years old.

305
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,570
Because he was shot
in the left thoracic cavity,

306
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,040
he was given a thoracotomy

307
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,250
by the Isaia Joint Medical Team.

308
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,760
The bullet was removed.

309
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,960
Two days after the surgery,

310
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,530
he was transferred from Isaia
to our ICU.

311
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,600
After receiving medical treatment,

312
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,890
his condition is good.

313
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,480
Currently,

314
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,730
his blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg,

315
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,810
heartbeat is stable.

316
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,640
Thoracic cavity and pericardium drainage
tube flow is steady.

317
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,640
The rate of drainage in 24 hours

318
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,690
is 100 ml.

319
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,810
What should be done next?

320
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,840
Conduct an echocardiography
and chest CT scan,

321
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,170
a blood routine and a full-set
blood coagulation examination.

322
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,920
Check if the thoracic cavity and
the pericardial drainage

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,410
flow rates have reduced

324
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,760
and whether the colour
has gradually turned clearer,

325
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,810
which will decide
if we can remove the tube soon.

326
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,840
In other words,

327
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,690
your recovery is going well.

328
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,770
Dr Zhang.

329
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,570
Will there be any medical repercussions?

330
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,290
Are you experiencing any yourself?

331
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,930
Xia Chu.

332
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,970
Let me introduce.

333
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,120
He

334
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,000
is the officer

335
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,210
I told you about in Isaia

336
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,760
who was injured even worse than Tian Yong.

337
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,960
You must be a major now, aren't you?

338
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,970
Chief, I've heard so much of you.

339
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,090
We know each other.

340
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,450
Really?

341
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,090
Why didn't you mention it?

342
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,050
We don't know each other too well.

343
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,440
We only crossed paths

344
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,690
back in Isaia

345
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,930
when I was held hostage.

346
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,610
Now I remember.

347
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,520
You were the one who saved the hostage,
weren't you?

348
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,320
Since you know each other,

349
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,570
why are you so discreet?

350
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,170
I don't know.

351
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,650
We even met a few times
upon returning.

352
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,850
Is there a cause for it?

353
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,960
No.

354
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,890
If she says so.

355
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,690
Alright then.

356
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,010
In that case,

357
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,290
if there's any problem
with Lieutenant Tian's condition,

358
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,600
you can look for Dr Xia in future.

359
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,570
No problem.

360
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,410
We're done here. Next wad.

361
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,440
What were you doing back there,
Liang Mu Ze?

362
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,410
What do you mean?

363
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,480
Do you know

364
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,730
that what you said just now

365
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,090
will bring me

366
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,160
a lot of troubles?

367
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,730
I only spoke the truth.

368
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,970
Are you a pretty little fool?

369
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,730
If you can't handle gossips,

370
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,770
that is your problem.

371
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,170
Liang Mu Ze.

372
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,690
Liang Mu Ze.

373
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,930
You don't call me chief now, do you?

374
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,610
Listen, Dr Xia.

375
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,690
If you think it is right

376
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,850
to cast people away

377
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,810
after using them,

378
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,610
then continue with it.

379
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,020
I don't care.

380
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,290
But I've told you before.

381
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,850
I like simplicity

382
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,290
and straightforwardness.

383
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,410
It's not something honourable to know you.

384
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,970
So there's no point in lying about it.

385
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,170
If you like to act,

386
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,410
then suit yourself.

387
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,570
I have no obligation to play along.

388
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,130
Something is not right.

389
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,970
What is it?

390
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,890
Aren't you from the Special Forces?

391
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,770
So?

392
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,410
A person from the Special Forces
shouldn't be

393
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,290
arrogant, cool, inarticulate and tough?

394
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,770
Why is it different when it comes to you?

395
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,780
You're so talkative.

396
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,680
I bet if you were

397
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,280
on a prolonged ambush mission

398
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,570
where you can't speak nor move,

399
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,330
the silence could just kill you.

400
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,400
When you move out,

401
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,370
make sure you take all your stuff.

402
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,130
Captain Liang, join us.

403
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,220
I'm done.

404
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,530
I'm a pretty little fool?

405
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,520
I can't take this.

406
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,610
Has she lost her mind?

407
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,050
What a joke.
How am I a pretty little fool?

408
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,210
She called an officer
a pretty little fool.

409
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,570
Tell me, Tian Yong.

410
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,930
As the top-notch graduate
of military school,

411
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,730
your captain,

412
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,970
in my every aspect,

413
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,010
whether it's my physique,

414
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,330
or my military skills,

415
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,330
or my cognitive aptitudes,

416
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,120
aren't they all equally excellent?

417
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,490
How can she call me a blockhead?

418
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,250
This isn't the worst part.

419
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,730
What really pissed me off is that

420
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,890
she pretended not knowing me

421
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,450
in front of her colleagues.

422
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,180
What's wrong with knowing me?

423
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,530
Tell me what's wrong with that?

424
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,850
Does it embarrass her?

425
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,440
You're just sneering.

426
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,770
Why don't you say something?

427
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,130
Did I feed you too fast?

428
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,820
I'm asking you.

429
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,580
I've answered you.

430
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,810
What did you say?

431
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,410
Via Morse code?

432
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,810
I've been thinking

433
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,050
if we should have

434
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,210
some kind of secret way

435
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,300
of communication between us.

436
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,810
We should, shouldn't we?

437
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,960
If someday you are captured
by the enemy...

438
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,930
Nonsense.

439
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,530
Why isn't it you being captured?

440
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,770
I'm just saying.

441
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,000
You can't do that either.

442
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,740
Let's be clear that there's no way

443
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,650
for it to happen in my troop.

444
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,290
You're being too idealistic.

445
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,810
Major.

446
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,810
Without ideals, why are you
even a soldier?

447
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,530
Without ideals, how can you be a soldier?

448
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,010
Didn't you start off as a soldier
because of your ideals?

449
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,050
I did it for survival.

450
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,410
I grew up in an orphanage

451
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,730
with no parents.

452
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,810
I couldn't find a decent job
after graduating from high school.

453
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,250
What ideals did I have?

454
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,530
I was looking to survive.

455
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,130
Tian Yong.

456
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,660
Listen.

457
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,860
You're wrong.

458
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,940
Even if in the beginning,

459
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,970
you joined the forces
merely because of survival,

460
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,450
you've still managed to stay in it
for so long.

461
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,490
After so many years,

462
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,560
your ideals

463
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,050
have already transcended
the mere reason of surviving.

464
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,760
Am I right?

465
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,940
Don't you deny that.

466
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,460
It's pointless to deny it either.

467
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,010
Look at this.

468
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,540
This here

469
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,530
is the best proof.

470
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,250
What's that?

471
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,200
It was this?

472
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,170
Yes.

473
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,930
Hold on to it.

474
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,490
Keep it, so you'll always remember.

475
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,170
Thanks, captain.

476
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,210
Take it.

477
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,410
That's so kind of you.

478
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,690
Ouch.

479
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,570
It hurts.

480
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,970
That's good.

481
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,380
That way you'll remember.

482
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,400
Brace yourself.

483
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,370
My wound hurts.

484
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,010
Alright. I'll remove it.

485
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,470
[Somewhere in Southeast Asia,
Willick, T4 Headquarters]

486
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,540
Why did the mission fail?

487
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,530
The local police

488
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,010
hired help from Hunter Military School.

489
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,850
They were all top-notch special forces
from various countries.

490
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,090
What about the thing I wanted?

491
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,050
It's gone.

492
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,060
But we can find another one.

493
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,730
Listen.

494
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm running out of time.

495
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,170
-I must have it as soon...
-Of course.

496
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,100
Just like the steak before us.

497
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,060
As long as one can afford it,

498
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,890
anyone can have a taste of it.

499
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,820
Money is not a problem.

500
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,090
Once I've received it

501
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,890
and confirmed that it's compatible,

502
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,800
you'll have the rest of the payment.

503
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,620
Again, just like this steak,

504
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,370
time determines its doneness.

505
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,970
Likewise,

506
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,420
its taste will vary accordingly too.

507
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,940
What are you trying to say?

508
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,620
The organ provider is from Country A.

509
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,410
This matter has now alerted
not only the Isaia police,

510
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,700
but the Interpol is watching closely too.

511
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,170
Trying to retrieve your goods

512
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,490
under such dire conditions

513
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,970
requires a higher price now,
don't you agree?

514
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,890
You're fooling with me.

515
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,970
Business is business.

516
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,220
Great.

517
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,690
So it is.

518
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,050
Fine.

519
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,250
You may be in power in China,

520
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,900
but over here,

521
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,650
I'm in charge.

522
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,220
Boss, don't move.

523
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,170
You must understand
that everything in this world

524
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,570
revolves around money,

525
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,690
except money itself.

526
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,900
Money is related to one's dreams.

527
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,930
And you seem to have belittled mine.

528
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,540
Therefore,

529
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,500
your opportunity is gone now.

530
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,730
What do you mean?

531
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,400
Have you forgotten whose fundings

532
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,980
T4 owes for its glory today?

533
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,890
There's an old Chinese saying.

534
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,330
Great kindness repaid with ingratitude.

535
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,900
No kindness needs a lifetime of repayment.

536
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,690
Furthermore,

537
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,970
while we were negotiating our ties,

538
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,130
your little brother, Gui,

539
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,210
struck a money deal with me.

540
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,730
He wants you dead.

541
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,340
Plus he has offered me

542
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,740
something I simply can't refuse.

543
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,620
You liar.

544
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,620
Tell Old Gui

545
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,210
that the job is done.

546
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,050
Have him come over

547
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,850
to negotiate the remaining terms
of the goods supply and market sharing

548
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,860
as soon as possible.

549
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,450
Yes.

550
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,980
Master.

551
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,090
People think my resources come from

552
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,060
T4 alone.

553
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,010
But they never know

554
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,940
my greatest asset is you,

555
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,380
Zhuo Ran.

556
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,020
I owe it to your cultivation, Master.

557
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,780
Here, have a sit.

558
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,010
Yes.

559
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,580
Try out my cooking.

560
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,810
Master.

561
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,340
How does it taste?

562
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,210
Zhuo Ran.

563
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,580
Hasn't it been eight years since you
last set foot on China?

564
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,660
It's been 8 years and 27 days.

565
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,130
Pack up.

566
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,530
You'll be heading there.

567
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,370
Can I bring my mother along?

568
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,460
Have you forgotten that

569
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,140
she needs to recuperate?

570
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,260
Don't worry.

571
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,890
Once you return,

572
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,890
I'll arrange a short reunion.

573
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,290
Sounds good?

574
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,170
Yes.

575
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,930
What's the mission?

576
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,650
Dong'an University of China recently

577
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,700
invented a new form of medical sedatives.

578
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,050
I need the formula
and its person-in-charge,

579
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,860
Xia Guang Yuan.

580
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,410
Perhaps his daughter rings a bell.

581
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,740
Xia Chu.

582
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,100
I got it.

583
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,090
We've already locked

584
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,580
onto this dark web platform called

585
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,020
City of Desires.

586
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,980
Many recent cases of drug trafficking
in the city

587
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,370
are connected to this platform.

588
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,770
After our technical team

589
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,060
hacked into the server,

590
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,820
they collected metadata

591
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,290
for further analysis and interpretation.

592
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,810
We gradually found

593
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,450
some basic information
about the mastermind behind the platform.

594
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,500
This person uses an online account named

595
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,090
Dreadful Pirate.

596
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,290
Just moments ago,

597
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,780
he published several images

598
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,860
mourning the death

599
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,890
of several T4 mercenaries.

600
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,450
Besides that,

601
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,210
he even initiated

602
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
a suicide mission game

603
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,420
using high monetary rewards as bait.

604
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,420
Various mission cards

605
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,250
are randomly published

606
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,970
to incite netizens

607
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,970
to commit suicide missions.

608
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,050
[Although the motive is unclear,]

609
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,060
[it has already caused
terrible ramifications.]

610
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,530
[Higher-ups have called for
a special task force]

611
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,260
[led by the chief
of Criminal Investigation Detachment Unit]

612
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,170
[Rao Feng,]

613
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,690
[along with Narcotics Divison,
Financial Investigation Division]

614
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,180
[Cyber Crime Division
and various other divisions]

615
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,650
[to identify the whereabouts]

616
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,140
[of Dreadful Pirate.]

617
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,690
[According to the latest intel,]

618
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,740
Dreadful Pirate is hiding somewhere
amidst our country's borders.

619
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,940
It's likely related

620
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,530
to the mercenaries hired by T4.

621
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,290
If we were to arrest them,

622
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,050
the police would need your help.

623
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,020
No problem.

624
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,130
I'll inform the Thunder Commando
to get ready immediately.

625
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,980
Once the mission is approved,

626
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,540
we'll assist in the operation.

627
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,580
Thank you.

628
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,250
She asked me to lend her
my pair of shoes.

629
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,010
But I didn't have an extra pair.

630
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,930
I think Army Officer Liang was the one

631
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,260
who brought her those.

632
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,300
How can I help you?

633
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,440
I bet

634
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,060
the shoes and military uniform
you're wearing now

635
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,260
were delivered by Army Officer Liang.

636
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,810
Of course not.

637
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,330
He's pursuing you?

638
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,730
Impossible.

639
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,700
Are you guys together?

640
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,340
Nope.

641
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,900
He seems to be close to Dr Zhang.

642
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,860
How should I know about that?

643
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,500
So the reason you were selected to attend

644
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,700
that international medical
training program in Isaia

645
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,140
was because he talked
to Dr Zhang about it?

646
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,730
Dr Zhang.

647
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,810
Why aren't you doing this in the office?

648
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,130
It's too noisy there.

649
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,700
You heard gossips?

650
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,900
You heard them too?

651
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,340
It's easy to guess.

652
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,020
You should know that

653
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,220
you're our first ever resident doctor

654
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,610
to have participated

655
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,420
in a foreign aid medical program.

656
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,020
You're also the first ever resident doctor

657
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,980
to stand in front of the operating table.

658
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,130
Others of the same age as you

659
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,500
are still busy practising how to stitch.

660
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,860
Hence comes the gossip.

661
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,490
You have to learn to handle them.

662
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,180
Why should I?

663
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,390
To wear the crown

664
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,889
is to bear its weight.

665
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,250
What you have to do now

666
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,929
is to work as hard as you can.

667
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,929
Let those who talk

668
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,690
feel hopeless.

669
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,330
Then, they'll stop talking.

670
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,929
Will they really stop?

671
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,300
Of course they will.

672
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,300
I'm certain of it.

673
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,219
It's because I

674
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,940
experienced it too.

675
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,860
Do you train like this all the time?

676
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,770
Of course. It's a must.

677
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,780
Ever since the day I first did stitching

678
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,170
and was kicked out of the operating room
by my teacher.

679
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,860
Every day.

680
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,540
But this time during the day,

681
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,139
isn't it bright enough already?

682
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,139
Why do you also need a candle?

683
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,850
They aren't for the training.

684
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,300
It's for those

685
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,570
who went on the operating table

686
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,300
but never made it back alive.

687
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,980
Because of them,

688
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,460
I remind myself

689
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,460
that I can't slack even for a moment.

690
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,660
Remember this, Xia Chu.

691
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,260
Nothing is more important
than a person's life and death.

692
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,780
I understand now.

693
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,220
Mi Gu.

694
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,900
Hey girl.

695
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,900
Do you miss me?

696
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,060
[I do.]

697
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,620
[I miss you a lot.]

698
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,780
How are you doing there?

699
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,340
Is your residency life

700
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,380
full of blood, sweat and tears?

701
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,180
[Not only that.]

702
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,580
It's an imperial court drama
here every day.

703
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,580
When I started medical school,

704
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,140
[I thought
I just needed skills to survive.]

705
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,450
Only now do I realise that

706
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,580
emotional intelligence is super important.

707
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,060
No matter how terrible it is,

708
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,450
at least you've got
a free mansion to live in.

709
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,370
Am I right?

710
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,340
Forget it.

711
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,100
The landlord is forcing me to move out.

712
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,580
[Mi Gu.]

713
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,340
[How I wish you were my landlady.]

714
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,740
Well, I'm always ready to share

715
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,580
half of my tatami bed with you.

716
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Mi Gu.

717
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,650
You're the best.

718
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,580
I'll leave you with that thought.

719
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,940
I've got a cab to catch. Goodbye.

720
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,580
Bye.

721
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,850
What doesn't kill me

722
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,100
only makes me stronger.

723
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,300
Thunder Commando unit,
check your communication devices.

724
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Once we're at the borders,

725
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,460
our orders
are to capture the target alive.

726
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,500
But if the target fires,

727
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,740
we won't hold back.

728
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,330
Yes, sir.

729
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,300
Alright, let's have a look.

730
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,220
Who knows?

731
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,380
We might find a better place
than this one.

732
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,300
[I don't want to go. I like it here.]

733
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,660
What a pity. This house is so exquisite.

734
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,500
I was almost getting used to it.

735
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,340
Stop thinking, stop thinking.

736
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,340
Delete that thought.

737
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,330
Look for a new place.

738
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,420
Look for a new place.

739
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
You can do it.

740
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,100
[Hi, Dr Xia.]

741
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,420
[I'm Chen Meng Zhen,
Luo Xiao Jun's mother.]

742
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,500
[Do you remember me?]

743
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,820
Yes. How can I help you?

744
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,060
Well...

745
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,420
Two days back,

746
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,580
Xiao Jun kept complaining
about tightness in his chest.

747
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,050
He even fainted in school earlier today.

748
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,530
I was wondering

749
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,460
[if it could be some kind of repercussion
from his previous head injury?]

750
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,060
Has he done a check-up?

751
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,540
I brought him to the community hospital
during the day.

752
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,750
But their equipment was broken.

753
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,260
So they couldn't do an X-ray.

754
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,180
How is he doing now?

755
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,450
[Right now]

756
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,700
[he's sleeping.]

757
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,670
Mum.

758
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,430
I feel terrible.

759
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,700
Mum.

760
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,660
[I feel terrible.]

761
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,300
Don't worry. Just observe him for now.

762
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,020
If it gets worse,

763
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,420
come straight to the hospital
tomorrow morning.

764
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,660
I'll be there.

765
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,220
That'd be great. Thank you so much.

766
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,180
You're welcome. Goodbye.

767
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,860
Could it be that I didn't dress
the wound properly?

768
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,220
What's the point of raising
a lazy cat like you?

769
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,740
A holograph?

770
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,380
Looks like someone's messing with us.

771
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,390
Whale.

772
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,660
What's the situation?

773
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,310
The other party definitely
has ill intentions.

774
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,620
You have to be careful.

775
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,380
Yes, sir.

776
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,910
No matter what case this is,

777
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,530
or who the mastermind is,

778
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,320
I'll get to the bottom of it.
