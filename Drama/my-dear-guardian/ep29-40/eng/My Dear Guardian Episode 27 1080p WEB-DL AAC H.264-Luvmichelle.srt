[Episode 27]

4
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,600
♫ In my sadness, I hallucinate ♫

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,380
♫ Let it be, I'm once again
close to tears ♫

6
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,840
♫ An unfamiliar street,
a cruel heartbeat ♫

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,699
♫ Time stops, tears are meaningless
in this moment ♫

8
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,510
♫ All I want is a hug ♫

9
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,790
♫ Drunk on your lips ♫

10
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,900
♫ It's the trickery played by hormones ♫

11
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,730
His spine is a little crooked.

12
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,740
When he carried me down
the stairs yesterday,

13
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,170
I felt it.

14
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,250
To be frank,

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,480
after I turned 14,

16
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,850
I haven't seen much of him.

17
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,810
It's highly unlikely that I had caused

18
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,320
his back to be crooked.

19
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,730
In my memory,

20
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,250
I remember how he would carry me

21
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,430
me on his shoulders when I was a kid

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,540
and held me high up.

23
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,210
Now,

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,840
how did his spine become crooked?

25
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,660
Perhaps it's lack of calcium.

26
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,280
I know about those scientific

27
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,410
What I wish to say is,

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,329
just because this man

29
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,370
wears a police uniform,

30
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,100
I had believed that

31
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,890
he was invincible.

32
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,890
Who knew he'd get exhausted too?

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,970
Maybe other people don't see it.

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,680
He himself doesn't see it.

35
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,150
But I can.

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,760
His back is crooked.

37
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm heartbroken.

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,630
Just like you said,

39
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,310
I still hate him.

40
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,670
Still, I wish I could do
something for him.

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,650
But I'm just a lunatic.

42
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,400
You're not.

43
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,370
You know what I said to him yesterday?

44
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,019
I said,

45
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,760
"Stay away from me."

46
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,089
"I hate you."

47
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,890
If he doesn't wake up,

48
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,970
that would be the last thing

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,320
I ever said to him.

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,480
That would be

51
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,080
our farewell.

52
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,890
Perhaps this is a hint from God.

53
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,090
Only that

54
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,170
it was done in a more dangerous way.

55
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,810
Right.

56
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,030
A huge hint this is.

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,010
[doesn't mean he doesn't care.]

63
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,290
Daddy, I feel sick.

64
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,110
I want to go home.

65
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,420
I'll take you home
once you finish the drip.

66
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,260
Be good.

67
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,460
Please.

68
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,260
I want to go home now.

69
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,690
Be good, Tian Tian.

70
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,130
I'll buy you delicious snacks
when you finish the drip,

71
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,250
okay?

72
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,630
You mean it, right?

73
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,610
Promise me you'll stay with me too.

74
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,940
You mustn't leave.

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,220
I promise you,

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,060
I'll stay by your side.

77
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,860
Okay.

78
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,250
Pinky promise.

79
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,610
Pinky promise binds you

80
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,460
to the word for 100 years.

81
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,370
If you break it, you'll become a dog.

82
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,090
Good girl.

83
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,070
Do you have pen and paper?

84
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,610
I'll get some.

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,020
What's this?

86
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,120
I modified it using
the unit's bulletproof vest.

87
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,550
I use it when I'm dressed
in civilian clothing.

88
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,330
I want you to have it.

89
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,020
What for?

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,880
To keep you safe.

91
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,940
I'm wearing a bra.

92
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,450
How am I supposed to wear this?

93
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,380
Maybe go back and try to...

94
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,390
Try to find a way.

95
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,060
Such a straight guy.

96
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,140
Put away the heart protector.

97
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,890
I don't want to catch sight of it.

98
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,370
Why?

99
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,790
It's ugly.

100
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,330
Isn't is obvious?

101
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,100
I don't want to see it.

102
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,210
Is it ugly?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,020
You still donated blood
despite your injury?

104
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,850
Worry about yourself first, Dr Xia.

105
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,210
I'm doing good.

106
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,170
Good?

107
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,990
That parcel was sent to you.

108
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,260
If you got blown up by it,

109
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,490
would you still be good?

110
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,110
Were you worried about me?

111
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,420
Of course.

112
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,860
Who was the sender?

113
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,290
The police is still investigating.

114
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,550
My coffee.

115
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,430
Don't move.

116
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,530
Come here.

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,590
What are you doing?

118
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,770
What are you doing? Hey.

119
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,850
Sit down.

120
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,980
Relax.

121
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,940
Relax.

122
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,740
Relax.

123
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,600
Enjoy this moment.

124
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,330
How is it?

125
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,560
Left. The left side.

126
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,790
Yes, that's the spot.

127
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,960
Liang Mu Ze.

128
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,090
With your skills,

129
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,310
you'll be able to run a massage shop.

130
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,250
I'm sure you'll have returning customers.

131
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,970
This is my family's ancestral skill.

132
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,280
However,

133
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,100
this skill of ours

134
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,020
is reserved

135
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,730
for only one person this whole life.

136
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,660
Xia Chu.

137
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,290
Do think it over again.

138
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,130
Come to the unit.

139
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,730
Where?

140
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:02,400
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

141
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,650
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

142
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,390
♫ To relive the moment
my heart skipped a beat ♫

143
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,530
See?

144
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,010
We don't have answers to many questions.

145
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,370
But there's one answer

146
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,650
that I'm sure of.

147
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,980
What is it?

148
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,330
The moon tonight

149
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,880
is lovely.

150
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,660
Yes, it is.

151
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,940
Alright, Captain Liang.

152
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,620
Thank you.

153
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,210
I feel rejuvenated now.

154
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,890
I can return to my work.

155
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,790
Hope your hand recovers well.

156
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,790
Do you still remember the tips

157
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,480
I taught you about staying safe?

158
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,620
Don't travel alone.

159
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,810
Do not stay in the hotel alone.

160
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,820
Set the speed dial

161
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,100
to call the police.

162
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,080
Shut the doors and windows
when alone at home.

163
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,820
Do not put down the home address
for deliveries.

164
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,100
Take note of the location

165
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,290
of lifts, stairs and alarms.

166
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,300
Aside from that,

167
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,770
no matter how fast a lift goes,

168
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,620
a person running

169
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,820
can catch up to it

170
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,940
within three floors.

171
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,140
So during emergencies,

172
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,380
in order to ditch pursuers,

173
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,510
choose to go further than three floors.

174
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,540
Press more floors if needed

175
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,030
to confuse the pursuer.

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,980
Anything around me

177
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,540
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

178
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,980
If I really can't get away,

179
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,960
then go to somewhere with people
and call for help.

180
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,760
Captain Liang.

181
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,500
What you've told me,

182
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,680
I have them etched in my mind.

183
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,300
I won't forget it.

184
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,910
Not bad.

185
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,450
I'm off.

186
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,270
Dr Zhang.

187
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,290
Doctor.

188
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,410
Why are you here?

189
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,070
This is Ke Wei's grandmother.

190
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,390
We just came from the
Public Security Bureau.

191
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
We were told Ke Wei was sent here.

192
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,190
How is he?

193
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,450
Doctor.

194
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,170
He's badly injured.

195
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,710
What's most life-threatening is that

196
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,510
the foreign object pierced
through the right atrium

197
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,790
penetrating the heart

198
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,110
and right chest,

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,570
straight up the right side of the neck.

200
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,040
In addition,

201
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,500
the cut in the right atrium

202
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,360
is very close to the coronary artery.

203
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,090
We haven't been able to determine

204
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,280
if the aorta is damaged.

205
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,460
We can only

206
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,340
find out during the operation.

207
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,010
Doctor, please, I'm begging you.

208
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,580
You have to save him.

209
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,860
He is

210
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,250
the only heir of the family.

211
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
Madam.

212
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,970
Please calm down.

213
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,050
Tell me.

214
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,700
Does he have any criminal record

215
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,400
or history of mental illness?

216
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,090
No, none.

217
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,480
My grandson has always been good.

218
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,090
He's a good kid.

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,320
Doctor,

220
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,810
this man is very important
in our following investigation.

221
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,500
Please do your best to save him.

222
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,500
Don't worry.

223
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,060
As a doctor,

224
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,220
we'll do everything in our power.

225
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,900
Thank you.

226
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,810
If there are no problems,

227
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,570
please sign this consent form.

228
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,730
I can't believe you agreed
to do the operation.

229
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,160
What to do.

230
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,360
Director Chen is overseas.

231
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,730
Dr Lu is sick.

232
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,260
I'm the only one with experience
treating foreign matter penetration.

233
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,530
Who else is going to do it?

234
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,160
He blew up several people today.

235
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,690
That's why we need to save him,

236
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,290
so that he can be interrogated.

237
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,950
Putting aside his injuries,

238
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,900
the incident today is a huge deal.

239
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,060
Have you considered the risks
of saving him?

240
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,490
The police will be monitoring.

241
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,890
Our media department will be
recording the whole process.

242
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,830
Besides,

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,730
if something did happen,

244
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,990
I could only blame it on bad luck.

245
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,330
You can just ignore it.

246
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,090
You should at least wait
for the results

247
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,280
to his infectious diseases check

248
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,710
before performing the operation.

249
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,180
There's no time.

250
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,170
He may die at any moment.

251
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,410
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

252
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,180
You're unbelievable.

253
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,660
You always think you're right.

254
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,580
Be it at work

255
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,970
or in relationships.

256
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,540
You and Chen Meng Zhen

257
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,080
are not compatible at all.

258
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,370
You and I are compatible.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,250
We're both smart and cautious.

260
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,440
How did that end up?

261
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,170
Dr Zhang,

262
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,720
the patient's blood pressure is falling.

263
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,580
What's the situation?

264
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,890
He's spazzing non-stop.

265
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,740
Begin anaesthesia.

266
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,710
Okay.

267
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,740
Ke Wei,

268
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,690
it doesn't matter what happened before.

269
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,620
Right now, you're my patient.

270
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,310
I'm trying to save you.

271
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,630
I hope to get your cooperation.

272
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,980
At least, let your family

273
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,410
see you again, all right?

274
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,470
Ready to open the chest.

275
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,250
[Steady.]

276
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,820
[Let's finish it in one go.]

277
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,990
[Ready.]

278
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,540
[One, two.]

279
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,560
Apply pressure.

280
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,770
Use the hemostatic forceps.

281
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,040
Over here.

282
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,410
[Sorry, sir.]

283
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,070
It's okay.

284
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,290
Stop the bleeding with gauze.

285
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,950
I'm going to change my gloves.

286
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,920
Okay.

287
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,560
The blood pressure continues to drop.

288
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,270
The pulmonary artery is badly damaged.

289
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,610
Quick, hasten the blood transfusion.

290
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,890
Increase noradrenaline. Quickly!

291
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,050
Move it!

292
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,570
[In operation]

293
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,200
Doctor...

294
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,940
How is my grandson?

295
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,880
Say... Say something.

296
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,290
Say something.

297
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,770
It will be okay.

299
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,440
My grandson.

300
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,260
Mi Gu.

301
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,920
Xia Chu.

302
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,260
I've been looking for you.

303
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,610
Wait for me at the ER night shift room.

304
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,240
I'll be right there.

305
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,110
This sentence

306
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,610
lacks punch.

307
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,920
But I can't come up

308
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,350
with a better expression.

309
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,410
Highlight it.

310
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,180
We'll go over it again during editing.

311
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,810
Okay.

312
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,890
This is everything.

313
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,050
I'll take a copy with me.

314
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,370
Xiao Xiao.

315
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,120
Have you ever thought about

316
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,800
changing your job?

317
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,490
Why do you ask?

318
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,410
Just curious.

319
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,540
Say for instance

320
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,880
you're dating a very busy man

321
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,390
who is abroad.

322
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,060
You two love each other.

323
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,840
Are you willing to change your job

324
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,890
for the sake of your future

325
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,430
and move to be with him?

326
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,750
Why am I the one to switch jobs?

327
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,980
Why can't he?

328
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,120
His profession is a little special.

329
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,140
It's not up to him

330
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,850
to decide whether he can leave.

331
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,890
You're talking about Liang Mu Ze, right?

332
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,190
It doesn't matter who it is.

333
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,830
I just want to know,

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,260
if you were in their shoes...

335
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,230
I won't.

336
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,230
You're so sure?

337
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,450
Do you know

338
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,580
what the words I heard the most

339
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,770
since young are?

340
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,460
In primary school,

341
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,110
I got first place.

342
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,280
The elders and teachers would say,

343
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,500
"A girl"

344
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,040
"only performs well in primary school."

345
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,280
When I was in middle school,
I got first again.

346
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,280
Once again, the elders and teachers said,

347
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,190
"The boys haven't shown
their true power."

348
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,320
I got into the Science Experimental Class
in high school.

349
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,540
The Math teacher's favourite phrase was,

350
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,190
"I don't expect anything much
from girls on this question."

351
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,630
"But if the boys got this wrong,"

352
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,070
"they will be caned."

353
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,160
It didn't matter I could answer all of it.

354
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,690
When I got into
the Military Medical University,

355
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,440
at the start of my internship,

356
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,010
my supervisor would say,

357
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,070
"Females are strong in theory."

358
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,240
"But when it comes to actual practice,"

359
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,710
"men are still better."

360
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,490
In today's medical environment,

361
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,690
doctors are not allowed to make mistakes.

362
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,750
Especially female doctors.

363
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,630
One mistake

364
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,210
and that might destroy any hope
of holding a surgery knife.

365
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,380
So,

366
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,890
I've endured 27 years

367
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,270
of hardship.

368
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,250
There's no way I could give up
my career

369
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,970
over a man.

370
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
However,

371
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,420
I've given it serious thought.

372
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,350
To be like Professor Lin Qiao Zhi,

373
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,940
remain single my whole life.

374
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,810
I'll only live for myself.

375
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,430
A lifetime is long, Xiao Xiao.

376
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,220
Don't you find

377
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,340
such nonchalance boring?

378
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,510
But it's the kind of boredom I chose.

379
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,690
Done.

380
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,210
I've seen the proposal.

381
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,220
I think

382
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,370
the topic is still somewhat vague.

383
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,330
Let's work on it some more.

384
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,770
Also,

385
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,930
confirm next week's guest
soonest possible.

386
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,270
The styling?

387
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,840
We'll decide when I get back.

388
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,640
Bye-bye.

389
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,630
Done with work?

390
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,440
Where is the granny?

391
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,640
The village chief is waiting
in the car with her.

392
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,910
Why did you want to see me?

393
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,980
She's Ke Wei's grandmother.

394
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,650
Who?

395
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,700
Ke Wei.

396
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,740
The delivery guy who sent you the parcel.

397
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,690
How did you know them?

398
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,000
I met them while working on

399
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,140
the 'left-behind children' project.

400
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,670
We've kept in touch.

401
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,690
So,

402
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,200
do you know him well?

403
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,900
Was he like this before?

404
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,150
Did he have aggressive tendencies?

405
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,380
The young man seemed honest.

406
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,400
Aside from being a little quiet,

407
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,380
I didn't find anything wrong
with his personality.

408
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,160
Then why would he...

409
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,690
I'm not sure.

410
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,120
Maybe

411
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,870
it has something

412
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,420
to do with the things he'd
been reading on the Internet.

413
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,160
What's that?

414
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,170
I found this photo

415
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,920
on his computer.

416
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,500
Why would he have a photo like that?

417
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,730
Did you report it?

418
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,470
Because I called the police,

419
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,890
that's how I found out
what happened

420
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,210
and hurried here.

421
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,650
His grandma is devastated.

422
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,100
She's lived her whole life
in the countryside,

423
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,060
a good, honest life.

424
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,710
Now, suddenly

425
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,930
She's dumb-struck.

426
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,000
She kept asking

427
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,870
if she could visit the officer
who was injured.

428
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,810
I understand.

429
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,720
At this point in time,

430
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,300
an apology is meaningless.

431
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,910
But it is the grandma's
sincere wish after all.

432
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,710
Could you

433
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,170
pull some strings?

434
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,140
How about this?

435
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,020
When the patient has stabilized

436
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,190
and the family has calmed down,
we'll discuss it.

437
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,450
There's one more thing.

438
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,200
What is it?

439
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,670
Zhuo Ran and I are together.

440
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,510
Does that upset you?

441
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,860
No.

442
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,980
But I want to tell you this.

443
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,410
Treat him like a stranger

444
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,850
and get to know him once more.

445
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,410
Keep yourself safe.

446
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,320
Don't fall too hard, too quickly.

447
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,550
Also,

448
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,990
between you and him,

449
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,540
I'm forever your friend.

450
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,770
Let's have dinner tomorrow night.

451
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,860
I have a lot I want to tell you.

452
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,330
Sure.

453
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,020
[On the 25th of December, 2009,]

454
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,290
[during a military office operation,]

455
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,670
[a drug dealer kidnapped]

456
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,660
[the son of his accomplice,
who just turned 18.]

457
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,780
Xia Chu.

458
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,220
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

459
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,700
An injured that was sent in

460
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,620
is not doing well.

461
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,810
I need to check on him.

462
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,360
[Let me ask you something.]

463
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,040
Can you sign for Bed 14's patient?

464
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,200
Okay.

465
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,720
What is it?

466
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,720
Thanks, Dr Xia.

467
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,650
[What did Zhuo Ran's
parents do in the past?]

468
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,290
I only know that

469
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,130
his mother's health is not good.

470
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,900
As for his father,

471
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,180
I don't think he ever spoke about him.

472
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,050
[Why did you suddenly ask?]

473
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm currently

474
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,350
sorting out tapes in the resource room.

475
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,070
I came across this drug dealer's son.

476
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,970
He looked so much like Zhuo Ran.

477
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,500
Dr Xia.

478
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,720
I'll talk to you later. I have to go.

479
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,370
Dr Xia!

480
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,470
Dr Xia.

481
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,570
I'm Li Lei's wife.

482
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,610
Could you please play this for him?

483
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,560
I'm sure he'd wake up after hearing this.

484
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,140
Please help.

485
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,430
The patient's condition is serious.

486
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,630
We need six pints of blood.

487
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,010
Please hurry up.

488
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,990
The patient just became a parent.

489
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,190
Okay, thanks.

490
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,790
Is the condition very bad?

491
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,100
Severe septic shock.

492
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,500
The coagulation index is a mess.

493
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,650
The drugs have failed to stabilize
his brood pressure.

494
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,740
Administer more drugs.

495
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,220
Transfuse the blood once it arrives.

496
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,250
Got it.

497
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,250
Hang in there.

498
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,250
Bear it with a bit more.

499
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,450
Once this is over,

500
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,930
you'll be able to see your family.

501
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,350
Hi, can you please hasten
the delivery of plasma?

502
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,890
The patient in ER needs it urgently.

503
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,050
Thank you.

504
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,260
[Emergency Department]

505
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,810
The blood pressure is stabilizing.

506
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,100
So,

507
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,930
did he say anything in the end?

508
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,290
He was put under general anaesthesia.

509
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,340
He was unconscious.

510
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,100
How about before that?

511
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,110
During your attempt to save him,

512
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,900
had he mentioned any names?

513
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,860
He had been in shock.

514
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,480
When he was on the operation table,

515
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,720
he started having spasms.

516
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,740
Okay, that will do for now.

517
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,010
Thanks for your help, Dr Zhang.

518
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,080
Don't mention it.

519
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,980
Thanks.

520
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,950
Thank you.

521
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,780
The heartbeat is abnormal.

522
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,810
Ready the defibrillator.

523
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,740
200 joules. Get ready.

524
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,120
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,500
[Hello?]

526
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,570
Hey, Meng Zhen.

527
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm off work.

528
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,250
What about going for a movie?

529
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:08,930
[I'm sorry.]

530
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,170
[I'm not free.]

531
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,140
Wait.

532
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,040
About what happened,

533
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,800
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

534
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,760
I'd like to explain to you in person.

535
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,600
[I can't right now.]

536
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,430
[I have customers at the shop.]

537
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,710
I can go and help.

538
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,870
[It's okay.]

539
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,180
[Talk again next time.]

540
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,730
Have tea, aunty.

541
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,360
Thank you.

542
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,430
You're welcome.

543
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,250
Just now,

544
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,130
I took a look around your shop.

545
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,910
The furnishings

546
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,700
aren't what I expected.

547
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,790
It's quite Westernised.

548
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,330
Thanks.

549
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,420
Independent book stores like this

550
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,100
are commonly found elsewhere too.

551
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,530
If you're free,

552
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,790
you should check them out.

553
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,550
Most people buy books online now.

554
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,250
Hardly anyone visits book stores.

555
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,200
Buying books online
is a form of consumerism.

556
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,230
Visiting book stores is a lifestyle.

557
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,250
Each has pros and cons.

558
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,440
They do not overlap.

559
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
Does Yi Chi

560
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,310
know I came to see you?

561
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,400
Thank you.

562
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,740
My visit today

563
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,260
is a little sudden.

564
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,630
Since I met you the other day,

565
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,490
I haven't been able

566
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,200
to sleep the past days.

567
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,770
Yi Chi's dad told me

568
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,360
to be more open-minded

569
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,770
about you and him.

570
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,100
Honestly,

571
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,060
I am unable to do so.

572
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,770
I know my son well.

573
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,530
These past years,

574
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,840
he's had a few girlfriends.

575
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,790
They didn't last long.

576
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,980
As for the ones he brought home,

577
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,940
it was only perfunctory.

578
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,590
But, there's a good saying.

579
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,190
Dating and marriage

580
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,650
are two different things.

581
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,550
If you two

582
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,070
were still youngsters in your 20s,

583
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,920
dating and spending a few years together

584
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,280
wouldn't have required me to butt in.

585
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,170
But the fact is,

586
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,300
both of you are no longer young.

587
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,320
Especially you.

589
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,699
It is not easy for you

590
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,130
to raise a child alone.

591
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,909
Compared to

but improbable relationship,

594
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,290
I think

595
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,220
a stable marriage

596
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,790
is what you need.

597
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,290
Clearly,

598
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,950
my son

599
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,940
isn't the suitable marriage candidate
for you.

600
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,640
I worry that he's wasting your time.

601
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,330
What do you think, Chen?

602
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,250
Chen?

603
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,380
Aunty.

604
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,860
Don't be anxious.

605
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,790
Before he can waste my time,

606
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,410
I first have to allow him to.

607
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,480
I never said I'd let him.

608
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,930
So there's no reason

609
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,490
to say he's wasting anyone's time.

610
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,690

611
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,440

We'll wait for you inside then. Be quick.

613
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,560
Okay.

614
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,240

621

As such,

622
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,130
the fact that a huge tear occurred

623
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,240

That is why I'm here today.

You are Xiao Jun's mother.

692
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,970
the reason I did not answer

693
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,570
wasn't because I was unsure,

694
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,640
but because to me,

695
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,640
this wasn't something
I had to think about at all.

696
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,050
I even thought that

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,070
we won't have
our own children in the future.

698
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,110
He alone is enough.

699
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,280
That's what I thought.

700
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,050
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell them.

701
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,900
In that situation,

702
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,610
I wouldn't want to tell you either.

703
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,960
I thought maybe I was being hasty.

704
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,480
That you wouldn't believe me.

705
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,850
Why me?

706
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,130
Maybe it's fate.

707
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,150
The whys don't matter.

708
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,500
I just know we get along.

711
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,380
So my credentials don't matter.

712
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,640
Even if I'm not the best,

713
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,610
right?

714
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,370
Right.

715
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,480
But it matters to me.

716
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,540
The man I want to marry

717
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,410
has to see me as the best.

718
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,730
My family and career,

719
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,590
everything I've gone through

720
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,340
has created the best version of me today.

721
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,870
He would marry me

722
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,580
because he knows he's making
the best choice,

723
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,730
not because he's making a huge sacrifice.

724
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,170
I care about that.

725
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,820
I don't see the difference!

726
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,610
It's just semantics!

727
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,170
There is,

728
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,260
Dr Zhang.

729
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,850
Maybe you're used to having
everything go your way.

730
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,140
You've never seen

731
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,050
the other road that is full of potholes

732
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,670
and covered in mud.

733
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,860
Sacrifice is a momentary satisfaction.

734
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,380
It has to be sincere acceptance

735
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,250
for two to

736
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,320
This is what my late husband said

737
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,960
when he proposed to me.

738
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,730
I still remember now that he's gone.

739
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,800
He wasn't as polished as you.

740
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,690
He was a brute military man.

741
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,070
I was his biggest pride.

742
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,580
Am I yours?

743
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,780
We are from two different worlds.

744
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,370
The closer we get,

745
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,080
the harder it becomes.

a very professional variety

756
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,030
of the C-4 bomb.

757
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,140
Previously,

758
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,540
the composition bomb that was used

759
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,820
in the Isaia incident

760
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,860
was very similar

761
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,170
the the one used this time.

762
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,480
Should I say this is T4's

763
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,780
signature?

764
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,900
When Old Master's goods

765
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,930
were confiscated at the border,

766
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,480
he mentioned this to me.

767
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,360
That he'd get revenge
in Ningjiang.

768
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,990
Why didn't you say anything?

769
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,110
I thought he wouldn't dare.

770
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,020
You thought?

771
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,220
Because of your assumption,

772
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,280
Officer Rao and Officer Li

773
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,500
are hospitalized.

774
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,320
My mother is in his hands.

775
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,080
Her life is at stake.

776
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,240
How

777
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,050
did he get in touch with the deliveryman?

778
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,940
City of Desire.

779
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,210
Scary Pirate.

780
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,210
Scary Pirate?

781
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,970
That's Old Master?

782
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,730
Scary Pirate is just an ID.

783
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,990
Is it not?

784
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,690
If Old Master wants it,

785
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,200
anyone

786
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,260
can be the person using the ID.

787
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,000
Ask him what Old Master's goal is.

788
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,380
Why did Old Master

789
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,290
do this?

790
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,680
Maybe it's for revenge.

791
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,590
Listen carefully.

792
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,150
If you wish to save your mother,

793
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,730
you better buckle up.

794
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,890
We expect your full cooperation
in the investigation

795
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,930
and subsequent operation.

796
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,840
Thank you for watching my stream.

797
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,040
If you enjoyed it,

798
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,360
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.,

799
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,590
I'll be here waiting for you all
at Room 2924.

800
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,150
Love you!

801
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,030
[Zhuo Ran]

802
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,590
Hello.

803
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,100
[Nice song.]

804
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,290
[2924.]

805
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,900
[You watched my live stream?]

806
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,930
It was more interesting than I thought.

807
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,380
Thanks for the compliment.

808
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,310
You have no idea

809
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,850
the amount of preparation I have to do

810
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,570
for the 2-hour stream every night.

811
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,010
[What about your work?]

812
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,570
I still do it. This is extra income.

813
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,080
It doesn't affect my main job.

814
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,330
[Later, I still have
to update my website.]

815
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,670
So hardworking.

816
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,010
Aren't you tired?

817
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,010
I am.

818
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,250
How could I not be tired?

819
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,340
But no matter how tired,

820
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,080
I just have to sit by the full-height
window of my house

821
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,540
and I'll feel like my energy

822
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,310
has been

823
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,200
recharged.

824
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,980
[Zhuo Ran.]

825
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,190
[Back then,]

826
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,070
[why did you leave
without saying goodbye?]

827
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,280
Did Xia Chu ask you to ask me?

828
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,250
No.

829
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,290
I'm the one who wants to know.

830
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,700
[Is it because of your father?]

831
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,380
Why did you suddenly bring him up?
