00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,120
[Episode 36]

4
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,380
He got high on anaesthesia.

5
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,900
He is talking nonsense.

6
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,110
He is talking nonsense.

7
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,700
But you feel happy after hearing it.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,100
Who's talking nonsense?

9
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm Sailor Moon.

10
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,650
In the name of the Moon, I'll punish you!

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,790
Oh my.

12
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,840
Isn't this Sailor Moon's catchphrase?

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,220
I can't believe

14
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,630
I'm hearing this
from a special forces soldier.

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,780
Did you teach him that?

16
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,190
No. I...

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,540
No.

18
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,070
Sailor Moon

19
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,230
is

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,530
a couple gift from her.

21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,880
Liang Mu Ze.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,310
A set of Sailor Moon bed sheet.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,930
Liang Mu Ze, keep quiet.

24
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,490
Bed sheet?

25
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,340
No.

26
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,810
You don't need to explain it.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,020
Your dad is here.

28
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,170
He's waiting at the door.

29
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,960
What are you doing? Just go.

30
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,780
Check his body temperature.

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,250
His face was hot just now.

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,350
Xia Chu.

33
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,640
Xia Chu.

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,960
Xia Chu.

35
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,880
I love you.

36
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,540
Stop it. Captain Liang.

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,540
Let me check

38
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,090
your body temperature.

39
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,100
Where did you come from?

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,020
I came from my mother's womb.

41
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,050
Why did you come here?

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,850
What do you think?

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,190
After receiving the call from your unit,

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,500
I was frightened.

45
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,220
So I asked your grandpa to contact

46
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,690
the leader at your war zone.

47
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,200
When I heard that you're safe

48
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,590
and have completed the exercise,

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,520
I came to see you immediately.

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,980
You asked Grandpa for help?

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,620
It's all because of you.

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,230
I can do everything

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,640
for you.

54
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,500
So...

55
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,790
Does Mum know about it?

56
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,290
I dare not tell her.

57
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,900
Although I normally do things slowly,

58
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,180
when a big problem occurs,

59
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,690
I am very clear-headed.

60
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,390
I've informed your grandpa.

61
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,670
So she won't know about this.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't worry.

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,370
I'm sorry, Dad.

64
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,860
You have your own life.

65
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,180
I can't

66
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,270
make decisions for you.

67
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,330
But

68
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,040
you have to think carefully

69
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,560
about it.

70
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,310
I've thought about it.

71
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,120
However...

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,420
However?

73
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,480
If

74
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,060
I don't become

75
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,960
a great doctor

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,460
who makes history,

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,460
will you be disappointed?

78
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,530
I

79
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,240
have overcome

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,700
many difficulties in life.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,010
So many.

82
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,960
To me,

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,770
I only have one most important

84
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,040
masterpiece.

85
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,970
And that is you.

86
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,080
So

87
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,450
since the day you were born,

88
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,440
no matter what job you do,

89
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,850
be it a success or failure,

90
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,690
my answer

91
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,280
remains the same.

92
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,360
I want to join Liang Mu Ze

93
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,280
at his outpost.

94
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,690
Life is short.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,610
I hope

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,040
you will be happy.

97
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,530
Life can be long too.

98
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,960
So

99
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,760
you must find carefully

100
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,080
the one who will be your life partner.

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,720
But

102
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,120
don't worry about making mistakes.

103
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,060
Dad and Mum will always be with you.

104
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,120
Got it?

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,680
Yes.

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,760
Thank you, Dad.

107
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,560
I will be very happy.

108
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,510
The moon is lingering...

109
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,010
Brigade Commander.

110
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,930
Don't sit up.

111
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,040
Just lie down.

112
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,320
Are you okay?

113
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm okay.

114
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,840
I had some allergies.

115
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,970
I'm fine now.

116
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,450
What about you?

117
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,250
I'm fine.

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,760
I just had a few stitches.

119
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,400
Good to hear that.

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,380
Actually

121
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,440
the command post told me

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,640
that the foreigner who got caught

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,760
mentioned about Tian Yong.

124
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,880
This is the photo

125
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,560
given by the police.

126
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,930
It's confirmed

127
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,970
that he is

128
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,480
the commander.

129
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,660
What's the matter?

130
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,940
Do you know him?

131
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,690
His name is

132
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,180
Zhuo Ran.

133
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,560
He's Xia Chu's first love.

134
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,640
He was missing since 18 years old.

135
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,440
He just came back
to the country this year.

136
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,610
You're right.

137
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,360
When he was missing,

138
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,450
he was using another identity.

139
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,120
He was in the military
and have been at war.

140
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,880
He's the most valuable mercenary
in the world right now.

141
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,960
One of the representatives
in the foreign armed forces

142
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,360
is a former comrade in arms.

143
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,770
What is his other name?

144
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,799
Pei Yu.

145
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,570
You're not the first one
who said that I'm lucky.

146
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,760
Who else?

147
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,380
He was not a comrade in arms.

148
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,890
Before you,

149
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,560
he was my only failure.

150
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,900
Who is this guy?

151
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,680
Pei Yu.

152
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,610
The higher-ups gave order

153
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,810
to have liaison between
the police and the military

154
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,090
for a full search.

155
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,680
Is there any news?

156
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,960
As of now,

157
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,200
we are stepping up the search.

158
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,200
Your mission

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,390
is to focus on recovery.

160
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,100
[Miss Mi Gu, I have received
the amended proposal.]

161
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,970
[What shall we do next?]

162
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,660
[Mi Gu.]

163
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,010
[Do you have 10 thousand RMB?]

164
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,490
[I'm doing a business with my friends.]

165
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,960
[I still need some money
to join the partnership.]

166
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,680
[You must help your brother.]

167
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,690
[Call him before weekend.]

168
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,530
[Help him to achieve his dream
to start a business.]

169
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,610
[Miss Mi Gu, are you feeling better?]

170
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,620
[Mi Gu.]

171
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,580
[I found someone else
to manage your programme.]

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,920
[You take a rest at home.]

173
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,030
I'm warning you.

174
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,880
Don't call me again!

175
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,660
[Mi Gu.]

176
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,280
Zhuo Ran?

177
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,410
Is that you?

178
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,760
[Yes, it's me.]

179
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,850
Did anyone follow you here?

180
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,720
No.

181
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,470
I have deleted

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,770
the address that you sent to me.

183
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,600
I've applied a long leave.

184
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,450
May I know the reason?

185
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,680
Let's go to the hospital.

186
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,970
Zhuo Ran.

187
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,920
Zhuo Ran.

188
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm cold.

189
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm cold.

190
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,750
So cold.

191
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm cold.

192
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,330
♫ I'd like to find out ♫

193
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,010

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,960
♫ I'm putting on my best performance ♫

196
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm cold.

197
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,570
Mum.

198
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,730
Why did you only take my brother with you?

199
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,370
You're unfair.

200
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,330
Are you going to abandon me?

201
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,610
Don't leave me.

202
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,930
Don't leave me.

203
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,400
Don't go.

204
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,480
Don't leave me here.

205
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,280
I won't go.

206
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,570
I won't leave you here.

207
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,080
I won't leave you here.

208
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,610
The Training Unit
and Public Security Bureau

209
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,240
has confirmed his identity.

210
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,080
According to their analysis,

211
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,770
it's highly possible

212
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,360
that he came back to the city.

213
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,320
They have asked us
to do a thorough investigation.

214
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
[Find out his whereabouts]

215
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,620
[as soon as possible.]

216
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,640
Yes, sir.

217
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,380
Unit One.

218
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,290
Continue to track Tian Yong.

219
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Unit Two, follow me.

220
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,800
Xia Chu.

222
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,890
Xia Chu.

223
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,040
Xia Chu, there is a problem.

224
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,610
Liang Mu Ze's condition is not good.

225
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,800
Go have a look.

226
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,810
Sir.

227
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,859
How is he now?

228
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,119
He has high fever.

229
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,040
He also has indirect muscle spasms.

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,170
From my initial findings,

231
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,970
his wound is infected.

232
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,880
Infected?

233
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,120
I've taken his blood sample.

234
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,690
I will take it to the hospital
for testing.

235
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,610
Xia Chu.

236
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't stand there. Hurry up.

237
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,880
Xia Chu.

238
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,600
What?

239
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,210
Send him back to the hospital.

240
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,580
The condition here is not ideal.

241
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,580
Yes.

242
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,240
Let's do it together.

243
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,170
Don't worry, Commander Dong.

244
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,140
I will report Captain Liang's condition

245
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,520
to you.

246
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,000
Thank you, Xia Chu.

247
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,540
Dad, I'll get going.

248
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,510
Go.

249
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,100
Be careful.

250
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,010
[According to the test results,]

251
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,080
[Rescue Room]

252
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,240
[it should be
Acinetobacter Baumannii infection.]

253
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,860
[We have sent Liang Mu Ze]

254
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,200
[to the emergency room.]

255
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,070
[After several consultations,]

256
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,830
[we put on high dosage of sulbactam]

257
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,840
[and combined with tigecycline.]

258
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,930
[We hope it can control]

259
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,240
[the bacteria in his body.]

260
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,480
Is it controlled?

261
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,600
We are unable to confirm that now.

262
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,120
After some time,

263
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,410
we will do an analysis

264
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,530
of the bacteria in his body.

265
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,680
Only then,

266
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,840
will we know if the medicine is effective.

267
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,810
So...

268
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,400
If it is not effective,

269
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,210
what will happen?

270
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,480
We have prepared several plans.

271
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,200
If this doesn't work,

272
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,760
we will try another plan.

273
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,760
He should have changed jobs.

274
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,560
If he hadn't joined the exercise,
he wouldn't be injured.

275
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,260
His wound wouldn't have been infected too.

276
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,220
Enough.

277
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,690
Don't have to say it.

278
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,900
Sir.

279
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,120
Madam.

280
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,970
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,190
I didn't

282
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,850
take care of Mu Ze.

283
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,360
It's not your fault.

284
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,650
He's an adult.

285
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,720
He should be responsible

286
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,880
for his decision.

287
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,760
Liang Ren Dong.

288
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,080
You're so heartless.

289
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,720
Director Song.

290
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,920
Can we visit him?

291
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,440
His body is very weak now.

292
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,440
It's better not to enter the ward.

293
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,670
I understand.

294
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,600
We won't enter the ward.

295
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,440
We will look from outside.

296
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,740
Sure.

297
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,050
Xiao Xiao.

298
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,040
Did I wash my hands

299
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,080
before stitching the wound?

300
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't remember.

301
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,490
I don't remember anything.

302
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,040
Of course, you don't remember it.

303
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,000
You don't have to remember it.

304
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,420
It's a classical conditioning

305
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,080
in every surgeon.

306
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,840
It's impossible that you will forget.

307
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,700
Please.

308
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,640
Don't be so paranoid.

309
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,540
They are still checking

310
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,090
why he was infected.

311
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,820
There is no conclusion yet.

312
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,180
Why do you take responsibility

313
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,880
for that?

314
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,280
Do you want more conflicts to happen?

315
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,460
I...

316
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,830
Hello.

317
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,200
[Xia Chu.]

318
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,670
[Director Chen wants you and Xiao Xiao]

319
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,280
[to come to the meeting room.]

320
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,720
Now?

321
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,820
[Yes.]

322
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,580
Sir, Xia Chu reports.

323
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,040
Come in.

324
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,360
Sir, are you looking for me?

325
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,810
Where is Xiao Xiao?

326
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,540
She was stopped by
the patient's family members.

327
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,680
She will be here soon.

328
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,760
Let's start.

329
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,160
Recently,

330
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,650
there have been

331
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,920
two surgical site infection cases.

332
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,080
It's caused by Acinetobacter Baumannii.

333
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,600
First patient, Liu Ran

334
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,480
has passed away.

335
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,170
And now, the patient

336
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,170
is Liang Mu Ze.

337
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,240
Currently,

338
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,610
he is in emergency intensive care unit.

339
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,520
We are not sure what will happen.

340
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,810
If

341
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,840
the first case was an accident,

342
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,880
then we have to

343
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,210
take the second case

344
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,800
very seriously.

345
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,460
Today,

346
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,760
I have invited

347
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,280
all the resident doctors here

348
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,000
not to criticise anyone

349
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,620
or

350
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,810
to hold someone accountable.

351
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,890
I just hope that we can gather

352
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,320
and listen

353
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,370
to other's experiences

354
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,600
in clinical treatment.

355
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,120
So that you may benefit

356
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,970
and improve yourself.

357
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,120
Xia Chu.

358
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,480
You go first.

359
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,020
You have dealt

360
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,280
with both patients.

361
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,560
Especially Liang Mu Ze.

362
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,560
You stitched his wound.

363
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,800
What's your opinion

364
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,000
about his infection?

365
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,700
Did you

366
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,960
overlook anything

367
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,880
when you were treating him?

368
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,940
Xia Chu.

369
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,400
Mr Zhou is talking to you.

370
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,880
To be honest,

371
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,210
I have been

372
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,160
asking myself this question
in the past two days.

373
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,010
Outdoor...

374
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,120
During war...

375
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,120
In that setting,

376
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,570
it may not be possible to achieve

377
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,200
a germ-free situation
like in the hospital.

378
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm worried that this happened

379
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,200
because of my careless mistake.

380
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,600
But it wasn't.

381
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,170
When I was treating Liang Mu Ze,

382
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,050
I am certain

383
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,640
that I was very careful.

384
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,780
There wasn't any operational problem.

385
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,890
Sir, Xiao Xiao reports.

386
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,320
Come in.

387
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,540
Xiao Xiao.

388
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,440
You were at the site during the rescue.

389
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,330
Xiao Xiao.

390
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,770
What's your evaluation

391
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,560
on how Xia Chu treated the patient?

392
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,570
You witnessed the entire process.

393
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,520
You were the bystander.

394
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,970
Perhaps you saw other details.

395
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,090
All I can say is that

396
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,280
she was very serious

397
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,720
but she wasn't calm.

398
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,010
I don't think this is
how a professional doctor

399
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,920
should be when treating a patient.

400
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,360
So

401
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,000
about the prevention of
Acinetobacter Baumannii,

402
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,350
do you have any opinion?

403
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,650
We can discuss.

404
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,920
Okay?

405
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,420
[You knew what happened.]

406
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,570
We have been through
a life-and-death situation.

407
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,000
Of course, I know.

408
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,000
That's why I asked if you could do it.

409
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,730
You said you can.

410
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,000
You insisted to put the stitches for him.

411
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,690
I understand

412
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,730
that you wanted to save him.

413
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,960
But you weren't calm, were you?

414
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,990
[I thought we were friends.]

415
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,480
I don't know what
your definition of a friend is.

416
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,930
I treat you as my friend.

417
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,400
That's why I want to tell you that

418
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,340
when you're facing this patient,

419
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,780
you personal feelings have taken over

420
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,680
your professional ethics.

421
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,230
When Mr Zhou

422
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,940
asked me about my opinion,

423
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,450
I voiced out my intuition.

424
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,020
I didn't want to lie.

425
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,220
I didn't ask you to lie.

426
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,850
You just had to keep quiet.

427
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,520
Isn't this your forte?

428
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,240
I know you want to be
the chief resident doctor.

429
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,520
I never thought

430
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,610
that you would think that way.

431
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,760
I never thought

432
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,910
that you would think that way.

433
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,960
[Xia Chu.]

434
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,050
Mr Zhang.

435
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,400
Are you busy now?

436
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,880
It's regarding Mu Ze's medical condition.

437
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,760
His condition is bad.

438
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,040
I really want to save him.

439
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,170
But I don't know

440
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,120
what else I can do.

441
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,320
Sir, please teach me.

442
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,280
Please teach me.

443
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,740
♫ Whatever evidence ♫

444
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,460
♫ Requires no validation ♫

445
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,590
♫ It is our shared secret ♫

446
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,550
♫ Keeping it close to the heart ♫

447
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,460
♫ The embrace I long for ♫

448
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:54,350
♫ Comes up in my dreams often ♫

449
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,570
♫ If I hang in there ♫

450
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:09,820
♫ I know love will surely come, someday ♫

451
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,890
[Dear Professor Ye Jun.]

452
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,680
[I apologise for contacting you
out of the blue]

453
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,580
[I'm a doctor from]

454
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,320
[Hospital 109 of
the People's Liberation Army.]

455
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,880
[I tried calling your office phone number
but couldn't get through.]

456
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,680
[I've sent you an SMS
but you didn't reply.]

457
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,890
[I wonder]

458
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,640
[if you've received my previous email.]

459
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,570
[The patient's condition
is deteriorating.]

460
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,680
[He is starting to have septic shock.]

461
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,000
[He is in coma]

462
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,350
[and has hallucinations.]

463
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,520
[These are signs of impending death.]

464
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,680
Stay calm. Let's just wait.

465
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,440
I don't understand.

466
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,560
It's just bacteria.

467
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,410
Bacteria are found everywhere.

468
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,410
It's impossible

469
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,250
that it will take my son's life.

470
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,360
It has mutated

471
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,690
and become drug resistant.

472
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,880
All the antibiotics that we could get

473
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,250
don't work on him anymore.

474
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,160
Must you use antibiotics?

475
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,840
Can't you think of other method?

476
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,690
Besides antibiotics,

477
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,770
I don't believe

478
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,650
there's no other method
that can kill the bacteria.

479
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,920
Lower your voice.

480
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,520
Say something.

481
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,880
Aren't you doctors?

482
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,490
I'm sure you have other methods, right?

483
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,080
-Calm down.
-I can't.

484
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,040
Bacteriophage.

485
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,280
What is it?

486
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,210
Bacteriophage

487
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,530
is bacteria's worst enemy.

488
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,330
It's a special group of virus

489
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,730
that parasites on

490
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,450
selectively target bacteria or fungus

491
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,520
and replicates within bacteria.

492
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,580
It eats

493
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,560
and kill bacteria from inside.

494
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,930
It uses physical attack

495
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,000
so there isn't
antibiotic resistance problem.

496
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,540
As long as we find
the relevant bacteriophage,

497
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,690
it can kill the Acinetobacter Baumannii

498
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,200
inside his body.

499
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,760
Impossible.

500
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,700
There are many types of bacteriophage.

501
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,600
How do we find it
in such a short period of time?

502
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,140
I've contacted Professor Ye Jun

503
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,090
from Ke Hua University's
Biology Lab Center.

504
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,540
His lab

505
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,060
is doing research on phage therapy.

506
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,120
They have collected
many types of bacteriophage.

507
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,290
Moreover,

508
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,210
Acinetobacter Baumannii

509
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,100
is on their research list.

510
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,490
He is willing to provide

511
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,810
the phage therapy plan.

512
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,860
Phage therapy?

513
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,440
We have thought about it too.

514
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,490
But it is not part of
mainstream medical practice.

515
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,170
The rise of antibiotics

516
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,330
has completely pushed it aside.

517
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,730
Even if you have

518
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,130
this treatment plan,

519
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,400
you won't be able to get approval
from the department in charge.

520
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,280
We may face the risk of breaking the law.

521
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,410
Brigade Commander, Mr Dong Zhi Gang,

522
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,240
has submitted a request
to the higher-ups.

523
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,330
They will try their best

524
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,880
to talk to the department in charge,

525
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,440
and get a special arrangement.

526
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,130
What is the progress of the phage therapy

527
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,050
in their lab?

528
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,800
There is a successful case study.

529
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,400
How many cases?

530
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,480
One.

531
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,200
If the phage therapy has problems,

532
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,840
are we going

533
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,040
to lose him forever?

534
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,280
Since he joined the military,

535
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,370
we have lost him.

536
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,480
It's not the same.

537
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,290
I know he is with the special forces.

538
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,460
Even though I didn't see him,

539
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,080
I felt ease.

540
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
I...

541
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,240
I dare not think about it.

542
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,330
I dare not.

543
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,840
Let's not

544
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,080
do the phage therapy.

545
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,719
It's too risky.

546
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,000
Believe in him.

547
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,280
He will make his own choice.

548
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,980
Braised Egg.

549
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,040
Can you put on a smile?

550
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,199
I've told you

551
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,320
that you look nice when you smile.

552
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,160
Now,

553
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,360
you must be suffering.

554
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,800
Memory cleared.

555
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,360
Do you feel better now?

556
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,720
Do you still remember?

557
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,880
When I was being held hostage,

558
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,730
I was so scared

559
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,440
and you said to me,

560
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,240
"Do you trust me?"

561
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,960
"I'm here"

562
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,600
"so you will be fine".

563
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,480
This time,

564
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,480
I ask you to trust me.

565
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,120
I'm here.

566
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,490
You will be fine.

567
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,000
As long as we are together,

568
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,120
there is no difficulty
that we can't overcome.

569
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,600
Liang Mu Ze, listen carefully.

570
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,640
During the treatment,

571
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,370
you might be in even more pain.

572
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm afraid that this decision

573
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,920
is just my wishful thinking.

574
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,840
If

575
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,440
you want to give it a try,

576
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,010
please give me a sign.

577
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,310
♫ The best would be mutual affection,
having good feelings, hiding nothing ♫

578
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:12,550
♫ The best would be not answering,
anticipating, avoiding misery ♫

579
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:20,740
♫ Perhaps real happiness
is simple after all ♫

580
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,920
I got it.

581
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,490
Don't worry.

582
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,240
I will make sure you're safe.

583
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,020
I've talked to my dad.

584
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,160
He will use his network
in the medical field

585
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,050
to convince

586
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,440
the heads of relevant department.

587
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,400
We hope to get the approval earlier.

588
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,320
How's the situation on your side?

589
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,490
Professor Ye Jun has successfully

590
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,650
grown phages.

591
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,340
The treatment is all set.

592
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,340
Once we get the approval,

593
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,880
we can carry out
the treatment immediately.

594
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,450
[Outpatient Department]

595
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,060
Noradrenaline.

596
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,580
Add 30mcg per minute.

597
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,610
Atropine, 0.5mg.

598
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,960
-Prepare CPR.
-Yes.

599
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,540
Zhi Gang.

600
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,690
How is it?

601
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,260
I got it.

602
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,080
Thank you for your hard work.

603
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,700
All right.

604
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,640
What did he say?

605
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,300
There is no result yet.

606
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,600
He plans to meet the higher-ups

607
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,800
to hurry them.

608
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,200
Sir, the first batch
of bacteriophage is here.

609
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,620
Leave it there.

610
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,890
Perhaps

611
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,040
we still have to wait a little longer.

612
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,320
We can't wait anymore.

613
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,420
The patient's blood pressure, pulse

614
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,400
and oxygen saturation level is low.

615
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,410
After the shock,

616
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,800
he is now unconscious.

617
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,900
If we wait longer,

618
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,800
he will suffer organ failure.

619
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,720
We must carry out the treatment now.

620
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,980
We have not received the approval yet.

621
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,610
Director Hao.

622
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,040
We have signed the consent form.

623
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,440
We stand firm on our decision.

624
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,680
No matter what the outcome is,

625
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,250
we will accept it.

626
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,440
We will not blame the hospital.

627
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,700
Look.

628
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,010
Shall we give him

629
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,220
the medicine first?

630
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,330
Yes,

631
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,990
I understand your feelings.

632
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,880
But this treatment

633
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,430
is special.

634
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,930
Without the approval from higher-ups.

635
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,910
I'm afraid...

636
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,020
Dr Hao.

637
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,480
Liang Mu Ze is having high fever again.

638
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,480
What?

639
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,610
Xia Chu.

640
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,330
Xia Chu, what are you doing?

641
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,520
Xia Chu.

642
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,360
Xia Chu.

643
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:12,970
Dr Xia.

644
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,130
Please leave for a moment.

645
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,080
Xia Chu.

646
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,370
Open the door.

647
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,110
Xia Chu.

648
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,450
Xia Chu, open the door.

649
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,420
Xia Chu.

650
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,680
What are you doing?

651
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,660
Xia Chu.

652
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,760
What are you doing?

653
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,630
Xia Chu.

654
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,280
Open the door!

655
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,360
Xia Chu.

656
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,420
Xia Chu.

657
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,800
Stop it!

658
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,720
What are you doing?

659
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,060
I will bear the consequences.

660
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,030
You...

661
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,740
Wait for your suspension letter.

662
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,360
How is he?

663
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:45,530
♫ I had a quick glance at your eyes ♫

664
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:52,910
♫ It could be the destiny 
but it is not practical ♫

665
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,720
♫ Your expression popped up on my mind ♫

666
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:07,300
♫ I learn to face the music
instead of evading it ♫

667
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,130
♫ Remembering your interests, 
getting closer to you ♫

668
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,760
♫ If I can't predict the future, 
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

669
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:23,250
♫ I can't remember when 
I fell in love with you ♫

670
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:30,480
♫ I am afraid that
I might lose you one day ♫

671
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:37,280
♫ Every minute, every second,
how do I resist? ♫

672
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,240
♫ I can't help but look forward
to your return ♫

673
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,670
[Aunty.]

674
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:52,440
♫ Replaying the moment I fell in love ♫

675
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,360
[The phage therapy worked.]

676
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,940
[Liang Mu Ze's fever subsided.]

677
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:06,040
♫ Remembering your interests, 
getting closer to you ♫

678
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,600
♫ If I can't predict the future, 
I'll leave it up to fate ♫

679

♫ I am afraid that
