[My Dear Guardian]

3
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,070
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Are you here looking
for someone of your same kind?

5
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,150
Are you?

6
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,640
What do you think?

7
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,800
Zhuo Ran.

8
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,400
Do you love me?

9
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,310
I understand
your restlessness and loneliness,

10
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,590
as much as I understand myself.

11
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,150
To me, love

12
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,030
isn't that difficult.

13
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,210
It's just like...

14
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,360
Like what?

15
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,500
Dad.

16
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,850
Mum.

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,490
Meng Zhen.

18
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,600
Let's eat.

19
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,120
I want to drink it.

20
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,440
Xiao Jun, eat up.

21
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,910
It's okay, he can have it.

22
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,600
It helps in digestion.

23
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,730
Here.

24
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,370
Take it.

25
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,990
Try it to see if it's delicious.

26
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,510
I don't like eggplant.

27
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,190
Xiao Jun, don't be rude.

28
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,320
Zhang Yi Chi loves eggplant.

29
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,570
When I was hospitalised,

30
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,760
I saw him ordering
braised eggplant with rice.

31
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,440
Xiao Jun

32
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,630
has good memories.

33
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,150
It's not good to be a picky eater.

34
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,000
Here, let's dig in.

35
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,810
Here.

36
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,770
Okay.

37
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,930
Here.

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,390
Okay.

39
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,110
Well...

40
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,530
Meng Zhen.

41
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,360
What do you do for a living?

42
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,820
I own a bookstore.

43
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,650
I also sell clothes
that I design on my own

44
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,030
and some stationary.

45
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,160
You're self-employed.

46
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,570
Back in the university,

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,280
which course did you major in?

48
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,990
I majored in Dramatic Literature.

49
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,320
After graduating from the university,

50
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,750
I went back to my hometown and
joined an opera troupe as a screenwriter.

51
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,280
I think it's fate.

52
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,790
I decided to stay in Ningjiang.

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,909
In the end, I set up the bookstore

54
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,240
and met my late husband.

55
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,590
Your late husband?

56
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,390
He's a military officer.

57
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,790
He sacrificed in a battle eight years ago.

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,220
It's not easy to be you.

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,040
It's all right.

60
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,450
Dad.

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,530
Meng Zhen

62
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,510
is the most talented

63
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,450
among my female friends.

64
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,410
Furthermore,

65
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,030
she knows how to live a good life.

66
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,280
I bet you live under stress.

67
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,480
Everyone lives under stress these days.

68
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,360
For example, in the hospital,

69
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,120
those residents who work under me

70
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,050
usually resign within three years.

71
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,230
Do you know why?

72
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,310
Their job is tiring and worse,
they don't make much from it.

73
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,190
Their income
is not as much as self-employed.

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,880
If the job is so terrible,

75
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,600
why don't you change jobs

76
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,990
and become a bookseller too?

77
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,430
You don't say.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,310
It's crossed my mind before.

79
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,409
Meng Zhen.

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,350
Are you hiring?

81
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,390
Stop joking.

82
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,640
You're a cardiac surgeon.

83
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,930
Don't put yourself on a job
unworthy of your talents.

84
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,350
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,970
To be frank,

86
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,470
everyone can be a master
in their own special field.

87
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,790
There is

88
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,600
neither lowliness nor nobleness
in careers.

89
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,080
Be it a doctor

90
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,270
or a self-employed bookstore owner,

91
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,160
I think

92
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,910
it's just a job anyway.

93
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,200
Am I right, dad?

94
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,330
Here.

95
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,960
Try the braised eggplant.

96
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,410
Try it.

97
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,380
Here.

98
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,730
It's your son's favourite.

99
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,240
Here, try it.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,750
Mum, I need to use the washroom.

101
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,720
Sure, let me show you the way.

102
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,010
I can show him the way.

103
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,670
It's okay. I know the way.

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
Sit down.

105
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,550
Even if you don't want
to date someone of the same profession,

106
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,840
you can find someone
from another profession.

107
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,130
She could be a banker,

108
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,960
a teacher,

109
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,950
or a government servant.

110
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,270
We have introduced so many ladies to you.

111
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,830
Any of them is a good catch.

112
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,480
How aren't you fond of them?

113
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,640
Look at you.

114
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,560
You're after a lady
who got married before.

115
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,640
She has a son too.

116
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,610
What's wrong with
a lady who got married before?

117
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,030
What's wrong with that?

118
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,670
Mum, what's wrong with you?

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,790
Are you here to mess things up?

120
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,180
Mum.

121
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,760
Have you washed your hands?

122
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,490
Yes.

123
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,460
Let's go.

124
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,970
Mum.

125
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,880
I shouldn't have come with you, right?

126
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,990
No.

127
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,680
Why do you think so?

128
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,650
I can feel that

129
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,950
the old lady doesn't like me.

130
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,150
What makes you feel so?

131
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,640
She said that I'm not good.

132
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,360
You've misunderstood.

133
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,280
She doesn't mean that.

134
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,150
She thinks that it's not good
to be a picky eater.

135
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,360
Look, you're still young, right?

136
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,360
You're growing.

137
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,470
How do you grow up
if you are fussy about food?

138
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,630
She said that out of concern.

139
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,640
I criticise you at times too, right?

140
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,240
However, I'll always love you.

141
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,200
Am I right?

142
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,720
Stop thinking too much. Let's go.

143
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,040
If only I was not born.

144
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
Xiao Jun.

145
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,670
Listen carefully.

146
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,470
To me,

147
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,870
you're the most important.

148
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,800
I don't mind losing everything

149
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,390
but I can't afford to lose you.

150
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,550
Do you get it?

151
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,570
Yes.

152
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,210
That's great.

153
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,290
Be happy.

154
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,510
Be happy.

155
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,690
Let's go.

156
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,240
Listen.

157
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,550
For example, in the hospital,

158
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,600
the best surgeon

159
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,390
is not necessarily the most popular.

160
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,630
The person who suits me the best

161
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,830
is not necessarily a catch.

162
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,480
You're paranoid

163
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,360
because I don't have a girlfriend.

164
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,600
When I finally date someone,
you're being fussy.

165
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,150
I'm already 38 years old.

166
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,370
Of course.

167
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,130
I'm not compromising

168
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,110
because I'm getting old.

169
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,090
That's because Meng Zhen is outstanding.

170
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,049
She's really outstanding.

171
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,790
You haven't discovered that side of her.

172
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,360
It's destiny.

173
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,560
I accept my fate.

174
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,040
In that case,

175
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,510
you're ready to be a stepfather.

176
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,350
Xiao Jun is a good boy.

177
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,890
That's irrelevant.

178
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,860
Moving forward,

179
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,160
if you marry his mum,

180
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,480
you'll have a son all of a sudden.

181
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,150
It's not about living together
for a short period of time.

182
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,030
You'll have to live together
day in and day out.

183
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,210
It could be a few years

184
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,070
or a few decades.

185
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,120
Both of you are not blood related.

186
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,830
Are you sure

187
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,030
you can be responsible to him

188
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,910
as a stepfather?

189
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,690
Also,

190
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,120
moving forward,

191
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,720
you will have your own child.

192
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,240
You will have two children in total.

193
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,510
Are you sure when the time comes,

194
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,200
you can

195
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,400
be fair to both of them?

196
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,430
Xiao Jun.

197
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,150
You're back.

198
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,200
Xiao Jun has to go to school tomorrow.
He can't stay up.

199
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm bringing him home.

200
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,400
Enjoy the food.

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,920
Let me send you.

202
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,510
It's okay. We can go back on our own.

203
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,450
Let's go.

204
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,440
Xiao Chi!

205
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,190
I'm full.

206
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,260
You!

207
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,240
Meng Zhen.

208
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,640
Let me send you.

209
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,050
It's okay.

210
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,360
We can go back on our own.

211
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,400
By the way,

212
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,400
I've transferred the money
for the present to you.

213
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,250
Thank you

214
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,520
for preparing the present
on behalf of me.

215
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,750
What is going on?

216
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,410
Let's go.

217
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,410
Let me send you.

218
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,390
It's okay.

219
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,710
It'll be difficult to drop the habit
once it becomes one.

220
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,350
Then, I'll just keep the habit.

221
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,600
When your dad asked you the question,

222
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,890
you hesitated,

223
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,070
didn't you?

224
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm a mother with a son.

225
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,450
Hence, I can understand
your parent's feelings.

226
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,360
They just want to protect their son

227
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,080
and give what's best to their son.

228
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,790
It's understandable.

229
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,160
Therefore,
please understand my feelings too.

230
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,750
As for our relationship,

231
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,880
please give it some thought.

232
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,360
Both of us should give it some thought.

233
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,670
What do you think?

234
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,950
Xiao Jun, say goodbye to Yi Chi.

235
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,950
Goodbye.

236
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,890
We're leaving.

237
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,150
Are you hungry?

238
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,450
Here.

239
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,830
It's time to eat.

240
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,580
Eat up.

241
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,550
What's wrong?

242
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,170
Give me a shave.

243
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,430
Didn't you complain that it's prickly?

244
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,290
Give you a shave?

245
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,830
Can't you do it on your own?

246
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,270
I can't do it.

247
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,720
Why?

248
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,710
I'm injured.

249
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,960
Where did you hurt yourself?

250
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,230
It's over here.

251
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,870
Let me see.

252
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,520
Is it painful?

253
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

254
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,310
Give me a shave.

255
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,560
Okay.

256
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,710
I'll do it for you.

257
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,350
You're quite good at shaving.

258
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,550
Have you done it before?

259
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,260
For who?

260
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,670
Zhuo Ran?

261
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,270
I did it for patients.

262
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,510
When I worked at
the general surgery department,

263
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,120
I was in charge of skin preparation
before surgery was conducted.

264
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,470
It lasted for a month.

265
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,120
Making you shave
is a waste of your talents.

266
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,430
Thank you, Liang Mu Ze.

267
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,400
What for?

268
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,360
Thank you for carrying me back home.

269
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,240
I didn't know that
you've injured yourself.

270
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,000
I chose to carry you on my back.

271
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,030
I hit you too.

272
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,960
Is it painful?

273
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,110
Yes.

274
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,630
What should I do?

275
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,370
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

276
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,110
You've hit me anyway.
What's the point of telling you?

277
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,990
Well...

278
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,430
How should I make up to you?

279
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,130
You are already making up to me.

280
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,590
It would be better
if you could take it more seriously.

281
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,120
No matter what,

282
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,680
I still want to thank you.

283
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,370
If you didn't appear today,

284
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,080
I would be put through
a more awkward situation.

285
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,080
Are you sure you're only awkward today?

286
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,190
You can say whatever you want.

287
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,680
It's done, Captain Liang.

288
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you happy with it?

289
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,200
Not bad, at least you didn't injure me.

290
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,600
Perhaps you're right.

291
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,560
There is nevertheless
a gap of eight years.

292
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,880
Many things have changed.

293
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,350
Example?

294
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,110
Zhuo Ran admitted that
he installed the tapping device.

295
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,030
I knew it from the beginning.

296
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,520
You knew it?

297
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,320
My understanding of Zhuo Ran

298
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,990
is beyond your imagination.

299
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,750
You won, Liang Mu Ze.

300
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,590
Like I said, I don't care about winning.

301
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,550
I care about the people.

302
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,640
It's for you.

303
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,400
What a cute keychain.

304
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,510
Where did you get it?

305
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,910
I made it.

306
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,910
You?

307
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,670
You know how to make this?

308
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,160
Do you like it?

309
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,480
I like anything that comes from you.

310
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,650
If that's the case, keep it properly.

311
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't lose it.

312
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,670
Got it?

313
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,400
Sure.

314
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,430
Xia Chu.

315
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,770
The person who attempted to kidnap you

316
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,590
has been arrested by the police.

317
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,120
However, you have to be careful.

318
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,630
Stay vigilant.

319
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,120
Especially...

320
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,200
What?

321
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,040
Don't meet up with Zhuo Ran alone.

322
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,720
It's for your own good.

323
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,350
Got it.

324
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,680
I instructed my secretary

325
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,920
to get you a set of lingerie
based on your size.

326
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,550
She will send it here later.

327
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,320
Do you mind?

328
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,790
She's your secretary.

329
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,680
It's okay so long as you don't mind.

330
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,030
What are you doing?

331
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,600
I've set up a public account

332
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,310
and it's ready to be published.

333
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,630
I didn't know that
you have a public account.

334
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,099
It's done.

335
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm going to blow dry my hair.

336
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,750
The hair dryer...

337
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,040
I want to read your article.

338
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,550
I'm giving you access.

339
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,010
From now on,

340
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,480
you're the co-admin of my public account.

341
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,680
If I don't have the time,

342
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,030
you may publish posts on my behalf.

343
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,160
Aren't you worried that
I may mess things up?

344
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,870
No.

345
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,130
To you,

346
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,760
I've never been on my guard.

347
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,390
How about you?

348
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,580
Zhuo Ran.

349
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,240
Rao Zhi.

350
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,120
Long Yi's lawyer is here

351
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,360
demanding him to be released right away.

352
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,490
Rao Zhi!

353
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,690
Call the ambulance!

354
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,720
I'm here. Don't be scared.

355
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm here.

356
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,890
I'm here.

357
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,090
I'm here.

358
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,110
I'm here.

359
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,330
Rao Zhi.

360
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,190
The test result is out.

361
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,840
Long Yi is the suspect,

362
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
Xiao Yang.

363
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,020
He underwent plastic surgeries.

364
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,070
Rao Zhi!

365
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,320
Please calm down.

366
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,650
Rao Zhi!

367
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,850
Stop Rao Zhi!

368
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,400
Don't let him go into
the interrogation chamber!

369
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,640
Rao Zhi!

370
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,990
Rao Zhi!

371
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,470
Rao Zhi!

372
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,830
Rao Zhi!

373
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,990
Rao Zhi!

374
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,600
Rao Zhi!

375
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,510
Rao Zhi!

376
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,450
Lock up the investigation chamber!

377
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,760
Rao Zhi!

378
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,270
-Rao Zhi!
-Calm down, Rao Zhi!

379
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,910
Stay aside!

380
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,430
Rao Feng.

381
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,190
You're a veteran police officer.

382
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,720
I don't have to tell you everything

383
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,560
because you should have known it.

384
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,830
You are not allowed to touch him.

385
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,150
Why?

386
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,750
Why?

387
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,360
Now, the only evidence in our hands

388
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,240
is the testimony

389
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,030
given by Zhuo Ran against him.

390
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,450
However,

391
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,190
the credibility of the testimony

392
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,280
is uncertain.

393
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,640
He's the legal representative
of the 3D Printing Company.

394
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,110
We found a 3D printed mask

395
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,600
near the black maple forest.

396
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,110
Soon after,

397
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,750
he followed Xia Chu
in an attempt to kidnap her.

398
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,720
He also appeared

399
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,280
in the jungle along the border
where drug dealers meet.

400
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,850
The 3D printed mask was broken.

401
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,090
We were unable

402
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,670
to retrieve his fingerprints
from the mask.

403
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,930
As such,

404
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,030
everything that you said

405
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,160
is only our assumptions.

406
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,040
It can't be considered as evidence.

407
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,440
Furthermore,

408
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,870
the real culprit
has not fallen into the trap.

409
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,360
How about my daughter?

410
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,190
That scum has destroyed my family!

411
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,630
Ever since Xiao Xue met with that
mishap at the age of 13,

412
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,640
every day,

413
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,250
I woke up in fear

414
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,830
from the nightmare. Do you know that?

415
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,450
I've stopped drinking beer.

416
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,440
I don't have the guts to drink anymore.

417
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,110
Do you know why?

418
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,080
That's because when I see the bottles,

419
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,570
I would be reminded

420
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,000
of how the bottles
were stuck in my daughter's body!

421
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,400
She was only 13 years old.

422
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,760
The doctor said that
the injury would never recover.

423
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,880
It would never recover
for the rest of her life.

424
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,520
My wife...

425
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,720
No, I mean my ex-wife.

426
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,870
She divorced me because of that.

427
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,950
She said she wished she'd never met me.

428
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,830
My daughter...

429
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,560
I could have taken good care of them.

430
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,680
But I couldn't do that!

431
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,290
I could only send them far away from me.

432
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,880
They have to stay away from me.

433
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,590
My daughter called me cold-blooded.

434
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,010
She said that I'm an irresponsible father.

435
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,130
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

436
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,430
Am I?

437
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,780
I know.

438
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm a police officer.

439
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,200
As I'm wearing the uniform,

440
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,230
I have to be a role model.

441
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,080
I deserve to be punished

442
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,560
when I violate the rules and regulations.

443
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,330
I acknowledge that. I accept that.

444
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,840
However, Xiao Xue is my daughter!

445
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,200
I would risk my life to protect her!

446
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,210
Do you know that, Director?

447
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,200
Ever since Xiao Xue and her mum left,

448
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,960
I've officially died inside.

449
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,690
The only motivation that keeps me living

450
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,720
is to arrest that scum!

451
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,210
No matter how far I have to go,

452
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,920
I have to ensure that
I rope him up and wheel him to justice!

453
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm not going to forgive him.

454
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,510
I'm not going to be generous!

455
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,050
Only by doing so

456
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,120
can I continue living. Do you know that?

457
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,920
Now, the person
who harmed my daughter is back.

458
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,210
He's just right in front of me.

459
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,510
His hands are full of my daughter's blood.

460
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,390
Yet, you told me not to touch him?

461
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,150
You even want me to let go of him?

462
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,670
I can't do it!

463
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,920
Officer 052326.

464
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,240
The detention period of Rao Feng,
Captain of the Criminal Investigation

465
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,520
Division of the Public Security Bureau
is up.

466
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,990
Let him go.

467
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,840
Yes.

468
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,520
I don't want to leave! I want
to see Tian Yong undergoing training!

469
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,590
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

470
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,430
I want to see Tian Yong
undergoing training!

471
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
Stop it!

472
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,400
Listen.

473
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,710
You have two choices.

474
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,270
It's either you stay at home

475
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,520
or you will be sent back
with the army truck.

476
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,000
Why can't I watch the training?

477
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,360
It's not confidential.

478
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,000
I just want

479
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,280
to see how iron men are trained.

480
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:53,840
No way.

481
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,450
Why?

482
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,250
You're affecting Tian Yong's performance.

483
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,220
I...

484
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,190
Are you still in a cold war with your dad?

485
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,800
It's none of your business.

486
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,480
Stop calling me, will you?

487
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,050
Delivery?

488
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm not at home at the moment.

489
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,830
I gave you the address?

490
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,610
Will you please place it in the cabinet?

491
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,430
I'll get the parcel when I'm back.

492
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,920
All right, thank you.
Sorry for the trouble.

493
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,640
Well...

494
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,970
Can I go home now?

495
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,800
Have you thought it through?

496
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,110
I need to get my parcel.

497
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,120
When did she leave?

498
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,960
I think it's almost time.

499
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,230
I think I could run into her
if I go there now.

500
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,970
Sure.

501
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,360
Thanks, Mu Ze.

502
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,470
Are we heading to Cambridge Bay?

503
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,040
When is your wife's baby due?

504
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,470
When is the expected date?

505
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,200
It's been a few days late.

506
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,120
My mother-in-law told me

507
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,410
when she's pregnant with my wife,

508
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,750
she got into labour a few days late too.

509
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,390
When my wife gave birth to Xiao Xue,

510
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,760
she got into labour late too.

511
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,390
I think it's normal
when the baby is a girl.

512
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,010
Does that mean those
who are pregnant with a baby boy

513
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,910
will deliver earlier than expected?

514
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,440
I mean, my ex wife.

515
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,550
Listen,

516
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,510
when you have become a dad,

517
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,830
you must prioritise your wife and child.

518
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,350
Keep them company whenever you have time.

519
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,210
I know that.

520
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,360
Knowing it isn't sufficient.
You need to do it.

521
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,130
Listen.

522
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,800
Children grow up in a blink of an eye.

523
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,000
When you're ready to keep them company,

524
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,600
they've already grown up.

525
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,610
It's too late by then.

526
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,230
Especially when you have a daughter...

527
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,720
Rao Zhi.

528
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,510
When you reach there,

529
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,450
spend time with your daughter.

530
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,640
Don't think about other things.

531
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,170
I'll be waiting for you at the entrance.

532
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,990
Just give me a call if anything.
I'll be there anytime.

533
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,760
Is it nice?

534
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,070
Liang Shao Xue.

535
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,200
You have such a great taste.

536
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,410
Hello.

537
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,000
Hello, I have a parcel for Xia Chu.

538
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,070
Please pick up the parcel
at the pick up point now.

539
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,270
Are you going out?

540
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm going to collect a parcel.

541
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,480
Are you going to
the pick up point at the entrance?

542
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,410
Li Lei is there.

543
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,550
I'll get him
to collect the parcel for you.

544
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,230
Hold on, Xiao Xue.

545
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,290
Li Lei.

546
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,600
Please collect a parcel for me...

547
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,830
Did I say I wanted someone
to collect it for me?

548
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,390
Did you ask me first?

549
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,450
No.

550
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,650
Xiao Xue, I thought...

551
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,360
You thought...

552
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,120
You always do everything on your own will.

553
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,160
You've never cared about my opinion.

554
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,280
Xiao Xue, let's go together.

555
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,370
Stop following me!

556
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,440
You're so irritating!

557
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,430
It must be Liang Mu Ze again.

558
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,840
It's nothing to do with him.

559
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,630
Even if he didn't tell me,

560
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,010
I could trace you too.

561
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,120
Stop looking for me!

562
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,320
It's pointless.

563
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,600
I won't tell you

564
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,400
what happened in the tunnel the other day.

565
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,230
It's okay.

566
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,480
However, you must protect yourself.

567
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,950
In the future, avoid going to

568
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,640
places like Yunshan Tunnel.

569
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,470
Don't tell anyone

570
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,960
you went there on that night.

571
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,840
Don't tell others that I'm your dad.

572
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,250
Leave this place
when you have had your fun.

573
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,429
Go back to your mum.

574
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,170
Okay?

575
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,139
No!

576
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,800
You refuse to acknowledge me.

577
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,469
Why should I listen to you?

578
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,750
Why should I?

579
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,600
Xiao Xue!

580
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,310
Will you stop following me?

581
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,630
I really hate you.

582
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,160
Hello, I'm here
to collect Xia Chu's parcel.

583
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,040
Are you Xia Chu?

584
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,520
No.

585
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm her housemate.

586
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,550
You called me earlier.

587
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,190
Is this seafood?

588
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,310
Yes.

589
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,880
Please show me the inside.

590
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,040
Hurry up.

591
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,150
Fine.

592
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,830
I'll examine it when I reach home.

593
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,640
What are you doing?

594
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,760
Wake up.

595
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,360
Please don't just lie on the ground.

596
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,870
Wake up!

597
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,470
Help!

598
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,240
Village Chief.

599
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,520
Okay, I'll be there soon.

600
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,530
[Rescue Room]

601
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,880
Why are you rescuing him?

602
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,530
Please calm down.

603
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,440
Let him die!

604
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,240
Why did you do that to my dad?

605
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,590
-You're such a scum!
-Please calm down.

606
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,830
Scum!

607
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,480
Why did you do that to my dad?

608
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,110
Return my dad to me!

609
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,750
Xiao Xue, calm down please.

610
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,430
Why are you rescuing a murderer?

611
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,470
He is now a witness!

612
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,830
Teng.

613
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,560
Give it to me, Teng.

614
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,400
Give it to me, Teng.

615
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,720
When can we meet again?

616
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,560
Way to go, Xiang Yang.

617
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,270
You're engaged in online dating.

618
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,730
Take it.

619
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,230
Let me do it on my own.

620
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,490
[We're bringing you breaking news.]

621
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,370
[A serious explosion took place]

622
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,370
[at Cambridge Bay in the morning.]

623
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,930
[The casualties are pending confirmation.]

624
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,520
[According to the residents,]

625
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,040
[the explosion gave forth
a tremendous sound.]

626
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,970
[At the moment, police officers,
firemen and medical officers]

627
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,970
[have rushed to the scene.]

628
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,120
[The number of casualties
will be ascertained later.]

629
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,040
Attention!

630
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,190
I saw the news.

631
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,230
The Public Security Bureau
just gave me a call.

632
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,010
Liang Mu Ze.

633
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,770
Yes!

634
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,160
Go to the hospital
to check on the situation.

635
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,210
Yes!

636
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:56,760
Tian Yong.

637
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,200
Yes!

638
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,860
You should tag along.

639
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,830
Yes!

640
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,270
Ms Gu!

641
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,280
Village Chief.

642
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,590
Director Mi.

643
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,730
Have you found Ke Wei?

644
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,690
Not yet.

645
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,170
We tried to reach him through phone.

646
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,570
A few days ago, there were still signals.

647
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,440
Now, we couldn't reach him at all.

648
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,600
Before he left,

649
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,530
did he say anything

650
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,570
or mention any place?

651
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,470
My grandson is a good boy.

652
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,810
He seldom talks.

653
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,360
Did he behave abnormally?

654
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,450
No.

655
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,480
He did.

656
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,240
He refused to sleep.

657
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,160
It's like this.

658
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,150
Lately,

659
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,720
he's obsessed with computer games.

660
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,080
Qian Rong,

661
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,280
who is his mum,

662
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,320
paid him a visit a few days ago.

663
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,730
She gave him a laptop.

664
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,690
He's so excited.

665
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,930
He couldn't stop playing on the laptop.

666
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,840
Where is the laptop?

667
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,910
Please show it to me.

668
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,280
Well...

669
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,050
Well...

670
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,930
This lady...

671
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,900
Who is she?

672
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,150
Report to the police.

673
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,880
I've pasted

674
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,360
the documents for you.

675
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,840
Thank you.

676
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,110
This is another set of documents.

677
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,800
I need Professor Tang's help

678
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,800
to improvise it.

679
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,440
Your main goal

680
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,250
in asking me to do all these

681
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,800
is not to build a factory in Dong'an.

682
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,240
Your main goal

683
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,600
is to obtain project information

684
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,450
for the other companies, right?

685
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,720
Is there any difference?

686
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,440
I just want to focus on research.

687
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,160
I don't want to be a commercial spy.

688
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,000
Your salary for the month

689
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,910
has been transferred to your bank account.

690
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,610
Where did you get the particulars?

691
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,920
I have a way to obtain it.

692
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,190
Professor Xia, good day.

693
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,360
I'm Zhuo Ran.

694
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,600
I saw on the news that

695
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,590
an explosion took place
in Xia Chu's neighbourhood.

696
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,280
Did she contact you?

697
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,960
Is she okay?

698
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,000
Lan Zi Yu!

699
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,300
What's wrong?

700
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,520
Is Xia Chu living at Cambridge Bay?

701
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,320
You mean Ningjiang?

702
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,630
Yes, her house in Ningjiang.

703
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,000
Yes, what's wrong?

704
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,480
Is she staying together

705
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,710
with Liang Mu Ze?

706
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,870
She rented a room at his place.

707
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,440
Furthermore, Liang Mu Ze

708
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,440
usually stays in the military camp.

709
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,830
Why are you shouting?

710
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,030
Just how many things
are you hiding from me?

711
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,390
Will he die?

712
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,030
I can't give you any confirmation on that

713
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,750
but please trust us.

714
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,830
Xiao Xue!
