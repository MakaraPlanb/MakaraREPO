[Episode 22]

4
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,390
I confessed my feelings.

5
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,330
It's so embarrassing!

6
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,730
Surprise!

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,850
Cut it out.

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,540
Aunt,

9
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,690
did you cross over here?

10
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,230
Liang Mu Ze, let's walk around.

11
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,500
Now?

12
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,560
Yes.

13
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,440
Isn't it a shame if we don't

14
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,570
walk around with such a nice dress?

15
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,300
Aren't you sleepy?

16
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm not sleepy.

17
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,780
Didn't I take a nap just now?

18
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,930
I'm feeling great now!

19
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,600
Okay.

-Here.
-Bring it on.

37
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,820
Three, two...

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,900
Mother, why can't it fly?

39
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,450
I don't know,
perhaps we did it wrongly.

40
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,210
You messed up!

41
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,890
Dr Zhang.

42
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,450
Why are you here?

43
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,890
Perhaps it's destiny.

44
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,870
We meet again.

45
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,230
Come!

46
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,460
Don't touch my kite!

47
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,490
There's a problem with your kite.

48
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,860
How do you know that?

49
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,730
I'm a doctor.
Of course I know.

50
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,170
Let me fix it for you.

51
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,580
Okay, you guys fix it.

52
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,370
I'll go get you some water.

53
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,120
Here, take this.

54
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,450
Let me take a look.

55
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,340
Can you do it?

56
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,570
Rest assured.

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,920
You were a tadpole

58
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,210
when I played kite.

59
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,220
A tadpole?

60
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,250
A frog's baby.

61
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,000
I know what the problem is.

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,460
Why am I a frog's baby?

63
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,010
You're not the baby of a frog.

64
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,650
I'll tell you later.

65
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,690
Drink your medicine.

66
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,040
I don't want to drink it.

67
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,730
The kite has to be fixed
when it has a problem.

68
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,300
People should take

69
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,490
medicine when they are sick.

70
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,820
Can you guarantee that my kite

71
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,100
can fly after I drink the medicine?

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,130
Of course.

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,850
It's not only the kite,

74
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,250
you might also fly

75
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,220
if you

76
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,830
finish the medicine.

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,500
Okay.

78
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,950
Keep your words.

79
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,050
You have my words.

80
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,770
Slow down, don't choke yourself.

81
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,700
It's not bitter, right?

82
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,310
It's not bitter.

83
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,930
Okay, give it a try.

84
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,530
Okay.

85
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
Pull it longer.

86
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,860
Enough.

87
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,830
Enough.

88
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,820
Ready!

89
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,540
Okay, then.

90
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,820
Here. Ready, go!

91
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,810
Run!

92
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,730
It's flying!

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,320
Run!

94
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,300
Run and it will...

95
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,430
Feed the line!

96
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,640
Feed the line!

97
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,880
I can't ride anymore.

98
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,860
I shouldn't have listened to you
to come here by bicycle.

99
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,130
We should've been here by now
if we came by car.

100
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,440
Are you in a hurry?

101
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm exhausted.

102
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,580
How can you operate

103
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,130
when you have such poor stamina?

104
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,909
I'm here to enjoy the cosy sunshine.

105
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,610
I'm not here to train with you.

106
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,770
Can't you let me relax

107
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,500
as it's hard to have a rest day?

108
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,550
Then just go home

109
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,900
and lie down on the sofa to read.

110
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,870
How pleasant it is.

111
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,870
So

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
are you jealous?

113
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,010
I'm not.

114
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,190
You are.

115
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,180
You're jealous.

116
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm not.

117
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,140
You can't

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,530
lie to me, Liang Mu Ze.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,170
You drank my water.

120
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,690
Yes.

121
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,620
What do you mean yes?

122
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,290
Which question are you answering?

123
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,240
Your water, I give it back to you.

124
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,030
Are you sure?

125
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,330
I'm sure.

126
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,740
What are you doing?

127
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,770
Disinfect!

128
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,540
Zhang Yi Chi, you're so amazing!

129
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,890
You can fix everything.

130
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,850
Didn't I tell you?

131
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm an old player in kite-flying.

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,170
Can you fly kites with
me in the future?

133
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,880
Can you fly kites with
me in the future?

134
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,630
As long as you're willing to.

135
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,710
Xiao Jun,

136
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,130
the question

137
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,800
you asked me last time

138
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,050
about marrying your mother.

139
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,170
To be honest,

140
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,290
I hope that

141
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,290
I could be this fortunate.

142
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,610
I know

143
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,270
luck is for those who are prepared.

144
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,470
So I plan to

145
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,170
show my utmost sincerity and

146
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,210
get along with her

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,450
in ways that

148
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,880
she prefers and comfortable with.

149
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,730
As for the result,

150
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,570
I have no idea too.

151
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,130
Even if you ask your mother

152
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,930
about this question,

153
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,630
she doesn't know the answer either.

154
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,960
Give us some time,

155
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,170
okay?

156
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,850
What if I say no?

157
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,390
If you say no,

158
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,650
I'll tear this string apart.

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,390
Don't.

160
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,640
Don't do it.

161
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm just kidding.

162
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,210
Just come to me if you have

163
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,440
any problem.

164
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,420
Okay.

165
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,460
You take it.

166
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,450
Pull it tight.

167
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,970
Okay.

168
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,110
Pull it tight.

169
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,700
It's tight.

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,260
Take a rest.

171
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,530
Okay.

172
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,250
What are you writing?

173
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,810
A film script.

174
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,290
A script?

175
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,530
It's a job recommended by my friend.

176
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,010
It's a story about the comeback

177
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,980
of a single mother

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,130
as a wedding gown designer.

179
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,460
Comrade Chen Meng Zhen,

180
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,770
how many secrets do you have
that I'm unaware of?

181
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,760
Dr Zhang, thank you.

182
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,010
Thanks for coming to
play with Xiao Jun.

183
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,890
So that I can free up
some time to write this.

184
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,810
I'm not here just to
accompany Xiao Jun.

185
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,010
It doesn't matter

186
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,250
as long as you're attentive.

187
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,610
It must be

188
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,130
tough to take care

189
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,290
of a kid alone, right?

190
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,520
It was a bit hectic at first.

191
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,170
I got used to it as time went by.

192
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,050
Actually, sometimes,

193
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,690
it's not that Xiao Jun needs me,

194
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,690
but I need him instead.

195
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,620
It's Xiao Jun who makes me have a

196
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,840
deeper bond with this world.

197
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,140
When I wake up,

198
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,450
I'll find myself being fearless.

199
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,380
I didn't expect it was my child

200
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,210
who taught me to be brave.

201
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,650
Isn't that incredible?

202
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,260
Sometimes, Xiao Jun and I
don't seem like a mother and a son.

203
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,360
We're more like friends.

204
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,200
For me,

205
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,560
he is a

206
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,700
great child.

207
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,250
I hope that I am

208
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,670
a good mother to him too.

209
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,240
You've done great

210
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,270
as a first-time mother.

211
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,770
I think so too.

212
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,020
You eat it.

213
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,050
Take it.

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,790
The kite got loose!

215
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,110
Hurry, get it!

216
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,060
Just take a rest if you're tired.

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,550
Seems like

218
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,450
it's easier to cheer

219
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,660
a woman up by provoking her

220
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,090
than encouraging her.

221
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,250
What do you mean?

222
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,430
Be careful!

223
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,720
Are you all right?

224
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,870
Liang Mu Ze?

225
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,800
Xiao Jun?

226
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,620
Mr Zhang?

227
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
You guys...

228
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,770
What a coincidence!

229
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,310
Is this an encounter?

230
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,220
He said it was destiny
that sent him here.

231
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,410
And he said

232
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,450
I'm the son of a frog.

233
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,400
I...

234
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,710
I'm here to fix this kite.

235
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,450
Look.

236
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,730
Dr Zhang is quite idle.

237
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,860
Captain Liang,

238
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,480
you're quite idle too.

239
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,220
Mother, I want to drink water.

240
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,690
Okay, I'll take you there.

241
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,680
Dr Xia.

242
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,240
Dr Xia, what do you want to drink?

243
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,220
Mineral water will do, thank you.

244
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Okay.

245
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,250
Didn't you have one already?

246
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,780
It's poisoned.

247
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,760
What do you two want to drink?

248
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,310
-I'll go with you.
-I'll go with you.

249
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,740
What?

250
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,900
You just ride the bicycle with me.

251
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,940
-I'll go buy the water.
-Just

252
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,370
let Mr Zhang go with Ms Meng Zhen.

253
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,610
Right.

254
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,430
I'll go with you.

255
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,390
Okay.

256
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,730
I'm reliable.

257
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,300
Let's go!

258
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,030
Xiao Jun, let's go.

259
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,990
Let's go!

260
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,230
Let's go!

261
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,090
Xia Chu, don't be this childish, okay?

262
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,590
What do you mean by that?

263
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,060
Is it childish to blow bubbles?

264
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,770
I like it, it's none of your concern.

265
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,930
I'm talking about
Zhang Yi Chi and Meng Zhen.

266
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,140
You stay out of it.

267
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,170
It's not your concern too.

268
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,290
I know Zhang Yi Chi.

269
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,410
His love life is too complicated.

270
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,820
He doesn't want to get married
just because he has to.

271
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,830
He wishes to find his true love.

272
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,930
Is that wrong?

273
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,370
Right, it's not wrong.

274
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,960
But Meng Zhen can't be
the cost of his trial-and-error.

275
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,810
If you don't try it out,

276
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,800
how will you know if it's right or wrong?

277
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,560
For some men,

278
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,180
it's enough to be friends with them.

279
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,500
They are not suitable
to be a lover, it's too dangerous.

280
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,850
Nothing is more dangerous than
being a special forces soldier.

281
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,940
If it's wrong to be dangerous,

282
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,090
then what does the love
between Ms Meng Zhen

283
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,080
and your comrade mean?

284
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,090
Was it wrong?

285
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
And

286
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,930
Liang Mu Ze,

287
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,170
as you're a special forces soldier,

288
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,590
what kind of man are you?

289
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm talking about Zhang Yi Chi.

290
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,580
Don't turn this on me.

291
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,450
Obviously you're too subjective.

292
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,100
No matter it's Zhuo Ran
or Zhang Yi Chi,

293
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,450
you're biased
against my mentor and friend.

294
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,610
I tell you what.

295
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,940
Zhang Yi Chi is my friend too.

296
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,260
Don't compare him to Zhuo Ran, get it?

297
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,140
You don't have the right to
make the decision for your friend.

298
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,780
I didn't make decisions for him.

299
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,340
I just dissuade him in
good faith, okay?

300
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,780
They are not suitable, understand?

301
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,580
Being suitable may

302
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,370
give us a right relationship

303
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,180
but it will never explain
how love happens.

304
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,510
Being suitable means nothing to love!

305
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,770
The water is here.

306
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,900
Get off.

307
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,970
We're here.

308
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,030
Slow down.

309
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:33,140
[Passer-by Bookstore]

310
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,140
Wash your hands first.

311
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,170
Okay.

312
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,960
He has been smiling all day long.

313
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,940
You've worked hard today.

314
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,200
No, I'm happy too.

315
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,850
It's been a while since
I've been so happy.

316
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,830
Just now...

317
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,790
Right.

318
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,930
Mu Ze told me that

319
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,090
you saved his life.

320
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,010
So he'll help you if you

321
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,450
have any problems.

322
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,170
Similarly,

323
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,450
he knows

324
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,160
what kind of woman is
suitable to be your partner.

325
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,930
He considers you a friend

326
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,250
and speaks bluntly.

327
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,010
Don't mind him.

328
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,160
Are you comforting me?

329
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,410
I think your greatest virtue

330
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,940
is being considerate.

331
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,250
I really admire that.

332
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,620
Okay, then.

333
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,310
You're always welcome
to my book store,

334
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,220
I'll give you discounts.

335
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,330
I'll come here

336
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,010
every day as long as I'm free.

337
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,190
Okay.

338
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,100
How much do you think they heard?

339
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,070
I don't know.

340
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,500
Mu Ze, I have a good news
and a bad news.

341
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,520
Which do you want to hear it first?

342
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,790
Good news.

343
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,630
[Aunt already knew you kissed Xia Chu.]

344
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,950
She is very pleased
with your progress.

345
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,530
What about the bad news?

346
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,940
[She happens to be here for work]

347
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,340
[and she is currently at home,]

348
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,450
[preparing for your second renovation.]

349
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,860
You keep her calm first.

350
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,670
Okay.

351
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,380
My mother is here.

352
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,250
Don't forget that you're my girlfriend.

353
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,240
Even after talking
back to me just now?

354
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,420
You think you're right and

355
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,640
I think I did nothing wrong.

356
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,530
I don't know what to say

357
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,350
aside from shelving disputes.

358
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,920
Before going out today,

359
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,930
you did that to me

360
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,610
to make Liang Shao Xue

361
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,210
believe in our relationship,

362
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,470
right?

363
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,800
Is that what you think?

364
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,170
I prefer to get

365
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,390
a precise answer than
a rhetorical question.

366
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,920
Xia Chu.

367
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,170
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

368
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,670
Liang Mu Ze, do you like me?

369
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,070
What about you?

370
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,870
I don't.

371
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,090
I do.

372
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,730
And then?

373
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,400
Are you apologizing

375
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,190
to write off everything that happened

376
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,570
today?

377
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,970
I apologize because I made

378
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,090
you uneasy.

379
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,480
You can choose to break down my unease.

380
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,010
You know you can do it.

381
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,650
I can't.

382
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,740
This is the best I can do now.

383
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,350
Why?

384
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,140
[Why do you hesitate?]

385
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,070
[Is the list of
redeployment confirmed?]

386
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,330
Is it about the military information
that you need to keep secret?

387
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,480
Yes.

388
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,570
Well, so much

389
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,810
for your affection.

390
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,620
Xia Chu.

391
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,850
Look at you.

392
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,730
You've always been this

393
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,850
obnoxiously rational.

394
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,810
But

395
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,720
maybe this is the real you.

396
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,670
I accept your apology.

397
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,530
Liang Mu Ze,

398
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,530
don't ever mess with me.

399
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,650
What happened?

400
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,890
These are my plates.

401
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,190
Who threw them out?

402
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,330
I have no idea.

403
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,770
Aunt, you can't do this!

404
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,180
You can't take this away!

405
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,230
Why not?

406
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,740
Didn't you hear what the master said?

407
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,990
You can't raise this cat anymore!

408
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,660
Give it to me!

409
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,630
You guys hurry back!

410
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,380
I can't do this anymore!

411
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,570
You guys are back!

412
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,840
So this is how you keep her calm?

413
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,640
How can I keep her calm?

414
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,150
You're Xia Chu, right?

415
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,180
You're prettier in person.

416
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,440
It's really rare.

417
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,150
Aunt, I'm flattered.

418
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,000
You guys are finally back.

419
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,190
It's harder than I thought.

420
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,820
Hello, aunt.

421
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,790
Hello.

422
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,440
Have you registered for marriage?

423
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,730
No.

424
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,340
We only went to the seaside.

425
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,100
That's good.

426
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,380
Xia Chu, let me tell you.

427
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,570
Marriage should

428
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,990
be taken seriously.

429
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,890
You can't listen to
Meaty about this matter.

430
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,750
Meaty?

431
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,120
Meaty is Mu Ze.

432
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,010
He only ate meat when he was little.

433
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,670
He was a fat boy
until fifteen years old.

434
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,630
Right, brother?

435
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,620
Xia Chu, I tell you what.

436
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,240
About you and Meaty, I...

437
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,330
Why did you bring these cutlery back?

438
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,330
Aunt,

439
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,650
these cutlery are fine,
they are still usable.

440
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,860
I'll buy you a new set.

441
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,740
You can't use these anymore.

442
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,810
It's all right.

443
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,990
Who told you they're not usable?

444
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,730
Liang Mu Ze!

445
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,590
Why did you hold the cat?

446
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,860
Put the cat down!

447
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,140
Liang Mu Ze, I tell you what!

448
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,340
Liang Mu Ze, put that cat down!

449
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,750
You can't hold this cat, it has fleas!

450
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,780
Aunt, you can rest assured.

451
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,260
I've de-wormed it.

452
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,180
That's useless. It's still dirty.

453
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,380
You can't raise it.

454
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,490
Come, give it to me.

455
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,010
Meaty!

456
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,260
I tell you what.

457
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,140
I have found an adopter.

458
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,710
It's one of my friends in Ningjiang.

459
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,620
They have many cats in their house.

460
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,780
What a relief!

461
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,280
You guys are busy working every day.

462
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,490
How can you guys take care of it?

463
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,480
It's good for either
side to send it away,

464
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,450
right?

465
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,210
You know nothing!

466
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,650
You're really stubborn!

467
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,780
What is this?

468
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,290
What are you pulling out?

469
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,260
It's a tapping device.

470
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,010
You didn't

471
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,010
install this, right?

472
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,280
Of course not.

473
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,360
I handed the tapping device
to the technical department.

474
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,270
They said it's a professional device.

475
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,930
Yes, the installation technique
was professional too.

476
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,780
We searched everywhere

477
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,570
that day.

478
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,380
But we didn't expect

479
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,830
he'd put the bugging
device in the cat's collar.

480
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,820
Thank you.

481
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,860
Did you leak any confidential info?

482
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,060
No.

483
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,650
This is the basic military capacity.

484
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,810
After leaving the military camp,

485
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,690
my chat context is
only about my life.

486
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,570
Moreover, I'd taken

487
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,570
preventive measures that day after I

488
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,500
suspected someone broke into my house.

489
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,440
Good.

490
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,050
Did you check the camera
footage of the district?

491
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,090
I checked it on the day.

492
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,200
Nothing was found.

493
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,970
Who do you think it might be?

494
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,860
Zhuo Ran.

495
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,960
He asked someone to switch

496
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,150
the sleeping pills
which Xia Chu gave to me.

497
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,700
But based on what he said,

498
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,770
he didn't know the pills were for me.

499
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,190
He did it out of

500
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,230
his concern for Xia Chu.

501
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,410
I certainly never believed
in his explanation.

502
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,560
But I don't understand.

503
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,140
Because Xia Chu improvised

504
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,290
the pills for me the night before.

505
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,490
The pills happened to be

506
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,950
switched the next morning.

507
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,800
And I found this tapping device today.

508
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,210
All I could think is him.

509
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,250
Do you guys have any history

510
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,600
before the pills were switched?

511
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,370
I wouldn't call it that.

512
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,490
Just that

513
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,190
he was Xia Chu's first love.

514
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,970
Xia Chu

515
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,200
is currently staying in my house.

516
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,850
So you think

517
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,920
he did that for Xia Chu.

518
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,750
I find no other reason.

519
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,460
Mr Zhuo?

520
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,750
You're here.

521
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,380
Did you ask someone
to keep an eye on him

522
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,950
after the medical forum?

523
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,330
I did.

524
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,740
But this guy has high vigilance.

525
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,060
Our man got ditched a few times.

526
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,610
According to the information available,

527
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,380
we only know that he

528
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,740
frequently travelled between
Ningjiang and Dong'an.

529
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,080
But we didn't know where he went

530
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,150
and who he met.

531
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,910
He went to Dong'an?

532
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,950
[Mr Zhuo,]

533
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,490
Is it reliable about
the matter of a paymaster

534
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,610
is going to start a
pharmaceutical company in Dong'an

535
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,740
that you'd mentioned before?

536
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,710
Of course.

537
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,580
Professor Xia already agreed

538
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,050
to be our technical consultant.

539
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,730
Teacher agreed?

540
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,940
It's currently in a confidential phase.

541
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,060
When the conditions are right,

542
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,930
his inauguration will be announced.

543
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,590
No wonder.

544
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,690
No wonder what?

545
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,980
He sent an email to me
via his personal mailbox.

546
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,690
Asking me to send
him the data of a kind

547
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,850
of sedative in the
current clinical trial.

548
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,710
I thought there was something wrong.

549
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,690
I thought his email was hacked.

550
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,540
You are the apprentice
whom he's most proud of.

551
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,480
He certainly wishes to take you with him

552
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,790
if he leaves the institute.

553
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Then...

554
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,730
Then he should tell me in advance.

555
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,970
He even intentionally got mad at me

556
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,860
and asked the security to talk to me.

557
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,650
What was all that about?

558
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,470
Professor Xia has his own difficulty.

559
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,570
The point is there are many

560
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,680
inexplicable things in the current phase.

561
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,300
There will be many gossips

562
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,840
especially in your institute.

563
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,880
We should follow the procedure.

564
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,370
You're right.

565
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,930
But I didn't expect

566
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,670
teacher would leave too.

567
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,610
Who wouldn't leave

568
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,000
if there's a way?

569
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,670
Dr Tang, I'm not
going to deceive you.

570
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,420
This is a factory building contract

571
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,670
in two copies.

572
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,180
Take a look.

573
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,940
Let's sign the contract
if you think it's applicable.

574
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,930
We'll discuss the rest later.

575
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,690
Mr Zhuo,

576
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,230
the consultation fee is
100,000 dollars per month?

577
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,150
This is the fee for the
preliminary preparation.

578
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,340
We'll pay you immediately

579
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,660
after you sign the contract.

580
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,930
This is for your first month.

581
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,740
After the factory is built,

582
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,790
it'll be adjusted according to your

583
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,820
personal performance.

584
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,050
The greater the contribution,

585
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,130
the higher the wages.

586
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,770
Did teacher already sign this?

587
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,790
He did.

588
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,690
After all,

589
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,370
your institute is only a platform.

590
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,500
It's obvious that we can give you

591
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,170
more than the vanity title

592
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,610
it gives you.

593
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,070
I kept reviewing
the background of this guy

594
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,050
but nothing wrong was found.

595
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,340
What about the 3D printed gun?

596
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,050
Currently,

597
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,840
there's no proof that

598
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,550
he downloaded and printed it.

599
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,100
Moreover,

600
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,120
he happened to have an alibi

601
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,190
on the night Gui died.

602
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,960
Any clue at Yunshan Tunnel?

603
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,330
Perhaps we were too late.

604
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,060
The transaction parties had escaped.

605
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,290
Or it might be false information.

606
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,860
We set up roadblocks and

607
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,980
conducted searches

608
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,590
but no suspected

609
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,260
transaction parties and cars

610
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,710
were found.

611
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,450
Uncle Rao,

612
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,980
Xiao Xue was at

613
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,920
Yunshan Tunnel that night.

614
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,050
She said she dozed off

615
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,530
and Zhuo Ran saved her

616
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,720
and brought her to the hospital.

617
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,840
Zhuo Ran?

618
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,450
He saved Xue

619
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,790
at Yunshan Tunnel?

620
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,760
Yes.

621
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Why?

622
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,040
Based on what he said,

623
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,140
it was because Xue

624
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,890
wore Xia Chu's clothes.

625
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,380
That's strange.

626
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,440
If he was one of the
transaction parties,

627
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
his behaviour was

628
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,500
tantamount to exposing himself to

629
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,020
the sight of the police.

630
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,030
What if Xue didn't doze off

631
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,560
but witnessed the whole process?

632
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,810
Isn't he afraid?

633
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,960
Some people are born to be a gamester.

634
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,130
Right.

635
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,810
[Erasing any trace]

636
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,580
[after killing someone]

637
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,460
[is a kind of disguise.]

638
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,290
[It might be an]

639
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,370
[advanced method to hide oneself]

640
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,890
[by fully exposing]

641
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,290
[oneself to light.]

642
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,850
[Just keep an eye on him.]

643
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,190
I'm sure there's another move coming.

644
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,440
And given everything we know,

645
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,460
Xue and Xia Chu can't stay in

646
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,280
my house anymore
before the infiltrator is captured.

647
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
We have to make
other arrangements for them.

648
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,860
It's not as simple as making

649
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,810
arrangement for Xue and Xia Chu.

650
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,230
A tapping device was
installed in the house

651
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,330
of a military officer of
Special Forces Brigade.

652
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,340
It's a big deal.

653
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,410
We have to find out the identity

654
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,890
of the infiltrator and his purpose
as soon as possible

655
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,130
to avoid further losses.

656
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,810
I already informed your unit.

657
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,510
Brigade Commander Dong
will be here tomorrow.

658
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,820
Let's have a brief meeting

659
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,580
and go through all the information.

660
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,620
Okay.

661
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,440
[Those pills were for me.]

662
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,960
[He didn't know that.]

663
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,340
[Then how did he know
you had these pills?]

664
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,960
Miss Lan.

665
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:56,930
[Girl,]

666
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,360
are you having relationship with

667
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,400
Liang Mu Ze?

668
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,680
[No.]

669
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,030
Then why did Aunt Mu Min

670
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,730
call to congratulate me and

671
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,680
[address me as her in-laws?]

672
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,100
His mother asked him to go on blind
dates but he didn't want to.

673
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,530
So he asked me to
pretend to be his girlfriend.

674
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,980
[When did this happen?]

675
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,520
[You actually agreed?]

676
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,690
I don't want to move.

677
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,710
[Then do you like him?]

678
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,050
Be honest with me.

679
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,730
No...

680
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,780
[You don't like him?]

681
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,920
I don't know.

682
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,570
What do you mean by that?

683
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,080
[I just don't know.]

684
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,680
Miss Lan, how about you?

685
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,530
How did you and my father fall in love?

686
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,610
[How did you know]

687
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,130
[he's the one?]

688
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,300
Girl,

689
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm hanging up.

690
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,840
I'll call you back as
I've got something to do.

691
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,190
What is the matter?

692
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,980
Xia, you're back.

693
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,889
Come on in.

694
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,719
What's wrong?

695
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,199
Actually, what I'm most worried

696
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,110
is not about losing my reputation

697
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,150
but dragging Tang into this

698
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,409
due to my negligence.

699
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,920
He is a talented youth.

700
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,190
[If he can't continue
participating in the project,]

701
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,840
[it's not only his future
that would get affected.]

702
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,550
[It'd be a great loss]

703
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,850
[for the project and the institute's]

704
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,660
[long-term development too.]

705
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,050
[It won't happen.]

706
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,810
You already clarified the causality

707
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,520
of the matter.

708
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,510
It was omission not criminal

709
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,660
like you said.

710
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,420
The institute will find out

711
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,050
which part that went wrong.

712
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,330
Just consider it as taking a break.

713
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,440
Actually, for the past two days,
I've been thinking

714
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,390
what I can do if I can't

715
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,110
do research anymore.

716
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,410
I can't do anything else.

717
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,650
I can't even steam an egg custard.

718
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,800
Do you think it's easy
to steam an egg custard?

719
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,000
Even the most able housewife

720
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,700
can't guarantee that

721
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,960
every egg custard she steamed

722
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,840
has no air bubbles.

723
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,250
Moreover,

724
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,800
you're not a housewife.

725
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,490
You are Professor Xia.

726
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,240
Difference in profession makes
one feel worlds apart.

727
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,710
If such a day came,

728
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,970
would you hold it against me?

729
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,170
I've always held it against you,

730
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,750
from the first day I met you.

731
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,290
Do you remember

732
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,950
you got admitted to our hospital

733
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,020
when you first suffered
from tuberculosis?

734
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,780
You had high fever,

735
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,690
haematemesis and cough.

736
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,870
We performed bronchoscopy for you.

737
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,490
You even refused to use anaesthesia

738
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,490
because you were afraid
it'll affect your intelligence.

739
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,800
The patient we dislike most

740
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,010
is those like you,

741
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,830
who do not cooperate.

742
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,810
Why did you marry me and have child

743
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,820
with me if you dislike me?

744
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,800
That was because

745
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,850
I found a farewell letter

746
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,450
under your pillow.

747
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,650
You said

748
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,170
you're willing to donate your body

749
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,730
for medical research purpose

750
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,520
if you couldn't be cured.

751
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,570
And you said

752
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,580
you're particularly grateful to

753
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,250
a nurse named Lan Zi Yu.

754
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,380
She couldn't find your blood vessel

755
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,950
every time she put you on a drip,

756
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,860
causing her to be on
the verge of breaking down.

757
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,570
You thanked her for
giving you

758
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,760
nice memories and

759
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,650
cheering you up

760
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,320
at your final moment.

761
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,690
Xia,

762
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,420
is there anything harder than this?

763
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,150
[I dislike every flaw
your father has,]

764
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,660
[but I want to love
every virtue he has.]

765
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,920
[Are you like that too?]

766
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,210
Did you go to the police station?

767
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,710
Why are you still up?

768
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,010
I can't sleep.

769
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,810
Xue sent aunt to the airport.

770
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,980
I know.

771
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,110
I have something for you.

772
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,210
Hold on.

773
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,640
This is the present that
your mother gave to me when she left.

774
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,850
I give it back to you.

775
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,360
She gave it to you.

776
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,130
Why did you give it to me?

777
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,780
I can't have it.

778
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,100
Why?

779
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,130
We're only putting on a show for her.

780
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,480
It's too much

781
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,950
if I take it.

782
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,210
What do you mean?

783
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,490
She wanted me to ask my parents

784
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,090
to have a meeting with her.

785
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,450
And she asked me to persuade you
to have a career change.

786
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,210
Then how did you reply her?

787
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,380
I can only tell her

788
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,090
we have no plans to
marry at this point.

789
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,190
We can have a fake relationship

790
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,170
but we can't have fake marriage.

791
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,810
Marriage will get both
sets of parents involved.

792
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,020
You can blame me for
not keeping my words,

793
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,370
you can ask me to move out too.

794
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,010
Anyway, I can't do this anymore.

795
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,370
I don't want to lie to your mother.

796
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,950
I mean

797
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,050
how are you going to persuade me?

798
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,430
What?

799
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,180
About changing my career,

800
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,840
I'd like you to tell me about it.

801
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,270
I have nothing to say.

802
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,970
It's your choice

803
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,630
to leave or stay.

804
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,590
Who do you think put the tapping device

805
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,610
in Er Miao's collar?

806
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,690
I don't know.

807
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,270
Try to think.

808
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,580
Can you think of nothing?

809
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,250
Nothing.

810
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,900
Did you ever bring
Zhuo Ran back here?

811
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,010
What do you mean?

812
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,200
Just what I said.

813
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,330
Of course not!

814
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
I have no object of suspicion!

815
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,380
Nothing jogs my memory

816
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,190
and I didn't bring anyone back home!

817
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,480
Nothing!

818
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,450
I just...

819
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,980
Liang Mu Ze, I don't understand.

820
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,780
Why do you always
take aim at Zhuo Ran?

821
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,770
To me,

822
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,970
he's a guy that I knew
when I was 18 years old.

823
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,080
His clean appearance in a white shirt

824
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,920
is my youth.

825
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,070
How could he...

826
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,560
How could I suspect him?

827
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,480
So you don't like man
in green uniforms,

828
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,860
you like men in white shirts.

829
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,470
Will you listen properly?

830
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,960
Listen to my point, okay?

831
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,380
Calm down.

832
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,540
It's useless to be agitated.

833
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,820
Where are you going?

834
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,340
Let go!

835
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,220
I don't want to.

836
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,580
Let go of me!

837
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,610
I can't.

838
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,960
What?

839
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,180
Liang Mu Ze, we're even.

840
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,700
Do you think I'm medical waste?

841
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,070
You ditch me after using me.

842
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm tired.

843
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,130
I want to rest.

844
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,810
You said Zhuo Ran is
the memories of your youth.

845
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,530
I have no objection about this matter.

846
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,120
But Xia Chu, you need to know

847
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,410
the memories of youth are not

848
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,150
completely reliable.

849
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,620
Have Zhuo Ran told you why he appeared

850
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,920
at the tunnel yesterday?

851
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,980
He said

852
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,480
he passed by while having night run.

853
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,880
Xia Chu,

854
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,810
the dangers in this world

855
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,770
are much more than

856
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,280
you think.

857
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,280
Guarding against strangers

858
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,260
is actually as important as

859
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,130
guarding against familiar strangers.

860
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,250
So you should train yourself

861
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,060
when you're free.

862
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,080
Do not travel alone and

863
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,670
do not stay in a hotel alone.

864
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,690
Set your speed dial number on your phone

865
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,220
to call the police.

866
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,680
You can call the police
if anything happens.

867
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,820
Wherever you go,

868
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,380
you must remember the location of

869
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,490
the lifts and stairs.

870
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:11,890
And

871
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,950
no matter how fast the lift is,

872
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,180
a person running

873
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,000
can catch up to it within three floors.

874
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,100
So if there's any contingency,

875
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,540
you must press the button
for more than three floors

876
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,050
if you have to take the lift.

877
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,400
You can press multiple floors

878
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,560
to deceive the opponent

879
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,550
if it's necessary.

880
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,030
If you really couldn't get away,

881
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,250
just keep yourself

882
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,880
surrounded by the crowd,

883
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,130
and yell for help.

884
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,890
Anything around you

885
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,930
can be used as a makeshift weapon.

886
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,310
Anyway,

887
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,480
Dr Xia,

888
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,670
you need to learn to protect yourself.

889
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,870
You'll have the chance
to save more people

890
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,170
only if you can protect yourself.

891
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,490
Do you get it?

892
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,180
Why did you suddenly tell me these?

893
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,530
I'm going to be redeployed.

894
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,210
When do you leave?

895
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,510
It's not certain.

896
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,010
So do you really have nothing

897
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,910
to tell me about my career change?

898
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,740
Goodnight, Liang Mu Ze.

899
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,940
Goodnight.
