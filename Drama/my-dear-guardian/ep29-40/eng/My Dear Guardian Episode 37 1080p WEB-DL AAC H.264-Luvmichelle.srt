00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,080
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,610
Are you feeling better?

5
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm fine.

6
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,120
Thank you.

7
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,160
Why were you shot?

8
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,360
Someone held me hostage with a gun.

9
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,480
I escaped after I got changed.

10
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,050
Why didn't you report to the police?

11
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,200
I was afraid that they might seek revenge.

12
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,130
Zhuo Ran.

13
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,530
For how long was I asleep?

14
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,560
You were not sleeping.

15
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,079
You kept talking nonsense.

16
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,720
What did I say?

17
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,920
I couldn't hear it clearly.

18
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,280
I'm heading out.

19
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,280
Where are you going?

20
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,480
I need a computer.

21
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,600
Now?

22
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,530
It's about work.

23
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,370
I need to contact someone.

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,690
Where is your hand-phone?

25
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,770
Can't you do it with a hand-phone?

26
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,920
I lost my phone when I was on my way here.

27
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,920
Fortunately, I remember your phone number.

28
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,220
I've a laptop at home.

29
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll get it for you.

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,290
No need.

31
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,530
You're injured.

32
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,079
Will you stay at home?

33
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,420
Will I

34
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,410
put you in trouble?

35
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,640
Now only you're worried about it.

36
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,160
Why did you mess with me then?

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,410
Liang Mu Ze is out of the ICU.

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,810
He's just been transferred to
the Department of Infectious Disease.

40
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you know that?

41
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,840
Yes.

42
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
Dr Liu told me that

43
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,000
you injected bacteriophage

44
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,920
into him without permission.

45
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,560
Do you have anything to say about that?

46
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,120
I've violated the hospital rule.

47
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,530
I'm willing to face the consequences.

48
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,130
Even if you have to risk
losing your practising licence

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,810
and end your career

50
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,200
from now on?

51
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,750
Yes.

52
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,570
No regrets?

53
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,650
No doubt I feel sorry

54
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,240
as my behaviour
has put everyone in trouble.

55
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,320
However, under the circumstances,

56
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,820
I would do it no matter what.

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,080
What if it fails?

58
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,410
The right thing

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,970
can't be determined

60
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,960
by success or failure.

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,040
Right is right.

62
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,490
Right is right.

63
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,600
All right.

64
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,330
Let me ask you another question.

65
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,600
If the patient was someone else,

66
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,970
would you be so obsessed

67
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,370
with the so-called right decision?

68
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,490
It's a shame that Liu Ran
is no longer here.

69
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,080
Otherwise,

70
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,960
I would answer the question

71
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,520
with action.

72
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,520
Xia Chu, I requested to see you

73
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,200
for two things.

74
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,780
First,

75
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,800
regarding to your behaviour,

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,770
the hospital committee

77
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,659
decided to circulate a letter of criticism
against you.

78
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,970
It's considered a serious demerit.

79
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you have anything to say?

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,880
Okay. Second,

81
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,580
Brigade Commander Dong

82
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,040
specially expressed his gratitude
for your work.

83
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,440
After a discussion
in the department meeting,

84
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,600
it's decided that

85
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,320
you'll be the next chief resident.

86
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,640
So, you...

87
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,120
You don't have to remove your white robe.

88
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,240
However, bear it in mind.

89
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,810
In the hospital,

90
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,900
each system that seems negligible

91
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,890
is slowly formed

92
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,520
at the cost of life, blood and tears.

93
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,880
System

94
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,960
may not promote the greatest kindness

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,600
but it can avoid

96
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,240
the least evilness.

97
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,760
Xia Chu.

98
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,760
You're a doctor,

99
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,800
not a hero.

100
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,120
Got it.

101
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,330
The supervisor told me that

102
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,890
you decided not to run for
Chief Resident.

103
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,430
Yes.

104
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,970
Is it because of me?

105
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,400
Do you need me to let you win?

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,720
No.

107
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,320
Hence, my withdrawal
has nothing to do with you.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,480
It's because I've another career plan.

109
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,720
What career plan?

110
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,880
Take a guess.

111
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,080
You're such a strange person.

112
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,460
Thank you.

113
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,440
I take back my assumption about you.

114
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,250
No doubt I didn't do a good job

115
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,160
when I was trying to rescue Liang Mu Ze.

116
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,240
However, I have to say that

117
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,800
that's me.

118
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,760
Your rationality will ensure that
you have a smooth journey.

119
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,650
My emotion

120
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,400
will bring me far.

121
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,400
I can't be you

122
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,720
and you'll never replace me.

123
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,480
What say you?

124
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,240
I have to answer the call.

125
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,409
Yes, I am. Who is speaking?

126
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,370
Sure, I'll come now.

127
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,520
I've to go.

128
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,660
Excuse me, may I know
where the interrogation room is?

129
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,420
Go straight and turn right.

130
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,390
Thank you.

131
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,040
Mi Gu.

132
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,410
Are you okay?

133
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,930
Rao Zhi.

134
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,090
Can I take my friend with me?

135
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,080
Dr Xia.

136
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,770
I heard from Brigade Commander Dong

137
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,810
that Mu Ze's wound

138
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,410
is severely infected.

139
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,050
Yes.

140
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,960
However, he finally made it.

141
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,170
He's doing okay now.

142
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,360
Don't worry.

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,840
I just want to let you know that

144
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,450
on the dagger that injured Mu Ze

145
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,850
and his clothes,

146
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,010
we found a huge amount

147
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,400
of Acinetobacter baumannii.

148
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,090
I think it's not an accidental infection.

149
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,760
Got it.

150
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,400
Be careful.

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,480
They kept asking me about
my relationship with him

152
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,840
and his whereabouts.

153
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,530
How did you answer?

154
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,960
I told them the truth.

155
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,960
However, I feel that

156
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,680
I've put him in trouble.

157
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,280
Ever heard of the
Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria?

158
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,330
On Liang Mu Ze's clothes,

159
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,000
the same bacteria was detected.

160
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,580
The person who stabbed Liang Mu Ze

161
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,280
was Zhuo Ran's accomplice.

162
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,290
They barged into the drill site

163
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,450
and held me hostage.

164
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,640
All thanks to him,

165
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,800
Liang Mu Ze and I almost lost our lives.

166
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,370
Have you thought about it?

167
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,040
Who kind of person

168
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,720
came out with the idea
to use a weapon like that?

169
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,130
Not only he intended to kill a person,

170
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,770
obviously he enjoys torturing others.

171
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,800
He's so cruel and inhumane.

172
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,720
Who is he?

173
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,600
I don't know him.

174
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,880
Perhaps I've never known him.

175
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,800
Think about it.

176
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,930
Why would he

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,490
let you leave to get the laptop?

178
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,120
I offered to help.

179
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,680
How about taking care of him?

180
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,800
Did you offer to take care of him too?

181
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,690
He knew that you wouldn't turn him down.

182
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,530
He trusts me.

183
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,840
He did that on purpose!

184
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,640
Once he's missing,
the police would come after you

185
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,010
and put you under scrutiny.

186
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,860
No way he doesn't know
about the current situation.

187
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,440
Why did he choose to do that?

188
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,130
Why did he let you
look for a computer for him?

189
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,700
That's because through you,

190
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,400
he could confirm the police's next step.

191
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,730
He was trying to verify his own safety

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,680
by putting you in danger.

193
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,010
If you don't go back by today,

194
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,530
he will run away immediately.

195
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,840
He doesn't care about you.
Do you believe that?

196
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,340
Even if you go back today,

197
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,420
the only thing that he cares about

198
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,930
is the current situation

199
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,480
and whether the police
follow you in secret.

200
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,010
He's determined to drag you into it

201
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,610
so that you will do things for him.

202
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,580
He knows your love for him too well.

203
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,570
From the beginning,

204
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,250
he's been using you and deceiving you!

205
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,640
Say no more!

206
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,640
I've thought about

207
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,040
everything that you just said.

208
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm so stupid.

209
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,120
Mi Gu.

210
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,640
You've made the right choice.

211
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,360
You're back.

212
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,280
Take the laptop.

213
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,080
What took you so long?

214
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,290
The traffic on the highway was terrible.

215
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,170
Or else, I'd be back
a long time ago.

216
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,760
Did you run into anyone?

217
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,370
No.

218
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,720
Who would I run into?

219
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,080
I was worried that, just like last time,

220
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,010
you got abducted by crazy fans again.

221
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,800
If I got abducted again,

222
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,440
would you save me?

223
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,080
Or would you run away?

224
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,440
I would run away for sure.

225
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't believe that.

226
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,720
You would save me for sure.

227
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,600
Then why did you ask me?

228
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,160
I bought two bowls of porridge.

229
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,160
Eat up.

230
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,720
It'll go cold soon.

231
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,640
Where is yours?

232
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,880
Mine...

233
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,400
The waiter passed it
to the deliverer by mistake.

234
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,720
I didn't want you to wait.

235
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,250
That's why I brought yours back first.

236
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll get mine later.

237
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,400
Is it delicious?

238
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,160
Yes.

239
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,120
I prefer your cooking.

240
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,960
Zhuo Ran.

241
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,360
Are you the only son?

242
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,839
Yes.

243
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,040
What's wrong?

244
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,680
Nothing.

245
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,440
You're mature and stable.

246
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,880
You behave as if you have siblings.

247
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,520
Actually...

248
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,760
What?

249
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,160
This is the key for this place.

250
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,620
Keep one with you.

251
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,200
It's easier for you to come in.

252
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm going to pick up the porridge.

253
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,600
It's their fault.

254
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,570
Let them deliver to you.

255
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,560
It's not far anyway.

256
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,920
I need to go to the supermarket

257
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,480
to get some kitchen utensils.

258
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,800
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

259
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,800
Have I ever told you

260
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,360
you're like my mum?

261
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,960
If I can escape this time,

262
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,240
I'll meet you up with her.

263
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,320
She will surely like you.

264
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,040
I'll meet your mum with you.

265
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,360
The goods have been received.

266
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,360
Wait for the wind.

267
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,820
Rao Zhi.

268
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,120
Scary Pirate has logged in.

269
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,250
Don't move!

270
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,600
Don't move!

271
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,320
Take him back.

272
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,160
We meet again.

273
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,640
A terrible finisher.

274
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,600
Who are you referring to?

275
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,780
Me.

276
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,880
Fine.

277
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,760
Let's talk about it.

278
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,160
What should I say?

279
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,820
Ever since you're missing in action,

280
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,400
we kept a close watch on Mi Gu.

281
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,320
You've worked hard.

282
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,880
You logged in with Scary Pirate's ID.

283
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,760
What do you plan to do next?

284
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,080
Why don't you take a guess?

285
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,520
Have you ever counted the victims

286
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,320
on the City of Desire?

287
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,820
I know.

288
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,200
Once I'm arrested,

289
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,720
I won't be able to escape.

290
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm doomed.

291
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,610
I failed miserably
in a very simple mission.

292
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,760
I admit that I was careless.

293
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,520
However, on the journey to the afterlife,

294
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm sure someone will keep me company.

295
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,880
I won't be lonely.

296
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,450
You're afraid of being lonely.

297
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,090
Perhaps you don't know this.

298
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,640
I can tell you

299
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,530
Liang Mu Ze is out of danger.

300
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,810
He was saved by Dr Xia Chu.

301
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,900
What about Tian Yong?

302
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,200
Where is Tian Yong?

303
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,970
Is he still

304
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,600
at Old Master's mansion?

305
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,980
How well do you know Old Master?

306
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,730
I'm asking you a question.

307
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,360
Ask away.

308
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,080
You barged into the drill site

309
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,040
because of Xia Chu, right?

310
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,160
Yes

311
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,410
and no.

312
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,720
Who gave you the instruction?

313
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,050
Was it Old Master?

314
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,760
Do you want me to identify Old Master?

315
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,160
He aims to threaten
Professor Xia Guang Yuan

316
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,360
through Xia Chu, right?

317
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,660
Who is he?

318
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,280
What is the deal between both of you?

319
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,740
What deal?

320
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,170
How did you contact him?

321
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,840
How did you pass things to him?

322
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,700
If I tell you the truth,

323
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,520
will you let go of me?

324
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,730
Are you playing with fire?

325
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,930
If I don't play with fire,

326
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,400
I'll be grilled instead.

327
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm curious.

328
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,440
If Tian Yong is dead,

329
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,680
will you be upset?

330
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,530
Especially Liang Mu Ze.

331
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,120
Will he be upset?

332
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,770
If your best friend died,

333
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,800
what would you feel?

334
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,400
You've experienced it.

335
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,480
You should know better.

336
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,240
It's been eight years

337
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,330
yet you've not figured out

338
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,560
who is actually grilling you on fire.

339
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,890
Dolphin.

340
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,580
This is Camel.

341
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,360
Team One is already at the raiding spot.

342
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,460
The other teams,

343
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,530
report in sequence.

344
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,000
Team Two is in place.

345
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,120
You should know the consequences.

346
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,840
Boss.

347
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,240
What do you mean?

348
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,810
The Vietnamese will be here soon
to examine the goods.

349
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,040
We are ten percent short.

350
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,040
What should I do?

351
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,850
It has

352
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,360
nothing to do with me.

353
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,680
You're the mastermind.

354
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,570
I did everything

355
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,520
according to your instructions.

356
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,800
It's nothing to do with me.

357
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,290
[Team Three, come now.]

358
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,490
[I got bitten by the tongue just now.]

359
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,740
[Got bitten by the tongue?]

360
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,290
[Hurry up, everyone is waiting for you.]

361
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,490
[You know which tongue I meant.]

362
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,770
[Attention, everyone.
Take cover while moving.]

363
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,440
[We still have some time. Stay calm.]

364
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,450
[This is Camel.]

365
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,770
[We've reached the raiding spot.]

366
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,200
[Can we launch the attack?]

367
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,120
[You may launch the attack now.]

368
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,680
[Camel received the message.]

369
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,100
[Everyone,]

370
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,640
[get rid of the respective enemy
in front of you.]

371
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,720
[The person who is in charge of blasting,]

372
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,020
[check the equipment.]

373
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,240
[Listen to the command.]

374
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,920
We're brothers.

375
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,320
Don't push my limit.

376
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,680
As long as you return the goods,

377
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,440
I'll pretend nothing has happened.

378
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,400
You may leave after that
while I'll get busy with my own thing.

379
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,090
When you need my help moving forward,

380
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,640
just let me know.

381
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,460
Dad?

382
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,600
Son.

383
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,160
What do you mean?

384
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,200
I didn't take the goods.

385
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,680
Let me ask you one last time.

386
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,650
Where are the goods?

387
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,080
I don't know.

388
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,920
I don't know.

389
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,900
I really don't know.

390
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,720
Don't blame me for being merciless.

391
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,240
No!

392
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,720
Get ready.

393
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Team Two is ready to break in.

394
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,040
Attack!

395
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,200
Stop them!

396
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,960
Put down the weapon and stop fighting.

397
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,800
Back down.

398
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,720
Jerk!

399
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,680
Son!

400
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,360
Leave!

401
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,200
Hide!

402
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,100
Come back!

403
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,200
Captain!

404
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,610
Something was shot! Doctor!

405
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,040
Captain.

406
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,050
Hang in there! It's okay.

407
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,520
Mu Ze.

408
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,410
When Meng Zhen gives birth to the baby,

409
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,240
don't forget to tell me.

410
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,160
See it for yourself, Captain!

411
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,410
Captain!

412
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,040
Luo Liang!

413
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,680
Back then,
we destroyed the drug laboratory.

414
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,850
However, the culprit

415
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,760
who provided the fund
and manufactured the drugs...

416
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,120
escaped.

417
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,890
His hands were full of blood.

418
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,360
Not only did he kill our people,

419
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,130
he also killed your dad,

420
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,690
Pei Yong Yan and Zhuo Ran.

421
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,280
That's not right.

422
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,080
That's not right.

423
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,440
You came back here in Zhuo Ran's name.

424
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,330
Besides approaching Xia Chu

425
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,850
to obtain research information

426
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
from Professor Xia Guang Yuan,

427
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,820
[you also want to
avenge your father and brother.]

428
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,370
[Over and over again,]

429
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,290
[you targeted Liang Mu Ze.]

430
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,850
You tried to murder him!

431
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,930
However, do you know

432
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,500
you're assisting your enemy

433
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,530
by doing all the evil deeds?

434
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,650
Do you know that your father

435
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,160
and your brother died with their
eyes wide open?

436
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,340
Tell me.

437
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,290
Who gave you the instructions?

438
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,740
You're lying!

439
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,740
[Was it Old Master?]

440
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,520
[Did you kill him?]

441
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,480
He's Lu Wen Long,
the wanted person who has been on the run.

442
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,440
Am I right, Pei Yu?

443
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,960
I'm not at fault!

444
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,610
I'm not at fault!

445
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,220
I want to kill Liang Mu Ze!

446
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,130
Bring him out.

447
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,160
I want to kill him!

448
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,000
I want to kill him!

449
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,770
[I'm not at fault! Don't leave!]

450
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,320
[Bring him here!]

451
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,160
I want to kill him!

452
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,800
I want to kill him!

453
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,760
I want to kill him!

454
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,140
Captain.

455
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,760
Take a seat.

456
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,280
I remember

457
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,040
we competed in shooting,

458
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,160
driving,

459
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,360
combat,

460
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,170
table tennis,

461
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,450
and basketball.

462
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,090
Am I right?

463
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,120
Yes.

464
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,720
We haven't competed
in eating dumplings, right?

465
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,780
What?

466
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,290
I made it.

467
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,640
Let's see who can finish it first.

468
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,520
What's the point?

469
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,900
Let's begin!

470
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,290
What is the occasion?

471
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,050
Why are we having a dumpling
eating competition?

472
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,720
Steamed buns to welcome the new,

473
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,480
dumplings to see off the old.

474
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,090
Mu Ze.

475
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,400
I have to go.

476
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,050
Didn't you promise

477
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,250
to be my rival forever?

478
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,720
Your rival

479
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,320
is not me.

480
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,450
It's your ego

481
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,240
and endless guilt.

482
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,960
It's been eight years.

483
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,800
It's enough to make up for everything.

484
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,850
It's been eight years.

485
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,120
Captain.

486
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,280
I can't fall asleep every day.

487
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,920
The moment I close my eyes,

488
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,410
I can see the nightmare.

489
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,880
Those birds,

490
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,040
crushed stones and bullets...

491
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,530
I can see them clearly.

492
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,640
However, they're not real.

493
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,200
I've been asking myself

494
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,000
where did my captain go?

495
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,680
Where is Luo Liang?

496
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,560
If it weren't because of me,

497
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,520
you could watch Xiao Jun grow up.

498
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,840
You could grow old with Meng Zhen.

499
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,720
Whenever I see them,

500
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,520
I feel as if I'm a sinner.

501
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,400
I trained hard.

502
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,890
I locked my heart away.

503
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,840
When I'm not in the military camp,

504
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,560
I never open up to anyone.

505
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,640
I worry that
I may put someone else in trouble.

506
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,360
Sometimes, I'm cold to my parents.

507
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,020
I hope that

508
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,680
I could be an unpleasant son.

509
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,880
If something happened to me one day soon,

510
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,570
or if I sacrificed in a mission,

511
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,210
they would only remember
the worst thing about me.

512
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,640
I don't want them
to remember the good side of me.

513
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,400
In that case,

514
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,040
will they feel less sad?

515
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,800
I've thought too much.

516
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,170
I've thought about so many things.

517
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,440
However, it's useless.

518
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,090
It's not enough.

519
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,400
I know that
it's been eight years, Captain.

520
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,970
I'm so afraid something bad
would happen to others.

521
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,760
I would rather sacrifice myself.

522
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,520
I mean it.

523
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,120
You won't die, Mu Ze.

524
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,400
You have someone in your heart.

525
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,770
Xia Chu.

526
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,560
She's your soft spot

527
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,880
and at the same time, she's your armour.

528
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,440
She'll make you a braver person for sure.

529
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,120
Am I right?

530
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,280
I gave you my back.

531
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,280
I took that bullet for you.

532
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,080
I hope that

533
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,160
you can fight
like a real military officer.

534
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,650
You're the sharpest knife in Team Thunder.

535
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,320
You're the sharpest.

536
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,000
You need to find the right direction.

537
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,720
It's time to unleash yourself, lad.

538
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,600
Mu Ze, bear it in mind.

539
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,640
Don't let your lover down.

540
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,610
I've to go.

541
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,680
Son.

542
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,930
Finally you're awake.

543
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,900
You make us so worried!

544
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,200
My dear son.

545
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,410
Slow down.

546
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,160
You almost scared me to death!

547
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,410
Enough.

548
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,660
He's awake.

549
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,720
Stop crying.

550
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:29,850
Here.

551
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,160
Mum.

552
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,900
[Braised Egg.]

553
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,640
[Each story has an ending.]

554
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,680
[The ending of my story]

555
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,970
[is you.]

556
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,960
[Da Miao]

557
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,320
Son.

558
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,320
The Brigade Commander wants me to tell you

559
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,440
the investigation
against Xia Chu's dad has ended.

560
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,850
He's not involved in the matter.

561
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,880
He's approved

562
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,240
your love report.
