[narrator in Sanskrit] <i>2,500 years ago,</i>

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,520

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>But the Buddha appeared before the monster</i>

7
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,283
<i>and pulled out</i>

8
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,871
<i>the Red Eye and the Black Eye,</i>

9
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>which were the source of his power.</i>

10
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,795
<i>However, both eyes
escaped the Buddha's hands</i>

11
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>and started to run away from the Buddha.</i>

12
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>The Black Eye was caught
by the Buddha soon enough</i>

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,976
<i>and was locked inside a</i> sarira <i>casket.</i>

14
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,692
<i>But the Red Eye,
on the other hand, managed to get away</i>

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>by hiding inside people's bodies
and running away for seven nights.</i>

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,910
<i>Then, on the eighth night,
the Red Eye stopped and turned around,</i>

17

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,419

it had been on was actually a bridge</i>

19

<i>consisting of seven stepping stones
over a narrow, shallow stream,</i>

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,177
<i>the Red Eye learned that
it could never escape from the Buddha.</i>

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,596
<i>So it faked surrender</i>

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,307

- Mmm-hmm.

176
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,929
- [chuckles]
- [thunder rumbling]

177
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,568
[bell chiming]

178
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,322
FOUR SEASONS

179
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,664
[sniffing]

180
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,419
[clicking tongue]

181
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,760
- [hunter sniffing]
- [woman continues clicking tongue]

182
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,561
[door opens]

183
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,980
[eerie music playing]

184
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,199
[gasps softly]

185
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,786
[man] Did you have a nightmare?

186
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,248
Cheongseok.

187
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,045
Good or bad,
the dreams don't stay with us forever.

188
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,840
We must try to hold on to them.

189
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,134
We must not let them sway us.

190
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,721
The time has come.

191
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,516
Find Seonhwa.

192
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,017
SEONHWA

193
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,270
Tell him...

194
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,148
the monster is here.

195
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,941
[wind chime ringing]

196
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:11,884
[sighs]

197
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,552
THE THIRD DAY

198
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,137
[sniffling]

199
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,598
FOUR SEASONS - WELCOME

200
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,700
[officer 1 on radio] <i>He just arrived.</i>

201
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,975
[officer 2] Okay, copy that.

202
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,393
Let me know when he's up.

203
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,956
- I'll bring in a coroner and cleanup crew.
- [detective sighs]

204
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,939
[officer 1 on radio] <i>Perimeter secured...</i>

205
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,861
Hey, did we get a photo
of this shoeprint over here?

206
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,006
- [forensic officer] No, I don't think so.
- Well, why not?

207
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,865
Did you see it? What is this shit?

208
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,451
Hey, this should go
all the way around, don't you see?

209
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,077
- Oh.
- Such morons.

210
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:40,996
[bell chiming]

211
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,335
[sighs]

212
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,053
- [detective 1] <i>Who called it in?</i>
- [detective 2] <i>Hotel owner.</i>

213
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,805
- Any witnesses?
- No other guests at the hotel.

214
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,891
On weekdays,
it's like a ghost town around here.

215
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,354
- Hey, hey, over your shoes.
- Oh, please.

216
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,607
The owner of the motel was asleep
at the time of the incident.

217
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,150
Did the camera get anything?

218
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:15,197
Oh, yeah, right. About 11:45 last night,
the victim or, uh, suspect...

219
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,114
What should I call 'em?

220
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,367
What do you mean
what should you call 'em? You stupid?

221
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,493
See for yourself.

222
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,584
The body in the shower is the male.
But the female was gone.

223
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,629
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [groans] Female?

224
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:34,258
Yeah, this guy checked in together
with a woman named Seo Gyeong-suk.

225
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,302
CCTV has her leaving the hotel
right after the incident.

226
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,263
Where'd you get her name from?

227
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,140
She left all her stuff behind,
including her purse.

228
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,743
[detective 1] Have you
put out an APB out on her?

229
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,767
[detective 2] Yes, sir.

230
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,229
[camera shutter clicking]

231
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,691
[suspenseful music playing]

232
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,866
What about him, there?

233
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,702
[detective 2] That's the one
I was talking about before.

234
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,330
Cameras show he was fine
when he walked into the room, but...

235
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,500
So I guess he's both
the suspect and the victim.

236
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,587
SEONHWA

237
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,464
[monk 1] Shouldn't we let Seonhwa know?

238
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,967
- [monk 2] Do you know where he is?
- [monk 1] Yes.

239
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,637
- [monk 2] Don't.
- [monk 1] But Master Hajeong is...

240
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,921
[monk 2] Let's not bother him.

241
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,518
[monk 1] But then
what do we do about the funeral?

242
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,147
[monk 2] We'll keep it simple.
He would have wanted it that way.

243
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,069
Vow of silence?

244
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:38,947
For how long?

245
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,412
You know you could stop
now that he's gone.

246
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,626
DO YOU KNOW WHERE MONK SEONHWA IS?

247
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,711
Mmm.

248
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,890
I WILL BE BACK BEFORE THE FUNERAL
- CHEONGSEOK

249
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,486
[eerie music playing]

250
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:20,988
[voice 1] Bhante <i>Seonhwa.</i>

251
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,108
[voice 2 crying] <i>He's no monk.</i>

252
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,244
[voice 3] <i>He's not?</i>

253
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,139
[voice 2] No, he's nothing.

254
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,207
[voice 4] <i>If he's not a monk,
he can't help us.</i>

255
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,334
[voice 3] <i>How much longer
do we have to wait?</i>

256
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,585
[voices clamoring]

257
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,546
[voice 4] <i>You have to help us!</i>

258
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,589
[voices whispering and clamoring]

259
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,345
[clamoring intensifies]

261
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:54,398
THE FOURTH DAY

262
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,942
DAEJEON STATION

263
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,068
[indistinct chatter]

264
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,577
[indistinct announcement on PA]

265
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,817
4-91 EUNHAENG-DONG, JUNG-GU DAEJEON

266
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,670
[gasping]

267
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,406
[camera shutter clicking]

268
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,467
[detective 2] We found
Seo Gyeong-suk inside the stall,

269
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,993
dead, just like the other one.

270
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,439
[detective 1] <i>Let's think about this.</i>

271
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,671
These two check in together.

272
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,007
This guy comes in later.

273
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,968
Now, if we had found these two dead,

274
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,137
we'd have a much simpler case,
wouldn't we?

275
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,598
But we find him.

276
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,309
And she leaves the hotel in one piece.

277
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,312
Doesn't call anyone, leaves her stuff.

278
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,774
Then today, we find her dead
in a park restroom.

279
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,818
Grotesque and deformed,
just like the body at the motel.

280
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:22,902
[officer yawns]

281
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,112
So what happened here?

282
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:26,990
I want theories.

283
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:28,951
You, what's yours?

284
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,161
Mmm...

285
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,038
- Me?
- What do you think?

286
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,124
Uh, well...

287
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,002
It... It's a weird one

288
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,840
and we have no clue
why the corpses look like that.

289
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,923
Yeah?

290
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:47,302
But I have a friend who,
when they had a case they couldn't solve,

291
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:49,554
he, uh...

292
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,056
[smacks lips]

293
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,518
- I don't know. Never mind.
- Just spit it out.

294
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,020
- Come on, what did your friend do?
- Well...

295
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,981
that one was a tough case.

296
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,358
They spent some time
trying to catch a rapist,

297
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,360
so eventually he ended up
going to a psychic.

298
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,444
Psychic?

299
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,239
He told me she was very good.

300
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,366
I'm sure she is. At stealing.

301
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,617

302
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,328

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FOR PROMOTION

305
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,798
[chief] What are you going
to do about Dong-jin?

306
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,922
You need to pull the trigger.

307
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,633
Don't you think?

308
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,135
Uh-huh.

309
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,240
It's hard enough with the ones
that don't have his issues.

310
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,533
- [groans]
- [chief] He's got the limp.

311
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:36,393
He can barely see anything.
When are you gonna do it?

312
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,271
I got so mad at him yesterday,
I told him to quit.

313
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,524
But he said
he'd have to talk to you first.

314
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,694
It's not your fault he's like that.

315
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,405
You have to stop
blaming yourself for the accident.

316
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,617
Keeping him around
only makes it worse for the others.

317
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,577
It's time to let him go, okay?

318
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,537
[indistinct chatter]

319
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,169
[waitress 1] Why does
he always take this with him?

320
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,087
[waitress 2] Maybe he gives it to his dog?

in that meditation group, right?

337
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,970
But what's wrong?

338
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,764
What happened to you?

Hang on.

522
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:12,833
Can you show me some ID?

523
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:18,922
[backpack unzips]

524
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,306
Hey, real quick.

525
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:29,117
- [Dong-jin] <i>Yeah?</i>
- Need you to look up someone.

526
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:33,687
Park Jin-su, 750121-1046899.

527
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,541
[dispatcher over radio] <i>Patrol 7 here.</i>

528
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:39,818
<i>Yeah, we've got another
dead body over by Daegu High School.</i>

529
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:43,447
[Dong-jin] <i>Uh, not much. Just a fine
for causing a disturbance in court.</i>

530
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:45,072
[Ho-tae] Okay, thanks.

531
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,039
One more thing.

532
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:54,875
I'm gonna need to look in your backpack.

533
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,088
- [thrilling music playing]
- [both panting]

534
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:01,632
[both grunting]

535
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,388
[both exclaim]

536
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:12,934
[Ho-tae groans]

537
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,694
[grunts]

538
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,290
[suspenseful music playing]

539
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:18,250
I'm sorry,
but have we met somewhere before?

540
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:44,985
[ringing]

541
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,904
[suspenseful music playing]

542
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,560
[eerie music playing]

543
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:48,756
[growls]

544
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:50,633
[gasps]

545
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:05,124
DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE STATION

546
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,191
[Dong-jin] You all right?

547
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,025
What do you got?

548
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:12,197
Okay, so, first off,
the body found by the high school?

549
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,008
Turns out it's the delivery guy
from the tunnel.

550
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:15,701
Same thing, found decomposed.

551
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,704
What the hell is happening here?

552
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:22,791
[groaning]

553
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,837
Okay, look here.

554
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,838
NAME: PARK JIN-SU

555
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,774
Your little sparring partner
used to work construction.

556
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,843
But he ended up leaving the job
two days before the first case.

557
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,970
So I found his office manager
and called him up.

558
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,890
Turns out, back in 1999,

559
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,560
his wife and his five-year-old daughter
were killed in a car accident.

560
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:44,021
The other woman was driving drunk,

561
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,457
but when she went to the court,
she got her sentence reduced.

562
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,525
[Ho-tae] So that explains
the disturbance in court.

563
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:50,611
"2005, Assault"? What's that?

564
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:54,031
After the accident,
this guy goes and becomes a monk.

565
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,240
[Ho-tae] A Buddhist monk?

566
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,451
He ends up joining a temple in Gwangju.

567
00:51:57,534 --> 00:52:00,746
And apparently, it's known for exorcism.

568
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:03,207
- More psychics, then?
- I didn't... What I meant was more...

569
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,542
He's kinda like an exorcist...

570
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,503
Stop messing around already.
Just get to the point.

571
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:09,671
But this is the point.

572
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:12,508
He beat an actual demon out of the person.

573
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,259
That's a poor excuse.

574
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:18,639
But they did reach a settlement.
What about this fraud charge?

575
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,600
Well, after the Jogye Order of Monks
helped him settle the assault case,

576
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:25,896
they actually found
Park had never even been a real monk.

577
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,105
Is that so?

578
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:30,400
Simply put, if he was a real monk,
they would have known about it.

579
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:33,695
So in reality, we have no idea who he is.

580
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,823
[sighs] So that means
we're back to square one.

581

DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE PRECINCT MAP

582
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:50,254
Anyway, this other thing
happened this morning...

583
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,172
- Hey, Dong-jin.
- Huh?

584
00:52:53,382 --> 00:52:54,216
Shut up.

585
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:56,301
[intense music playing]

586
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:03,642
[footsteps approaching]

587
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:04,977
[Seonhwa] Come on.

588
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:08,647
[Dong-jin] Oh, wait.

589
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,775
Before I forget... Here.

590
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:13,693
What's this?

591
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:16,613
Some underwear and socks.
My wife bought extra for you.

592
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,365
Oh, wow, that's so nice of her.

593
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,287
I got something else. Take this, too.

594
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,204
[Ho-tae] What's this?

595
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,750
Remember that psychic
I told you about? It's from her.

596
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:30,711
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, wait!

597
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:34,965
Don't destroy it. Do you know
how much I paid for that talisman?

598
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,594
Not just money, I bled for this.

599
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,138
She used my own blood to give it power.

600
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:44,516
Fuck. How did you ever get hired
to do this job in the first place, huh?

601
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,312
Just keep it on you.
It wards off evil, you know?

602
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,475
And who knows?
Maybe it'll help you catch the killer.

603
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:53,400
Hey, why don't we get rid
of detectives altogether?

604
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,883
Let the psychics do the job for us.

605
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,696
Bro, what do you always say to me?

606
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:00,449
"It takes everything we have
to catch these guys."

607
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,835
How do you feel?

608
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:14,213
You better?

609
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:19,551
I'd say so.
Legs are better now. Eyes, too.

610
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:24,264
[automated voice] <i>The light
has turned green. You may now cross.</i>

611
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:31,188
Hey, you really don't need
to worry about me, you know?

612
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,274
It was an accident. Not your fault.

613
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:38,028
When I jumped in the water,
desperate to end it all,

614
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,863
who was there to pull me out?

615
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:45,077
In fact... [chuckles]
If you hadn't saved me from that,

616
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,206
I honestly... I wouldn't...
I wouldn't be a detective now.

617
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:54,586
That's why I have to keep at it.
I owe you that much.

618
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,047
MAP OF DAEGU

619
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,134
[Seonhwa] You didn't see
a female psychic anywhere in here?

620
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:04,263
[mouse clicking]

621
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:08,225
What about this place here?
Or maybe over here?

622
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:10,227
This is where you were, isn't it?

623
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,187
Click there.

624
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,439
- [mouse clicks]
- To the right.

625
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,400
Zoom in there.

626
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,743
But wait, I haven't told you
about what else I saw.

627
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:28,579
[flashlight clicks]

628
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,710
[Dong-jin] What is this?

629
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,174
The second he heard
about the body on the radio,

630
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:38,463
his whole face changed.

631
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,840
- Your pen.
- Oh.

632
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,140
[Ho-tae] This is the tunnel.

633
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:50,851
The high school.

634
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:53,270
And the restroom.

635
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:55,856
[officer 1] No new missing person
reports in the past few days,

636
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,774
but there is one runaway.

637
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,777
Except it's nothing new.
She's a repeat offender.

638
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:03,238
She usually comes back home
after a week or two.

639
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,158
Her mother always throws a fit, though.

640
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:08,327
Last time,
she was here bawling, screaming,

641
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,537
saying her daughter
was going to kill herself.

642
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:11,663
Kill herself?

643
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:15,417
Yeah. She had just joined
some suicide website and then took off.

644
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,794
But from what I recall,

645
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:21,256
I think she must have come back
just a few days later. Wasn't it?

646
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,467
[officer 2] But it wasn't
a suicide website.

647
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,553
Remember? It just turned out
to be a meditation group.

648
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,348
But it was for people
who had attempted suicide.

649
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:31,725
- [Ho-tae groans]
- [Dong-jin] Hmm.

650
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:33,935
[Ho-tae] Hmm.

651
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:36,647
[Seonhwa] <i>Are you sure
that's what you saw?</i>

652
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:38,815
You're positive?

653
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:45,531
[Cheongseok] What was that thing?

654
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,866
Listen carefully.

655
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:53,163
You need to leave right now.
If anyone asks, say you don't know me.

656
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:58,460
We've never met, you've never seen me.
Tell them you don't know me at all.

657
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:00,671
[Cheongseok gasps]

658
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:05,384
How could I say that
after everything that's happened?

659
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:08,011
- I could still go with you...
- [grunts]

660
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:12,891
- You need to go back now.
- Don't make me.

661
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:15,394
I came all this way.

662
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:20,148
Whatever it is you're about to do,
you don't have to leave me behind.

663
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,152
[intense music playing]

664
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:27,906
You think it's easy...

665
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:32,536
to murder someone?

666
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:35,622
Because that's what I have to do.

667
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:38,625
Do you understand now?

668
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:43,630
Who... Who do you have to kill?

669
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,510
- The girl I saw in the alley?
- Not her, she can't be killed now.

670
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:50,721
Who, then?

671
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:58,395
[gasps]

672
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,147
[somber music playing]

673
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,197
You understand I have to stop it.

674
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,075
And if the monster's back,
she's as good as dead already.

675
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,954
- I don't get it.
- And I don't have time to explain.

676
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,496
I have to...

677
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,376
stop him now, no matter what it takes.

678
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,173
That is my role to play here.

679
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:32,637
I'm sorry.

680
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:03,835
- Are you coming or what?
- No, you go ahead.

681
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,419
Okay.

682
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,881
One more thing.

683
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,509
- I received another call earlier today.
- What call?

684
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:11,760
Apparently, this morning,

685
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:14,596
another dead body
was found in the Chilgok mountains.

686
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,307
They did tell me it must have been old,
but I'm not so sure.

687
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:19,059
One of ours?

688
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:20,582
[Dong-jin] Based on the description,

689
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,647
I think it definitely sounded
like it could be one of ours.

690
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,441
- Did you check it?
- Of course I did.

691
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:29,361
Phone records, e-mails,
bank statements, the whole deal.

692
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:31,280
I'm on it, boss.

693
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,407
Come on, you know
you can always count on me, eh?

694
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,243
- Go! [sighs]
- [chuckles]

695
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:40,664
[car door opens and closes]

696
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:48,714
[dog barking]

697
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,477
[suspenseful music playing]

698

01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,060
[dramatic music playing]

704
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,082
[Cheongseok] We gotta get out of here.

705
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:30,399
Come on!

706
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:32,609
You have to come with me.

707
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,485
Please.

708

- [cell phone ringing]
- [sighs heavily]

709
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:45,664
- Yeah.
- [Dong-jin] <i>So about the body in Chilgok.</i>

710
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,792
<i>- It's definitely one of ours.</i>
- What did you find?

711
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:51,420
Name, Kim Jun-cheol. Anthropologist.

712
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:54,840
He forged some kind of relic a while back,
which caused a whole scandal.

713
01:01:54,923 --> 01:02:00,053
He left academia and started, get this,
a Buddhist meditation website.

714
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:01,763
But only for suicidal people.

715
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:03,098
So that's the one.

716
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,351
All of our dead bodies were members.

717
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:09,396
They're all in this photo
from an in-person meetup in Daegu.

718
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:11,064
Except for two of them,

719
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:14,276
<i>all of these people were found
in the rapidly-decomposed state.</i>

720
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:18,864
But the other two people
I see in that photo...

721
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:20,741
<i>- Who are they?</i>
- Well, it's...

722
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:22,403
It's almost hard to believe.

723
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:25,829
<i>One's the runaway girl
we heard about back at the station.</i>

724
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,915
<i>And the other
is the psychic I went to see.</i>

725
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:30,626
<i>The one who made the talisman.
They have to be connected.</i>

726
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,170
- And where are you now?
<i>- At the office.</i>

727
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:37,174
Okay, check out the psychic.
Send me the address now.

728
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,843
And make sure you
meet me there as soon as you can.

[Seonhwa groaning]

737
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:17,793

[sniffing]

740
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:47,948
You can run.

741
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:50,117
But you can't hide.

742
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:56,873

[cell phone ringing]

754
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,667
Fine then. Just ignore my call.

755
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:26,588
Didn't I come this way last time?
It should be here.

756
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:45,023
Whoa, what the... That looks like...

760
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,205
Don't move.

761
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:03,709

[officer] This is Patrol 8.
We're on our way.

768
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,340
We're close by.
Heading over there right now.

[in Sanskrit] This is not
where you'll die.

783
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:46,121
Go to Buk-San.

Gwangju, please.

798
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:08,222
I can't go all the way
out there this late.

799
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:12,226
- Okay, then just take me to the terminal.
- Sure.

800
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:23,778
[Seonhwa] Taxi!

801
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:26,823

[solemn music playing]

809
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:22,754
[Hajeong] You're afraid?

810
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:27,718
Of course you are. Everyone runs away

811
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:30,304
when faced with fear.

812
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:37,727
Pity.

813
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:43,442
All of your souls have left you.
That only means one thing.

814
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:47,154
It's already done.

815
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,950
The Black Eye has already
stepped on the last stone.

816
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:57,706
They must have thought you would die soon.

817
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,084
You're all that's left now.

818
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:04,713
You cannot run away from this duty.

819
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:07,925
It is your fate
to see it through to the end.

820
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,306
It transferred to you the second I died.

821
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,017
And it will be the same if you die.

822
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:20,229
Your fate will pass to a new successor.

823

[Cheongseok] Bhante <i>Seonhwa!</i>

824

Gwangju.

831
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:32,968
[Ho-tae] That makes no sense!

832
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:36,221
He has a wife and a kid.
He would never do something like that.

833
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,349
[officer] Calm down.
We're looking into it.

834
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:42,394
Maybe someone took his gun and his car.

835
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:43,562
[telephone ringing]

836
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,272

[thunder rumbling]

840
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:21,767
Because he told us to keep it simple.
Don't you think we should do what he...

01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,810
[screeching in distance]

01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:25,562
[eerie music playing]

843
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,064
Let me call you back.

01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[objects clattering]

846
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:50,628
What are you doing?

847
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:52,296
Stop!

848
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,508
- [gunshots]
- [monk grunts]

849
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,937
[in demonic voice] How does it feel
for you to know, old man,

850
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,107
that you have failed so spectacularly now?

851
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:21,910
[screeching in distance]

852
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,046
[Ho-tae] Any witnesses?

853
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,215
[officer] A few said
they heard the commotion.

854
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:37,885
But no one could really see anything.

855
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:39,845
[sarcastically] That's just great.

856
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:43,265
We need to prove this wasn't Dong-jin.

857
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:44,600
Yes, sir.

858
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:49,228

[breathing heavily]

864
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:54,628
My name's Cheongseok, by the way.

865
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,673
May I ask your name?

866

I was right.

[psychic] The other detective?
He was here.

01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:06,839
He came to me a few days ago.

914
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,592
<i>I made him a talisman with his blood.</i>

915

<i>How could he have known
that he was already destined to die, too?</i>

The whole meditation group,

917
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:21,895
no one there realized the awful truth.

918
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:26,483
That their deaths had been
written in stone a long time ago.

919
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:31,071
They were only alive
because they didn't die

920
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:33,365
when they tried to kill themselves before.

921
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,410
But he brought them all together there.

922
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:39,788
How he found them, I don't know.

923
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,584
He took a blood sample
from each one of them

924
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,794
<i>to create the stepping stones.</i>

925
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:48,630
<i>So that the Red One</i>

926

<i>could find them
by the smell of their blood.</i>

927
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:57,097
<i>And pass through them one by one</i>

928
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:01,185
<i>to return to the Black One.</i>

929
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:03,770

The girl kept me here
so I couldn't escape.

Ae-ran promised me I could live
if I just let him take my place.

943
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:00,077
None of this would have
happened if you had just let him die.

There's only one way this ends.
You have to go to that mountain.

It is you.

hell.

1075

Not the kid.

1076
01:42:13,383 --> 01:42:16,720
Leave him. You can have me.

1077
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:19,306
Now you care for him, do you?

1078
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:22,851
He's the son of the woman
who killed your family.

1079
01:42:24,228 --> 01:42:27,356
That hatred still burns inside you.

Family is
the most important thing in the world.

1087
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:52,524
You've suffered so much without them.

1088

to put an end to your pent-up
anguish and resentment.

<i>The deeper our sorrow,</i>

1121
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:02,107
<i>the greater our appreciation
for nirvana will be.</i>

1122
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:06,820
<i>What is our life...</i>

1123
01:48:11,074 --> 01:48:13,911

1124
01:48:16,788 --> 01:48:18,040
<i>Vibrant now,</i>

<i>It is truly fleeting.</i>

1128
01:48:35,724 --> 01:48:39,686
<i>But even the most trivial moments
in our predetermined fate</i>

1129
