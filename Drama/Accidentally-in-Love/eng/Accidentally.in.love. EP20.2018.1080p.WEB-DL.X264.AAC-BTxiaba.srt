EPISODE 20

2
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:34,505
Qingqing.

3
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,464
Why are you walking so fast?

4
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:38,085
Situ Feng, tell me.

5
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,544
You and Lan
were rolling on the ground just now.

6
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,544
What exactly were you two doing?

7
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,105
There was a wind,

8
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,095
-then--
-Wind? Nonsense.

9
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,384
What happened to your hand?

10
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,424
-I'm all right.
-Show me.

11
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,605
It's only a small scratch.

12
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,745
Hey, Qingqing.

13
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:06,345
Is Lan really your best friend?

14
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:08,665
Yes, why?

15
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,224
It's nothing.

16
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,664
I think that you haven't met
a lot of people yet.

17
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,584
You still need to learn
how to read people.

18
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,875
Don't just pour your heart out to anyone.

19
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,445
Why are you laughing?

20
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,615
It's nothing.

21
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:28,715
Hey, there's a scarecrow.

22
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:38,405
Hold this.

23
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,305
Qingqing.

24
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:23,265
You really like flying kites, don't you?

25
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,184
When I was young,

26
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:27,584
I flew a kite once with my parents.

27
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,265
That's my only memory of them.

28
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,145
I understand

29
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,225
how you feel.

30
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,785
My mom left me

31
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,855
when I was young. And my dad,

32
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,285
you've met him.

33
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:51,465
He's never cared about me
since I was young.

34
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,285
Every time we meet,

35
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,785
we'll get into a fight.

36
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,264
I've wanted to talk to you about this.

37
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,265
Perhaps your dad

38
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:05,555
is not as mean as you think.

39
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,385
My dad?

40
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,584
He thinks that I've brought disgrace
upon him by becoming a singer.

41
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,224
He would love to disown me.

42
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,665
That's not true.

43
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,015
Let me show you something.

44
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:19,504
Remember that last time you got sick?

45
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,824
I went to your house to visit you.

46
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,864
I walked into the wrong room at that time.

47
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,585
I accidentally went into his study.

48
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:32,765
Situ Feng?

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,665
<i>In fact,</i>

50
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:51,135
<i>your dad loves you more
than you can imagine.</i>

51
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,085
He just doesnâ€™t know
how to express himself.

52
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,105
I actually envy you.

53
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,345
I've been trying hard

54
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:05,624
to get used to a life

55
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,175
without my parents.

56
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,264
I've become so tough.

57
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,325
Even if no one likes me,

58
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,405
I don't care.

59
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:19,435
Sometimes I would fly a kite alone

60
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,645
and that's when

61
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,435
I would feel

62
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,035
that no matter how hard I try,

63
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,335
I couldn't make the kite fly.

64
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,945
Then, I would think,

65
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,145
if someone

66
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:37,815
could stay by my side,

67
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:39,745
how nice

68
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:42,825
it would be.

69
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,065
Qingqing.

70
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,665
I have something to tell you.

71
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,705
You were the one

72
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:00,824
who helped me overcome my darkest moment.

73
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,665
If possible,

74
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:07,315
I hope that I could always
keep you company.

75
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,385
Ever since I met you,

76
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:13,065
I've noticed

77
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,795
that I've started to care more and more

78
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,165
about what you think.

79
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:25,745
Qingqing.

80
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:28,985
I...

81
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,665
I like you.

82
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,505
Situ Feng.

83
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,745
Actually...

84
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,905
There you are.

85
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,104
Mr. Chen asked me to come
and look for you.

86
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:53,584
There are jackals around.

87
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,224
Hurry up and come home with me.

88
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,065
Come on.

89
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,545
Let's go.

90
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:16,595
-Let's walk together.
-Sure.

91
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,385
It's getting late.

92
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,984
It's time for me to go home.

93
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,864
Didn't you say that my grandpa asked you--

94
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,944
Actually, I wasn't only doing
Mr. Chen a favor.

95
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,625
As your best friend,

96
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,104
I also wanted to check him out for you.

97
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:34,315
I wanted to make sure
that he is compatible with you.

98
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:38,505
When we were hanging the bed sheets...

99
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:44,145
Let's go downtown tomorrow.

100
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:47,624
It's far more interesting
than this small village.

101
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,545
Sure.

102
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,264
We can ask Qingqing to come with us.

103
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,895
You're a city boy.

104
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,464
Don't you find the life here
really boring and intolerable?

105
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,535
Not at all.

106
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,904
I wanted to see the place
where Qingqing grew up.

107
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:02,035
I think that

108
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,765
this is a really good place.

109
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,875
You can't stop talking about Qingqing.

110
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:11,344
I don't think that you two
are just classmates.

111
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,635
You obviously care about her.

112
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:14,935
That's right.

113
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,555
We have been through a lot together.

114
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,875
To me, she's not just
an ordinary classmate.

115
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,865
Actually, an outstanding guy like you

116
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:32,585
shouldn't be hanging out
with an ugly and poor girl.

117
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:36,225
Why don't you consider me?

118
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:38,465
Hey!

119
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:41,384
Although Chen Qingqing
doesn't have great looks,

120
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:44,185
in my opinion, she's a great girl.

121
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,295
I won't let you badmouth her.

122
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,744
We outsiders probably worried too much.

123
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,985
You have good taste in men.

124
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:54,705
Let's go.

125
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:56,345
Let's go.

126
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:07,305
Grandpa.

127
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,304
It's inappropriate
for a young man and a young lady

128
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,965
to wander around in the mountains.

129
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,784
He's going to spend the night here.

130
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:18,824
Hurry up and tidy his room.

131
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,144
There's no electricity here.

132
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,064
You won't be able to see anything later.

133
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:22,945
Mr. Chen.

134
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,365
There's no electricity?

135
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,705
Grandpa.

136
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,304
This is unbelievable.

137
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:31,264
Are you not providing electricity?

138
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,664
We're living in a village.

139
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:35,144
That's how impoverished this place is.

140
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,224
Mr. Chen, that's not what I meant.

141
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,505
I will help Qingqing out.

142
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,505
Why don't we

143
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,505
-sit here?
-Sure.

144
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,305
Here.

145
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,505
<i>Situ Feng has done so much for me,</i>

146
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:30,085
<i>yet I've been lying
to him this whole time.</i>

147
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,425
Qingqing.

148
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,465
-Yes?
-How do you feel

149
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:38,695
about what happened

150
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,105
this morning?

151
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:47,865
Situ Feng.

152
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:54,745
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

153
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:57,875
I will give you an answer later.

154
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,065
Look.

155
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,165
The stars tonight are so pretty.

156
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:14,795
Yes, they are.

157
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:32,784
Situ Feng.

158
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:34,024
What are you doing?

159
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,504
I'm trying to fix the wires.

160
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,224
You know how to do that?

161
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:38,265
Yes.

162
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:45,304
-The electricity is back on.
-Yes.

163
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,464
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

164
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:49,584
-I need to tell you something.
-What is it?

165
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,425
I...

166
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,025
I have to leave.

167
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,345
Right now?

168
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,224
I'm going to release my new album soon.

169
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,664
My agency has arranged for me
to get some training in Korea.

170
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,464
Daniel has already left.

171
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,395
I will meet them there.

172
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,585
Let me take you to the airport.

173
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:08,504
You don't have to.

174
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:12,305
Stay with your grandpa.
I'm going to go now.

175
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:15,915
Be careful on the road.

176
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:17,585
Qingqing.

177
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:21,845
I really had a good time
these past two days.

178
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:25,085
I'm going to go now.

179
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:31,065
Qingqing.

180
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:33,355
See you later.

181
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,725
Travel safely.

182
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,185
Remember to give me a call.

183
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,635
Go inside. It's cold out here.

184
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,825
Grandpa, you're awake.

185
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:11,745
The light?

186
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,165
Situ Feng fixed it.

187
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,504
Where is he?

188
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,695
He just left.

189
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,064
Why didn't he tell me?

190
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,224
He didn't want to disturb your sleep.

191
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:26,025
He's quite thoughtful.

192
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:31,505
Grandpa.

193
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:38,425
I want to tell Situ Feng the truth.

194
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,095
If you think it's worth it,

195
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:49,544
you can make your own decision.

196
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:53,935
You'll be the one who will bear
the consequences anyway.

197
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:58,265
KOREA

198
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,865
<i>Chen Qingqing.</i>

199
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:11,345
<i>When are you going to call me?</i>

200
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,784
Hello, Qingqing?

201
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:19,625
Hello?

202
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,745
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:25,064
I'm going back to campus tomorrow,
so I was packing my luggage.

204
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,785
<i>My grandpa forced me
to bring a lot of things.</i>

205
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,225
Are you going to bed now?

206
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:32,885
<i>It's still early.</i>

207
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:35,664
<i>I can talk to you for a while.</i>

208
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,904
Qingqing, let's do a video call.

209
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,185
No!

210
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,265
I mean,

211
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,945
there was a power cut.

212
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,984
You know, the power went out.
It's really dark.

213
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:49,785
You won't be able to see anything.

214
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,025
Fine.

215
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,544
<i>You were training all day.</i>

216
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:57,205
<i>Was it tiring? Were you exhausted?</i>

217
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,305
It was all right.

218
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,544
It wasn't really tiring.

219
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,744
I had nothing to do just now.

220
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:05,705
So...

221
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,925
So I kind of missed you.

222
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:14,345
Hey.

223
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:15,765
Situ Feng.

224
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,064
<i>Stand by the window.</i>

225
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,065
The window?

226
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,624
Hey, Qingqing.
Don't tell me that you came to Korea?

227
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,625
Situ Feng.

228
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,784
You haven't removed
your makeup yet, have you?

229
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,344
That's right. I haven't.

230
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,104
Qingqing, where are you?

231
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,824
Are you really in Korea? I don't see you.

232
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:34,664
Did the liquid foundation
get into your brain?

233
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,464
Haven't you cleansed your brain?

234
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:39,395
I don't have the money to go there.

235
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,464
Are you really not here?

236
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:42,985
I'm really not.

237
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,525
Situ Feng.

238
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,745
Look outside the window.

239
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:53,865
The moon is so round today.

240
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,675
It's indeed very round.

241
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,365
What should I do?

242
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:02,305
<i>I'm really</i>

243
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,585
not sleepy at all right now.

244
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,144
How about this?

245
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:11,225
I will sing you a song.

246
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,305
Which song?

247
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,544
The title track of my new album.

248
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,304
<i>-Am I the first listener?
-That's right.</i>

249
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:19,904
You've just got a Super VIP pass.

250
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:20,944
Hey, Situ Feng.

251
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:21,785
Hold on.

252
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:26,264
This is such an important song.
I need to prepare something.

253
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,385
Prepare what?

254
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,984
Change the frequency to 72.5MHz.

255
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,984
Change the frequency to 72.5MHz.

256
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:36,344
You're currently listening
to Ming De College Campus Radio.

257
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,224
<i>Idol singer, Situ Feng, is bringing you</i>

258
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,075
the title track of his newest album.

259
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,184
The name of the song...

260
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,424
It's a secret.

261
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,365
I'm going to sing now.

262
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:53,425
<i>Wounds are smoothened by memories</i>

263
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:56,065
<i>Thank you for being here</i>

264
00:16:56,905 --> 00:17:00,465
<i>There are too many memories</i>

265
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:04,785
<i>Our worlds begin to cross path</i>

266
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:09,865
<i>You exist in my past</i>

267
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,665
<i>Like a novel</i>

268
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:16,985
<i>The stories are hidden under a tree</i>

269
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:20,865
<i>Quietly waiting for you to pass by</i>

270
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:24,265
<i>Waiting for you to pass by</i>

271
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,745
This song is great.

272
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,785
<i>I'm certain that this song
will be really popular.</i>

273
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:36,885
What should I do?

274
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,104
It's even harder for me to sleep now

275
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:41,025
<i>after hearing this song.</i>

276
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,304
How about I sing you another song?

277
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:44,265
Sure.

278
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,664
Do you have another song?

279
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,285
What should I sing?

280
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,265
Hey, Qingqing?

281
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,865
Qingqing?

282
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,025
Good night.

283
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,144
<i>Chen Qingqing.</i>

284
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,264
<i>I'm not around. Who are you going
to see a movie with?</i>

285
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>How did you know?</i>

286
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,115
<i>I've planted an informer around you.</i>

287
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,995
<i>It's Gu Nanxi, right?</i>

288
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,264
<i>Don't change the topic.</i>

289
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:26,864
<i>Tell me. Who's going with you?</i>

290
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:29,264
<i>Fangfang doesn't have to work today,</i>

291
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,904
<i>so we decided to go watch a movie.</i>

292
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:31,845
<i>All right.</i>

293
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,624
<i>Go to the movies with me when I come back.</i>

294
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,704
<i>I pity myself.</i>

295
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:37,995
<i>I've only watched a few movies this year.</i>

296
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:43,445
Chen Qingqing.

297
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:46,865
Welcome back.

298
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:47,945
Come on.

299
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,904
I've arranged a celebration for you.

300
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:50,944
Let's go eat together.

301
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,664
Thank you, Lin Yiyang.

302
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,464
I'm going to the movies with Fangfang.

303
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,415
I'm busy.

304
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,304
Aren't you going to eat?

305
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,925
Let's eat together.

306
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:03,205
I'm not hungry. I don't want to eat.

307
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,504
-Qingqing.
-Fangfang.

308
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:06,945
I'm so hungry. Let's go eat.

309
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:10,465
Perfect.

310
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,664
I've reserved a table
at the restaurant across the street.

311
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,024
Let's go eat together.

312
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,595
It's a free meal.

313
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,245
Let's go eat.

314
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,104
Feel free to order anything.

315
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,475
You don't have to be modest.

316
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,485
Chen Qingqing.

317
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:43,225
I think you look prettier
after you came back from your hometown.

318
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,064
What's gotten into Lin Yiyang?

319
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,985
He just complimented me.

320
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:54,095
Did you hear that? Pretty?

321
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:03,985
Well,

322
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:08,015
I think I will go to the bathroom first.

323
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,784
I know this place well.

324
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:11,944
Let me take you there.

325
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,664
I can go there on my own.

326
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:16,405
I need to go to the bathroom too.

327
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:25,885
Chen Qingqing.

328
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,744
I want to talk to you alone.

329
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,904
There's nothing
that we need to discuss alone.

330
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,224
Fangfang is waiting for me.

331
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:32,105
Qingchen.

332
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:35,305
Or

333
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:37,645
should I call you

334
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:41,104
the granddaughter of Chen Xiaotian,
the wealthiest man in Jincheng?

335
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,285
Chen Qingqing.

336
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,405
Did you investigate me?

337
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:49,205
Chen Qingqing.

338
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:52,555
You blew your cover by going home.

339
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,425
No.

340
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,655
Actually, your background

341
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,935
simply catches people's attention.

342
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,384
But don't worry.

343
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,565
I'm not interested in you.

344
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,335
One more thing.

345
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:07,944
Stay away from Situ Feng.

346
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,624
What does this have to do with Situ Feng?

347
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,625
I know.

348
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,545
You two are close.

349
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,104
But have you ever thought about it?

350
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,975
If Situ Feng finds out

351
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,424
that you've been lying to him,

352
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:21,855
what will happen?

353
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:26,205
If the press and Situ Feng's fans find out

354
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:29,215
that he has been lying to them,

355
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,584
what's going to happen?

356
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:35,384
"A liar who has fooled his fans."
This kind of negative coverage

357
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:37,224
will ruin his reputation.

358
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:40,315
Lin Yiyang, you're distorting the truth.

359
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:42,335
No one will believe you.

360
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:44,705
I can make up any scandals.

361
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,335
By the way,

362
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,345
Situ Feng is about

363
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:50,635
to release his new album.

364
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:53,905
Imagine how his reputation

365
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:56,545
could be destroyed by you.

366
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,744
Why are you doing this to Situ Feng?

367
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:01,944
Because he doesn't deserve love.

368
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,305
Is this because of Lan Xinyu?

369
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,925
It happened a long time ago.

370
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:11,155
-Lin Yiyang, why can't you let it go?
-Chen Qingqing.

371
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,605
You don't understand.

372
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:19,435
Anyway, Situ Feng's career
is in your hands.

373
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,955
It's up to you.

374
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:23,665
Let's go.

375
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,704
Qingqing, what took you two so long?

376
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:34,125
They've served all the dishes.

377
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:36,984
Go ahead and eat.

378
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,845
What happened just now,

379
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,104
you know I didn't do it on purpose.

380
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:41,985
I hope

381
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,704
that we could get along peacefully

382
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:45,835
from now on.

383
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:51,505
Welcome back, Chen Qingqing.

384
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:09,995
<i>Is the movie over?
Can you talk on the phone now?</i>

385
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:39,104
Qingqing, why don't you answer it?

386
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,105
It's just a crank call.

387
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,355
Hello, Gu Nanxi?

388
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:48,784
Qingqing is right next to me.

389
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,045
I'm not here.

390
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:55,155
She has fallen asleep.
Should I wake her up?

391
00:23:58,265 --> 00:23:59,575
All right, bye.

392
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:08,784
Situ Feng must've made Gu Nanxi call you
in order to talk to me.

393
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:11,135
What happened between you two?

394
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:13,505
We had a small fight.

395
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,845
It's not a big deal.

396
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:19,824
You've worked hard.

397
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,104
Go home and get some rest.

398
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:23,624
We'll soon start promoting your new album.

399
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,104
Daniel, take me back to school.

400
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,424
There's something I need to do.

401
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,864
What do you want to do there?

402
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,795
Go home and rest first.

403
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,944
Go back to school first.

404
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:33,264
All right. I'll listen to you.

405
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,575
Back to school.

406
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:36,975
Come on. Let's go.

407
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:47,815
Talk to him.
I'll go back to the dorm first.

408
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,104
When did you come back?

409
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,944
I came here straight from the airport.

410
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:02,744
You must be exhausted
from all the training.

411
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,664
Why didn't you go home and rest?

412
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:05,625
Because...

413
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:09,505
I miss you.

414
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,105
Qingqing.

415
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,144
I've been standing here for too long.

416
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:20,104
My legs are numb.

417
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,105
Can you give me a hand?

418
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:23,265
Sure.

419
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:24,745
Give it to me.

420
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,065
No.

421
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:28,965
You're so stupid.

422
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,665
Qingqing.

423
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:38,095
Why didn't you answer my calls?

424
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,845
My battery ran out.

425
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:43,785
I see.

426
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:53,545
Qingqing.

427
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,725
Have you eaten yet?

428
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:04,984
Is there something
that you want to ask me?

429
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:06,485
Go ahead and ask.

430
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:11,715
I have a feeling that you're avoiding me.

431
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:14,475
Why is that?

432
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,015
Do you remember

433
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,965
when you were at my place,

434
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,055
I promised to give you an answer?

435
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:30,185
I remember.

436
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,085
When I came back,

437
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:40,575
I thought hard about it.

438
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,385
So...

439
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,815
I have the answer now.

440
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,265
Do you want to hear it?

441
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:55,625
Yes.

442
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,985
I think...

443
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:07,105
I think

444
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:11,475
it's better for us to stay as classmates.

445
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,555
As normal friends.

446
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:31,135
Are you sure about this?

447
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,295
Don't you like me at all?

448
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:38,865
Yes.

449
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,055
I'm sure about it.

450
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,915
I don't like you at all.

451
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:50,504
Oh, right. I still have work to do.

452
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:52,135
I have to go back.

453
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:24,984
Qingqing, Situ Feng is in trouble.

454
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:26,165
What happened?

455
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:32,584
IDOL SINGER, SITU FENG,
IS ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING.

456
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,864
How did this happen?

457
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,144
Situ Feng released his new album today.

458
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:37,384
Many people soon discovered

459
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:40,264
that this song is very similar
to another original song on the internet.

460
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,904
Although I don't know much about music,

461
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:45,024
a lot of musicians have pointed out
that there's a possibility of plagiarism.

462
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:47,944
After all, that song
was released two weeks ago.

463
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:51,765
Therefore,
the press is talking about this matter.

464
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:57,665
<i>Wounds are smoothened by memories</i>

465
00:28:57,745 --> 00:29:00,305
<i>Thank you for being here</i>

466
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:04,385
<i>There are too many memories</i>

467
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:08,905
<i>Our worlds begin to cross path</i>

468
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,144
Where is Situ Feng right now?

469
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:12,424
Does he know about this?

470
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:13,424
I've just asked him.

471
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:16,264
He's at the agency.
He probably has heard of it.

472
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:21,975
Gu Nanxi, there's something I need to do.
I have to go back to my dorm.

473
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,424
There's no way to prevent a thief
who lives under your roof.

474
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:34,785
Did I give you my permission?

475
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:37,105
Lin Yiyang.

476
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,784
I knew you were the one who did it.

477
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:42,504
There's no evidence to prove
that we stole the music sheet.

478
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,864
<i>I'm going to do everything
to make him miserable.</i>

479
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,555
Stop me if you can.

480
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:47,825
Quit now.

481
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:51,185
Quit? What's in your head?

482
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,744
<i>I didn't know Situ Feng
was this kind of person.</i>

483
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:56,545
I've recorded what you said.

484
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,825
Situ Feng's reputation will be ruined.

485
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:05,115
