00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,085
EPISODE 12

2
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,565
Go on!

3
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,065
Situ Feng!

4
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,325
What's going on?

5
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,725
Sorry, it was an accident.

6
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:11,885
"Accident"?

7
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,484
How can there be so many accidents?

8
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:14,855
Hey, Lin Yiyang!

9
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:20,204
Some fans hacked the agency's computers,
so the music video got leaked.

10
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,884
-I just found out too.
-Situ Feng, can you please

11
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:24,884
come up with a better excuse next time?

12
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,084
Are you taking me for a fool?

13
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:27,085
Lin Yiyang!

14
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,124
You've known me for so long.

15
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,305
You should know me by now.

16
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:34,964
It's because I know you too well.

17
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,924
So everything you do makes me really sick.

18
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:38,765
Okay.

19
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:40,525
I assure you

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,785
that I, Situ Feng won't sing
that song again.

21
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:49,535
I don't want to hear any more
of your promises, Situ Feng.

22
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:53,284
I thought you wouldn't sing that song
for the sake of Qingqing.

23
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,484
Look at what happened.

24
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:56,165
You're two-faced.

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,765
Okay.

26
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:01,575
I'm not buying any more of your promises.

27
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,564
You're out of chances.

28
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,615
Don't blame me for being mean to you.

29
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:17,825
Situ Feng.

30
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,004
Did you make a deal with Yiyang

31
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:23,525
not to sing "Breath"
because he kidnapped me?

32
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,164
Is he using me to threaten you?

33
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,355
It's nothing.

34
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,284
Just let it be.

35
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:32,995
-But I just heard him say--
-Shall we rehearse?

36
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:12,605
Sir.

37
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,644
He's drinking so much.

38
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:16,715
Is he okay?

39
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,524
He's often like that.

40
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,204
He drinks until he passes out every day.

41
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:21,804
And he ordered us to leave him alone.

42
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,124
-But he--
-Don't worry.

43
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,495
He'll leave once he's sober.

44
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,385
Li Yiyang.

45
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:36,125
Yiyang.

46
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:37,835
Are you okay?

47
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,405
Xinyu.

48
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,525
Don't go.

49
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,005
Xinyu.

50
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,775
I feel terrible.

51
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:42,475
HAVE SOME PORRIDGE. TOO MUCH
ALCOHOL IS BAD FOR YOU - FANGFANG

52
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,644
You've got to be there this afternoon,
or I'll be nervous.

53
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:06,604
And I assure you, you'll see
the world's most handsome beast...

54
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:08,475
Situ Feng is not here.

55
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,575
Is this yours?

56
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:17,645
Thanks.

57
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:22,644
Do you and Yiyang don't have
enough clothes to wear?

58
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:25,995
Why do you have to exchange them so often?

59
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:29,044
Aren't you supposed to go
to the meeting for the play?

60
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:29,925
Hurry.

61
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,165
You and Lin Yiyang...

62
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,255
You're going to be late, Qingqing.

63
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:43,285
Students.

64
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:47,125
Without sacrifice, you won't succeed.

65
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:50,604
The road uphill is the toughest of all.

66
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:51,675
And you all

67
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:54,884
have passed it through without a hitch.

68
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,965
Today,

69
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:59,244
as long as you have total faith
in yourselves

70
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:02,835
to bring out the very best
of your abilities,

71
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,524
you'll surely make this play a success.

72
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,884
Did I make myself clear?

73
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:07,804
-Yes!
-Yes!

74
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:08,645
Good.

75
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:12,124
The event is in a few hours.

76
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,965
Let's seize the moment
to do the last rehearsal.

77
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:33,765
Xinya.

78
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:34,765
Look.

79
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:39,315
That bitch Qingqing is about
to take Feng away from you.

80
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:46,185
Baby, I'm here to check on you.

81
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,965
Munian, you're here!

82
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,175
The setup is really nice.

83
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:55,524
Not bad, right?

84
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:56,465
Situ Feng.

85
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,484
I heard you will be wearing
women's clothing.

86
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,965
You guys are so creative!

87
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,444
-Really--
-Qingqing.

88
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,945
I have a problem.

89
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,245
What problem?

90
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,265
The moves.

91
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:10,385
What's wrong with your moves? That's...

92
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,445
Qingqing.

93
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,085
Why don't we rehearse together?

94
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:19,525
Sure.

95
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:22,265
-Kill the beast!
-Kill the beast!

96
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,604
Take whatever booty you can find.

97
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,725
But remember,

98
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,565
the beast is mine!

99
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,305
-Kill the beast!
-Kill the beast!

100
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,245
Gaston, no!

101
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,525
Belle!

102
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,484
What's the matter, Beast?

103
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,605
Are you in love with her?

104
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:49,285
Don't you know how ugly you are?

105
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,684
How can she possibly like you?

106
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:52,965
Die, Beast!

107
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,765
Feng is mine!

108
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,604
Your emotions aren't bad,

109
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,835
but those aren't the lines. Do it again.

110
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:12,484
<i>I heard that Situ Feng took the
female lead in Beauty and the Beast</i>

111
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,164
and Chen Qingqing took the male.

112
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:17,955
-Hurry, let's go and see!
-Let's check it out!

113
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,925
Yes, finally.

114
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:27,004
It's so crowded.

115
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,205
Yeah.

116
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:30,845
Ms. Chen.

117
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:32,165
Good job.

118
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,395
We should hold more events like this.

119
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,405
Little Town

120
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:53,495
is a small, quiet town.

121
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:57,685
Every day, just like
the days before today,

122
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,345
the dawn rises in Little Town.

123
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,195
Every morning, we all say...

124
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:05,925
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

125
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:08,485
Look.

126
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,425
And this is what the baker sent us.

127
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,765
Wheat bread.

128
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:18,005
Ever since we moved here,

129
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:20,845
Little Town hardly changed.

130
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:26,525
Mr. Jean.

131
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,484
Good morning.

132
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,095
Good morning, Belle.

133
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,375
Did you lose something again?

134
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:34,844
I believe I have.

135
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:38,065
Don't you think this pose looks familiar?

136
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,524
-Where have I seen it?
-Where have I seen it?

137
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,365
Yeah.

138
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:43,244
I want to return a book.

139
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,124
-Look at that.
-It's about two lovers

140
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,045
in the beautiful Verona.

141
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,365
Qingqing.

142
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,145
You're up next.

143
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:58,005
In your final act,

144
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:59,235
do your best.

145
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,604
-Go for it.
-I will.

146
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:03,405
Go.

147
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:06,465
Chen Qingqing.

148
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,395
You've got to make the audience

149
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:12,005
see your talent!

150
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,124
-What the--
-Why did you drink my alcohol?

151
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,045
Alcohol?

152
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:36,724
This isn't a prop?

153
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,244
Yeah, this alcohol is for props.

154
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:39,735
Alcohol for props?

155
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,515
Stop drinking it.

156
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,075
If this is alcohol, what is this?

157
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:49,284
<i>No one makes slick and quick moves
Like Gaston does</i>

158
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:53,004
<i>No one shines in the midsummer
Like Gaston does</i>

159
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,364
<i>You make me tremble
When I stand beside you</i>

160
00:11:56,365 --> 00:12:01,844
<i>-Oh, my, Gaston is so perfect!
-Oh, my, Gaston is so perfect!</i>

161
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,725
Kill the beast!

162
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,085
Remember.

163
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:09,084
Take whatever booty you can find.

164
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,845
But the Beast is mine!

165
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:13,205
Oh, no!

166
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,284
We're under attack!

167
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,764
Hurry, warn the Master!

168
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,005
Full force!

169
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,724
-We're not afraid of anything!
-We're not afraid of anything!

170
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,524
-We'll fight them to the end!
-We'll fight them to the end!

171
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,245
Master, the castle is under attack!

172
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:30,225
Just let them come.

173
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,825
I don't care.

174
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,165
Hello, there.

175
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,325
Beast.

176
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:38,805
I'm Gaston.

177
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:40,565
Belle sent me.

178
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:46,125
Are you in love with her?

179
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,285
Did you honestly think

180
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,565
that she'll love you?

181
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,485
No, Gaston!

182
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,025
Don't hurt him!

183
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,165
Belle!

184
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:04,364
When we return to the village,
you will marry me.

185
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,175
And that beast's head

186
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,635
will hang on our wall.

187
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,364
I beg you, Beast.

188
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,564
Please let me go!

189
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,684
I'll do anything.

190
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,285
-Please.
-Get out.

191
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:19,575
Get out of my castle!

192
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,005
Belle.

193
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,084
Are you all right?

194
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,565
You came back.

195
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,115
I told you,

196
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,665
I'll be back.

197
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,055
I'm afraid

198
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,225
it's my turn to leave.

199
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,325
No!

200
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:51,945
You're going to be fine.

201
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:54,725
But...

202
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,525
At least I got

203
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,565
to see you again

204
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:03,525
for one last time.

205
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,805
No.

206
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:08,604
After what we went through,
we're finally together.

207
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,665
You're going to be fine.

208
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,755
I love you.

209
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,685
I love you too.

210
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:26,445
Qingqing.

211
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,305
The show is over.

212
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,935
Did you drink?

213
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,205
-Fangfang.
-You're awake.

214
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,364
How did I get here?

215
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,204
You were drunk during the play.

216
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,705
You just woke up.

217
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,404
How could I have missed

218
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:10,495
the applause and cheers of the audience?

219
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,835
Who told you to drink?

220
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:15,884
What time is it?

221
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,244
It's four o'clock. Why?

222
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,684
Isn't it that witch's class now?

223
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:20,724
We're too late now.

224
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:23,484
Ms. Chen took a sick leave,
so she asked us to have our own revision.

225
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:24,615
Is she sick?

226
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,164
She said she was worn out.

227
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,084
Perhaps from all the rehearsals.

228
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,125
Is she seriously ill?

229
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,804
Shall we go see her?

230
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,164
We just went there.

231
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,724
It's not that serious.

232
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:36,855
That's good.

233
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:42,745
If you're still worried,
you can drop by at her place.

234
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:43,845
Good point.

235
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,525
NO. 2, SPRING GARDEN, BACK STREET

236
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,125
Ms. Chen.

237
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:02,665
Chen Qingqing.

238
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:03,965
Ms. Chen.

239
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,164
I'm here to visit you.

240
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:07,045
Come in.

241
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:08,325
Thank you.

242
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,525
Ms. Chen.

243
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:17,484
You shouldn't overwork like that
after this.

244
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,404
Your health is the most important thing.

245
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,924
I'm just slightly ill.

246
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:23,564
As long as the play went smoothly,

247
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:25,164
I felt really pleased.

248
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,644
It was all thanks to you.

249
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,364
If it wasn't for your supervision,

250
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:31,785
we wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

251
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:35,825
Actually, for all this while, we've all

252
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,245
misunderstood you.

253
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,765
It's okay.

254
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,604
There's no need to blame yourself.

255
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,685
I just hope that I could see

256
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,044
each and every one of you improve.

257
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,045
And for this performance,

258
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,545
each and every one of you did a great job.

259
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,444
I'll get you some fruits.

260
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:55,524
No, it's okay.

261
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,044
You should get some rest.

262
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,724
It's okay, I'll be fine.

263
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:01,455
-It'll take just a minute.
-Okay.

264
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:38,965
Chen Qingqing.

265
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:40,995
What's wrong?

266
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,605
Do you know them?

267
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:49,565
Actually...

268
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,815
Actually, Xiao Jingnan

269
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:57,285
is my dad.

270
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,565
What about Chen Youyou?

271
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,725
Chen Youyou

272
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,565
is my mom.

273
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:10,845
Qingqing.

274
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,805
You really turned out to be

275
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,455
exactly like Youyou.

276
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,475
No wonder when I heard you play the piano,

277
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:22,365
I had

278
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,505
a strong sense of déjà vu.

279
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,005
This is who I am, more or less.

280
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,335
By the way, I'm Chen Xiao.

281
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,444
I look forward to working with you.

282
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,325
Hey.

283
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,924
Newcomers should tell us
their vital stats, right?

284
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:41,445
-Vital stats!
-Vital stats!

285
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,284
What's going on here?

286
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:46,435
I could hear your commotion from outside.

287
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,924
Don't bully our new friend.

288
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,684
I brought you some drinks today.

289
00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,684
Come take them, they are for everyone.

290
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,605
-All right!
-All right!

291
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:58,245
For you.

292
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,284
What's your name?

293
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,225
Chen Xiao.

294
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,764
My name is Chen too.

295
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,205
I'm Chen Youyou.

296
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,085
Hello.

297
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:08,764
It's so good to know you,
my little sister.

298
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:09,605
Guys.

299
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,405
From now on,

300
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,565
Chen Xiao is now my little sister.

301
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,675
Whoever bullies her

302
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,825
is going to get it from me, okay?

303
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,524
My mom was so domineering.

304
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,884
Come to think of it,

305
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,444
the first time I saw you,

306
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,675
you looked kind of familiar.

307
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,885
Your mom was like a hero.

308
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,604
Ever since I got to know her,

309
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:38,645
she has been helping me, caring for me

310
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,185
and a lot more.

311
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:42,445
She may not remember,

312
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,015
but I will always remember.

313
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,765
By the way, how are your parents?

314
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:54,005
My mom passed away many years ago.

315
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,604
And I don't know where my dad is.

316
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,284
I came to this school

317
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:02,245
just to find out more about my parents.

318
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:03,945
They're...

319
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,005
Ms. Chen.

320
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:13,785
They're...

321
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,585
It's been almost 20 years.

322
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,945
I've not kept in touch with them.

323
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:26,685
Ms. Chen.

324
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,105
Can you tell me

325
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,405
what my dad was like?

326
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,535
Because every time

327
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,345
I asked my grandpa,

328
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,735
he'd always flip out.

329
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,655
He always said that my dad
abandoned my mom.

330
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,485
Then he never came back to see me.

331
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,665
Is my dad really that bad?

332
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,445
Did he really love my mom?

333
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:53,564
Jingnan is not a bad person.

334
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:56,175
And the person he loved the most

335
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,885
was Youyou.

336
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:00,675
He loved Mom the most?

337
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:06,925
Just a moment, Qingqing.
I need to show you something.

338
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,365
This photo was taken

339
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,485
when your parents first met.

340
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:32,205
Youyou, why are you so calm?

341
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:34,364
Your dance partner stood you up.

342
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,485
What are you going to do?

343
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:37,775
It's okay.

344
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:39,444
I'll just have to forfeit.

345
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,804
You can't pull out like that.

346
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:43,924
You're really great at dancing.
Wouldn't it be a waste to forfeit?

347
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,795
Then what should I do?

348
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,565
I think we'll just have

349
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,505
to join the audience after this.

350
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:53,765
Youyou, look.

351
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,285
That guy over there dressed up so weirdly.

352
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,165
He's walking toward us.

353
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,435
Do you know him, Youyou?

354
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:05,445
I don't.

355
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:08,065
Hello, are you Miss Chen Youyou?

356
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:10,884
I'm so sorry that my friend
is giving you such a hard time.

357
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,484
But he had something urgent
to attend to today,

358
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,644
so I'll take his place.

359
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,145
I'm Xiao Jingnan.

360
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:20,245
Hello.

361
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:23,604
Can you dance?

362
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:25,405
Just a little bit.

363
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,884
It's still early before the dance.

364
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:29,375
Shall we practice?

365
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,445
Sure.

366
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:32,985
I'll get going.

367
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,105
-Let's try.
-Okay.

368
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:44,565
Sorry.

369
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,245
Sorry.

370
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,285
Sorry. I'm so sorry!

371
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,175
I can't really dance.

372
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,804
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

373
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,105
I just stepped on your foot.

374
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:05,645
Why don't we take a break?

375
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:06,925
Sure.

376
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:14,525
Youyou.

377
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,355
Can I call you this?

378
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:18,764
We're in the same grade, right?

379
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:21,445
I see that you're a bit nervous.

380
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:23,244
I don't know why either.

381
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,404
Perhaps it's because the dance
is about to start soon.

382
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:29,145
So I'll get a little bit nervous.

383
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,484
Although I can't dance,

384
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:32,685
but I think

385
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,484
dancing doesn't matter so much.

386
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,204
What matters is that you enjoy the music.

387
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,404
You have to control the rhythm,

388
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:40,885
not let the rhythm control you.

389
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:45,405
Xiao Jingnan.

390
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:48,044
I didn't think you could comfort anyone,

391
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:50,045
but it's just the same.

392
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,765
Are you still nervous?

393
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:57,085
I'm much better.

394
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:32,025
When I saw them dance, I was stunned.

395
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:36,004
I had a strong feeling
that I should keep watching.

396
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,885
As time slowly passed,

397
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:39,995
looking at them

398
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,375
was like gazing at happiness.

399
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:45,645
And then?

400
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,675
What happened next?

401
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:50,885
Then,

402
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:54,284
they danced by controlling the rhythm
like your dad said

403
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:57,575
and won the event as prom king and queen.

404
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,565
Really?

405
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:04,575
Xiao Jingnan joined the Student Council
just to be with Youyou.

406
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:07,405
Then he became the president.

407
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,585
Is it this picture?

408
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:15,084
Two people who really love each other

409
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:18,535
will surely outdo themselves
for one another.

410
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:25,484
Ms. Chen, do you know
what happened to my mom and dad

411
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:27,725
after graduation?

412
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,964
The last time I saw them

413
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:37,765
was when Xiao Jingnan proposed to Youyou.

414
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:56,525
Youyou.

415
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,195
Do you remember this song?

416
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:05,604
They played this during the dance
when we first met.

417
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:07,225
Time flies so fast.

418
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,564
We're about to graduate.

419
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,505
I remember

420
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,525
the first time we held hands.

421
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:18,385
I want to keep holding them.

422
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:23,284
The lecturers always said
that graduation means separation.

423
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:25,165
But I don't think so.

424
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:29,775
I think that graduation to us
can be another new beginning.

425
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:33,045
Youyou, will you marry me?

426
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:36,725
I will.

427
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:39,845
I will.

428
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,125
And then,

429
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:07,564
I heard that Xiao Jingnan and Youyou
went to work in Jincheng.

430
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:08,525
And then,

431
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:10,924
I went on with my life.

432
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:15,045
Studying, graduating
and looking for a job...

433
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,845
I slowly lost touch with them.

434
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:30,804
Qingqing, don't cry.

435
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:31,685
Ms. Chen.

436
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,965
Thank you so much.

437
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:39,725
Thank you for telling me so much
about them.

438
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:44,444
This is the first time
I heard anything about my parents.

439
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:48,005
I'm also happy to be their daughter.

440
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:52,965
Qingqing, have you found any information
about your dad?

441
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:55,925
No.

442
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,124
Don't worry, Qingqing.

443
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,044
I'll definitely help you out.

444
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:04,565
I'm sure you'll hear from your dad soon.

445
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,685
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

446
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:16,525
Ms. Chen, it's getting late.

447
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,404
I should go back to school.

448
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:21,484
-But I need you to do me a favor.
-Sure.

449
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:24,724
I came to Yuncheng
without telling my grandpa.

450
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,764
So once I go back to school,

451
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,284
I still want to continue

452
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:30,444
presenting myself like I've always been.

453
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:33,084
So you have to help me keep this secret.

454
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:34,515
Please, Ms. Chen?

455
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:35,805
Okay.

456
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,985
That won't be a problem.

457
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,145
I've got to go now, Ms. Chen.

458
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,365
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

459
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,075
Let me send you out.

460
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:03,404
<i>Like what Ms. Chen just said,</i>

461
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:07,084
<i>Mom and Dad loved each other.</i>

462
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:12,564
<i>Then why did Grandpa
say that Dad abandoned Mom?</i>

463
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:16,035
<i>Did he lie to me?</i>

464
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:22,275
<i>Then why did he have to lie?</i>

465
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:30,525
Your phone, sir.

466
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:36,285
Hello?

467
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:37,485
Hello?

468
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:38,484
<i>Grandpa.</i>

469
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:40,285
Is that you, Qingqing?

470
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,695
How would I know if

471
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,564
<i>I'm in love with somebody?</i>

472
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,804
Are you okay now?

473
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,004
<i>I realized that</i>

474
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,524
<i>I can be myself in front of her.</i>

475
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:57,004
It looks like this friend of yours

476
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:58,924
is more than just a friend.

477
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,684
<i>So what if I'm not myself,</i>

478
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:02,804
but I've turned into
a completely different person?

479
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:05,585
Chen Qingqing, what brings you here?

480
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,804
How could you just bring
any ordinary person here?

481
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:10,844
Miss, may I see your invitation?

482
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:13,604
<i>We've hated each other since we first met.</i>

483
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,004
And we still do.

484
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:16,684
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

485
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:19,365
Can I say what I like about you?

486
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:21,915
