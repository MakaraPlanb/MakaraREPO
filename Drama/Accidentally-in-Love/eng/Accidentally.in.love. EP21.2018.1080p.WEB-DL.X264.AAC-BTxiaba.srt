EPISODE 21

2
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,364
<i>Hebiancao,did you see the latest news
about His Highness?</i>

3
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:53,964
<i>-I just saw it.
-Oh, my God.</i>

4
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:56,445
<i>How unlucky. How did it happen?</i>

5
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:00,004
I MIGHT STOP SUPPORTING HIM.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE DID STEAL THE SONG.

6
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,724
<i>Calm down, let's see
what his agency has to say.</i>

7
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,135
<i>Please believe in His Highness.</i>

8
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:10,395
<i>IDOL SINGER ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM.
VIDEO LEAKED.</i>

9
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,524
<i>The time this video was taken</i>

10
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,564
<i>seems to be two days
after Situ Feng sang this song for me</i>

11
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,724
<i>so he couldn't have copied the song.</i>

12
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,645
<i>Who's behind all this?</i>

13
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,965
<i>A competitor?</i>

14
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,485
<i>Or...</i>

15
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:29,044
<i>Hebiancao, what do you think?
Will you stop supporting him?</i>

16
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,435
<i>It's a set up.</i>

17
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:31,604
<i>My close friend told me</i>

18
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,644
<i>she personally heard His Highness
sang this song before.</i>

19
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,644
<i>Even before the video was uploaded.</i>

20
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:36,605
<i>Really?</i>

21
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,255
<i>Absolutely.</i>

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,324
<i>Something fishy is going on here.</i>

23
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,444
FAN E: LATEST NEWS FLASH

24
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,764
PLAGIARIZED SINGER IS A FORMER INTERN
OF SITU FENG'S AGENCY

25
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,284
FAN F: SO DRAMATIC, WHO COPIED WHO?

26
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,084
COULD THE EX TRAINEE BE
SITU FENG'S GHOST WRITER?

27
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,365
<i>Hebiancao,should we investigate?</i>

28
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,205
<i>That's for sure!</i>

29
00:02:56,805 --> 00:03:00,635
<i>Don't worry, let's support His Highness
together.</i>

30
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:07,005
<i>Wounds are smoothened by memories</i>

31
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,044
<i>Thank you for being here--</i>

32
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,355
This is absurd.

33
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:13,644
There's no way to prevent a thief
who lives under your roof.

34
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:17,564
Mei, check the surveillance camera
to see if Zhou Zhi

35
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,484
has stolen this song demo
from our company.

36
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,405
Okay.

37
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:27,355
Daniel, those comments by netizens
don't bother me.

38
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,964
People who trust me will have faith in me.

39
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:32,924
But will this issue affect
my latest album's release?

40
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,364
Don't be so naive.

41
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:37,265
The agency produces albums for profit.

42
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:40,164
With such a bad reputation,
who would purchase your album?

43
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,965
Yet you're thinking...

44
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:44,844
What makes you think
we can release this album now?

45
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,964
Right, you have that commercial event
this afternoon.

46
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,765
Remember to attend it.

47
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,875
-Commercial event?
-Yes.

48
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,965
It's 15 yuan.

49
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:55,444
Glow sticks, anyone? For 15 yuan.

50
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,804
Miss, do you want to buy a glow stick?

51
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,964
There will be performances
by singers inside.

52
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:01,165
Sir,

53
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:04,244
-do you have Situ Feng's glow sticks?
-Situ Feng?

54
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,884
Wasn't he accused of plagiarism?

55
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:08,364
I didn't think he would still come today.

56
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,795
I don't have his glow sticks.

57
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,444
All right, I'll look around then.

58
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:13,884
There's no need to.

59
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:16,124
I'm the only stall here
selling glow sticks.

60
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,375
Just pick one.

61
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:20,585
Okay, sir.

62
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:21,804
I will take these two.

63
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,924
Thank you, everyone
for coming to our event today.

64
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,845
Let's now welcome

65
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,724
-the idol singer, Situ Feng.
-Excuse me.

66
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:32,735
-perform an opening song for us.
-Excuse me, thanks.

67
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,875
I heard he was accused of plagiarism.

68
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:52,385
Excuse me.

69
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,525
<i>Nights</i>

70
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,765
<i>-City lights
-Thank you.</i>

71
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,284
<i>-People come and go
-Excuse me.</i>

72
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:10,365
<i>Like thousands of shining stars</i>

73
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,725
<i>-Excuse me.
-Stars</i>

74
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:15,125
<i>Come and go</i>

75
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,085
<i>The future is a puzzle</i>

76
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,765
<i>The glare makes it hard to see</i>

77
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:23,285
Situ Feng!

78
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,244
<i>Day and night alternates
Time fleets like a white horse</i>

79
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:31,004
<i>-I stay there holding onto memories
-We shall remember</i>

80
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:34,005
<i>Those times</i>

81
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:38,405
<i>Separated from dawn by the sea</i>

82
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,604
<i>-Leave and say goodbye to the past
-Farewell</i>

83
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:45,605
<i>For all wrongdoings</i>

84
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:51,485
<i>You sail through endless years</i>

85
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,164
<i>Time is like the surface of the sea</i>

86
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:57,165
<i>It reflects 1,001 nights</i>

87
00:05:57,245 --> 00:06:02,245
<i>Those unchanged has changed</i>

88
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:05,805
<i>The fallen leaves after the run</i>

89
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:08,524
<i>The wind carries them to someone else</i>

90
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:13,885
<i>-And they carry him forward
-Situ Feng!</i>

91
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:17,005
<i>Hope is standing on the edge</i>

92
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,805
<i>It lights up day and night</i>

93
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:25,085
<i>It shines within my sight</i>

94
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:28,125
<i>When I get to the end of the story</i>

95
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:31,044
<i>I understand how fate has been right</i>

96
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,644
<i>-It's all about staying by your side
-Situ Feng!</i>

97
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,845
We will support you!

98
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:38,845
FENG

99
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,324
-Go away.
-Get lost.

100
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:44,524
For God's sake.

101
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:45,805
Go away.

102
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:49,955
You did well.

103
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:55,644
Right, the person who was holding
that interesting banner

104
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,805
might be a new supporter.

105
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:04,845
Dad, I'm home.

106
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:07,605
Hang on.

107
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:14,465
You're always
causing unnecessary troubles,

108
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,804
damaging our family's reputation.

109
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,924
What kind of agency are you with?

110
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,575
Did they find you an investigator
or a lawyer?

111
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,045
Dad.

112
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,045
Don't worry.

113
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,115
I can solve it myself.

114
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:34,644
That's good.

115
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:36,324
If there's nothing else,

116
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,524
I'm going up to rest now.

117
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,845
You should too.

118
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,165
CHEN QINGQING

119
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,325
Come in.

120
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,225
Situ Feng.

121
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,484
Gu Nanxi, why are you here?

122
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,124
I brought someone here with me.

123
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,644
Is it Chen Qingqing?

124
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,605
Feng.

125
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:08,645
It's me.

126
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,565
Xinya?

127
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:12,745
Why are you here?

128
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,975
I brought your favorite snacks.

129
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:18,805
Thanks.

130
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:19,765
Feng.

131
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:21,804
Don't worry about what the media
wrote about you.

132
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,164
They are all nonsense.

133
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,764
Who do they think they are,
writing those comments?

134
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,404
It's full of rubbish.

135
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:31,644
So, is it true that the other singer
used to be from your agency?

136
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,525
Yes,

137
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,964
but he left after his contract
was terminated.

138
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:39,545
He could be holding on to grudges
and did this on purpose.

139
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:43,444
Has your agency found any evidence
against him yet?

140
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:45,525
Not at the moment.

141
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:46,764
Don't be too worried.

142
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:49,845
The situation will eventually get better.

143
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,145
Who knows for sure?

144
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:59,265
My latest album
is now stuck without progress.

145
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,395
That could be a problem.

146
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:22,484
<i>Hebiancao, are you there?</i>

147
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:24,655
<i>I think we found something.</i>

148
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,764
<i>I am here. What did you find?</i>

149
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,804
<i>We were researching online
for the entire day today</i>

150
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,484
<i>and found something worth looking into.</i>

151
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,844
<i>We found the first negative commenter.</i>

152
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,084
<i>This person seems odd.</i>

153
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:36,884
<i>Under all of Situ Feng's songs,</i>

154
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:37,964
<i>he left a similar comment</i>

155
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:39,764
<i>accusing His Highness of plagiarism.</i>

156
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,204
<i>He works like a bot!</i>

157
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,485
<i>Anyone found his IP address?</i>

158
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:47,284
<i>I did and it gets more interesting here.</i>

159
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,244
<i>Lei tried to locate this IP address.</i>

160
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:53,724
<i>It seems to come from an internet cafe
near Ming De College.</i>

161
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,724
<i>That's good, I am just around the corner.</i>

162
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,004
<i>I will have a look tomorrow.</i>

163
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,204
<i>Will update you guys then.</i>

164
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:03,155
<i>All right! We'll keep looking too
for His Highness, keep it up!</i>

165
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,364
Can you respond to Situ Feng's
plagiarism claims?

166
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:11,764
As Situ Feng's manager,

167
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:15,644
<i>I will bet my entire career that
he never plagiarized anyone's songs</i>

168
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,004
<i>this case is obviously a set up.</i>

169
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,644
<i>We're still investigating the matter.</i>

170
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:23,124
<i>A press conference will be held
three days later for more clarity.</i>

171
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,924
<i>Of course, we'd like to show everyone
how talented Situ Feng really is.</i>

172
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,365
<i>His new song will be</i>

173
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,644
<i>officially released in three days as well.</i>

174
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,244
<i>This latest song will be heavily promoted.</i>

175
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:36,055
How was it? I did well, didn't I?

176
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:37,884
Three days?

177
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:39,805
A brand new song?

178
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,084
Daniel, did I give you my permission?

179
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,005
Gosh.

180
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,484
The agency has been urging me
and the media is pestering me.

181
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:46,484
What can I do?

182
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,915
I'm running out of ideas too!

183
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,284
Gu Nanxi, it's me.

184
00:10:56,285 --> 00:11:00,645
I just found some clues
to Situ Feng's case.

185
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:04,164
It lies in the internet cafe
near our college.

186
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,975
Can you come with me?

187
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,245
Okay, see you later. Bye.

188
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:36,965
<i>-Hello?
-Hey.</i>

189
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:39,844
What a beautiful day. It's almost over.

190
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:42,635
Have you written your new song yet?

191
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,684
I have no inspirations at all

192
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,564
<i>I can't come up with anything.</i>

193
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,805
What? Nothing yet?

194
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,884
I promised the entire world yesterday

195
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,044
with such confidence

196
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,324
that we'd release a new song
in three days.

197
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,265
But this is how it is.

198
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,484
I have no inspirations at all.

199
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,044
<i>Could it be you're being too picky?</i>

200
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:08,044
Why don't you take reference
from your old music pieces,

201
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,284
edit them a little.

202
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,804
Nobody has heard them before anyway.

203
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,484
They can't be used at all, all right?

204
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:16,044
Plus, if I don't like the songs,

205
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:17,684
<i>my fans will not like them too.</i>

206
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:20,844
Okay, it's my fault
for being superficial, all right?

207
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:22,844
We have two more days left.

208
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,844
You should concentrate on the new song.

209
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,204
Leave the rest to me.

210
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,644
<i>Don't stress yourself over it, okay?</i>

211
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,455
Okay, I'm hanging up.

212
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:50,825
-Police.
-Police.

213
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:55,644
We suspect a bank robber
has entered your internet cafe.

214
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:56,884
He's running away from us.

215
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:58,165
No.

216
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,324
A bank robber?
No one here would do such a thing.

217
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,265
Calm down.

218
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,884
We're just trying to find out

219
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,324
who was here on the night
of the 12th of last month.

220
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,845
Wait a second.

221
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:09,955
Here it is.

222
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,685
Sir, ma'am, look.

223
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:15,204
This is the list of customers
for last month.

224
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,124
Everything should be there.

225
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,164
-What?
-No!

226
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,885
I confirm that everything is there.

227
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,084
-Zhao Dalei.
-Sir.

228
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,325
Everything went well.

229
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,185
Situ Feng is done this time.

230
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,964
Our boss is really too smart.

231
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,644
I bet Situ Feng will not be able
to create a new song in three days.

232
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:37,605
No.

233
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:40,124
Now, there are only two days left.

234
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,924
Even if he did,
the quality is going to suck.

235
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,924
We can carry on talking bad about him.

236
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,724
Dalei, you're getting smarter these days.

237
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,244
That's because I learn from the best.

238
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,365
Lin Yiyang.

239
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,084
I knew you were the one who did it.

240
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,204
Qingqing, don't act rashly.

241
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,845
Lin Yiyang, why did you do it?

242
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,884
What are you two talking about?

243
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:01,884
Why doesn't it make sense to me?

244
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,404
Stop pretending, Zhao Dalei.

245
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,044
We've already found out

246
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,804
you were the one
who started those comments.

247
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,925
Really?

248
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:09,885
So what?

249
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,084
It's true that Situ Feng
plagiarized the song.

250
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,685
We're just stating the fact.

251
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:15,924
Is that true?

252
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:19,004
Coming from someone like you who doesn't
even read the entertainment news,

253
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,725
how could you have known?

254
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:26,284
You guys must have been the ones
who gave Zhou Zhi that music sheet

255
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,284
then instructed him
to use that stolen piece

256
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,884
to create a similar song
then uploaded it online in advance

257
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:33,545
to accuse Situ Feng of plagiarism.

258
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,084
What a wonderful analysis.

259
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:44,084
I almost thought you were Detective Conan.

260
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:48,044
But even if you were right,
do you have any evidence

261
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:51,645
to prove it was us
who took the music sheet?

262
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:56,445
If you've got no evidence,
hurry up and go back home.

263
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,505
No evidence, no talk.

264
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,725
Lin Yiyang.

265
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:03,884
Do you have any idea
how upsetting this could be for Situ Feng?

266
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,005
We all grew up together.

267
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,044
Let me be clear.

268
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:11,364
Ever since that incident happened,
we're no longer brothers nor friends.

269
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:13,564
I'm going to do everything
to make him miserable.

270
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:15,255
Stop me if you can.

271
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,084
Stop it, Lin Yiyang!

272
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:18,124
Are you okay?

273
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,885
I'm fine. Let's go.

274
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,845
Listen up, Lin Yiyang.

275
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,935
I will find the evidence!

276
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:31,284
-What? Lin Yiyang did it?
-Yes.

277
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,444
I got it. I will hire more people
and get to the bottom of this.

278
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,065
By the way, Daniel.

279
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,525
How is Situ Feng doing?

280
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,315
He's not doing well.

281
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,285
How come?

282
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,884
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

283
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:49,644
But given his talents,
I'm sure he will come up with something.

284
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:50,604
<i>Let's leave it here.</i>

285
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,524
<i>Once I have more information
about Lin Yiyang,</i>

286
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,145
<i>I will contact you.</i>

287
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,045
-Mei.
-Yes?

288
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,844
Get me the profiles of employees
with high turnover probabilities.

289
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,004
We need to search for them
in the surveillance videos.

290
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,964
Before our press conference,

291
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,484
I have to find that person
who took the music sheet.

292
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,225
-Now.
-I'll be on it right away.

293
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:20,925
Why are we here?

294
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,284
This is where Zhou Zhi lives.
I'm going to see him.

295
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,524
Don't be foolish.

296
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,804
We have no evidence to confront him.

297
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:31,844
Do you want to help out or not?
If you're not, you can leave now.

298
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:34,405
Leave? Hey, wait for me.

299
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,844
Are you Zhou Zhi?

300
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:42,884
Who are you?

301
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:46,044
Let's be frank, were you the one
who set Feng up?

302
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,924
Have you not figured out the situation?

303
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,164
He was the one who copied me.

304
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:51,764
Stop spouting nonsense.

305
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,164
Still trying to pretend?

306
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,565
Was it because of money?

307
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,225
Here's my card.

308
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:03,045
You can take it,

309
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,724
but you'll have
to tell everyone the truth.

310
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,484
Xinya, don't do this.

311
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,275
Did Situ Feng send the two of you
to bribe me?

312
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:12,525
No.

313
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,004
We didn't mean to do that.

314
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,924
So what if it's a bribe?

315
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,535
Why? Is this not enough for you?

316
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,564
I didn't expect Situ Feng to be
this kind of person.

317
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,844
Manipulating people to get what he wants.

318
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:27,195
Don't you dare speak like that about Feng!

319
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,965
I've recorded

320
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,645
what you said.

321
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,125
Situ Feng's reputation

322
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:36,165
will be ruined.

323
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,355
Let's go.

324
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:45,885
I can't...

325
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:48,835
Are you okay?

326
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,115
I'm okay.

327
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:51,845
You?

328
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,285
I'm fine.

329
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:57,255
Thanks for what happened earlier.

330
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,785
Don't mention it.

331
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:02,084
I'm not letting anyone bully my Queen Lan.

332
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,965
But what's going to happen to Feng?

333
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:07,125
Come on.

334
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,564
Don't worry.

335
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:13,124
Given his talents, I'm sure he will
be able to come up with a new song.

336
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,135
I hope so.

337
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,605
Cheers!

338
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:25,325
Lin Yiyang.

339
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,115
How dare you?

340
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:30,804
Did you forget about
what happened at the park?

341
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,644
Qingqing told me everything.

342
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,044
Were you behind Situ Feng's case?

343
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,564
So what if I was?

344
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,124
Haven't I told you?

345
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,604
-I've got nothing to do with you.
-Don't get me wrong.

346
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,164
I'm not trying to get close to you.

347
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,204
I'm just telling you as a regular student.

348
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,044
You're not an evil person to begin with,

349
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,215
so before things get worse,

350
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:50,324
you should stop now.

351
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,245
Stop now?

352
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:55,564
Why don't you tell us
how should we stop it?

353
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:56,844
Go turn yourselves in.

354
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,404
Admit that you took the music sheet.

355
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,085
Be sincere about it.

356
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,985
Oh, my God, this is hilarious.

357
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,444
What's so hilarious about it?

358
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,884
What is in that brain of yours?

359
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:14,685
That was so fucking naive.
Do you hear yourself?

360
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,505
Why don't you

361
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:21,965
consider dating our boss
as one of his girlfriends?

362
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,245
Enough.

363
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,235
Let's go.

364
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:32,525
You should think
about that suggestion of mine.

365
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:45,425
-Good day, sir.
-Good day, sir.

366
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:46,444
Where's Feng?

367
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,644
Young Master has been staying
in his room for two days.

368
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,364
He hasn't eaten much.

369
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,535
Could it because of stress?

370
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:07,645
Dad.

371
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,245
What brought you here?

372
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,645
I saw the news.

373
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,965
What's wrong? No ideas yet?

374
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:20,685
Yes.

375
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,155
No ideas yet.

376
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,325
Come with me. Let's play some games.

377
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:38,525
Hey, son.

378
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,925
Is that all you've got?

379
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,005
Again.

380
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,485
Again!

381
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,805
Dad!

382
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:06,875
Little rascal, you're pretty good
at playing games.

383
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:18,445
It's been a while
since we played like this.

384
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:22,084
You're right, Dad.
We haven't played in a while.

385
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,145
You're still good at it.

386
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,445
You resemble your mom so much.

387
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:34,155
Simple but committed.

388
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:36,055
Once she sets a goal,

389
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:39,465
she will achieve it no matter the cost.

390
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:46,365
Perhaps it's time for me to give up.

391
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,364
This doesn't sound like you.

392
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:52,165
Tomorrow is my due date.

393
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,485
So far,

394
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,385
I have written nothing.

395
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:59,555
Have you done your best?

396
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,005
Have you

397
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:04,875
given all that you've got, do or die

398
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:07,945
to protect what you love deeply?

399
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,405
What I love deeply?

400
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,925
As human beings,

401
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,004
there are two ways to live our lives.

402
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,885
One way is to live like the grass.

403
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:25,164
Constantly being showered by the sun,

404
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:27,445
but they will never grow.

405
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:31,885
Another is to live like a tree.

406
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,885
As long as you're a seed,

407
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:39,124
you can survive anywhere with soil.

408
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:43,645
You'd be able to absorb nutrients
from the soil and grow.

409
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:47,345
You're talented, I won't deny that.

410
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,565
To become a tree,

411
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:53,085
there are going to be obstacles.

412
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:58,535
If you can pull through all hardships,
you'll become a real man.

413
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:05,485
I have faith in you

414
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,915
because you're my son.

415
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:12,895
Okay, go write your song.

416
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:16,485
Wait.

417
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,084
I have something for you.

418
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,004
Something for me?

419
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:23,775
You should never
let someone who likes you down.

420
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:25,284
Someone who likes me?

421
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:27,004
When I came back earlier,

422
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,815
I met a girl outside.

423
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:33,785
She was the one who created a scene
at the wedding ceremony.

424
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,885
Have we met before?

425
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:43,365
Hello, sir.

426
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:44,685
No.

427
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,565
We haven't met before.

428
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,844
What happened to your neck?

429
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,044
I might have sprained my neck
while sleeping last night.

430
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:55,445
Well, sir...

431
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:56,565
This...

432
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,805
This is for Situ Feng.

433
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,764
Would you pass it to him, please?
Thank you very much.

434
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:03,725
Dad.

435
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:05,604
Did you give her a hard time?

436
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:07,044
What are you talking about?

437
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,165
Am I such a petty person?

438
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:10,345
Thanks, Dad.

439
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,245
<i>Situ Feng,</i>

440
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,964
<i>I hope you'd be able to smile
through this difficult period.</i>

441
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,764
<i>No matter what happens,
we will support you.</i>

442
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:26,645
<i>I drew this myself.</i>

443
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:29,485
<i>It is as rare as you can get.</i>

444
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,964
If anything goes wrong
with the press conference,

445
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:57,284
all of you can stop coming to work!

446
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,564
Where is Situ Feng?

447
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,755
I can't reach him at all.

448
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,325
Are you Lin Yiyang?

449
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:05,215
Who the hell are you?

450
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,125
Ye Bei, what's wrong?

451
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:10,125
Cheers!

452
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,905
<i>Let's drink to our heart's content.</i>

453
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:17,125
-Nanxi, I--
-Right, I--

454
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:20,445
Be careful.

455
00:25:20,805 --> 00:25:22,935
I'll call a cab for you.

456
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:28,615
