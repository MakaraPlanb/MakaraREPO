EPISODE 13

2
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,235
Your phone, sir.

3
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:13,465
Hello?

4
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,744
Is that you, Qingqing?

5
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:16,585
Grandpa.

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,664
I miss you.

7
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:22,144
I thought you went away for a while
because you were upset.

8
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,445
I didn't think you'd be gone for months.

9
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,704
Qingqing, listen to me.

10
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:30,205
If you come back,

11
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:32,024
I will do anything for you.

12
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,385
Then please,

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,504
in the name of my mom,

14
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,824
tell me the truth.

15
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:44,185
Have you been lying to me
about Mom and Dad?

16
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:48,585
I had to hide some things from you

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,264
for your own good.

18
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,275
I was so--

19
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,904
What did Qingqing find out
that she'd ask something like this?

20
00:00:55,905 --> 00:01:01,824
She must have gone
to her parents' college after all.

21
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:04,264
You were alone with that witch
for so long.

22
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,664
Weren't you scared?

23
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,285
You mean, Ms. Chen?

24
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:09,465
-Ms. Chen?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,464
You're now calling her Ms. Chen
behind her back?

26
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,775
Did she plant a bug on you?

27
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:19,545
Fangfang, this time,
I really got to know Ms. Chen.

28
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,545
She's a good person.

29
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:25,195
Did she cast a spell on you?

30
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,344
Qingqing, it's my day off tomorrow.

31
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,405
Do you want to hang out?

32
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,945
No. Tomorrow, I have
a date with a mysterious person.

33
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:37,625
-A mysterious person?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,065
Is it Situ Feng?

35
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,824
The both of you were so in character
during the play.

36
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,704
The more you acted,
the more real it seemed.

37
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,864
-You kissed like real lovers--
-Knock it off, Fangfang!

38
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,945
Gosh!

39
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:52,945
I see that you're getting even more...

40
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,345
What?

41
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,305
Gossipy.

42
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:56,945
Come here.

43
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,704
I need to ask you something.

44
00:01:58,705 --> 00:01:59,545
Sit.

45
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:01,584
I want to ask you.

46
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:05,545
What's really going on between you
and Lin Yiyang?

47
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,575
Don't tell me you like him.

48
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,184
But he used to kidnap us, Fangfang.

49
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,505
No!

50
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:16,424
I just think that sometimes,
he's pretending.

51
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,105
It makes me curious.

52
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,424
Someone in this dormitory

53
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,345
has fallen in love.

54
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:24,785
Cut it out!

55
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,944
Like I said, about you and Situ Feng,

56
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:30,064
you were so into it
when you were on stage.

57
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,544
Your relationship developed so fast.

58
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,184
Cut the crap already.

59
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,144
He's just one of the good-looks club.

60
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:37,464
I look down on him, he surrenders to me.

61
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:41,544
There's already so much hatred between us.
There's no way for us to like each other.

62
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,864
That's not necessarily the case.

63
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,104
I remember an author once said,

64
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,745
"If we judge love,

65
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,064
by the majority of its results,
it resembles hatred

66
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,795
more than friendship."

67
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,224
Then the author was just fooling around.

68
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,464
But then again,
I want to ask you something.

69
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:00,025
How would I know

70
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:03,545
if I'm in love with somebody?

71
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,264
I've never talked about love,
but as they say in the books,

72
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,864
"When you can completely

73
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,144
be your own self in front of someone,

74
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:15,024
that means you're in love with him."

75
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:17,275
So what if I'm not myself,

76
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,144
but I've turned into
a completely different person?

77
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:22,264
Maybe you aren't
a completely different person,

78
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:25,175
but you've discovered your true self.

79
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,384
Fangfang, no one could've thought of that.

80
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,464
You could wipe out all the so-called
love experts on Weibo!

81
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:34,895
You're brilliant!

82
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,224
I want to ask you too.

83
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:38,984
Have you ever thought of

84
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,415
what kind of guy do you like?

85
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,545
I like...

86
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,665
By the way,

87
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:53,544
my grandma's birthday is in a few days.

88
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,624
Can you come and help me
carry the gifts tomorrow?

89
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,785
Okay.

90
00:03:56,985 --> 00:04:00,024
I've been doing the same thing every year.
Why are you even asking?

91
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,745
I asked

92
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,024
simply to remind you
that another year has passed,

93
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,184
and I still don't have a girlfriend.

94
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,784
You're a good guy.
There will be someone for you.

95
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,105
Don't give up.

96
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:14,425
I heard that the whole campus

97
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:17,904
is asking me about my sexual orientation.

98
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,425
Of course.

99
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:22,104
You're warm, you're hygienic

100
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,424
and you don't have bad habits.

101
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:28,024
No one would believe it
if you said you were straight.

102
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,944
If they doubt your sexual orientation,

103
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:32,435
who do they think you're with?

104
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:38,905
Gu Nanxi.

105
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,424
You should keep looking for a girlfriend.

106
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,904
Why are you always sticking with me?

107
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:44,345
Don't tell me...

108
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:46,304
Do you really like me?

109
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:49,304
I don't have freckles
and I don't have curly hair.

110
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:50,944
I don't go around baring my fangs

111
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:54,184
and I don't speak with a thundering voice.

112
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,785
How am I supposed

113
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,615
to attract you, Your Highness?

114
00:04:58,785 --> 00:04:59,985
Get out.

115
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,875
You can make a date with Qingchen.

116
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,064
I've tried so many times, but I couldn't.

117
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,024
So I gave up.

118
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,065
Why is that?

119
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,705
Beats me.

120
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,744
I'm so done talking to you about love.

121
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,045
I'll come with you tomorrow.

122
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:30,824
That place was really huge and lively.

123
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,664
Next thing you know, when he dropped by,

124
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,384
we have already finished our meal.

125
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,944
Your dad was left eating by himself.

126
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:36,785
Really?

127
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:37,745
Really.

128
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:39,505
Ms. Chen.

129
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,224
I really want to thank you

130
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:46,745
for being able to tell me so much
about my parents today.

131
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:50,424
Qingqing, shall we meet up again
next time?

132
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,944
Sure. You should hurry back now.

133
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,104
I'll pay the bills.

134
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,985
Okay, I've got to go.

135
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,105
Hey, Nanxi.

136
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,264
Isn't that Qingchen?

137
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,104
We just ran into her like this.

138
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,544
Come on, let's go there.

139
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:14,464
-No.
-Come on.

140
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,385
-Forget it.
-Come on.

141
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:19,785
Hey, Qingchen.

142
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:23,864
What a coincidence.

143
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,225
It sure is.

144
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,664
What brings you here?

145
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:27,795
Do you mind?

146
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:29,985
No, I don't.

147
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:32,625
Qingchen.

148
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,384
Are you busy after this?

149
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,225
Yes.

150
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:38,504
How about a little chit-chat?

151
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:41,745
It won't take up too much of your time.

152
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,525
Don't bother her.

153
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:47,184
Miss Qingchen, I'm sorry to bother you.

154
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,744
Situ Feng is going through

155
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:51,144
some sort of love-hate relationship
with a girl on campus.

156
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:55,024
So he's a little outgoing
and not quite like himself.

157
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,184
Hey, Gu Nanxi!

158
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,304
What are you talking about?

159
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,984
I want to go buy some gifts.

160
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,544
You guys should have a chat.
I've got to go.

161
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,025
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

162
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:10,225
Never mind.

163
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:11,225
Well...

164
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,264
My friend...

165
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,825
-He's a really nice guy.
-Yeah, I can tell.

166
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:16,864
They call you

167
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,065
"Your Coldhearted Highness."

168
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,065
But, you don't look as cold as they say.

169
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,384
Do you think so?

170
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,585
Yeah.

171
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,985
By the way,

172
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,665
Gu Nanxi just said

173
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:33,704
you have a love-hate relationship
with someone.

174
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,325
Who's that someone?

175
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:37,275
A crazy friend of mine.

176
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:39,385
But,

177
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:41,225
I realized that

178
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:44,304
I can be myself in front of her

179
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,824
more comfortably than before.

180
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,584
"When you can completely

181
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:50,024
be your own self in front of someone,

182
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,945
that means you're in love with him."

183
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,185
It looks like this friend of yours

184
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:00,265
is more than just a friend.

185
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:03,105
Yeah.

186
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:07,545
She is more than just a friend to me.

187
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:09,225
She's...

188
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,025
my best friend.

189
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,904
You should meet her sometime.

190
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:17,505
You've got to teach her
to be more ladylike.

191
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,065
Even so, it's nothing, really.

192
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,145
I think you should

193
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:25,864
get to know each other.

194
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:29,224
I see that your behavior
is a bit similar to hers.

195
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,665
I find that odd.

196
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:37,264
If you'll excuse me,
I have something to attend to.

197
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,935
Say goodbye to Nanxi for me. Bye.

198
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,145
Nanxi is...

199
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:51,784
That was close!

200
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:55,224
It makes me uncomfortable every time
I make up as Qingchen.

201
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:58,624
Then I met Situ Feng
and I don't know how to talk to him.

202
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:03,504
But then again, Qingchen is the real me.

203
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:07,904
Why should I be angry
when he's stepping on Qingqing?

204
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:08,824
Gosh.

205
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:14,305
Chen Qingqing,
you've got a split personality!

206
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:35,425
Hey.

207
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:39,225
Qingqing, what a coincidence.

208
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,704
What are you doing here?

209
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,495
Weren't you having coffee just now?

210
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,025
Hey, how did you know that?

211
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:52,024
Look, there's a coffee mark
at the side of your mouth.

212
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,824
Not only you can't control your limbs,

213
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,424
you can't use your brain either!

214
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,824
Tell me, what are you doing here?

215
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,104
Doing some shopping.

216
00:09:59,105 --> 00:09:59,945
And you?

217
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:04,265
I'm here to look for a part-time job.

218
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,165
Have you found one?

219
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,504
It's hard to get one here.

220
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,144
Chen Qingqing, don't you earn enough
from being my assistant?

221
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,304
Besides, if anyone catches you,
you'll embarrass me.

222
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,245
All right.

223
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,115
What a bother.

224
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,264
We can't help you get a part-time job.

225
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:20,384
But we can help you
save on your travel expenses.

226
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,425
Let's go.

227
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:30,465
-Qingqing!
-Yes?

228
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:33,384
-I heard you're from Jincheng.
-Yes.

229
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:36,264
We haven't properly
introduced you to Yuncheng.

230
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:40,155
We should come out
and enjoy ourselves more often.

231
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:44,504
Don't you know,
ever since I came to this college,

232
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,904
I kept running into sixes and sevens
without fail.

233
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:48,864
So I have no time to relax.

234
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,304
But my grandma's birthday is coming up.

235
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,485
Would you like to join me?

236
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:54,465
Yeah.

237
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,965
You've got to relax sometimes.

238
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:59,275
Can I bring Fangfang along?

239
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,305
Of course, you can.

240
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:09,584
Qingqing, do you have an evening dress?

241
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,784
Maybe I can buy you one.

242
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:12,264
Oh, no, thank you.

243
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,504
I hate that stuff.

244
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:14,635
Look at you.

245
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,304
I simply can't put up with you.

246
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,304
If I put on an evening dress,

247
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,485
you're going to freak out!

248
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,495
Step on it.

249
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,224
May you lead a life full of joy,
live long and smile always!

250
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,165
Thank you.

251
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:32,585
Sure.

252
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,225
Grandma.

253
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,904
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

254
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:44,165
Mom and I would like to wish you
to be always healthy and cheerful.

255
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,864
This piece of jade represents good luck.

256
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,864
It'd be good for you to put it on.

257
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,384
This is for you, Grandma.

258
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,944
-Good one.
-Happy birthday, Mother.

259
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:53,945
Thank you.

260
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,744
It's a jade bracelet.

261
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,904
It doesn't look that great.

262
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,905
Grandma, look at what I got you here.

263
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:03,264
A five-carat diamond necklace.

264
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,665
I wish you longevity, Grandma.

265
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:07,824
Here you go, Grandma.

266
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:08,745
Good boy.

267
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:11,264
As long as you gave them to me,

268
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,864
that would keep me happy.

269
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,465
Well, Grandma, please excuse us.

270
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:19,225
Take care.

271
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:22,585
Grandma.

272
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:27,535
I have something to attend to.
Rest well. I'll take my leave.

273
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,785
Let me get you a drink.

274
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:38,464
Every year, you've been doing nothing,
but boot-licking.

275
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,584
Don't forget who you really are.

276
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,424
You don't have the Gu family blood

277
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:43,984
and you will never have.

278
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:45,105
Gu Donglin.

279
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,445
Don't you forget,

280
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,024
Gu Nanxi is still taking care
of your gambling debt.

281
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:53,264
If it wasn't for him,
you'd be hacked to death.

282
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:58,264
Besides, you should be grateful for not
bringing your family to shame.

283
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,225
Situ Feng,

284
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,435
you shut up!

285
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,504
I didn't let you in here
to spew crap on us.

286
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:06,744
Besides, what right do you have
to meddle in our family affairs?

287
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,785
Donglin.

288
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:11,215
It's Grandma's birthday today. Cut it out.

289
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:13,265
Don't worry.

290
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:18,185
Qingqing.

291
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,064
This is my first time
to a party like this.

292
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,565
What should I do?

293
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,744
Fangfang, when the time comes,

294
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,024
you just have to follow me.

295
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,184
I've been to so many parties like this.

296
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:31,605
You won't make a mistake if you follow me.

297
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,385
Chen Qingqing.

298
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,544
What are you doing here?

299
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,965
Why are you stealing my lines?

300
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,984
What are you here for? Business?

301
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:47,735
It seems the rich kids around here
don't need any of your errands service.

302
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,045
If that's the case, you still owe me money

303
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,125
for my errands service.

304
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,424
Don't be so full of yourself.

305
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,504
Sooner or later, you're going to get it.

306
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,425
Really?

307
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,664
As a matter of fact,
every time it turns out

308
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,704
that you're the one
who always going to get it first.

309
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:07,745
Lan Xinya.

310
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:12,424
All the dirty tricks you pulled on me
only made me stronger.

311
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,265
Just think about it.

312
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:16,905
Hey.

313
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,065
You look great in that dress.

314
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:20,945
Really?

315
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:24,255
It's much better than the kid's clothes.

316
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,665
You don't say.

317
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,744
No one's elegance
reflects her inner beauty

318
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,665
more than your darling Xinya's.

319
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,865
Yeah.

320
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,055
Xinya's also pretty today.

321
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,505
Sorry, I'm late.

322
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:44,545
Lanting.

323
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:46,544
Ting, you're here.

324
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:47,425
Lanting.

325
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:49,064
I miss you so much.

326
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,385
Lanting.

327
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,024
Why are you back?

328
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,984
I thought you weren't coming back
from abroad.

329
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:57,144
Of course I should be here
for Mrs. Gu's birthday.

330
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:57,985
Lanting.

331
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,744
Let me introduce to you.

332
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,344
This is Chen Qingqing.

333
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,824
And this is Zhang Fangfang.

334
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:05,624
They are all my good friends
from Ming De College.

335
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,745
Good friends?

336
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

337
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,345
So you are Chen Qingqing?

338
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,465
Yes, I am.

339
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,965
Do you know me?

340
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:16,265
Qingqing.

341
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,384
This is Lanting.

342
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,624
She's a childhood friend of ours.

343
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,944
She's older than us by just two years,

344
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,745
but doesn't she have a great aura?

345
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:25,945
Lanting.

346
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,855
She's wearing the same clothes as you are.

347
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,224
Wearing the same clothes is nothing.

348
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,664
I just won't wear this next time.

349
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,695
But the other person should be careful.

350
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:46,865
Qingqing.

351
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:48,875
That Yang Lanting.

352
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,255
Why is she so eccentric?

353
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,605
What do you mean?

354
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,265
Who knows?

355
00:15:57,185 --> 00:15:58,264
Don't you see?

356
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:01,905
Every girl who grew up with Situ Feng

357
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,665
are all the same.

358
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:07,895
Maybe they're all infected
by that cold snap of his.

359
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:12,384
Anyway, you've got to be careful here.

360
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,624
Don't worry, Fangfang.

361
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,904
Chen Qingqing is never afraid of anybody.

362
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:18,515
The only thing I fear is myself.

363
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,225
-I've got to use the bathroom.
-Okay.

364
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,145
Lanting, your dress.

365
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,345
Chen Qingqing.

366
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,945
It's you again!

367
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,745
I get it.

368
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:50,144
It's because you're wearing
the exact same dress with Lanting!

369
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,664
You didn't look good,

370
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,384
so you spilled it on purpose.

371
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,345
I didn't.

372
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:55,665
What?

373
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,544
You're not going to admit it?

374
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,465
I told you to be careful around her.

375
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,185
What's going on?

376
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:03,265
Qingqing.

377
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,885
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

378
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,465
What's going on?

379
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,445
What happened?

380
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:11,655
Who did this?

381
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,705
She did!

382
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,865
Chen Qingqing.

383
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:19,344
Chen Qingqing,
apologize to Yang Lanting now.

384
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,264
Why should I apologize to her?

385
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,624
Did anyone see me spill juice on her?

386
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,624
It's obvious that she ran into it herself!

387
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,104
She's the one who's supposed
to apologize to me.

388
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:29,055
I didn't!

389
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,744
What an ugly attention seeker.

390
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:31,685
Lan Xinya!

391
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:37,304
How could you just bring
any ordinary person here?

392
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:40,585
Gu Donglin, you'd better watch your mouth.

393
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:42,785
Situ Feng.

394
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:47,264
Didn't I tell you not to stick your nose
into our family affairs?

395
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,384
Hey, can't you just be

396
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:50,904
-a little more reasonable?
-Shut your mouth.

397
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:53,025
-Guard!
-Young Master.

398
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,464
Who is this? Who let her in?

399
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,005
Miss, may I see your invitation?

400
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,064
You dared to come without an invitation.

401
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,864
Don't you have any shame?

402
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:06,865
Donglin.

403
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,015
Cut it out.

404
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,064
They're all my good friends.

405
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:13,744
Stop. They may be your friends,
but they're not mine.

406
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:14,745
Gu Donglin.

407
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,264
Since this is how you treat our guests,

408
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,224
we're not keeping you company anymore.

409
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,595
Sorry, Gu Nanxi.

410
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:26,304
Bring them back here!
They haven't apologized to Lanting.

411
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,185
Yes, sir.

412
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:33,304
Do you believe that
I didn't spill it on Lanting?

413
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,065
-I do.
-No way!

414
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,275
You don't believe me.

415
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:40,555
I believe you.

416
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,405
I don't have to think.

417
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:49,625
Qingqing.

418
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,105
What's the matter?

419
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:54,705
Something got into my eye.

420
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,264
Don't move. Let me see.

421
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,304
It's okay. I'll deal with it--

422
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,464
I said, don't move.

423
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:01,535
Let me see.

424
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,035
I think I see it.

425
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,125
Are you okay now?

426
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:12,425
Yes.

427
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,345
I...

428
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,715
Where did I leave Fangfang?

429
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,525
Chen Qingqing.

430
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,584
Can't you stop getting flustered
all the time?

431
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,384
Sorry, I'm always like this.

432
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:29,615
Can you lend me your phone for a minute?

433
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:31,445
Thank you.

434
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,165
Hello, Fangfang.

435
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,064
I'm so sorry.

436
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,304
I just had a situation just now.

437
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,104
So I had to run out first.

438
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,184
Can you return to the dorm yourself?

439
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,185
I know you're the best.

440
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:48,905
Wait for me there.

441
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:49,985
Bye.

442
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,704
How about you?
Are you going back to your dorm?

443
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:56,635
Where else should I go?

444
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,064
Let's go. Let me show you something.

445
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,224
Where are we going?

446
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,655
You'll see once you're there.

447
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,944
You're leaving me in suspense.

448
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:06,945
Come on!

449
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:09,875
Walk slowly. I'm wearing high heels.

450
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,624
Hey, why are you bringing me here?

451
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,984
To play basketball?

452
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,595
But you're so bad at basketball.

453
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:26,784
What are we doing here?

454
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,104
-Did you say I'm bad at basketball?
-Yeah.

455
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,544
The last time Nanxi played with me,

456
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,024
you didn't see the look on his face.

457
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,584
It was like he ate shit or something.

458
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:36,865
Because you play like shit, Situ Feng.

459
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:41,355
Do you want to bet?

460
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:42,985
As you wish.

461
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,424
Have you played basketball before?

462
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,425
No.

463
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:00,704
A girl's arms may be a little shorter.

464
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:03,875
So you've got to throw a little harder.

465
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,704
Situ Feng, I'm sorry. Is your face okay?

466
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,424
Why did you tell me to throw so hard?

467
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:16,405
My face is important to me, you know?

468
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:19,025
I'm sorry.

469
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:22,335
I said "girls."

470
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:26,345
Can't a brute like you restrain yourself
a little?

471
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,835
Watch and learn.

472
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,424
To score three points,

473
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:37,664
even when you hang in the air,

474
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:42,105
make sure your wrist angle
and your movements are perfect.

475
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:53,595
You mean, you can miss on purpose?

476
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,065
It went in!

477
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:23,304
Situ Feng, that was brilliant!
You really got it in!

478
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,224
What's the point of that?

479
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:27,264
I can only score at times like this.

480
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:31,295
I can't score like this
in front of everyone else.

481
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,824
You care so much about your image.
Why are you doing that?

482
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:40,824
You'll show everyone your true beauty
when you let go of yourself.

483
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,585
No, I won't!

484
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:46,664
They call me the Kaede Rukawa
of Ming De College.

485
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,215
Step aside, let me have a shot.

486
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:52,395
Throw it over there, a little lower.

487
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,705
One, two.

488
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,304
You could do it like that?

489
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:04,744
Are you the one-of-a-kind player
we've been looking for?

490
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:05,664
All right.

491
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:09,665
You can be our own Sakuragi Hanamichi.

492
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:13,185
I'm a genius!

493
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:16,375
Get out of my way!

494
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:23,985
Throw it!

495
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,065
One more time!

496
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:54,985
Situ Feng.

497
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,495
Are you asleep?

498
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:58,585
No.

499
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,235
Are you tired?

500
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,645
What do you mean?

501
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:08,345
I mean,

502
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:12,264
I can see that you know
how to play basketball,

503
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,584
but you're not doing it well.

504
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:18,545
When you're a star,
you have to disguise yourself.

505
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:20,584
It must have been hard.

506
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,425
Right?

507
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,735
I didn't choose to do this.

508
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,985
Because I don't want sympathy.

509
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,344
I'd rather you hate me

510
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,405
than to have pity on me.

511
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,344
And you hate me too.

512
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:38,424
We've hated each other since we first met.

513
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,865
And we still do.

514
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:47,224
Why don't we talk about what we don't like
about each other?

515
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:48,825
-Okay.
-You first.

516
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:51,424
You're too frank.

517
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:52,584
You pretend to be cool.

518
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:53,864
Your clothes are too colorful.

519
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:57,624
Your clothes are too tight
and you're not even muscular.

520
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,104
I'm not muscular?

521
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,915
Have you ever seen me

522
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:04,104
-do martial arts?
-You don't do martial arts.

523
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,795
I don't believe it.

524
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:09,985
Is this how you flirt?

525
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:11,865
It's so fake.

526
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,544
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

527
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:18,225
Can I say what I like about you?

528
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:19,944
You don't have secrets.

529
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,585
You're so lucky.

530
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,224
Look at performing artists like us.

531
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:29,115
We're bound to contracts
and hounded by paparazzi.

532
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,064
Even if you want to let go of the past,

533
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,235
they'd bring it up over and over again.

534
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:40,225
Qingqing.

535
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,064
I'm so envious of you.

536
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:46,115
How do you know I don't have secrets?

537
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:51,335
You have a big mouth.
You'd even leak secrets to the CIA.

538
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:01,745
You...

539
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:05,185
Are you saying that you like me?

540
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:07,104
Don't think too much about it.

541
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,585
Look at the context, all right?

542
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,264
What I meant by "like" is,

543
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,384
what I admire, what I appreciate

544
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:15,304
and what I envy about you.

545
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,264
You're so good at languages,

546
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:19,945
but why isn't your math as good?

547
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:22,025
You're a retard.

548
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,105
Hey. Situ Feng.

549
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,505
Did you hear that?

550
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:47,424
It must be a mouse.

551
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:48,265
What?

552
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:50,225
A mouse?

553
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,504
Situ Feng, you've got to protect me!

554
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:54,425
But how?

555
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:58,784
Why do I always end up like this
every time I'm with you?

556
00:26:58,785 --> 00:26:59,704
I hate this!

557
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,264
There's a mouse around here.

558
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,825
You hate it? Let's go find it.

559
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:07,585
Situ Feng, put me down!

560
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:08,545
Look.

561
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,065
Hurry, look.

562
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,195
It's not a mouse.

563
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,185
It's a kitten.

564
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,825
I like cats so much!

565
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:40,235
Why do you like cats?

566
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:44,875
Don't you have the ability
to think logically?

567
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,625
I hate mice.

568
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:48,195
Cats catch mice.

569
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:49,985
So I like cats.

570
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:51,505
Right?

571
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,345
Little kitty.

572
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:55,944
I want to take you home and keep you.

573
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,145
Okay?

574
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:01,184
Don't you want to give it a name?

575
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:02,425
A name?

576
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:03,625
Okay.

577
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:05,305
How about

578
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,895
I call you Kitty Chen?

579
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,665
-You like it?
-Hey.

580
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:12,024
Why is it a Chen, not a Situ like me?

581
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,464
Can't you see my surname
is much more epic?

582
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:16,465
Epic?

583
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:18,165
Are you kidding me?

584
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,865
We found this kitten together.

585
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:22,864
We're the mom and dad.

586
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,744
I'm the dad. You're the mom.

587
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,264
Of course it'll take my surname.

588
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:28,195
Am I right, Kitty Chen?

589
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:29,775
That's right.

590
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:31,664
-Hey.
-Yes?

591
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:33,415
Why are you the dad?

592
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:35,985
Because I'm domineering.

593
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,464
Enough about that.

594
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,664
We should at least give it a nickname.

595
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,035
That would be...

596
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,345
Situ's Stupid Dog!

597
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:47,185
Hey.

598
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:05,525
Chen Qingqing, what are you drawing?

599
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,064
-Ming De's Yearly Miss Campus--
-Excuse me!

600
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:09,424
Why are you here?

601
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,864
I'm here to join the Miss Campus contest.

602
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:17,085
Our Student Council Secretariat
received a letter of complaint earlier.

603
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,224
You're doing this on purpose!

604
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:23,704
I have something important to ask you.

605
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:27,304
May I ask what motivated you
to stand on this stage?

606
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:30,184
Based on your understanding,
what defines beauty?

607
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,085
The winner
of Ming De College's Miss Campus is...

608
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:37,615
