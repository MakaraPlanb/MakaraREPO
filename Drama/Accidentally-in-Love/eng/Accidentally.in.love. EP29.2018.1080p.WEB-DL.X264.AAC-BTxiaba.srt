EPISODE 29

2
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:48,745
Chen Qingqing.

3
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,185
You have been too arrogant lately.

4
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,264
What do you expect me to do?

5
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,384
Return to your normal self.

6
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,545
Lay low in the college for three months.

7
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,695
Three months after three months.

8
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,864
Then three months after three months.

9
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:09,415
It has been almost a year, sir.

10
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:13,925
Now, all I want

11
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,285
is to be beautiful.

12
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,584
You were already beautiful.

13
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,425
Gosh.

14
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:31,825
But this is how I really look.

15
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:36,035
Are you jealous?

16
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:39,065
I'm jealous? Are you kidding?

17
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,585
Me? Jealous?

18
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:44,664
I've seen countless beautiful girls.
Way more than you've seen.

19
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,555
Plus, who dares to even think
about my girlfriend?

20
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,345
You are jealous.

21
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,265
-You are.
-I'm not.

22
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:56,904
-You are.
-I'm not.

23
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,464
-I'm not jealous.
-Look at you!

24
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:01,245
You're obviously jealous, Situ Feng.

25
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:04,424
All right then.

26
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:07,505
I'll change my appearance

27
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,864
according to what you like, okay?

28
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:10,995
You said it.

29
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,015
Hey, why won't you help me?

30
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,944
Hua Munian, are you leaving for good?

31
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,184
Baby, we finally got our leave of absence
approved for this trip.

32
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,784
Of course I'd have to bring
every important thing with me.

33
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:50,384
There are clothes, shoes
enough for us to change outfits every day.

34
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,584
And you won't have to worry.

35
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,624
I've blocked
all our mutual friends online.

36
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,904
No one would know about this.

37
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,664
You're the only person who can see it.

38
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:57,864
Why don't you block me too?

39
00:03:57,865 --> 00:03:58,705
Why?

40
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,224
Because I've already blocked you.

41
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,824
I don't want to see
your online feeds anyway.

42
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,584
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

43
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,224
Can't you be concern about your friend?

44
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,144
Even if you don't think of me
as your friend,

45
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,464
I'm still your college mate.

46
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,784
Can't you show a little concern?

47
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:16,545
All you think about all day is Situ Feng.
You can end up crazy, you know?

48
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:20,605
I'm sorry, Xinya.

49
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:22,555
I didn't mean that.

50
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,865
You're right.

51
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:26,735
During this period,

52
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,465
I did too many stupid things.

53
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,424
For someone who doesn't even love me,

54
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,145
I've forgotten what really matters.

55
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:41,185
Just like how he has always been around,

56
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,785
but I have been oblivious
about his presence.

57
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,344
It's time for me to keep him company now.

58
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,835
Actually, it's not a big deal.

59
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,824
He's not really a dog.

60
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,824
You don't have to keep him company.

61
00:04:55,825 --> 00:05:00,155
Hua Munian, don't tell me
you've forgotten about Teddy?

62
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:09,665
What I meant was

63
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:13,345
he behaves like a person.

64
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,944
He knows when you're feeling down,
so he will keep you company.

65
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,805
You don't have to keep him company.

66
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,035
What a load of rubbish.

67
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,465
There you go, Teddy.

68
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,775
We should go.

69
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:01,375
They must think that I look terrible.

70
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:04,464
They probably think I'm not good
enough for you and giving me funny looks.

71
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,224
This won't do, I need to go back.

72
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:09,195
Don't. They probably like your outfit.

73
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:10,505
Come here.

74
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,224
Tell me. Why did you look at me like that?

75
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,104
I was just very impressed
of your appearance.

76
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,704
You must've been exceptionally talented

77
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,504
to be able to date
such a good looking fellow.

78
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,465
You...

79
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,905
What's so funny?

80
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,185
I hate it.

81
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,184
I barely had the chance
to look pretty for the past few days.

82
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,624
Now, I'm back to square one and have
to put up with people's judgments.

83
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,425
Okay, what do you want to do then?

84
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:01,565
Situ Feng, can you stop being so nervous?

85
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,144
I'm an idol, okay?

86
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,435
What if people recognized me?

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,184
Oh, please, stop finding excuses
for yourself.

88
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:10,025
Look around you.

89
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,855
Who's staring at us?

90
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:16,185
See, no one cares.

91
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:19,904
-But why?
-Because you're in disguise now.

92
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,944
You look just like
any other ordinary person.

93
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,544
Nobody is going to notice
that you're Situ Feng.

94
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,395
You can drop your idol identity now.

95
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:31,105
Look, hey!

96
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,665
Nobody cares at all.

97
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:36,945
See?

98
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:37,905
It' true!

99
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,464
Doesn't this feel absolutely amazing?

100
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:40,904
Why don't we dance?

101
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:41,745
Sure.

102
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,785
One, two, three, go.

103
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:05,095
I feel like I could dance. Let's go.

104
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,315
Number seven and eight. Here.

105
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:22,715
It's starting.

106
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,825
Are these people crazy?

107
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:57,095
This is not the right movie to be kissing.

108
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,745
I agree.

109
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,515
I wonder how can they do it?

110
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,585
If any of the horror scenes

111
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,344
give you the creeps later on,

112
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,505
you can come to me.

113
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,205
I will protect you.

114
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:41,845
Stop looking at us.
Sorry, please ignore us.

115
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:51,215
The movie was all right.

116
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:53,755
You were the real horror.

117
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,704
I'm so sorry about it.

118
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:58,735
But that horror movie was really scary.

119
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,825
All right, come over here.

120
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,024
-Do I look good?
-Yes.

121
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,005
-Am I perfect?
-Perfect.

122
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,384
Hey, Qingqing.

123
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,144
What should we do later?

124
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,224
Whatever you want is fine.

125
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,664
What do you want to do?

126
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,504
What do I want to do?

127
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:21,664
How about the claw machine?

128
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:23,104
-All right.
-Let's go play.

129
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:23,945
Okay.

130
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,965
It's Spongebob Squarepants.

131
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:32,304
Move to the back a little.

132
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:33,245
Like this?

133
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,305
Shift to the side a little.

134
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,744
-I'm going to get it this time.
-Okay.

135
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,735
-Okay.
-Let me get you.

136
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,225
-Now.
-Now.

137
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,265
Okay.

138
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,845
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

139
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,085
Qingqing, cover for me.

140
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,305
Why?

141
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,515
You'll find out soon.

142
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:15,145
Hey, Situ Feng!

143
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,225
Situ Feng!

144
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:18,904
There are people around.

145
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:20,105
I've got it.

146
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:22,824
Look what I've got.

147
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:23,865
Situ Feng.

148
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:27,445
You're so rowdy, but cute.

149
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:31,515
But I wanted Spongebob Squarepants.

150
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,785
Psyduck is ugly and looks a lot like you.

151
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:44,065
But now you are just like me.

152
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,624
-Someone's here.
-Someone's here.

153
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,635
Let's run.

154
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,984
-That one looks more interesting.
-I want this.

155
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:56,995
Let's see.

156
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:01,255
-This cap--
-No, you should wear it.

157
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,464
It looks good on you.

158
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:03,984
The pink one is not bad too.

159
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,624
I don't feel like wearing a cap.

160
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,944
Then I'm not wearing one too.

161
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:08,984
Is it nice?

162
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:09,984
It's awful.

163
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:11,464
Let me pick one for you.

164
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,335
Here, let me help you.

165
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,965
Do I look good?

166
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:20,464
Then it must have been the opposite!
I'm not wearing it.

167
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,944
-But--
-We're not taking it, thanks!

168
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,465
Let's go.

169
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:33,645
-Do you want some sweets?
-They look good.

170
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:34,944
Go on, have your pick.

171
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,384
I like this one. Kiwi.

172
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,875
-Okay.
-This one.

173
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,504
You have one too.

174
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:41,384
I'll have this, thanks.

175
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,445
Candied haw.

176
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,025
Lovely flowers.

177
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:48,545
What?

178
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,815
It's leaking.

179
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,185
Is it nice?

180
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:58,705
I look awful!

181
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:00,224
Why does my face look so bloated?

182
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,504
Give it to me, I'll delete it.

183
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,425
-Give it to me!
-No!

184
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:04,345
Rascal!

185
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,744
Come and get it.

186
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,065
Give it to me!

187
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,704
I can't feel my face anymore.

188
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,424
Me too. I can't wait for this to end.

189
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,365
Thank you.

190
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:31,225
I have done what you ordered,
Young Master.

191
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,104
This is smart of you.

192
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,064
This couple would not be able
to handle all the negative comments.

193
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:37,905
Damn it!

194
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,344
Do not refer to them
as a couple in front of me.

195
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:42,704
Of course, Young Master.

196
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:46,704
-That bastard and that bitch--
-What's your problem?

197
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,864
Why are you calling Qingqing a bitch?

198
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:52,505
-Then, bastard and that girl.
-Shut your mouth!

199
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:59,264
But netizens will talk
about Chen Qingqing too.

200
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,464
Young Master, do you--

201
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,704
I'm trying to drive a wedge between them.

202
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,265
Just wait and see.

203
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:10,425
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

204
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:14,105
You're so comfortable like a lazy couch.

205
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,625
Of course.

206
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,024
What are you doing?

207
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,264
Open your mouth, take a bite.

208
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:29,824
My agency forbids me to eat chocolate.

209
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,825
No, you have to eat it.

210
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,435
You have to eat more.

211
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:39,145
This way, it'll fill up your bony edges.

212
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,615
You're too skinny now.

213
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,584
I have to fatten you up.

214
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:48,155
Then it'll become even
more comfortable to cuddle with you.

215
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,555
Open your mouth.

216
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,065
Situ Feng.

217
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:04,464
So this is where you
and Gu Nanxi's secret base is?

218
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,465
This is a first for me.

219
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,424
What are you talking about?
This is my secret base.

220
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,904
He only comes here to hang out
with me once in a while.

221
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:15,745
Did Gu Nanxi and you

222
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,944
watch the stars and hugged like this too?

223
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,504
What nonsense are you talking about?

224
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:25,385
Why would two straight guys
hug each other and watch the stars?

225
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,855
I wonder where is Gu Nanxi now?

226
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,305
Him?

227
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,965
He went to run some errands.

228
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:41,625
Situ Feng.

229
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,665
Situ Feng.

230
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:48,095
You owe me a girlfriend in my next life.

231
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:52,185
Wait, next life?

232
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:55,345
Why should I wait until the next life?

233
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:59,705
Gu Nanxi, I pity you.

234
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,904
I don't think you'll ever meet a girl

235
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:08,095
who looks like she came out
from a romantic music video ever again.

236
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,425
Then, what if he's on the way back now?

237
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:28,665
If he sees us hugging together like this,
it'd be so awkward.

238
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,225
Gosh. He won't.

239
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,304
He has too many errands to run.

240
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:36,525
It'll probably take him the entire night.

241
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,705
Your phone.

242
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,544
<i>-Hello?
-Situ Feng.</i>

243
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,744
<i>-Yes.
-About your relationship,</i>

244
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,744
<i>I don't think you should be
totally open about it.</i>

245
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,665
<i>Your haters are growing.</i>

246
00:16:57,745 --> 00:16:58,745
Haters?

247
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,104
<i>-What haters?
-Chen Qingqing's haters.</i>

248
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,344
<i>Check your Weibo.</i>

249
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,285
All right.

250
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,424
What is it about?

251
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,215
Daniel asked me to check out Weibo.

252
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:23,305
<i>"New love interest, Chen Qingqing</i>

253
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,545
<i>used her beauty to woo Situ Feng"?</i>

254
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,855
What is this?

255
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,944
Situ Feng was the one
who confessed to me first.

256
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:36,465
Well, this is a good point
worth considering.

257
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:38,704
Of course, what I'm saying is,

258
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:41,144
we shouldn't care about it too much.

259
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,464
As a public figure,
this is an idol's life.

260
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,215
Easy for you to say!

261
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,965
They are not blabbering about you.

262
00:17:55,945 --> 00:18:00,665
Chen Qingqing is both pretty and talented.

263
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,065
There's no reason for her

264
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,145
to rely on Situ Feng

265
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,145
like that.

266
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,335
HATER: LIES! PROOF?

267
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,864
You want proof? I will show you proof!

268
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,355
How are you going to prove it?

269
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:23,955
I'm going to show the world,

270
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:26,344
in the realm of Chen Qingqing,

271
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:28,065
I am a queen.

272
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,905
Your realm?

273
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,585
I, Chen Qingqing

274
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:42,665
am a heaven-born genius.

275
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:45,865
There's nothing I can't do.

276
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,585
Plus, I'm also an expert

277
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,065
in Taekwondo.

278
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:03,255
Good morning, everyone.

279
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,544
I'm your Taekwondo instructor.

280
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,024
My name is Chen Qingqing.

281
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:11,185
Now, I'll briefly explain to you
what is Taekwondo.

282
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:16,065
Taekwondo is not just training
in physical self-defense,

283
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:17,824
but also a training of your mind.

284
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,584
It's an all-rounded mental
and physical exercise.

285
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:24,785
Every movement in Taekwondo
is based on self-defense.

286
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:28,385
To defend is to handle
an attack harmlessly

287
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:32,085
and to be always conscious
about your situation.

288
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,595
Do you understand?

289
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:04,785
I'm never going to have a child with you.

290
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:11,384
I did not say I wanted
to have a child with you.

291
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,465
Hey, wait for me.

292
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,745
Hello, everyone.

293
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,704
I'm your new assistant instructor.

294
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:29,064
The reason I am here today
is because I'd like to convey

295
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,984
my appreciation for ballet.

296
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:35,025
Miss, I think you look pretty.

297
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:37,435
You shouldn't...

298
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,264
Excuse me, little guy.

299
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:43,024
Is she your girlfriend?

300
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,805
If she isn't, please do not
disrupt our lesson.

301
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,385
I told you.

302
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:07,405
You shouldn't have.

303
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:18,025
It sucks to have to prove myself.

304
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,104
Maybe I should return
to my family's business.

305
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:27,995
Given my capabilities,
it won't be an issue for me to succeed.

306
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:31,064
It hurts so much.
Can you not hit me so hard?

307
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,225
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:36,304
But didn't you say
that you're not interested in that?

309
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,045
So what if I'm interested or not?

310
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,355
Do you know?

311
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,065
People like you

312
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:46,185
who can live your dreams

313
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:48,585
are one in a million, okay?

314
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,944
You saw what happened earlier.

315
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:52,585
Those dreams of mine...

316
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,545
They are not going to work for me.

317
00:21:57,745 --> 00:22:02,265
Do you think I should
just give up my dreams

318
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:05,745
and take over
my family's business instead?

319
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,345
I feel that we can still think about it.

320
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,895
We're still young, aren't we?

321
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:18,785
Welcome.

322
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:20,985
Lin Yiyang?

323
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:22,464
Why are you here?

324
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:26,024
You don't have to work
in this cafe anymore.

325
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,775
I've bought it as a gift to you.

326
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,344
What the hell do you think you're doing?

327
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:35,304
We're dating.

328
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:37,864
<i>We're not starring in the drama
The President's Lovely Wife.</i>

329
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:42,255
Kidnapping me, buying me a cafe,
what is wrong with you?

330
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,905
It was a joke.

331
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,465
I didn't buy this cafe.

332
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:54,984
Well, you see,

333
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:57,784
I was just trying to rehearse a scene
for our stage play here with you.

334
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,344
I'll contact you after work.

335
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,865
You should leave.

336
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,305
I'm not leaving.

337
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,595
I'm here for work as well.

338
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:21,544
Sir, give us a price.

339
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:22,785
Our boss said

340
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:26,455
he will pay you
twice of the proposed amount.

341
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,905
ABOLISH PLAN

342
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:36,645
Our boss just said that
you'll be dead if you don't obey.

343
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,664
QING QING, FANG FANG

344
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:42,845
Chen Qingqing.

345
00:23:43,145 --> 00:23:45,505
Chen Qingqing, I'm coming in.

346
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,325
Chen Qingqing, wake up.

347
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,445
Chen Qingqing, wake up.

348
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,805
Chen Qingqing.

349
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:03,904
Chen Qingqing.

350
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:05,065
Situ Feng.

351
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,384
Why are in you
in our female dormitory again?

352
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,464
Why didn't the warden stop you?

353
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,344
I didn't cross-dress today.

354
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:13,264
I climbed from the other side.

355
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:14,464
But what's important is that

356
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,704
I think I've figured out
what you should do.

357
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,304
This could be your new life goals.

358
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:19,585
Hey, man.

359
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:22,064
Do you know it's still bedtime for me?

360
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:23,944
If you really want
to talk about life goals,

361
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,865
can you please wait until I'm awake?

362
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:28,405
My princess,

363
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,945
it's already noon.

364
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,265
Do you still want to sleep?

365
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,715
I'm serious, Situ Feng.

366
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:42,225
If I let my crazy self out,
it'd be too late.

367
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:46,105
Do not disturb my sleep.

368
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:49,825
Nevermind.

369
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,264
It's not a big deal anyway.

370
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:55,224
It's just something related to your dad.

371
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:56,355
I'm leaving.

372
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:58,745
What?

373
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:08,184
<i>The headquarters have decided</i>

374
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:10,424
to transfer you to the office in Japan.

375
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,625
Japan?

376
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:14,304
<i>The representative from America
really liked your album.</i>

377
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,344
-They've decided to offer you a contract.
-Really?

378
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:19,424
You haven't told her yet?

379
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:21,224
When were you going to tell me?

380
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:25,464
<i>When you've got your visa
or after you've gone to America?</i>

381
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:26,985
Perhaps

382
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:29,805
<i>I'm just a passerby in your life.</i>

383
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,595
Let's say goodbye here.

384
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,625
Goodbye.

385
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,235
