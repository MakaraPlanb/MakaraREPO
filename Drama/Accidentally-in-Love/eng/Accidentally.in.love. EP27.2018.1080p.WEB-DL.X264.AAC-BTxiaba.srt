EPISODE 27

2
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,565
Hello, dear audience.

3
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,764
Welcome to Situ Feng's
global press conference

4
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,564
for his upcoming new album.

5
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:42,684
Let's now give a warm welcome
to His Highness.

6
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,765
Welcome.

7
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:50,565
-His Highness.
-His Highness.

8
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,204
<i>-His Highness.
-His Highness.</i>

9
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:55,564
<i>SITU FENG'S 2018 NEW ALBUM
BREAK THROUGH PRESS CONFERENCE</i>

10
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,484
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

11
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,364
<i>All right. Situ Feng is here today</i>

12
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:00,964
to give us the details

13
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,204
of his newest album Break Through.

14
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,244
<i>I would like to ask Your Highness.</i>

15
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,644
What kind of journey did you go through

16
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,185
during the making of this album?

17
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:12,645
All right.

18
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:16,284
<i>The name of the album is Break Through.</i>

19
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:19,324
<i>As its name implies, Break Through means
to overcome an obstacle.</i>

20
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,124
When I was producing this album,

21
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,684
I wanted to make a breakthrough

22
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,695
in both the genres and interpretations
of the songs.

23
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,244
When I was writing the songs...

24
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:32,885
Why does His Highness
look so haggard today?

25
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,044
I thought so too.

26
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,684
-I think he's wearing a lot of makeup.
-I also continued to...

27
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:39,084
His voice is also a bit hoarse.

28
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,364
He's perhaps exhausted
from promoting his new album.

29
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,884
Making music is hard work nowadays.

30
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:48,684
-I hope that he'd be all right.
-There are also elements in the palace.

31
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:51,764
As we all know, the cover of this album

32
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,484
is a collaboration between Situ Feng

33
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:59,084
<i>and his number one fan, Chen Qingqing,
who's also known as Hebiancao.</i>

34
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:01,565
The design of the cover

35
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,165
the lyrics page

36
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,885
and also this handshake voucher

37
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:08,565
are all very original and unique.

38
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,444
That's right.

39
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:16,125
We've made a bold attempt on this album.

40
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:20,605
Every album comes
with an exclusive handshake voucher.

41
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:23,284
With this voucher, you'll be able
to attend my meet-and-greet

42
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,924
and shake my hand for five seconds.

43
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:28,524
Not only does it sound
like a great deal to me,

44
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,445
but at the same time,

45
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,404
it's also quite an original idea.

46
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:33,924
<i>I would like to ask Your Highness.</i>

47
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:39,645
<i>What was it like collaborating
with Chen Qingqing?</i>

48
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,085
I...

49
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,525
Chen Qingqing and I...

50
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:52,524
-Come here.
-Xinya...

51
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,484
<i>I'll get going now.</i>

52
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,735
You can't do this to them.

53
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,724
-Be my girlfriend.
-Take care of me forever.

54
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,345
-I'll miss you.
-I'm so happy.

55
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,924
EXCLUSIVE HANDSHAKE WITH HIS HIGHNESS

56
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,004
What's going on?

57
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,084
His Highness looks strange.

58
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,884
Holy Mary Mother of God,
please protect His Highness.

59
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:15,165
<i>SITU FENG'S 2018 NEW ALBUM
BREAK THROUGH PRESS CONFERENCE</i>

60
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:22,055
I had a great time...

61
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,724
working with her.

62
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,244
<i>All right, everyone.</i>

63
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,724
<i>This is the end
of today's press conference.</i>

64
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,004
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

65
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,484
<i>And please show your support</i>

66
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,044
<i>for Situ Feng's newest album.</i>

67
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,555
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

68
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,604
Ms. Lan, which gown do you like?

69
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,845
I like a couple of them.

70
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:51,085
But I feel that they all lack something.

71
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:54,025
I will try this one and that one.

72
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:56,364
And that one. Please help me to try it on.

73
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,805
Sure, right away.

74
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:05,604
Lanting, why don't I postpone
the wedding for a few days?

75
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,124
So I'll have time to design my gown.

76
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,124
Silly. Don't you understand?

77
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,644
Chen Qingqing will be back
after Situ Feng finishes his work.

78
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,635
Will he choose you then?

79
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:16,645
It will be hard to say.

80
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:20,284
You should tie the knot
as soon as possible.

81
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:21,444
Pick your wedding gown.

82
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,684
You'll hold an engagement ceremony
in a few days.

83
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,365
Once you're engaged,

84
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,604
no matter what Chen Qingqing does,

85
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:31,444
Situ Feng won't be able to back out.

86
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:35,405
By that time,
Situ Feng will be yours forever.

87
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,524
Baby, what are you doing here?

88
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,525
Hua Munian?

89
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,604
Why are you here?

90
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:46,804
I'm here to ask some brands
for sponsorships.

91
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,364
We're destined to meet.

92
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:51,884
-That's right.
-It seems that you're in a good mood.

93
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,844
Why are you checking out wedding gowns?

94
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:55,165
I'm going to--

95
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,325
I'm in a good mood.

96
00:05:58,365 --> 00:05:59,604
I can shop whatever I want.

97
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,725
I'll leave you two alone.

98
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:07,004
You're doing the right thing.

99
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,625
Take the long view.

100
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:12,975
Don't give up on everything else
for one Situ Feng.

101
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,324
Don't do anything silly again.

102
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,244
Let's go.

103
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,724
I'm also in a good mood.
Let's shop together. It's my treat.

104
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,445
I'm busy now.

105
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:22,395
I can't accompany you.

106
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:23,644
Why are you busy?

107
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,165
Why do I need to tell you?

108
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,565
Tell me.

109
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:31,084
Miss, the gowns
that you've chosen are ready now.

110
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,084
You can try them on anytime you want.

111
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,165
Is he your fiancé?

112
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,684
You two look great together.

113
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:37,935
Of course not.

114
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,645
Fiancé?

115
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:41,884
What's going on?

116
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,485
I'll tell you.

117
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,324
Feng and I are going to get engaged.

118
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,924
We'll be holding
the engagement ceremony in a few days.

119
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,855
Since you've found out,

120
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,315
you're invited.

121
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,044
ENGAGEMENT PARTY: SITU FENG, LAN XINYA

122
00:06:59,045 --> 00:06:59,885
What?

123
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,524
Isn't Chen Qingqing
the one who Situ Feng likes?

124
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,244
It was just a fling.

125
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,804
He has agreed to marry me.

126
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,284
This proves that he's been in love
with me all along.

127
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,395
Lan Xinya, are you insane?

128
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:14,364
I want to go home now.

129
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,405
Lanting, let's go.

130
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,405
Please stop provoking her, all right?

131
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:44,444
Hello, Qingqing.

132
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,644
Hello, Gu Nanxi.

133
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,844
<i>Do you know where Situ Feng is?</i>

134
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,684
I called him several times.
But he didn't pick up my calls.

135
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:52,645
He...

136
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,585
I'm not sure.

137
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,764
<i>He probably didn't bring
his phone with him.</i>

138
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,135
Can you look for him for me?

139
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,804
<i>I'm worried about him.</i>

140
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:02,935
Don't worry.

141
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,364
I will go look for him now.

142
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,205
Thank you.

143
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:31,405
Feng.

144
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,324
You look so handsome.

145
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,524
Don't you think
that we look great together

146
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,044
when we stand side by side?

147
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:39,364
You two have great taste.

148
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:42,044
This wedding gown suits you well.
You two are perfect for each other.

149
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,005
Of course.

150
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,365
But I prefer the other one.

151
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,135
Feng, give me a second.

152
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:54,035
-I'll go and try that one again.
-Okay.

153
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:00,125
<i>-Hello?
-Hello?</i>

154
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,204
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

155
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:05,505
You don't have to apologize.

156
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:09,204
<i>I overreacted last time.</i>

157
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:12,305
I should be the one apologizing to you.

158
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,164
<i>No.</i>

159
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,595
I've already made up my mind.

160
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:20,164
<i>And this decision</i>

161
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:21,805
might hurt you.

162
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,455
That's why I said

163
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,924
<i>sorry.</i>

164
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,155
What decision have you made?

165
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,085
I...

166
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:39,085
I can't put Xinya in danger again.

167
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:43,804
<i>We're going to get engaged.</i>

168
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:44,965
It's over...

169
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:51,165
Between us.

170
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:59,884
<i>-Situ Feng.
-I'm sorry.</i>

171
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:00,895
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,495
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,165
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,825
Stop apologizing to me.

175
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,764
<i>If you keep apologizing,</i>

176
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,665
<i>it means...</i>

177
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:23,205
<i>It means that you're not mature enough.</i>

178
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,675
You've made your decision,

179
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:29,845
so...

180
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,275
So you should be responsible

181
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,455
for the one you love.

182
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,125
Qingqing.

183
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,145
I don't know what to say anymore.

184
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,205
Just say goodbye then.

185
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,324
<i>Usually,</i>

186
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,124
<i>that's how people end a phone call.</i>

187
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,975
<i>Isn't it?</i>

188
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,685
Goodbye.

189
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:09,725
Goodbye.

190
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:28,035
Xinya, I'm here. Where are you?

191
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,055
See you later.

192
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,845
Feng, are you all right?

193
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,564
You should get some rest.

194
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:56,124
Otherwise, you won't look great
on the day of the ceremony.

195
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,745
Nanxi, you're here.

196
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:00,565
Xinya.

197
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:04,364
I need to go back to school
to get something.

198
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,115
I'll wear this suit.

199
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:08,764
I'll ask the driver to take you home.

200
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,645
Okay.

201
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,775
Nanxi, why don't you
accompany Feng to school?

202
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,405
Sure.

203
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,705
That's not necessary.

204
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,324
Excuse me, please help me.

205
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,255
Let me use you. Thanks.

206
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,204
The young master went that way!

207
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,735
<i>I need to use you!</i>

208
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:05,085
Do you know that it was my...

209
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,404
Hey, why are you bringing me here?

210
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,955
To play basketball?

211
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,764
You could do it like that?

212
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:34,395
Get out of my way!

213
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,245
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

214
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:02,924
Can I say what I like about you?

215
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,855
You don't have secrets.

216
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:06,125
You...

217
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:11,595
<i>Are you saying that you like me?</i>

218
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:15,405
-Situ Feng, put me down!
-Look.

219
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,244
<i>We found this kitten together.</i>

220
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,325
We're the mom and dad.

221
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:22,844
I'm the dad. You're the mom.

222
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,764
Of course it'll take my surname.

223
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,484
<i>Am I right, Kitty Chen?</i>

224
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,964
<i>That's right.</i>

225
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:30,044
<i>-Hey.
-Yes?</i>

226
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,964
<i>Why are you the dad?</i>

227
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,785
<i>Because I'm domineering.</i>

228
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:50,235
I can't believe such a place
exists in our school.

229
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:57,884
Is it for me?

230
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:58,885
Yes.

231
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:01,565
Thank you.

232
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,164
What is it called?

233
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,804
Its name is the same as yours.

234
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,545
It's called Qingqing.

235
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,935
It's called Qingqing too?

236
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,685
Grandpa, why did you come downstairs?

237
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,045
Qingqing.

238
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:54,804
This is the first time I'm feeling scared.

239
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,685
Grandpa.

240
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:57,615
Don't worry.

241
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:03,995
I've already decided
to stay and manage our family business.

242
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:06,985
This is not what I'm afraid of.

243
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:10,405
I tried to raise you

244
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,425
to be a replica of me.

245
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,265
But you ran away.

246
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:17,835
You started to live independently.

247
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,045
You've lived your own life.

248
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,865
I've finally realized

249
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,345
that I was wrong.

250
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:30,645
I shouldn't have imposed

251
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,365
my dreams on you.

252
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:35,945
But Grandpa,

253
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,345
right now,

254
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,655
I don't have a good excuse

255
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,125
to run away again.

256
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,215
A good excuse?

257
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,495
It's probably the most boring excuse

258
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:53,595
that people use when making a decision.

259
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,765
After all these years,

260
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:02,855
if I could go back in time
and deal with your mom again,

261
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,315
guess what I would do?

262
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,125
I think

263
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:10,924
that you would try everything you could

264
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,975
to stop her from leaving.

265
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:14,565
That way,

266
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:18,444
Mom would have avoided the accident.

267
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,525
No.

268
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,245
I would encourage her,

269
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:23,605
trust her

270
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:27,175
and be proud of her

271
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,235
for being courageous.

272
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:38,965
God

273
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,405
has finally given me

274
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,765
a second chance.

275
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,205
Hey, breaking news!

276
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,445
Look, she's asking all the fans

277
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,925
to do this.

278
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,605
What? This is insane.

279
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:11,045
That's impossible.

280
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:15,244
If we join hands,
there's nothing impossible in the world.

281
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:17,404
Although we only have three days,

282
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:20,004
we must not fail this mission.
We shall only succeed.

283
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,324
-Roger that.
-That's right.

284
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,804
There's no way I'm going to miss out

285
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,484
on such an important moment.

286
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:26,964
His Highness' business is my business.

287
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,645
Use my credit cards.

288
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,595
Let's get to work.

289
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:42,445
Miss.

290
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,565
You've maxed out all your cards.

291
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,285
No way.

292
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:51,815
Are you sure that there's nothing wrong
with your laptop?

293
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,485
Come on.

294
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:57,825
How could this happen
at this life or death moment?

295
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,684
I need to think of another way.

296
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,805
How can I get more money?

297
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,885
Miss, didn't you mention something

298
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,805
about borrowing money from some card?

299
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,684
That's right. Gosh.

300
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,564
How could I forget about it?

301
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:16,165
I can use the 9Fbank application.

302
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,884
I've just wired 150,000 yuan. Try again.

303
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,745
-Hurry up.
-Over here.

304
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:25,635
It's working.

305
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,375
We're gathered here today

306
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:21,524
in the sight of God

307
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,644
to witness the engagement of Mr. Situ Feng

308
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,164
and Miss Lan Xinya.

309
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:28,044
Do you, Miss Lan Xinya, take this man,

310
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:30,775
Mr. Situ Feng, to be your fiancé?

311
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:33,605
I do.

312
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,364
Do you, Mr. Situ Feng, take this woman,

313
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:39,215
Miss Lan Xinya, to be your fiancée?

314
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,685
Mr. Situ Feng, do you?

315
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,565
I...

316
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,405
I object!

317
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:58,945
Chen Qingqing?

318
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:01,175
What is she doing here?

319
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:11,065
Chen Qingqing.

320
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,644
How dare you interrupt
my engagement ceremony?

321
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:15,164
Who do you think you are?

322
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:18,925
I came here today
to officially introduce myself.

323
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,465
Nice to meet you.

324
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,684
My name is Chen Qingqing.

325
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:24,845
I am

326
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:27,625
your "fiancée."

327
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,324
I'm your classmate.

328
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,945
I'm your assistant.

329
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,644
I'm the female lead in your music video.

330
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,125
I'm also your business partner.

331
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:39,425
And you...

332
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:42,605
You're mine.

333
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,235
What is he to you?

334
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,444
Why didn't you finish your sentence?

335
00:22:49,445 --> 00:22:50,444
I'm done talking.

336
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:52,125
You're a psychopath.

337
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,645
Qingqing.

338
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,805
Saying sorry to you is useless,

339
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,964
-but I--
-You don't have to say anything.

340
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,084
I didn't come here

341
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:04,765
to kidnap the groom.

342
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:07,324
There's one thing that I need to do.

343
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,245
I will leave afterwards.

344
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:15,524
This is the handshake voucher
from your new album.

345
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,485
I designed this voucher.

346
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,805
It says that

347
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:20,884
I can shake your hand for five seconds

348
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,605
with this voucher.

349
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,385
Nice to meet you,

350
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:27,425
Situ Feng.

351
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,484
Chen Qingqing, don't change the topic.

352
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:33,695
How could you take this voucher seriously?

353
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,204
Five seconds have passed.

354
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:52,324
Let go of his hand!

355
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,164
I don't only have one voucher.

356
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,764
I've got two, three

357
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,165
and many more.

358
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,845
Let him go!

359
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,365
Situ Feng.

360
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,395
You must keep your word.

361
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,105
Chen Qingqing.

362
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:43,965
I won't let go of you this time.

363
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:49,685
Xinya.

364
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:51,975
I'm sorry.

365
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,425
The person I love

366
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:56,635
is Chen Qingqing.

367
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:00,235
