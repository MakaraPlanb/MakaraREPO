EPISODE 16

2
-00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:00,965
-Qingchen.
-Yes?

3
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:04,165
I'm sorry for letting you down.

4
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:07,364
You're beautiful.

5
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:09,485
You'll find love one day.

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,075
Was what I said earlier too harsh for you?

7
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:21,125
No.

8
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:28,625
It's good that
you're able to find someone you love.

9
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:31,684
You can forget what I said earlier.

10
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:33,495
It doesn't bother me.

11
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:40,404
-Hey, Qingchen.
-Yes?

12
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,895
What do you think of Gu Nanxi?

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,735
-Actually, he really likes--
-Hey!

14
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,385
-Who's there?
-Who's there?

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,484
-Gu Nanxi?
-Gu Nanxi?

16
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,285
You're finally here.

17
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,444
I thought I'd have to spend my night here.

18
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:59,985
I just got here
and I didn't hear anything.

19
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,085
Hello, Xinya.

20
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:07,285
I've found them.

21
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:11,484
Yes, they're both all right.
You don't have to worry now.

22
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,844
When you're coming with the rescue crew,

23
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:16,444
just take the path on the right.

24
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:18,935
We'll be waiting for you here.

25
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:24,155
That's odd.

26
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,524
How did Chen Qingqing get home yesterday?

27
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,924
She said she wasn't feeling well

28
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:32,244
so she took the college bus
and came back to the campus.

29
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:35,124
That's typical of Chen Qingqing.
She always keeps things to herself.

30
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,804
She left without telling anyone
even though she was sick.

31
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:39,885
Oh, right.

32
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,604
Did she find out what happened
at the cave?

33
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:45,564
She seemed furious
whenever I mentioned Qingchen.

34
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:47,364
She's probably jealous.

35
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:50,085
Gosh, she must be imagining things.

36
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:51,515
Do you really

37
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:53,645
not have a clue?

38
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,465
I think I know.

39
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:05,495
Does Chen Qingqing like Qingchen?

40
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,765
Gosh, that's impossible!

41
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,084
Fangfang, what a coincidence.

42
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:19,665
-Are you heading to class?
-Yes, I was just from the dorm.

43
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:23,764
Where's Qingqing?

44
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,604
She's not feeling very well.

45
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,284
It might be something she ate yesterday.

46
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,764
I'm going to call in sick for her.

47
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:29,764
Is she doing okay?

48
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,324
-I should go and see her.
-Don't.

49
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,444
She asked me to tell you
not to go see her.

50
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,725
What? Why?

51
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:38,004
It's probably because
she doesn't look too good now.

52
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:40,564
You're not allowed to go
into the girls' dorm anyway.

53
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,695
That's true.

54
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,324
Feng, since Fangfang has said so,

55
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,004
let's not disturb Qingqing.

56
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,004
We should go to class now.

57
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,945
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

58
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,715
Hi, Mr. Zhou.

59
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:03,965
I'm so sorry!

60
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,525
I'm sorry!

61
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:19,244
Attention to all students, we're
conducting our health inspection tomorrow.

62
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,285
Please clean your rooms.

63
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:24,585
Do not throw your trash on the staircase.

64
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,405
Be considerate.

65
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:29,765
Excuse me.

66
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:49,124
You're so pretty.
You must have a very good taste.

67
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,085
Here.

68
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,044
Give me some suggestions.

69
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:55,085
Tell me which bag will suit me better.

70
00:04:56,445 --> 00:04:57,365
This one.

71
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,825
Young people really have good taste.

72
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,295
This bag looks really good.

73
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,124
And it's not too expensive.

74
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,005
Goodness.

75
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:11,085
Why didn't I think of it before?

76
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,285
Hey...

77
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,265
Where did she go?

78
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,284
That was quick! People these days.

79
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,705
QINGQING, FANGFANG

80
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,625
Chen Qingqing.

81
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:25,245
Situ Feng?

82
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:28,215
Why did he come here?

83
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:30,815
Why is he here at this hour?

84
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,365
Chen Qingqing.

85
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:53,625
Chen Qingqing.

86
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,315
Qingqing, are you still alive?

87
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,285
Qingqing.

88
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,405
It's me, Situ Feng.

89
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,325
Situ Feng.

90
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,284
Do you find pleasure in dressing up?

91
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,535
Are you crazy?

92
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:13,765
Yes, I'm crazy.

93
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:19,615
If I didn't dress up like this,
how am I supposed to see you?

94
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:22,805
You...

95
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,295
What happened to your forehead?

96
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:27,725
This...

97
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,444
When I was sleeping,
I accidentally bumped my head.

98
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,044
It's not a big deal.

99
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,035
Why are you so careless?

100
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:35,925
Well...

101
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,605
Why did you come to my room?

102
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,535
Excuse me, miss.

103
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:43,124
You were absent for the whole day.

104
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,425
I was worried you were dead.

105
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,545
-Stop cursing me.
-Enough.

106
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,295
Stop fooling around.

107
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,804
Fangfang said you haven't eaten anything.

108
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,735
I brought food for you.

109
00:06:58,965 --> 00:06:59,925
Look!

110
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,484
It's Boston lobster pasta.

111
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,204
How did you know it's one of my favorites?

112
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,964
Well, that's because,
on the first day of school

113
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:11,004
you specifically asked
for Boston lobster pasta for lunch.

114
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,084
It was such a random request,
how could I not remember it?

115
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,284
Hurry up, eat it while it's warm.
How does it taste?

116
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,804
-It's good?
-Is it good!

117
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,244
Where did you get it?

118
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,125
I personally made it myself.

119
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,004
I don't just cook for anyone.

120
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,995
You'd better cherish it.

121
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,405
Don't be smug.

122
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,015
Don't eat too fast.

123
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:42,925
You...

124
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,785
Why are you staring at me?

125
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:53,405
How exactly did you
hurt yourself while you were sleeping?

126
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,004
Were you sleepwalking?

127
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,055
That's not what happened.

128
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:07,684
The egg is still warm.
I can rub your forehead for you.

129
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,555
-Don't--
-Don't move.

130
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,804
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

131
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:23,965
When did you start learning how to cook?

132
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,644
When I was little.

133
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,635
I was always home alone.

134
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,095
That's when I began to cook.

135
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,155
That's good for you.

136
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,525
By the way, Qingqing--

137
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,045
Pervert!

138
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,364
-Fangfang!
-Don't you worry, Qingqing.

139
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:44,884
-I will catch him for you!
-Wait!

140
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,085
Fangfang!

141
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,164
Stop running, you pervert!

142
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:51,324
We need to catch this pervert!

143
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,015
Let's hit him hard!

144
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,585
-Stop right there!
-Catch that pervert!

145
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:09,485
Excuse me.

146
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,475
Are you all right, Qingqing?

147
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,815
I'm fine, thanks, Fangfang.

148
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,284
-Fangfang!
-Hey, Fangfang.

149
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,685
What exactly happened yesterday?

150
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:27,044
There was a pervert who dressed up
as a girl yesterday.

151
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,164
His legs were really hairy.

152
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,844
What did he look like?

153
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,204
Yes, what did he look like?

154
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,684
He was wearing a dress,
but his hair was short like a guy.

155
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:36,244
I couldn't really see his face.

156
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,204
-What a weirdo.
-Goodness.

157
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:39,644
Luckily, I went back in time.

158
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,444
He wasn't able to do anything to Qingqing.

159
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:44,805
-Great job, Fangfang.
-Great job.

160
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,525
Situ Feng.

161
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,884
Do you have any idea about the pervert
they were talking about?

162
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:51,725
Me?

163
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,165
How would I know?

164
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:57,215
I'm glad nothing happened to Qingqing.

165
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,004
That's odd.

166
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,684
Shouldn't you be worried
about Chen Qingqing?

167
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,525
I am.

168
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,204
I'm worried. I am really worried.

169
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,145
All right.

170
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,765
Hey.

171
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,785
You're finally here for class.

172
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,685
Yes.

173
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,804
Qingqing, were you all right yesterday

174
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:39,645
after being harassed by that pervert?

175
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:44,675
I'm fine.

176
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,085
That's a relief.

177
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:53,244
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

178
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,524
The lecturer is looking for you.
It looked like it was serious.

179
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,885
-Now?
-Yes.

180
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,335
Were you looking for me, Ms. Chen?

181
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:18,965
Qingqing.

182
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,324
The reason you came to this college

183
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:24,185
was because of your dad, wasn't it?

184
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:25,925
Yes.

185
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,125
Recently,

186
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,924
I've been trying to look into it as well.

187
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,035
It seems like your parents

188
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:37,605
got into an accident
while they were eloping.

189
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,105
I think...

190
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,644
INFLUENTIAL FAMILY IN JINCHENG

191
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:53,775
I think the news was going to affect
Ming De College's reputation.

192
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:57,525
Back then, the news was kept hidden.

193
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,085
But...

194
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,735
But my grandpa told me...

195
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:08,285
Qingqing.

196
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,444
Perhaps your grandpa kept this a secret

197
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,005
for your own good.

198
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,645
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

199
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,445
Hello, Qingqing.

200
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:34,845
Grandpa.

201
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:40,175
My parents passed away
in a car accident, right?

202
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:44,005
My mom didn't die of an illness.

203
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,444
My dad didn't leave to enjoy his life.

204
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,324
They were being pushed to the edge by you.

205
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:53,724
That's how they got
into an accident, am I right?

206
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,565
Qingqing.

207
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,204
I was only doing this for your own good.

208
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,765
So it was all a lie.

209
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,325
Liar!

210
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,764
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

211
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,325
I don't want to listen to you.

212
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:21,924
That is Mr. Xiao Jingnan.

213
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,524
He's an honorary alumnus of our school.

214
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,804
He used to be
the president of the School Council

215
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,884
and has made great contributions
to the school.

216
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,445
XIAO JINGNAN

217
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,325
CHEN YOUYOU

218
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,365
Your mom was like a hero.

219
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,444
Ever since I got to know her,

220
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:46,485
she has been helping me, caring for me

221
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,365
This photo was taken

222
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:50,635
when your parents first met.

223
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,444
Two people who really love each other

224
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,204
will surely outdo themselves

225
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:55,845
for one another.

226
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,005
Qingqing.

227
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,284
We wanted to tell you

228
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,764
that you're a smart and beautiful girl.

229
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,515
We are proud of you.

230
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:07,575
But more than that, we hope you will be

231
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,965
a happy and brave girl

232
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,595
and go after the life you want.

233
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,545
She's over there.

234
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,644
-Qingqing.
-Qingqing.

235
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,675
-Qingqing.
-What happened?

236
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,325
What's going on?

237
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,555
I'm afraid I have to leave this college.

238
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:15,925
My dad...

239
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:18,945
He has passed away.

240
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,005
I was hopeful

241
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:33,295
when I first came to this college.

242
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,985
I thought this is how I could find my dad.

243
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,445
But...

244
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,045
After hearing the news,

245
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,845
I don't see hope anymore.

246
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,215
Everything is shattered.

247
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,205
Should I stay?

248
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:00,625
I'm not sure.

249
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,045
I feel like

250
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,005
everything has lost

251
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:11,045
its meaning.

252
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:13,604
That's not true.

253
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,445
Qingqing.

254
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:16,884
You still have us.

255
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,815
We're all your friends.

256
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:24,135
You still have a reason to stay
at Ming De College.

257
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,955
You must remember

258
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,435
that you're never alone.

259
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,085
Qingqing.

260
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,485
Don't go.

261
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,244
Chen Qingqing.

262
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,404
Was I not clear about this?

263
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:58,604
It has been a long day.
Is that all that you've done?

264
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,535
What's going on, Xinya?

265
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,165
Mr. Gu.

266
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,244
It's good that you're here.

267
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,284
I told her to organize
the files for the freshmen.

268
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,724
She mixed up all the files
for the sophomores and the juniors.

269
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:10,924
Even the order of arrangements
were all wrong.

270
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,185
I don't care.

271
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,044
You have to complete
all these files today.

272
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:15,925
Okay.

273
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,004
I will bring them home with me
to finish them

274
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,084
and submit them to you by tomorrow.

275
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,804
Remember your promise.

276
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:23,995
Don't forget.

277
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,795
Qingqing, let me help you.

278
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:38,885
Thanks.

279
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,795
I will help you with the files.

280
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,345
You should go back and rest.

281
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,165
Leave these to me.

282
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,155
I can't do that.

283
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,245
This is my responsibility.

284
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:54,684
Don't be so hard on yourself.

285
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,604
Given your current state,

286
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:00,375
it might take forever
to finish all these files.

287
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,085
Qingqing.

288
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:07,445
Do you still remember what I told you
back at the campsite?

289
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,084
If you ever need help,

290
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,484
you should come look and for me.

291
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,595
Never keep it to yourself.

292
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,345
Go back and rest.

293
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,364
I'm heading over to the office now.

294
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,365
Okay.

295
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,285
Thank you so much.

296
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,985
Don't mention it.

297
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,385
CHEN QINGQING, DATE OF BIRTH,
JANUARY 30, 1999

298
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:56,685
Fangfang.

299
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,985
Why did you bring me here?

300
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:03,804
You've been staying in campus
most of the time.

301
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,684
We should get out sometime.

302
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:06,885
Get out?

303
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,925
But it's so dark here

304
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,205
and there's nothing to see.

305
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:18,405
Fangfang.

306
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,005
Fangfang.

307
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,245
Fangfang!

308
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:29,725
Fangfang.

309
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,844
-Happy Birthday, Qingqing!
-Happy Birthday!

310
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:54,924
Thank you, guys.

311
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,364
How did you know today was my birthday?

312
00:19:57,365 --> 00:20:00,205
Baby, you should thank our president.

313
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:04,244
I was organizing some files
and I accidentally saw yours.

314
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,724
So I thought of gathering everyone
to celebrate your birthday.

315
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:07,724
I hope you don't mind.

316
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,085
Of course not!

317
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,005
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

318
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,765
Did you put up all these lights?

319
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:16,885
Yes.

320
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,575
They look beautiful.

321
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:21,445
Qingqing.

322
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,215
Make a wish.

323
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,284
Congratulations, baby.
You're one year older.

324
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:27,655
You're annoying!

325
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,284
Don't mind him.

326
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,364
You will always be 18 years old to us.

327
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,235
Hurry up, make a wish.

328
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,244
All right, let's have some cake!

329
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,005
-Great!
-Wow!

330
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:47,965
It has gone out.

331
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,545
Gu Nanxi, thank you so much.

332
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,444
This is the first time in my life

333
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:58,084
to celebrate my birthday with my friends.

334
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,015
I'm very happy tonight.

335
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:04,564
I feel very lucky
to have all of you as my friends.

336
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:07,004
Actually, I am not the only one
you should thank.

337
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,865
They all took part in this as well.

338
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:12,684
That's right.

339
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:15,764
I have prepared a mystery gift
for all of you.

340
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:16,884
What mystery gift?

341
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:17,964
Please tell us!

342
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,884
This mystery gift
can't be opened under the tree.

343
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:22,085
What is it?

344
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:25,844
You're annoying.
All this mystery is killing me.

345
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,604
Gu Nanxi, stop beating around the bush.
Tell us now.

346
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,545
All right.

347
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:32,404
I'm sure all of you are going
to love this gift.

348
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,164
Especially you, Qingqing.

349
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,405
-Really?
-Yes.

350
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:36,684
Everyone, come with me.

351
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,625
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

352
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:45,835
We're here.

353
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:48,644
This is the place?

354
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,284
-Baby, there's nothing here.
-That's right.

355
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,785
Wait for me here.

356
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,044
I'll be back.

357
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,465
Make sure no one leaves, okay?

358
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:57,615
Wait for me.

359
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:00,965
Gosh.

360
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:03,804
I left my bag back there.

361
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,044
I need to go back and get it.

362
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,564
Qingqing, it's dark out there.

363
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,865
-Let me go with you.
-Okay.

364
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:10,015
Wait for us.

365
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:18,924
-Hello?
-Yes, Mom?

366
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,044
What? Something went wrong
with the budget?

367
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,364
-I'm coming now.
-Okay, I'm coming home now.

368
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:27,885
-Sorry, I have to head back.
-Sorry, I have to head back.

369
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,205
It's right here.

370
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:50,245
CHEN YOUYOU

371
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,645
Qingqing.

372
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:50,155
Where's everyone?

373
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:14,125
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

374
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,684
It's almost midnight.
I have a present for you.

375
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:18,885
It's a song.

376
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:21,065
It's called "Soulmate."

377
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,685
That day you asked

378
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:37,525
Are there lights in the dark

379
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:43,325
I looked up facing the stars

380
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:50,365
Wondering about the world

381
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:54,845
Wanting to share everything with you

382
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:05,925
Brutal wind, damaged sprouts

383
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:12,445
Spring will lose its meanings

384
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:16,005
Light breeze

385
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:19,365
Dreams and scents

386
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:24,205
Home is where you are

387
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:31,805
I'm waiting by the stars

388
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:37,125
The crescent of your eyes

389
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:45,405
Melody lingering about like the wind

390
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:52,325
Always by your side

391
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,445
Situ Feng.

392
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,405
Thank you for singing for me.

393
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:09,725
This song

394
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,445
was my mom's favorite song.

395
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,005
Then...

396
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:17,335
she fell ill

397
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,295
and passed away.

398
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,045
Situ Feng.

399
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:24,045
I remember

400
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:27,175
before my mom left me

401
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,445
she said

402
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,705
if she's not around anymore,

403
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:36,545
she will turn into a star
to look after me.

404
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:41,305
I believe your parents would be the same.

405
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:43,405
Even though

406
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:45,655
they are gone,

407
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:47,595
but they have

408
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,365
influenced our lives forever.

409
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:05,505
Dear Mom and Dad.

410
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,045
Are you both

411
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,645
doing well up there?

412
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,245
When I was little,

413
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,564
my mom gave me this guitar pick.

414
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:29,964
I turned it into a necklace,
hoping it'd bring me good luck.

415
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,215
Now, I'm giving it to you.

416
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,084
I hope it will bring you good luck too.

417
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,025
Situ Feng.

418
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,524
This is such a precious item to you.

419
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,764
Are you sure you want to give it to me?

420
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,324
Why? Do you think I'm a petty person?

421
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:46,365
That song was not the only gift, okay?

422
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,295
Try it on.

423
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,625
Thank you, Situ Feng.

424
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,575
I promise to cherish it for you.

425
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,644
To think I actually prepared
fireworks for them

426
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:33,465
and they left me hanging,
to be all romantic with one another.

427
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:38,964
Why do I always end up
helping other people?

428
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:42,995
I am not going to set off the fireworks
this time.

429
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,245
Situ Feng, look at the fireworks.

430
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,564
It's rare to have fireworks at this hour.

431
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:50,675
Who set off the fireworks?

432
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,035
It's beautiful.

433
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,005
Perhaps

434
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:58,515
it was your necklace
that brought us the fireworks.

435
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:10,925
Chen Qingqing!

436
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,924
Stay away from Situ Feng from now on.

437
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,684
Isn't this Situ Feng's necklace?

438
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:16,375
Why is it with you?

439
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,645
-Qingqing.
-Lin Yiyang!

440
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:23,315
Didn't I tell you?
Don't lay your hands on Chen Qingqing.

441
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:27,035
This is helium.

442
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:31,245
It will create a magical effect
when people inhale it.

443
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:33,525
Fangfang!

444
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:37,284
Qingqing, we need to find Situ Feng
as soon as possible.

445
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:40,505
This isn't the first time he disappeared.

446
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:44,855
