EPISODE 26

2
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,245
<i>Qingqing.</i>

3
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,324
<i>I am really sick this time.</i>

4
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:39,405
My health is getting worse.

5
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,564
Please don't say that, Grandpa.

6
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,425
You're recovering well.

7
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:48,485
I know my own body.

8
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:51,564
It's a fact that I'm getting old.

9
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:54,964
I've been working
on our family's business my whole life

10
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:58,245
and I've got such a capable granddaughter.

11
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,165
To me,

12
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,965
I have no more regrets.

13
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:06,125
Grandpa.

14
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,735
Mom and Dad left me so soon.

15
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:15,364
You were the one
who has always been there for me.

16
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,565
I think

17
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,684
you're the best grandpa

18
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,685
in the whole wide world.

19
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:22,845
In my world,

20
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:26,365
you're the most talented man.

21
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,965
But this man is old now.

22
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,425
You're not old.

23
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,965
Not at all.

24
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,445
Qingqing.

25
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,785
Listen to me carefully.

26
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:44,884
I have something to ask you.

27
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:49,025
Will you be willing to take over
our family business?

28
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:54,685
Grandpa.

29
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,595
Please give me some time
to think about it.

30
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,605
Okay?

31
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:02,505
All right.

32
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:07,655
I hope you'd be able to find
your true goal in life.

33
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,725
Thank you, Grandpa.

34
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,355
The doctor said

35
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,164
he didn't observe
anything that's out of the ordinary.

36
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,625
We can soon discharge her
from the hospital.

37
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,365
Lanting.

38
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:02,125
Is there a reason why
you want to talk to me at this hour?

39
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:07,565
I've more or less heard
about what happened between you guys.

40
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:13,005
First, it was Xinyu then it was Xinya.

41
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:18,305
It feels like the Lan family owed you
from their past lives.

42
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:21,405
I...

43
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,345
I really didn't expect it.

44
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:25,965
I thought

45
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,564
she was just being childish.

46
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,545
She thinks that I must have liked her

47
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,244
because we grew up together.

48
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,865
You don't have to tell me that.

49
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:41,395
I know it's probably hard for you too.

50
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,165
But Xinya...

51
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,644
Can you guarantee that it's
not going to happen again?

52
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:50,325
Lanting, are you saying that

53
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,484
because someone likes me,
I can't be in a relationship at all?

54
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,044
Or that I should date someone
I have no feelings for?

55
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,044
This is not the same case
as being an idol.

56
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:01,085
There are plenty of fans who like you.

57
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,065
But as for Xinya...

58
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,684
She's now committing suicide for you.

59
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,235
Are you going to watch her die?

60
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,895
Of course not.

61
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:13,045
But, I--

62
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,085
Xinya is the only daughter left
in her family now.

63
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:31,165
Are you awake, Xinya?

64
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:32,685
Lanting.

65
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,455
I feel horrible.

66
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:36,605
Silly girl.

67
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,564
Why did you do this to yourself?

68
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,255
I have no idea why.

69
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,435
Ever since Chen Qingqing appeared,

70
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,805
Feng has been ignoring me.

71
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:53,595
Perhaps I should just disappear for good.

72
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,364
At least, I won't be a burden.

73
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,524
Never say that.

74
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,524
It's wrong of Situ Feng to ignore you,
whether for Xinyu

75
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,244
or for you, or for me.

76
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,044
But to hurt yourself like this...

77
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,164
What if something terrible
really happened?

78
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:10,355
Aren't you indirectly
helping Chen Qingqing to succeed?

79
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,175
What else can I do?

80
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,045
That day,

81
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,265
he told everyone that

82
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,645
Chen Qingqing is his girlfriend.

83
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,285
He didn't consider my feelings at all.

84
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,764
I haven't been around for quite a while.

85
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:39,164
I never expected Situ Feng
to have changed so much.

86
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,365
I really should die.

87
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,695
Stop being silly, do you want
to go through it again?

88
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,225
Let me think of a solution for you.

89
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,485
What else can we do?

90
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,284
No matter how deep their love is,

91
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:59,025
but if they can't see each other,

92
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,875
their feelings will definitely fade.

93
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,835
Just get ready to become Situ Feng's wife.

94
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,365
Gosh.

95
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,724
Situ Feng.

96
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,405
What's that smell?

97
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,045
Smell?

98
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,845
It smells rotten.

99
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,364
How many days have you gone
without washing up?

100
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,004
<i>And your dark circles make you look like
the panda in Kung Fu Panda.</i>

101
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,084
Quickly lower your head.

102
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,364
I don't want your fans
to see you like this.

103
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,284
Please wash up
once we're back in the office

104
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,145
and change your outfit.

105
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:44,124
Perhaps you will need
a facial appointment,

106
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,164
a beauty treatment,

107
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,285
a massage

108
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,484
and a manicure.

109
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:48,804
Maybe not a manicure.

110
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,884
Goodness, my dear Situ Feng.

111
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:54,524
Your latest album
will be released very soon now.

112
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,324
The agency has planned out your schedule.

113
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,885
Do you know how...

114
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,455
Are you listening?

115
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:01,165
Hey.

116
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:02,085
Daniel.

117
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,945
If a girl needs you to take care of her,

118
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:08,444
would you take on the responsibility

119
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,685
and give up your true love?

120
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,044
Actually, there's something

121
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:17,475
I didn't want to tell anyone.

122
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,005
When I was 17 years old,

123
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:23,785
during winter,

124
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:25,985
it was freezing cold.

125
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,365
That year, I...

126
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,524
I was just about to start reminiscing.

127
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,124
How could you just ignore me like that?

128
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,004
Damn, you're no fun at all.

129
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:38,325
Goodness, that year's winter

130
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,865
was indeed freezing cold.

131
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:53,684
Hello? Lanting.

132
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:56,644
<i>Situ Feng, come to the hospital now.
Something happened to Xinya.</i>

133
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,825
What? I'll head there now.

134
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,305
What happened to her?

135
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:11,445
<i>Feng.</i>

136
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,884
<i>Without you in my life,
everything would be meaningless to me.</i>

137
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,284
<i>I've loved you for all these years,</i>

138
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,644
<i>but you didn't love me in return.</i>

139
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:22,435
<i>I have decided to leave this world.</i>

140
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,125
Xinya pulled out her tube today.

141
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,844
Fortunately, I was there and noticed it.

142
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,924
Otherwise, I can't imagine
what would've happened.

143
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:29,885
Situ Feng.

144
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:33,164
I don't care what's going on
with you and Chen Qingqing.

145
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,564
All I know is you've only known her

146
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,065
for a short time.

147
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,244
But Xinyu and Xinya
grew up together with you.

148
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,495
You can't do this to them.

149
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,325
Xinya, please stay with us.

150
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,404
Mrs. Lan, please be patient.

151
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:52,964
The doctors are doing their best.

152
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,705
Let's remain hopeful.

153
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,045
Mrs. Lan.

154
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:06,455
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:12,965
Doctor.

156
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:15,335
Doctor, how is my daughter?

157
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,085
She's all right.

158
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,924
The patient can be transferred
into a general ward later.

159
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,204
-What a relief.
-Although the patient is still in a coma,

160
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,564
if nothing goes wrong,

161
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,924
she should regain consciousness
within half a day.

162
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,415
Thank you, doctor.

163
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,884
-She's all right.
-Please keep in mind that

164
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:36,775
after she wakes up it is best
not to provoke her mental state.

165
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,525
Feng.

166
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,455
Yes, Mrs. Lan?

167
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:46,545
I've never blamed you
about what happened to Xinyu.

168
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,605
We all know that

169
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,485
it was an accident.

170
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,595
But we can't afford to lose Xinya too.

171
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:57,564
Please, I beg you.

172
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,175
I'm begging you, please help us.

173
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:04,605
Xinya's dad is already worried sick.

174
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:09,324
I couldn't even bring myself to tell him
about what happened today.

175
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:10,205
Mrs. Lan.

176
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:12,365
About Xinya--

177
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,645
Don't you worry about it.

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,305
Feng will take care of it.

179
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,524
In the past, he promised us that
he will look after Xinya.

180
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,325
And take care of her in this life.

181
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,705
"This life"?

182
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:28,765
Feng.

183
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,125
Do you mean that

184
00:11:31,205 --> 00:11:34,175
you have the intention to marry Xinya?

185
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,485
Mrs. Lan.

186
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,625
-I--
-Feng.

187
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,884
Are you trying
to let history repeat itself?

188
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:43,355
Do you want the same thing
to happen twice?

189
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:47,645
What were you trying to say, Feng?

190
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,335
It was nothing, Mrs. Lan.

191
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:54,165
Feng hasn't proposed to Xinya yet.

192
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:57,155
What should we do if Xinya disagrees?

193
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:11,805
How is he?

194
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,035
Let's talk over there.

195
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,404
I'll be honest. It doesn't look too good.

196
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,644
Even though we managed
to control his condition,

197
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,245
Mr. Chen is 70 years old.

198
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,004
The intensity and pressure from his job

199
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:31,605
was enough to affect someone much younger.

200
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,105
I should get going.

201
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:44,684
Given Mr. Chen's age,

202
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,444
it's going to be tough for him to manage

203
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:47,924
such a large family business.

204
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:48,975
Especially...

205
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:50,705
Especially what?

206
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:54,124
Especially ever since
you ran away from home.

207
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,244
Mr. Chen has aged so much
during this period.

208
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:00,955
Although Mr. Chen talks
like you need him more,

209
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,365
the truth is,

210
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,685
he needs you more.

211
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,724
Grandpa, how are you feeling?

212
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,365
How has the mergers

213
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:18,205
and acquisitions plans
for the hotels been going?

214
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:22,044
Mr. Chen, the news
that you've fallen ill has spread.

215
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,564
Everyone has been trying
to take advantage of the situation.

216
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,084
The proposals were not in our favor.

217
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,565
We're on a bidding war now.

218
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,445
Grandpa.

219
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,495
Lie down, Grandpa.

220
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,644
I need to take care of this.

221
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,375
I have to solve our current issue.

222
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,005
Grandpa.

223
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:46,244
About the contract,
please let me take care of it.

224
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,745
You need to rest.

225
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,485
Don't worry about it anymore.

226
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,005
Let's go.

227
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,015
<i>Are you there?</i>

228
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,325
<i>-Hey?
-Hello?</i>

229
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,455
How is Lan Xinya now?

230
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,485
<i>She is still rather</i>

231
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,995
emotionally unstable now.

232
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,484
I'm looking after her at the hospital now.

233
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:16,845
How manipulative.

234
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,105
Chen Qingqing.

235
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,604
Can you not say that?

236
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,364
<i>A person who tried to kill herself</i>

237
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:26,005
because of love...

238
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,844
Don't you think she needs to be counseled?

239
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,775
<i>How would you help her?</i>

240
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,685
Cheng Qingqing.

241
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,284
So you're talking to me at this hour
just to tell me

242
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:38,195
<i>how pitiful your little Lan Xinya is?</i>

243
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,724
-I know now.
-Can we just calm down and talk?

244
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:45,204
Do you know a lot of things
are happening to me too?

245
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,404
You're supposed to be my boyfriend,

246
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,004
but you're always by her side
instead of mine.

247
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,324
<i>So many days have passed.</i>

248
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,164
Were you even concerned about me?

249
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,844
Were you concerned about my grandpa?

250
00:15:55,845 --> 00:16:00,605
Were you concerned at all
if I'm still returning to Yuncheng?

251
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:02,645
What if

252
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,535
I can't come back to Yuncheng?

253
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,585
<i>What will you do?</i>

254
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:11,725
<i>Chen Qingqing.</i>

255
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,765
If us being together

256
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,265
means that people around us
will get hurt...

257
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:23,925
Perhaps...

258
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:29,895
We shouldn't be together
in the first place.

259
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,475
<i>It seems like you didn't want me
to come back at all.</i>

260
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,045
As you wish.

261
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,485
Goodbye, Situ Feng.

262
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,405
Feng.

263
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:19,445
Xinya.

264
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:20,604
How are you feeling?

265
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,605
Feng.

266
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,085
Slowly.

267
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:27,145
Are you feeling better?

268
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:34,225
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

269
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,525
There, there.

270
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,485
I'm here.

271
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,655
Will you stay with me

272
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,295
and never leave me again?

273
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,365
Will you?

274
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,645
Yes.

275
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,164
But you have to promise me

276
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:59,255
that you will never hurt yourself again.

277
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:06,735
As long as you stay with me,

278
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,875
I will promise you anything.

279
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:12,125
Okay.

280
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:17,985
How about the other promise you made?
Will you commit to it?

281
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:21,805
Yes.

282
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:25,505
I'm so happy.

283
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,645
How unexpected.

284
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,764
The heir of the Chen Family,
the most prestigious

285
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,404
out of the four great families
in Jincheng,

286
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,685
is someone's mistress.

287
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,645
Chen Qingqing, get lost.

288
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,684
Hurry up and get lost!

289
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:51,115
Get out of Situ Feng's sight!

290
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,475
What's wrong, Chen Qingqing?

291
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,885
In the end, Feng chose me.

292
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:07,505
I will be married to him
and become his wife.

293
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,955
These bunch of good-for-nothing people...

294
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:23,145
Why are they bothering me in my dreams?

295
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,725
<i>I am sorry.</i>

296
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:42,595
<i>No matter what I do, people will get hurt.</i>

297
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,084
<i>I didn't want to do this.</i>

298
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,804
<i>But I have no choice.</i>

299
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:48,005
<i>I am sorry.</i>

300
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,525
You're my son.

301
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,395
Don't easily admit defeat.

302
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:22,905
I could have made

303
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,725
a mistake.

304
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,635
I have faith in you.

305
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:32,925
Just like how I believed in you

306
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:36,215
when you pursued music without my consent.

307
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,285
I have my regrets.

308
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,284
Ever since your mom passed away,

309
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:45,284
I haven't been good
with all my responsibilities as a dad.

310
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,804
I've always made decisions on my own

311
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:51,644
and failed to take your feelings
into consideration.

312
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:53,015
I can understand

313
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,665
if you hate me.

314
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,965
Growing up,

315
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:02,205
I thought you were just a playful kid.

316
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:07,084
I ignored your hard work.
I made things difficult for you

317
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:09,255
and went against your wish.

318
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,284
But the truth is--

319
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:12,415
The truth is

320
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,595
you were only putting up a front.

321
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,475
Deep down, you have
always cared about my career.

322
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:24,364
When Qingqing came to visit the other day,
she told me about it.

323
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,284
When she accidentally entered your room,

324
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:32,115
she saw the room was filled
with news about me and my albums.

325
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:38,525
Thanks for being honest with me, my son.

326
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,635
I am proud of you.

327
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:43,765
Dad.

328
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:48,155
I've never resented you.

329
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:50,465
I was only afraid

330
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:53,975
that you didn't care about me.

331
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:00,725
I'm sorry, son.

332
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,275
You're all grown up.

333
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:11,764
You're capable of
taking charge of your own life

334
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,735
and be a man who takes responsibility.

335
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:16,685
Starting today,

336
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:19,084
I will not control your life anymore.

337
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:20,955
No matter what you do,

338
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,135
I will fully support you.

339
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,245
Thank you,

340
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:33,525
Dad.

341
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,564
Young Master, it's time to go.

342
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:50,724
The car is here.

343
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:52,525
Whenever you're ready.

344
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,485
Okay.

345
00:22:58,845 --> 00:22:59,785
Situ Feng!

346
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,275
Stop right there.

347
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,155
You go ahead.

348
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:06,825
I need to go.

349
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:08,845
Stop.

350
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:12,844
What the hell is this?

351
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:15,244
What do you mean I need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

352
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,975
How could you do this to Qingqing?

353
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,305
ENGAGEMENT PARTY: SITU FENG, LAN XINYA

354
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:28,764
I hope you'll come.

355
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:29,845
Situ Feng.

356
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,124
You'd better explain this to me right now.

357
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,524
Or I'm not letting you go anywhere!

358
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,884
I'm going to be engaged to Xinya.

359
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:40,764
This is your invitation
to attend our engagement party.

360
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,405
Are you kidding me?

361
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,615
Everyone knows
that you don't even like Xinya.

362
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,645
Do you think it was easy for me?

363
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:50,965
Yes.

364
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,684
I don't have feelings for Xinya,

365
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:57,004
but I can't just let her hurt herself
over and over again.

366
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,505
What do you mean?

367
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:04,785
A few days ago,

368
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:08,445
Xinya committed suicide again.

369
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:12,155
It took the entire night

370
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,545
for the doctors to revive her.

371
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:19,245
I...

372
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,325
I'm really scared.

373
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,455
I was blamed for Xinyu's life.

374
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:32,965
I can't afford to let anything bad
happen to Xinya too.

375
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,825
Is he your fiancé?

376
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,484
You two look great together.

377
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,164
It was just a fling.

378
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,164
I've already made up my mind.

379
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,965
Chen Qingqing and I...

380
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:01,165
<i>It's over...</i>

381
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:04,005
Look, she's asking all the fans

382
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,084
to do this.

383
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:07,365
What? This is insane.

384
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:09,764
We must not fail this mission.
We shall only succeed.

385
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,284
<i>Once you're engaged,</i>

386
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,724
no matter what Chen Qingqing does,

387
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,164
Situ Feng won't be able to back out.

388
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:20,525
<i>By that time,
Situ Feng will be yours forever.</i>

389
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:25,175
