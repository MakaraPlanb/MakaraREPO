00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,725
EPISODE 1

2
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:09,325
My goodness.

3
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,284
Those guys aren't giving up.

4
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,615
I can't even catch my breath.

5
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,725
Are all girls from Yuncheng
so open-minded?

6
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,485
I think she went that way.

7
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,124
Excuse me, please help me.

8
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,955
Let me use you. Thanks.

9
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,324
The young master went that way!

10
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,855
I need to use you!

11
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,684
You can't make deals on such things.

12
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,445
Stop moving. I'm going to kiss you.

13
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,164
My name is Chen Qingqing.

14
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,364
Today is my first day at Yuncheng.

15
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,964
It's only my first day.

16
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,724
And my first kiss

17
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,724
got stolen by this wicked guy
in front of me.

18
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,684
Right. I should start the story
from one day ago.

19
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:15,244
I didn't look like this a day ago.

20
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,365
JINCHENG

21
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:35,675
TO THE PLACE WHERE WE MET
AND FELL IN LOVE, YUNCHENG.

22
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,085
CHEN YOUYOU

23
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,515
AT YUNCHENG MING DE COLLEGE

24
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,885
Dad, Mom.

25
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:24,885
Qingqing.

26
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,164
Tomorrow is your engagement ceremony.

27
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:30,765
We wanted to tell you

28
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:34,285
that you're a smart and beautiful girl.

29
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,125
We are proud of you.

30
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:41,285
But more than that, we hope you will be

31
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,805
a happy and brave girl

32
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,004
and go after the life you want.

33
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,045
But...

34
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,445
I don't know what it is that I want.

35
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:56,325
You might be able to find the answer
at Ming De College.

36
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,044
We are so lucky and honored
to witness the engagement

37
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,915
of the two elite families in Jincheng.

38
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:36,845
Indeed.

39
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:40,364
Ms. Chen and Mr. Lu
are both gorgeous and talented.

40
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,505
They are a sight to behold.

41
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,324
Speaking of my granddaughter, Qingqing,

42
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:47,565
it sure makes me proud.

43
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,084
Thanks to the excellent traits
of the Chen family,

44
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:54,315
Qingqing was able to grow up
into such an elegant lady.

45
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:59,605
What is wrong with all of these gifts?

46
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,204
What happened to the tradition
of giving red packets?

47
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:04,285
Is that no longer a thing?

48
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,415
At the age of eight,

49
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:19,425
Qingqing passed the British Royal Music
piano exam.

50
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,804
Authentic limited editions

51
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:28,204
of Burberry, Gucci and Hermes bags
up for auction.

52
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,804
Take a look and see if there is anything
that you like.

53
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:34,324
At 12 years old, Qingqing graduated
from Harvard Business School

54
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:37,185
with credits in psychology and biology.

55
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,165
Ma'am, save your breath.

56
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:43,765
This bag is only 680 yuan.

57
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,404
Those shoes, 580 yuan.

58
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,175
That will be 680 yuan.

59
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,885
These are 480 yuan.

60
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:50,844
The perfume is 880 yuan.

61
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,165
Yes! I have been wanting this.

62
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:00,644
Qingqing, why are you not ready yet?

63
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,804
The whole world
is waiting for you outside.

64
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:03,845
Nalan Yiyi.

65
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,445
Are you my best friend?

66
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:08,325
Yes.

67
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:12,324
Since your friend is in trouble,
you won't abandon me, right?

68
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,165
Yes.

69
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,844
Jingyang, I'm handing Qingqing
over to you today.

70
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:30,795
I wish you two happiness.

71
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,195
Mr. Lu Jingyang.

72
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:49,925
Are you willing to be engaged

73
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:52,265
to Miss Chen Qingqing?

74
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,245
-Are you?
-Yes, I am.

75
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,044
Miss Chen Qingqing.

76
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,405
Are you willing

77
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,484
to be engaged to this man

78
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,085
standing before you?

79
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:03,685
Are you?

80
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,155
You may kiss your fiancÃ©e.

81
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,085
Who is that?

82
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,805
Where's Qingqing?

83
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,645
Yiyi, what are you doing?

84
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:22,625
What's going on?

85
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:25,364
-Go take a look.
-What's going on?

86
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,615
Qingqing, stop! Get back here!

87
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:29,165
I'm sorry, Grandpa!

88
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,045
You guys, bring her back here.

89
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,205
Stay away!

90
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,644
Just be quiet and stay
in those white suits.

91
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,085
Stop! Don't move.

92
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,164
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

93
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,865
I don't want to marry Lu Jingyang.

94
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,165
Don't move.

95
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,084
Qingqing, listen to me!

96
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,445
You better stop!

97
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,244
Mister, can you lend me your motorcycle?
Thank you.

98
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,335
Why should I?

99
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:10,235
-Don't ask me why. Just let me use it.
-No.

100
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,205
Here. Those guys will pay you.

101
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,004
THE LAST REGISTRATION
IS AT 12 NOON TOMORROW

102
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,164
Grandpa has no mercy.

103
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:50,724
He already canceled all my cards.

104
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,444
I don't have a lot of cash though.

105
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:59,575
How am I going to survive
after paying the school fees?

106
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,524
Sir, I've done as you instructed

107
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,644
and froze all of Ms. Chen's cards.

108
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:21,124
But we found out that she bought
a flight ticket to Yuncheng.

109
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,185
She's probably already on her way there.

110
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,325
So she went there after all.

111
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,084
I don't want to marry Lu Jingyang.

112
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:35,125
There is no such thing as true love.

113
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:38,524
Are you saying Dad and Mom
didn't have true love?

114
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,164
I told you many times.
Stop bringing up that dad of yours.

115
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,425
Your mom died because of him!

116
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,524
I know my dad isn't that kind of person.

117
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,404
Otherwise, why would Mom love him so much?

118
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:49,565
Shut up!

119
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:57,205
YUNCHENG

120
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:20,844
Dad, Mom.

121
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,945
I finally came to your city.

122
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:31,764
Sir, let's go to Yuncheng's
most authentic snack street.

123
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:32,645
Okay.

124
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,804
-You have arrived.
-Miss, the total is 128 yuan.

125
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:53,805
Okay.

126
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,805
You look totally different.

127
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,975
I'm no longer the person I was before.

128
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,045
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

129
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,725
I'm okay.

130
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:22,075
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,045
-Sir.
-Yes.

132
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,364
Give me one of this and two of these.

133
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,365
-Okay, please wait.
-Okay.

134
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,625
How much are they?

135
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:41,575
The total is ten yuan.

136
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:46,825
Where's my money?

137
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:51,565
Wait.

138
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,605
This isn't my bag.

139
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,084
Mom, don't give her any money.

140
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:12,445
She's a fake.

141
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:13,804
How do you know?

142
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:15,244
Look at the way she is dressed.

143
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,705
There's no way she's a beggar.

144
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:49,364
This won't work.

145
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,765
What do you mean?

146
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,625
The appearance is wrong.

147
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,204
Look at the fancy clothes you're wearing.

148
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,804
Nobody will believe that you're a beggar.

149
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:02,245
But I can tell that you have what it takes
to be one.

150
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:06,635
I can teach you a thing or two
about my bag of tricks.

151
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,364
The Seven Arts of Begging.

152
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,684
-"Seven Arts of Begging?"
-Yes.

153
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:14,085
Pity, Pester, Spit, Grab,

154
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:15,965
Cross, Help, Love.

155
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,484
"Pity" means putting on
your most pitiful face.

156
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:21,115
"Pester" is to lock onto a target.

157
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,905
As for "Spit," `when someone
is taking something...

158
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:27,805
Never mind.

159
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,395
You need time to master a skill.

160
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,765
You can start working
on the basics of "Pity."

161
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,885
YOUR HIGHNESS

162
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,965
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

163
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,764
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

164
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,765
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

165
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:03,404
-What the hell is going on?
-Your Highness.

166
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,705
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

167
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:27,204
Your Highness has arrived

168
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:31,364
There's a cool man at the top

169
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,044
Ordinary men should step down

170
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,204
Welcome to my domain

171
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,044
-It won't take you a lot
-Thanks.

172
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,884
-A toast and you're my homie
-Thanks.

173
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:42,564
Do not call me as you like

174
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,644
Do not wait for the music

175
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,524
To be reminded of the wild passion

176
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,084
I'm born with talent and power

177
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:52,555
I don't need training and lessons

178
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:57,164
Your Highness has arrived

179
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,044
There's a cool man at the top

180
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:05,135
Ordinary men should step down

181
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:31,765
FENG

182
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,125
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,835
-I'm sorry.
-What's your problem?

184
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,164
-Let us through. Stop!
-Excuse me.

185
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,375
Let me through!

186
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,485
Goodness.

187
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,884
Did you see the reaction from the fans?

188
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:07,884
I told you that this album
was going to be a big hit.

189
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,955
Our pockets will be filled!

190
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,124
A normal album is sold at 70 yuan.

191
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,844
An autographed one is 130 yuan.

192
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:17,084
A limited, autographed, special edition
is 300 yuan.

193
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:19,964
We will release
10,000 normal copies first.

194
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:22,105
How much is all that worth?

195
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,245
Well?

196
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:26,855
I'm counting.

197
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,085
Counting?

198
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:31,615
Have you figured it out?

199
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,045
It's a lot of money.

200
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,305
Never mind.

201
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,724
The point is, an idol
needs to rule the market.

202
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,284
Back when I was a singer,
I had dreams too.

203
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:43,924
Did I rule the market?

204
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:47,924
At 17 years old,
I sold 10,000 copies of one album.

205
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,244
-And then--
-Then it went downhill.

206
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,195
There was no more "then."

207
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,164
Please. We've heard the same story
about 800 times now.

208
00:17:56,165 --> 00:18:00,005
Anyway, Your Highness's performance today
was great.

209
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,125
Good job.

210
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,175
Let's go.

211
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:11,884
Young Master, Mr. Situ asked us
to come for you.

212
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:15,725
Your attendance is required
at his wedding ceremony.

213
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,665
I'm not going.

214
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,644
Young Master,
you're making things hard for us.

215
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,084
Your dad has made it clear

216
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:28,404
that if you don't cooperate,
we'd need to use force.

217
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,225
I hope you don't take it personally.

218
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,965
All right. Step outside.

219
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:42,445
I need to change.

220
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,205
Okay. Let's go.

221
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:51,825
See? Didn't I tell you?
They came all the way here.

222
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,524
Listen, you should just go back.

223
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:55,524
How can the son not be
at his dad's wedding?

224
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:58,035
The press will have a field day.

225
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,895
Like I said, I'm not going.

226
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,395
I can just force my way out.

227
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,564
Do you dare to?

228
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:06,924
No need for makeup.

229
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:07,884
Listen to me.

230
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,284
I won't allow that.

231
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:10,404
Did you see the entrance?

232
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:13,225
It's filled with the press and fans.

233
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:16,804
I'm going to talk to your dad's men.

234
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,945
Come out when you're ready.

235
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,445
Remember this.

236
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:22,644
-You're a top idol.
-Fine.

237
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,044
-You're a top idol, okay?
-Okay. Enough already.

238
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,045
Gosh.

239
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,635
Make it clear.

240
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,725
Will you go or not?

241
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:37,085
No.

242
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,165
I'll jump out the window.

243
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,084
Are you crazy?

244
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:46,105
We're on the sixth floor.

245
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:57,765
Here.

246
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,924
I brought some extra clothes.

247
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,164
Change into them.

248
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,185
I'll take care of Daniel.

249
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,475
Girl's clothing?

250
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,155
I'm not wearing that.

251
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,915
There's no other way.

252
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,235
I'd rather jump out of here.

253
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,725
Absolutely not!

254
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,525
All of you have worked hard.

255
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,204
These suits look smart.

256
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,585
Did you guys buy them together?

257
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:33,404
I look good in black too, right?

258
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,995
Don't you think so?

259
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:38,765
Very nice.

260
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,045
I knew it would work.

261
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,525
Nobody is going to recognize you.

262
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:12,844
That person looks familiar.

263
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:15,045
It's the young master! Stop!

264
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,565
What the...

265
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,525
What happened?
What's the matter with them?

266
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,445
My goodness.

267
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,364
Those guys aren't giving up.

268
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,695
I can't even catch my breath.

269
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,244
Are all girls from Yuncheng

270
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,845
so open-minded?

271
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,605
I think she went that way.

272
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,244
Excuse me, please help me.

273
00:22:06,245 --> 00:22:08,075
Let me use you. Thanks.

274
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,444
The young master went that way!

275
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:16,975
I need to use you!

276
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,804
You can't make deals on such things.

277
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,565
Stop moving. I'm going to kiss you.

278
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,084
My first kiss

279
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:39,165
suddenly got taken away.

280
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:50,045
Do you know that it was my...

281
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:56,004
Since Dad wants me to attend
his wedding so much,

282
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:59,004
I'll give him a big gift.

283
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:02,645
Feng, who is this ugly girl?

284
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:03,685
Hello.

285
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:06,565
Welcome to my engagement party.

286
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:13,084
-Get out of the way!
-Stop her!

287
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,524
-Who's that?
-Who?

288
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,365
You...

289
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:22,415
