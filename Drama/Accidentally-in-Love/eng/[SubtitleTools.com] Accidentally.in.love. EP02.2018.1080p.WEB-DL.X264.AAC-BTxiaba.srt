EPISODE 2

2
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,144
Excuse me, please help me.

3
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:04,225
Let me use you. Thanks.

4
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,544
The young master went that way!

5
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:08,075
I need to use you!

6
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,864
You can't make deals on such things.

7
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:12,625
Stop moving. I'm going to kiss you.

8
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:34,505
That was just an accident.

9
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:38,175
I won't pursue the matter on my side.

10
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,005
But you can't say anything.

11
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,144
Do you want my autograph

12
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,835
or do you really want my autograph?

13
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,035
If you want a picture,

14
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:07,325
I'm afraid I won't be able to do so today.

15
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,825
Do you know that it was my...

16
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,025
Hey.

17
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,995
You're that famous idol.

18
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,065
Your Highness, right?

19
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,185
So,

20
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,495
can you let go now?

21
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,664
Someone took my bag.

22
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,865
You've got your ways, right?

23
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,224
If you promise to help me find my bag,

24
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,675
I'll let this whole thing pass.

25
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,685
What does that have to do with me?

26
00:03:57,825 --> 00:04:00,425
I'm so unlucky!

27
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:04,385
I have no money and I'm so hungry.

28
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:07,225
I'm being chased all over the city.

29
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:08,305
And now,

30
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:13,065
this good-for-nothing jerk
stole my first kiss!

31
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,775
My first kiss!

32
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:16,265
Stop crying.

33
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,015
I'll do it, okay?

34
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,095
Fine, I'll believe you.

35
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:21,665
You...

36
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:23,665
What?

37
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,665
You already promised me.

38
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,144
How could you lie to me?

39
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:28,985
I didn't lie.

40
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,385
Look.

41
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,344
This bag isn't mine.

42
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,424
I tried calling that person,

43
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,345
but nobody is answering.

44
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:37,385
See?

45
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,745
This phone isn't mine.

46
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:44,635
<i>Isn't that Gu Nanxi's phone?</i>

47
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,025
It's ringing.

48
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:52,144
<i>Since Dad wants me to attend
his wedding so much,</i>

49
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,904
<i>I'll give him a big gift.</i>

50
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,145
Hello?

51
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,624
This isn't your phone, right?

52
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,465
What?

53
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:03,075
You're not going to give the phone back?

54
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,005
Okay. I know where it is.

55
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:07,425
Okay.

56
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:09,905
So?

57
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:13,425
The guy is pretty furious.

58
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:16,905
So I think you shouldn't go.

59
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,904
Why don't you go with me?

60
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:20,504
You're a superstar, right?

61
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:22,264
-Yes.
-They will listen to you.

62
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,345
I'm sure.

63
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:24,745
Please.

64
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:28,095
All right. If that's the case,

65
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:30,525
I will reluctantly go with you.

66
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:31,825
Thanks.

67
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,555
It's him. He's the one.

68
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,695
Wait, don't say anything.

69
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:54,985
Her bag.

70
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:56,905
You took it, right?

71
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:57,905
Yes.

72
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,545
And?

73
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,665
Think carefully.

74
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:03,945
Don't act rashly.

75
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,505
So...

76
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,624
What is it that you want?

77
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,544
Look at you, all dressed like a gentleman.

78
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:12,255
I didn't expect you to be a snob.

79
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:16,304
You can disregard me,
but you can't disrespect him, right?

80
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:19,224
He's the one-and-only,
keeper of the female fans' hearts,

81
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,904
Your Highness, Situ Feng.

82
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,224
Do you know how scary his fans can be?

83
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,304
They will start a witch hunt
for you online.

84
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:28,744
And you'll be beaten to a pulp
on the street like a rat.

85
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,765
How about it? Am I right?

86
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:33,905
Yes.

87
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:37,184
So I have no choice, but to return
the bag, right?

88
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,065
Of course.

89
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:39,265
Here.

90
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,995
Get lost if you want to save your ass.

91
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,665
Count yourself lucky!

92
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,515
You dare mess with me?

93
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,145
Thank you.

94
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:00,105
Hey!

95
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,265
That's my bag!

96
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,544
It wasn't easy getting this bag.

97
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,384
I can't just let you have it.

98
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,785
What do you want?

99
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,245
Do as I say.

100
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:13,905
What is it?

101
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,095
Go in and you will find out.

102
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:57,825
Hey.

103
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:07,345
Feng.

104
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,025
Who is this ugly girl?

105
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,624
Xinya, go back to your seat.

106
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,025
You'll know soon.

107
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:17,745
Hey.

108
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,665
Hey, what's going on?

109
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,765
You can eat all you want.

110
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,195
Please excuse me.

111
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:41,125
I thought you weren't coming.

112
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,424
Don't you feel bad for my mom?

113
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,685
This does not mean that I don't love her.

114
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,955
Your love sure is cheap.

115
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,584
Feng, what are you doing here?

116
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,824
I thought you couldn't come
because of your show.

117
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,735
It's my dad's big day.

118
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,504
I had to make time for him.

119
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:05,665
Besides, I have a big gift for you.

120
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:07,985
What is it?

121
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:12,464
I'm warning you.
You better not mess things up.

122
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:13,495
Don't worry.

123
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,985
I only came to give my blessings.

124
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:20,664
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:24,864
Mr. Situ Jie and Miss Li Lusi's wedding
is about to start.

126
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,424
First, how about we listen
to what the groom has to say to everyone.

127
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,325
Let's get him on stage.

128
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:40,705
Situ Feng.

129
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:44,585
Situ...

130
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:48,984
What's your name?

131
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,105
Chen Qingqing.

132
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:52,625
Hello.

133
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:55,945
Welcome to my engagement party.

134
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,544
Engagement party?

135
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:01,624
What's happening?

136
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,784
Isn't this Situ Jie's wedding?

137
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:04,865
Engagement?

138
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,184
Who's getting engaged?

139
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,545
This girl, Chen Qingqing,

140
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,065
is my fiancée.

141
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,185
Hey, Situ Feng. Are you crazy?

142
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,384
Did his fan sneak into the hall?

143
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:26,135
But he just called her his fiancée.

144
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:32,545
<i>What's going on?</i>

145
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,705
Situ Feng!

146
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,785
Are you crazy?

147
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,584
Who are you calling your fiancée?

148
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:39,465
This card

149
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:42,465
has unlimited credit.

150
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,585
The passcode is 233333.

151
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,105
Who...

152
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,345
Who is...

153
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,545
Who is your fiancée?

154
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,105
Me, of course.

155
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:01,305
Hello.

156
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,245
I'm Chen Qingqing.

157
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,145
Nice to meet you all.

158
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,104
What a happy day it is
for the Situ family.

159
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:19,744
Not only did the head of the family
find a beautiful bride,

160
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,535
the young master
has found his future partner too.

161
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,165
No. I'm sorry.

162
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,264
We shall now open the dance floor
for everyone.

163
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,595
We'll decide what to do next.

164
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:45,425
Feng, stop fooling around.

165
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:50,235
Who allowed you to get engaged?
Did I agree to that?

166
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,155
We are unrelated.

167
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,195
"Unrelated"?

168
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,504
Let me remind you that I'm your dad.

169
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:01,505
If you weren't my dad,
I wouldn't have come today.

170
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,305
Miss, you should listen to me.

171
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,344
It's not too late to step away.

172
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,704
Don't scare your daughter-in-law.

173
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:11,864
Come straight to me
if you've got a problem.

174
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,544
Shut up. I've heard enough nonsense.

175
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:18,715
There are too many people here.
We'll talk over there.

176
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,185
What do you want?

177
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,505
What do I want?

178
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:30,584
You know that very well.

179
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,144
Is that how you talk to your dad?

180
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:34,225
Like father, like son.

181
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:35,185
Damn you!

182
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:49,624
Who did that?

183
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,625
Gosh.

184
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,385
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,345
My hand slipped.

186
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,744
Maybe it's because you blended
into the background.

187
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,264
You obviously did that on purpose!

188
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:04,904
I don't give a damn how you
got Feng's attention.

189
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,344
I see crazy, clingy fans like you

190
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,465
all the time.

191
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,545
I see how it is now.

192
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:15,745
Well, let me tell you something.

193
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,425
Actually,

194
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:20,145
I'm not his fan at all.

195
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,825
Actually,

196
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:23,665
I am...

197
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:26,945
Mind your own business!

198
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,425
You're so rude!

199
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,315
You said you weren't his fan.

200
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,745
That means you want his money.

201
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:41,625
I'll buy you.

202
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:46,795
Is this enough?

203
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,945
Look.

204
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:06,125
This is how a lowlife acts.

205
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:08,225
They say one thing,

206
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:12,185
but the body can't help, but pick it up.

207
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:15,785
Take the money

208
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:19,645
and make yourself disappear
from Feng's side!

209
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:30,585
Excuse me.

210
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:32,544
May I have your attention?

211
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:33,465
Firstly,

212
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,464
I'd like to thank the lady here.

213
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,865
I just received a monetary gift from her

214
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:41,864
for my engagement to Feng.

215
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,865
So now,

216
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,344
I'm going to take this check

217
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,805
and return it back

218
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,825
as a thank you.

219
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:51,985
Thanks.

220
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,225
You...

221
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:05,355
-I'm sorry.
-Get her!

222
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,435
Don't let her leave!

223
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:08,705
Hurry!

224
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:12,175
-Get out of the way!
-Stop her!

225
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:14,705
-Who's that?
-Who?

226
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,625
Xinya, are you okay?

227
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,795
Are you hurt?

228
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,205
For the sake of the family,

229
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,424
let's each take a step back.

230
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,385
How exactly?

231
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,555
I'll cancel the wedding.

232
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,845
You cancel the engagement.

233
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,065
Okay.

234
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:47,985
Deal.

235
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,865
Chen Qingqing.

236
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,505
Have you lost your mind?

237
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,584
Why did you do what they told you to?

238
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:17,865
Now, look.

239
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:20,305
You lost your first kiss.

240
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:24,215
And look at the pathetic state you're in.

241
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:26,625
What should I do?

242
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:00,265
What kind of a zipper is this?

243
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,625
I'm so sorry.

244
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,345
The door was slightly opened.

245
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,384
I didn't mean to barge in.

246
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,345
It's you?

247
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,905
I don't think we've met.

248
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:37,025
Are you Situ Feng's friend?

249
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,585
You know Situ Feng?

250
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:42,945
Yes. I'm his good friend.

251
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,675
My name is Gu Nanxi.

252
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,105
And you are?

253
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,745
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:52,985
Stop!

255
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,105
What is it?

256
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:58,745
Wait.

257
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,905
Do me a favor.

258
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,325
What can I help you with?

259
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,584
I can't zip up the dress.

260
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,235
Can you help me out?

261
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:09,425
Thanks.

262
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,425
Thanks.

263
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,865
-Hurry up, please.
-Okay.

264
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,825
-It's done.
-Thanks.

265
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:45,785
-Sir.
-Yes?

266
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:47,545
Are you free?

267
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:50,975
Why are you still here?

268
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:54,425
Can I ask you something, miss?

269
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,305
Have I ever offended you before?

270
00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:59,265
No.

271
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,345
But right now, I hope that

272
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:04,265
you'll erase me

273
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:07,265
completely from your memory.

274
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,305
I hope we'll meet again.

275
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,805
Young Master.

276
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,385
Stop!

277
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,575
What happened today...

278
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,464
Does it make you happy?

279
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:11,624
I was only trying to protect the name
of the Situ family.

280
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:16,265
Your actions have totally
and utterly shamed the Situ family.

281
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:21,264
Our guests today were all the people
with high ranks in Yuncheng.

282
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,645
Who were you trying to impress?

283
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:27,504
Just because you're a celebrity,
doesn't mean you rule the world.

284
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:30,904
Did you think your Situ name
didn't play a part?

285
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,544
I achieved this on my own.

286
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:35,104
You achieved all that
because you're my son

287
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:37,545
and the support from the family.

288
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:41,895
I'd rather not have any of it then.

289
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:45,675
Stop right there!

290
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:56,464
I knew you wouldn't stay at home today.

291
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,045
Did you argue again?

292
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:08,465
Let me.

293
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:28,025
What a show-off.

294
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,995
You're like the shrink in movies,

295
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,635
giving good advice
while hitting the bullseye.

296
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,904
What about a game?

297
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:37,945
Come on.

298
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:21,345
I'm not trying to nag.

299
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:25,425
But I really think you're too hung up
on the past.

300
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:27,995
It's like that with your parents.

301
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:30,675
And the same with your own stuff.

302
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:34,825
Right now, I can't do the things I like.

303
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,285
I can't sing the songs I want.

304
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:39,845
If not the past,

305
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:43,425
I'm not sure what I should hold on to.

306
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:45,685
Stop being so pessimistic.

307
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:49,385
Sometimes, something will happen

308
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,144
or you'll meet someone
that will change your mind completely.

309
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:57,385
Just like how I met a girl
in the changing room today.

310
00:22:58,185 --> 00:23:01,385
I've never seen such a girl before.

311
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:06,215
Just one look and she's forever imprinted
in my mind.

312
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,215
You were looking at girls

313
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,145
in the changing room?

314
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:18,665
What I meant was,
you need to look forward.

315
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,745
Things will get better.

316
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:25,545
Here.

317
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,585
Cheers.

318
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:51,664
<i>This is the school where Dad and Mom
studied and fell in love.</i>

319
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:55,145
<i>I finally found you.</i>

320
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:17,624
<i>Looks like there's no way in.</i>

321
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,904
<i>But today is the last day of registration.</i>

322
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:23,544
<i>There's only one hour left before 12 noon.</i>

323
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,024
<i>It's my last chance to register.</i>

324
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:29,765
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

325
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:05,304
-What's her name?
-I don't know.

326
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,424
You don't know where the first person
you kissed on screen is?

327
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,665
Situ Feng.

328
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:10,904
Your fiancée is there.
Why don't you look after her?

329
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:12,925
I don't know that person.

330
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:16,625
-You again?
-You again?

331
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:20,624
<i>You tore it apart?</i>

332
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,904
I'll make you pay!

333
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,704
<i>That good-for-nothing jerk!</i>

334
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,504
<i>If I see him again,</i>

335
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:30,265
I'm going to kick him all the way
to the moon.

336
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:33,544
<i>Hello, I am your new deskmate.</i>

337
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,105
I'm Chen Qingqing.

338
