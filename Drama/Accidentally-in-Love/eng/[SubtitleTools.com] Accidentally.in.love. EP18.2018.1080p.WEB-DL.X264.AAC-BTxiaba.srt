EPISODE 18

2
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:10,225
<i>Fangfang and Lin Yiyang
are staying in the same room.</i>

3
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:11,325
So...

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,684
Are you sure that you want to go in?

5
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:14,725
Yes.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,745
I have to apologize to Fangfang.

7
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:19,985
All right.

8
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,604
I came here to apologize to Fangfang.

9
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:37,924
I didn't come to visit you.

10
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:39,785
Don't flatter yourself.

11
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:41,725
Fangfang, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,084
It's all right, Situ Feng.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,964
I should've been more careful.

14
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:47,775
It wasn't your fault.

15
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:51,924
How are you doing today?

16
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,404
I'm doing much better.

17
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:56,345
I don't care if you eat it or not.

18
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,145
I'm not hungry.

19
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:13,285
-Fangfang, do you want to have one?
-I will eat it later.

20
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,524
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

21
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,044
I want to go to the bathroom.

22
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,045
Can you give me a hand?

23
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,205
Lin Yiyang, no way.

24
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,284
She's a girl. It's inconvenient for her.

25
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,524
She didn't say anything.
Why are you so worked up?

26
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:29,844
-I--
-And I'm not going to the men's bathroom.

27
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:31,605
-I--
-Enough.

28
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,005
Stop quarreling.

29
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:36,004
Fangfang can't get any rest
if you don't stop.

30
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,084
I'll have to put her in another room.

31
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:39,025
Situ Feng.

32
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,684
Just help him get to the bathroom.

33
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,185
You can't let him hold it in.

34
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,095
Fine, I'll do it.

35
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:52,055
Hey, I'll help you.

36
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,804
-I have to answer this call.
-Go talk outside.

37
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,985
-I'll go with you.
-Okay.

38
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,445
Zhang Fangfang.

39
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:46,565
Actually,

40
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,715
you didn't have to save me.

41
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,855
Don't worry.

42
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,204
I didn't think much at the time.

43
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:55,075
I won't blackmail you.

44
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,035
I'm trying to say...

45
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,585
We're from two different worlds.

46
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,005
We...

47
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:06,015
We should stay away from each other.

48
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,485
I know.

49
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,035
Situ Feng, what's wrong?

50
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,884
Your expression tells me
that something is wrong.

51
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:24,004
Daniel told me that my agency
got an ocean commercial for me.

52
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,615
An ocean commercial?

53
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,085
No way.

54
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,165
You'll have to get into the water.

55
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:34,825
It's all right.

56
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,724
Daniel understands my situation.

57
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,964
He'll handle this matter for me.

58
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,465
That's good then.

59
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,044
Anyway, I'll leave them to you.
I have to go now.

60
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,044
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

61
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,285
-I'll get going now.
-Bye.

62
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,695
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

63
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,364
Although Lin Yiyang admitted his mistake,

64
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:04,245
you...

65
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:07,204
You should still be careful.

66
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,585
Do you hear me?

67
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,405
Is it because

68
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:17,395
that I'm a very important person to you?

69
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:26,964
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

70
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,404
How long haven't you washed your hair?

71
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:31,255
-It stinks.
-Go to hell, Situ Feng.

72
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,564
It doesn't stink.

73
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,764
It smells awful.

74
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:34,835
Cut it out.

75
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,125
Don't worry.

76
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,515
Did you forget?

77
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,855
I used to practice Taekwondo.

78
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,125
Anyway, you need

79
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,685
-to watch out.
-I will.

80
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,924
I have to answer this.

81
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,105
Hello, Daniel?

82
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,924
All right. I understand.

83
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:56,884
I'll go there now.

84
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,705
I'll have to go now.

85
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,285
All right.

86
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,805
Ms. Wang.

87
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:27,545
I don't think this commercial
is a good idea.

88
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,804
Situ Feng will probably be reluctant
to do it.

89
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,545
He will be reluctant?

90
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,844
If he's reluctant, can't you persuade him?

91
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:35,765
Tell me.

92
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,364
How would you like them
to modify the proposal?

93
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:41,415
It's best if we stay away from water.

94
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,684
Open your eyes and take a good look.

95
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,295
"Protect the Ocean."

96
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,804
-Yes.
-It's not an ocean if there's no water.

97
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,404
It would become "Protect the Desert."

98
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:53,445
-Yes, but you know--
-There's no but.

99
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,724
Situ Feng's career has thrived

100
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:57,884
under your care
over the last couple of years.

101
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:58,885
Yes.

102
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,684
But look at him now.

103
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,084
He can't do this.

104
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,655
He won't do that.

105
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:05,804
We spent so much money
on him to make him a star.

106
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,164
-He turned out to be so disobedient.
-That's not true.

107
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,964
Then, I should invest in someone
who's more obedient.

108
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,444
But Situ Feng's music career
has a lot of potentials.

109
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:17,604
-Commercial value is what matters now.
-Yes.

110
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:22,044
He can't even do a commercial.
How can he earn money for the agency?

111
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,765
A trainee complained to me today.

112
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,924
He said that we spent all our resources
on Situ Feng.

113
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,644
-They couldn't make a dime.
-That's not true, Ms. Wang.

114
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,575
Just give me an answer.

115
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,255
Is he going to do

116
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,525
this commercial or not?

117
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:37,845
This...

118
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,084
Ms.Wang, you...

119
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,005
This--

120
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:42,165
Ms. Wang.

121
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:44,105
I will do it.

122
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:45,885
Hey, Situ Feng.

123
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,955
Well, since Feng has agreed,

124
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,884
I'll be looking forward to it.

125
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:54,485
Feng, if you cooperate,

126
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,305
the company will treat you well.

127
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,525
Situ Feng.

128
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,405
Ms. Chen.

129
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,644
Please have a rest here.

130
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,924
Young Master is taking a shower now.

131
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:35,284
But you told me
that he was taking a shower an hour ago.

132
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,925
Is he not done?

133
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:37,845
Well...

134
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:39,724
How about this?

135
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,684
I will sit here and wait.

136
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,175
You can get back to your work.

137
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,875
-Okay.
-Thank you.

138
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:52,985
Situ Feng?

139
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,005
Situ Feng, I'm coming in.

140
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:01,685
Situ Feng!

141
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,285
Situ Feng.

142
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,145
Situ Feng, wake up.

143
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:09,525
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

144
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,315
What are you doing here?

145
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,855
I just wanted to check on you.

146
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,925
Didn't our maid tell you?

147
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,955
I was taking a shower.

148
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,085
She did.

149
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:22,724
Why did you still come in then?

150
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,964
Were you trying to peep at me?

151
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,965
Situ Feng.

152
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,765
You're overthinking.

153
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:31,285
Actually,

154
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,615
I was thinking

155
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,225
that I could overcome my fear of water.

156
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,305
Aren't you silly?

157
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,404
How could you overcome your fear of water

158
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:44,195
by submerging your head in the tub?

159
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,225
How did you know?

160
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:50,405
Your entire body is dry
except for your head.

161
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:52,084
Were you out of your mind?

162
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,205
Yes.

163
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,445
Hey, nonsense.

164
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:58,925
A smart man wouldn't have done that.

165
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,485
Why did you come here anyway?

166
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:06,084
First of all, I wanted to ask you
about the commercial issue.

167
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,484
Secondly, I wanted to thank you

168
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,484
for helping me get through

169
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:12,684
the most difficult time in my life.

170
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,484
Therefore, I wanted to see
if I could be of any help to you.

171
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:17,924
There's a saying that goes,

172
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,524
"A drop of water in need,
shall be returned with a spring indeed."

173
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,465
All right.

174
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,324
First of all, I boasted to my boss
that I could do the commercial.

175
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:30,284
I'll have to shoot underwater in a week.

176
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,764
Secondly, I'm sure
you can't be of any help to me.

177
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:36,524
-You should go home and go to bed.
-Who said so?

178
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:37,775
In this world,

179
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:41,125
there's nothing that I can't do.

180
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,165
But...

181
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:47,805
A week of preparation is too short.

182
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:49,805
Therefore,

183
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:52,845
don't bother about it.

184
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:54,125
Situ...

185
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,145
Situ Feng!

186
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,605
Situ Feng!

187
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,755
-Don't mess with me.
-Chen Qingqing.

188
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,725
Be careful.

189
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,924
It's okay if you get hurt.

190
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,235
But don't break my new toy.

191
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,715
What is this?

192
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,555
Can I take a look?

193
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,285
What is this?

194
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,124
Do you want to know?

195
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,245
Come on. Let me show you.

196
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:26,404
-Hurry up.
-What is it? Why are you so mysterious?

197
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,605
Welcome to Your Highness' concert.

198
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:42,725
<i>Nights</i>

199
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,805
<i>City lights</i>

200
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,485
<i>People come and go</i>

201
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,365
<i>Like thousands of shining stars</i>

202
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:56,605
<i>Stars come and go</i>

203
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:59,365
<i>The future is a puzzle</i>

204
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:03,245
<i>The glare makes it hard to see</i>

205
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,684
<i>Day and night alternates
Time fleets like a white horse</i>

206
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:12,205
<i>-I stay there holding onto memories
-We shall remember</i>

207
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:15,605
<i>Those times</i>

208
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,564
<i>The tide recedes on the eve of sunrise</i>

209
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:22,805
<i>-Separated and say goodbye to the past
-Farewell</i>

210
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:26,165
<i>For all the wrongdoings</i>

211
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:32,485
<i>You sail through endless years</i>

212
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:35,804
<i>Time is like the surface of the sea</i>

213
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:38,445
<i>It reflects 1,001 nights</i>

214
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:43,045
<i>Those unchanged has changed</i>

215
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,925
<i>The fallen leaves after the run</i>

216
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,844
<i>The wind carries them to someone else</i>

217
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:55,365
<i>And they carry him forward</i>

218
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,005
<i>Hope is standing on the edge</i>

219
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,845
<i>It lights up day and night</i>

220
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:06,165
<i>It shines within my sight</i>

221
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:09,644
<i>When I get to the end of the story</i>

222
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,404
<i>I understand how fate has been right</i>

223
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:17,325
<i>It's all about staying by your side</i>

224
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,135
Why are the lights off?

225
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,405
I think the power went out.

226
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:28,215
Situ Feng, you know what?

227
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,805
When you're on the stage,

228
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,125
you exude

229
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,165
a very special vibe.

230
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:40,205
It shows how devoted
and really passionate you are.

231
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,745
You seem to be
an entirely different person.

232
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,675
How did you do that?

233
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,165
When I sing,

234
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,644
I forget about everything else.

235
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,505
It's as if I entered another world.

236
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,885
A world where only music exists.

237
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,485
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

238
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,135
I've got an idea.

239
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:09,135
Let's work hard together
over the next week.

240
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,925
Let me help you.

241
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,805
I'll cure your fear of deep water.

242
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:19,305
Let's work together. What do you say?

243
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:21,925
All right.

244
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,884
I've got the tickets.

245
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:49,835
Let's go.

246
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,045
No, help me.

247
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,875
I can't do this. I really can't.

248
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:01,604
-No, I'm dying!
-Situ Feng.

249
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:02,845
I'm drowning.

250
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,035
Gosh, I'm sorry, everyone.

251
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,925
Hey, Situ Feng. Let's go over there.

252
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:15,925
Wait.

253
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:18,125
Give me a break.

254
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,044
You can take a break.
I'll check it out myself.

255
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,125
Hold on. Come back.

256
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:25,185
Chen Qingqing.

257
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,005
I'm serious.

258
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,804
Every time I start to think
that you're kind of cute,

259
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:34,284
you'll play pranks on me
to make me dislike you.

260
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:36,604
Situ Feng, let me remind you.

261
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,924
Don't forget
what you promised me last night.

262
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,604
A man who doesn't keep his word
is distasteful.

263
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,445
I--

264
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,924
You promised to listen to me
for the entire week last night.

265
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:50,844
If I tell you to go east,
you can't go west.

266
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:54,015
But still, you can't pull pranks on me.

267
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,775
I'm not pulling pranks on you.

268
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,925
I came up with a plan for you.

269
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,725
The movie just now

270
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,764
was only an appetizer
that was as mild as a drizzle.

271
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:13,965
Coming up next,
there's a storm waiting for you.

272
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:15,565
Come on.

273
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:16,525
Please.

274
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:21,605
Can we not talk about drizzle and storm?

275
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,125
I'm getting old.

276
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,605
My heart can't handle it.

277
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,215
Take a look.

278
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,444
What are you going to do again?

279
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,804
Let's do some exercises
since you're getting old.

280
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,795
Come on. Let's exercise.

281
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,204
-Where are you taking me?
-Just here.

282
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,404
Stand straight.

283
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,655
Are you ready?

284
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,805
One, two,

285
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:49,725
three!

286
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,885
I can do it!

287
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:50,485
I can do it!

288
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:54,885
<i>I can do it!</i>

289
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,925
<i>I can do it!</i>

290
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,685
I can do it!

291
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:05,805
I can do it!

292
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,365
Wow, Situ Feng.

293
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:14,244
Do you think that you're in the Olympics?

294
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,324
Aren't you a little overdressed?

295
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,885
Get set...

296
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:18,805
One.

297
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:20,805
Continue.

298
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,245
Two.

299
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,245
Continue.

300
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,165
Three!

301
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:29,325
3.1415926

302
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:31,205
56575859.

303
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,645
Situ Feng.

304
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:40,365
You can do it.

305
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:50,564
Let's give it another try, okay?

306
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,284
No, this is my limit.

307
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,785
This is my limit.

308
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:04,725
Situ Feng!

309
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,285
Rise and shine.

310
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,515
Why is it you again?

311
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,844
After going through training
in the last few days,

312
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:14,245
your mind and body
have been well-adjusted.

313
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,245
Therefore,

314
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:18,765
it's time to take our last step.

315
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,764
I don't want
to be the spokesperson anymore.

316
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,285
Get up.

317
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:29,645
Situ Feng.

318
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:30,725
Get up.

319
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,365
Wake up.

320
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,764
I'm going to say it again.

321
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,124
You can't give up.

322
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,004
Young Master, Ms. Chen--

323
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:40,644
Young Master, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

324
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:41,825
Chen Qingqing!

325
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,764
You've ruined my good reputation!

326
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,604
You've never had a good reputation.

327
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:48,045
That's not true.

328
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,565
Young Master, breakfast--

329
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:55,605
Situ Feng!

330
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:02,125
So where are we going today?

331
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,895
You'll find out soon.

332
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,724
By the way, where's your little stereo?

333
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,415
Why do you need it?

334
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,725
That's my secret weapon.

335
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,815
We've arrived.

336
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:27,485
Qingqing.

337
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,115
Where are we?

338
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,275
Take a guess.

339
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:35,035
The wind here
gives me a feeling of serenity.

340
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:39,044
Situ Feng, I'm going
to remove your eye cover now.

341
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,475
But don't open your eyes yet.

342
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,895
Don't open your eyes.

343
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,585
Situ Feng.

344
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,325
You can open your eyes now.

345
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:10,845
Situ Feng.

346
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:12,925
Don't be afraid.

347
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,415
Close your eyes.

348
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,045
Listen carefully.

349
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,165
Next,

350
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:24,365
let's welcome Situ Feng!

351
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:30,505
Actually, this place
is no different from any other places.

352
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,765
As long as there's music,

353
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,265
any place can be your stage.

354
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:44,685
<i>Separated from dawn by the sea</i>

355
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:49,285
<i>Leave and say goodbye to the past</i>

356
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,165
<i>You sail through endless years</i>

357
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,335
Look, Situ Feng.

358
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,895
There's nothing scary about the sea.

359
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:05,585
I believe in you.

360
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:08,955
I believe that you can do it.

361
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,045
<i>The fallen leaves after the run</i>

362
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,804
<i>The wind carries them to someone else</i>

363
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:20,645
<i>And they carry him forward</i>

364
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,205
Qingqing.

365
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,205
Qingqing, don't go.

366
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,055
I can't lose you.

367
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,005
Xinya.

368
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:23,885
Feng.

369
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,484
He was probably saying "kissing."

370
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,465
You meant kissing, right?

371
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:30,805
I know.

372
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,524
Let's talk when I get back to the office.

373
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,564
Oh, my God, you're finally awake.

374
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:36,924
Daniel, where's Chen Qingqing?

375
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,444
Don't worry about Chen Qingqing.

376
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:41,525
Talk about yourself first. What happened?

377
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:43,855
We went to the sea.

378
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:46,405
There was an accident.

379
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,964
I fell into the water with Qingqing
and then...

380
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:50,644
I don't remember what happened afterward.

381
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,965
You should do things slowly.

382
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,405
How could you risk your life?

383
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:56,884
Fortunately, the doctor said

384
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:58,884
that you only suffered
from emotional distress.

385
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,484
You're physically all right.

386
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,324
Daniel, where's Chen Qingqing?

387
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,324
Qingqing looked after you the whole night.

388
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,604
She got a call this morning
and left in a hurry.

389
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:09,895
By the way, look. She sent you a message.

390
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:12,884
<i>Are you feeling better?</i>

391
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:15,444
<i>The moment you dived into the water,</i>

392
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:18,164
<i>I thought that you looked really cool.</i>

393
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,084
<i>I'm sorry</i>

394
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:21,244
<i>that I couldn't take care of you
until you recover.</i>

395
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,604
<i>My grandpa has fallen ill.</i>

396
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,164
<i>I have to go back to Jincheng.</i>

397
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:26,484
<i>I don't know when I will be back.</i>

398
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,895
<i>Good luck with your commercial.</i>

399
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>Chen Qingqing.</i>

400
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,444
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to look for Qingqing.

401
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:35,764
You just woke up.

402
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:36,885
Situ Feng.

403
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,484
Can you not be so willful?

404
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,364
You're not going anywhere
except for the hospital today.

405
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:43,604
That's right.
You should take care of yourself first.

406
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,395
You can go anywhere you want later.

407
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,205
Xinya.

408
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,335
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,735
It's all right, Feng.

410
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,375
Get some rest.

411
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:08,185
I'm going to go now.

412
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,404
You and Chen Qingqing are friends.

413
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,275
Why did you follow me?

414
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,404
Did you come here to make fun of me?

415
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:45,205
Are you satisfied now?

416
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:51,204
I just wanted to cheer you up.

417
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:52,085
You?

418
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:53,685
Forget it.

419
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,595
What is it?

420
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,975
What's wrong with me?

421
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:01,924
I don't want to argue with you.

422
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:05,155
Can you just turn into a ball? Roll out!

423
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:06,585
Lan Xinya.

424
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:08,684
Don't cross the line.

425
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:11,995
I'm a man. How can I roll on the floor?

426
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:24,284
Lan Xinya, what have you done to me?

427
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:26,444
Why did I really listen to you and roll?

428
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:28,644
Can you be even more childish?

429
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,445
I can't stop.

430
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:34,485
Xinyu.

431
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,685
In the past years,

432
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,565
coming here

433
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:42,644
frightened me the most.

434
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:43,885
LAN XINYU

435
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:45,884
I was afraid to see you.

436
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,925
But you always showed up in my dreams.

437
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:03,005
Xinyu.

438
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:04,765
In my heart,

439
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,044
you were the kindest,

440
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,595
the most beautiful,

441
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,695
and at the same time,

442
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:15,255
I thought of you
as my dearest elder sister.

443
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,505
This will never change.

444
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:20,585
I finally understand now.

445
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,045
I wouldn't let you go

446
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,045
because

447
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:31,665
I was too stubborn.

448
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:37,435
I didn't want to forget
the painful memory.

449
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,005
I think

450
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:46,245
that I can finally let you go now.

451
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,605
I know

452
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:52,145
that you would want me
to focus on my life,

453
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:56,355
sing the songs I want to sing

454
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,975
and love the person who I want to love.

455
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,805
Xinyu.

456
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,085
Goodbye.

457
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,605
Don't disappoint me.

458
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:05,055
It's my pleasure working with you.

459
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:15,124
I thought that you hated me.
Why are you helping me?

460
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,204
-What?
-Qingqing,

461
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:17,844
give me your address. I'll go find you.

462
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,884
Our address is Canglan Village, Beijiao.

463
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,164
<i>Come and we'll meet you here.</i>

464
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,325
STOP

465
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:24,604
-Situ Feng!
-Where's your house?

466
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,035
-My house?
-Yes.

467
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,364
Grandpa, you're back. I've made dinner.

468
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:31,535
-You've made dinner?
-Yes.

469
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,924
I'm Lan, Qingqing's best friend.

470
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:38,445
I love your songs, Feng.

471
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:39,644
Feng and Lan.

472
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:42,045
<i>Go and hang this bedsheet.</i>

473
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,575
