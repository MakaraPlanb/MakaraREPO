EPISODE 9

2
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:06,244
"Breath" really invokes emotions.

3
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,955
Do you feel the same?

4
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:11,645
Goodness, my master.

5
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:14,284
Aren't you busy? Why did you come here?

6
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,564
Take a look at this.
They sent us the music video.

7
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,525
It's great.

8
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,564
We already thought of various ways

9
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:24,164
to make you and Qingchen
into a national couple.

10
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,165
Daniel.

11
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:27,804
I don't want to release this song.

12
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:29,145
That's for sure.

13
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,004
What? You don't want to release it?

14
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,205
Why? Explain to me clearly.

15
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,484
There's no specific reason.

16
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:37,385
I just wanted to do so.

17
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,525
You're really childish!

18
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,604
I'll bear the consequences myself.

19
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:44,485
Hey!

20
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,665
Stop right there!
Can you bear it yourself?

21
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:55,925
Xinya.

22
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,725
I heard that, last night,

23
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:02,684
Situ Feng and Gu Nanxi
were with Chen Qingqing.

24
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:03,525
What?

25
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,005
That's why they didn't accompany you.

26
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,725
Chen Qingqing!

27
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:17,025
I won't let you live in peace!

28
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:29,755
Hello, Mr. Gu.

29
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:31,644
Chen Qingqing.

30
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,525
It's me.

31
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:35,175
I have something to ask you, sir.

32
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,884
Why do you have to do this
if you want to ask a question?

33
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,284
If I don't do this,
I can't stand properly.

34
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,565
Look at my leg.

35
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,925
Your leg is so swollen.

36
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,844
It's okay. The doctor said
I'll be fine after a few days.

37
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:49,964
Right, Mr. Gu.

38
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,324
Regarding yesterday's incident,
I have a question.

39
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,284
Ask away then.

40
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,115
Did you know Lan Xinyu?

41
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,964
How did you know about her?

42
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:00,484
I heard Situ Feng said her name
yesterday at the amusement park.

43
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:03,804
When he mentioned her name,
Yiyang got really angry.

44
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,125
The two of them almost fought.

45
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:09,564
So I'm guessing that
our honorable president

46
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,115
will definitely know what happened.

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,924
I placed the book
at the wrong place just now.

48
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,125
Regarding Xinyu,

49
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:30,695
all I want to say is that
after she passed away,

50
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,685
Situ Feng changed completely.

51
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,645
Yiyang too.

52
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,524
What happened between--

53
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,124
You should ask Situ Feng
about what happened.

54
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,745
Only he can decide
whether to tell you or not.

55
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,244
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

56
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:03,075
-Yes?
-How's your leg?

57
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:06,245
The doctor told me that he can

58
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:09,325
remove my leg cast after two more days.

59
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,965
-Let's study maths today.
-Hey.

60
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:15,465
I'm not tutoring you today.

61
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:16,724
-Really?
-Yes.

62
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,985
I'll go play basketball then.

63
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,975
Right, put the snacks into my drawer.

64
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:23,365
Stop!

65
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:25,005
Come back.

66
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:34,405
Although we're not studying today,

67
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:37,885
but I have an important matter

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,465
to share with you.

69
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:49,805
Let's begin

70
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:53,605
Lin Yiyang's Discipline Committee's
first meeting.

71
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,364
-Discipline Committee?
-That's right.

72
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,685
Hello, I'm Miss Chen Qingqing.

73
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:03,045
You're my sidekick, Situ Feng.

74
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,364
The purpose of today's meeting is

75
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,605
to bring justice upon Yiyang

76
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:12,325
for the kidnapping at the amusement park.

77
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,985
Please look at this.

78
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,844
After a few days of investigation,

79
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,485
I've already understood
our target completely.

80
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,655
Count me out.

81
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,405
Why?

82
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:27,905
I'm telling you,

83
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,245
I quit.

84
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:31,725
Hey!

85
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,605
Situ Feng!

86
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:35,524
Do you know what you're doing?

87
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,724
I want to ask you that.
Do you know what you're doing?

88
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,684
Discipline Committee?
What justice are you talking about?

89
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:41,804
Who do you think you are?

90
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:42,764
Are you the principal?

91
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,324
But Yiyang kidnapped me. He kidnapped me!

92
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:46,644
But he didn't hurt anyone.

93
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,775
Your injury was an accident.

94
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:50,285
Situ Feng.

95
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,924
Don't you think that Yiyang
always has something against you?

96
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,244
He's always harassing you.

97
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:59,405
Not just you, it's because of Xinyu too.

98
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,845
He's...

99
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:04,245
How did you know about that?

100
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,485
I...

101
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,145
Of course I would know about her.
What about it?

102
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,445
Hey! Situ Feng!

103
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,644
The school will handle
the matter regarding Yiyang.

104
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:26,605
Don't meddle in other people's affairs,
especially in this matter!

105
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,345
Situ Feng, you've crossed over the line.

106
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,085
I'll stay out of it! I don't want...

107
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,045
Chen Qingqing.

108
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,844
Why do you care about him?

109
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:45,995
It's annoying.

110
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,045
SITU FENG!

111
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:09,215
HOW PITIFUL, LET'S MOVE!
I'VE ASKED LAN XINYU TOO.

112
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:14,765
I put in so much effort.

113
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,205
In the end,

114
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,645
he said that I was a busybody.

115
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:25,804
Hebiancao has uploaded a new material.

116
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,804
His Highness's official account
shared it too.

117
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,604
Let's read it together.

118
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:31,765
His Highness is so cute.

119
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,684
It seems like Hebiancao
really understands His Highness.

120
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:38,685
I think we should talk to him sometimes

121
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,095
so that we can get news
about His Highness.

122
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,655
By the way, have you seen this?

123
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:52,964
DON'T CRY, LITTLE FENG.

124
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,425
I saw it. It's that guy again.

125
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,965
I think it's quite good.

126
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,865
Look at your face
with two nose drips. How cute.

127
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,365
He's painting the wrong picture.

128
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,924
But I feel that the writer
really understands you.

129
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,325
Could he be someone we know?

130
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,495
Well, he better not
let me find out who he is.

131
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,564
I can't believe that someone

132
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,305
other than Qingqing can tolerate you.

133
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,685
Hey, get lost.

134
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,045
Situ Feng.

135
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,615
Please answer the second question.

136
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,205
Come to my office after class.

137
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,165
Qingqing.

138
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:55,964
I'll help you out.

139
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,844
Where are you going today?

140
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,044
I can do it myself.

141
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,244
It's just a small matter.

142
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:03,495
I don't want to bother you, Your Highness.

143
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:24,124
<i>Are you free tomorrow, Qingchen?
I want to have dinner with you.</i>

144
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,495
<i>Sure.</i>

145
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,415
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

146
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:00,985
You look so pretty today, Qingchen.

147
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:03,885
Thank you.

148
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,485
Are you this nice to every girl?

149
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:10,825
That's not true.

150
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:13,244
I don't like to lie.

151
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,815
If I say that you're pretty,
then I mean it.

152
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,485
Thank you.

153
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:23,684
For this restaurant,
I've ordered some signature dishes.

154
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,505
Try it and see whether it suits you.

155
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,084
Looking at the way you have the soup

156
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,395
suddenly reminds me of someone.

157
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:38,805
A friend?

158
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,525
No.

159
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,844
I'll get right to the point.

160
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,364
I asked you out today

161
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,605
is to explain to you

162
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,195
that I've decided not to release

163
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,935
the music video of "Breath."

164
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,285
You...

165
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,045
Aren't you surprised?

166
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,435
I believe that

167
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,755
you have your own reason.

168
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,695
Thanks for understanding.

169
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,045
Actually,

170
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,895
the releasing of this song

171
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,615
will cause harm

172
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,045
to someone.

173
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,545
Cause harm to someone?

174
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,045
"Breath."

175
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,805
What does it represent?

176
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,445
If you can't tell me,

177
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:48,485
then it's okay.

178
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:52,325
"Breath."

179
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:56,525
Actually, I wrote it for an important...

180
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,825
A very important girl.

181
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,315
It's just that she...

182
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:02,765
What is it?

183
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,415
She passed away

184
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,645
three years ago.

185
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:13,685
So once the song is released,

186
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,175
it will invoke unwanted memories

187
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,405
and conflict to others.

188
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,045
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,015
I've talked so much.

190
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,265
You must be unhappy.

191
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,364
Although this music video wasn't released,

192
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:37,115
but the agency has watched the demo.

193
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,325
They love your acting.

194
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:43,684
Maybe there will be a chance for us
to work in the future.

195
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:44,645
Thank you.

196
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:48,885
Thank you for your honesty too.

197
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,444
Of course, we're friends after all.

198
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,285
Friends?

199
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,244
Yes, we're friends.

200
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,764
<i>If Qingchen is your friend,</i>

201
00:13:56,765 --> 00:14:00,865
<i>who is Qingqing to you then?</i>

202
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:04,284
It's a pleasure having you as a friend.

203
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:07,045
It's a pleasure for me too. Thanks.

204
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,644
I'm sorry. I have something to do.
I need to leave first.

205
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:21,605
Now?

206
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,604
Do you want me to send you?

207
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:28,505
It's okay. I can go home on my own.

208
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,684
<i>We should treat our friends sincerely.</i>

209
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:40,964
<i>When he talked to Qingchen,</i>

210
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,324
<i>he told her everything.</i>

211
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,164
<i>As for Chen Qingqing,</i>

212
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:48,004
<i>he told her not to meddle
in other people's affair.</i>

213
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,204
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

214
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:54,525
<i>So are you only friends
with beautiful girls?</i>

215
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:59,645
SELF-REVISION TIME

216
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:05,475
I RECENTLY HAD A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE.
CAN I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION?

217
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:15,765
SURE.

218
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:23,815
THIS PERSON HAS A SECRET THAT
HE TOLD A STRANGER, BUT NOT ME.

219
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,164
What do you want, Situ Feng?

220
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,684
I saw you play with the phone
instead of studying.

221
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:36,425
-I will monitor you.
-Do I need to be monitored?

222
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,885
Hey, I'm just curious.

223
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,365
You must've done something shady.

224
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:51,615
You're right.

225
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,044
You're the righteous one.

226
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,764
You tell others about everything.

227
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:59,395
I don't want to listen to you.
I don't have time for you.

228
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,165
What are you doing?

229
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:07,084
I just want one.
You've stopped supplying snacks to me.

230
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:10,244
You can't even have one. I won't allow it.

231
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:12,265
-I'll help you out.
-No!

232
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,444
Since we're not so close,
let's get straight to the point.

233
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:44,935
What kind of trouble
will you bring me today?

234
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,205
Qingqing.

235
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:50,324
I admit that it was our fault
for certain things before.

236
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,365
But we're here now

237
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,675
to become friends with you.

238
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:56,724
That's right.

239
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,125
We came here today to buy snacks from you.

240
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,124
You want to buy snacks from me?

241
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,485
Yes.

242
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,285
Xinyan.

243
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,015
Thank you, Xinya.

244
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:28,684
Everyone, we bought some snacks.

245
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:29,925
Help yourselves.

246
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,884
If you're tired in the afternoon,
have them for your afternoon tea.

247
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,845
Thank you.

248
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:35,815
Thank you, Xinya.

249
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,164
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

250
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:39,204
My stomach hurts.

251
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,604
Why does it hurt all of a sudden?

252
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:43,485
I think it's because of this biscuit.

253
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,755
Let me take a look.

254
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,164
There's a problem
with the manufacturing date.

255
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,375
It has expired.

256
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,755
Don't eat it, everyone.

257
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:57,275
What? It has already expired.

258
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,405
Man.

259
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:01,044
Are you sure these biscuits
are the ones we bought from Qingqing?

260
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,165
Yes.

261
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,884
Qingqing is a profiteer.

262
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,204
-We must boycott her.
-Boycott!

263
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,164
Xinya, you must seek justice for us.

264
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:09,404
-That's right.
-Yes.

265
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,684
Don't worry, everyone.

266
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,564
I'll bring justice for everyone.

267
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:14,835
We can't easily let this go.

268
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,445
-That's right.
-That's right.

269
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,485
-Qingqing, are you done?
-Yes, let's go.

270
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:24,555
Qingqing, don't you dare run away.

271
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:29,804
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why would I run away?

272
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,284
Look at it yourself.

273
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,785
I bought these biscuits from you.

274
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,844
If you didn't do anything wrong,

275
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,164
don't you think this is absurd?

276
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:41,084
We bought snacks from you to support you.

277
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,284
But you sold the expired ones to us.

278
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,485
Expired?

279
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,764
If my classmate didn't get a stomachache,

280
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,524
we wouldn't know that we were cheated.

281
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,005
Xinya, there must be something wrong.

282
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,724
It's impossible for us to sell
expired products to you.

283
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:58,445
Will anyone still believe
the words of a liar?

284
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,684
I'll tell everyone about your evil deed.

285
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,565
Your service is doomed.

286
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:11,815
But isn't it odd

287
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:14,804
that one of the Goddess members
had a stomachache?

288
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,524
They found out
about the expired dates too.

289
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:17,615
That's right.

290
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,805
Plus, when I looked at Xinyan,

291
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,004
she didn't look like
she had a stomachache.

292
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:25,945
But those expired products

293
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,045
are definitely ours.

294
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,525
What should we do now?

295
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:35,924
Fangfang, why don't
I find Mr. Zhao and ask him tomorrow?

296
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,644
I'll ask about the source of the snacks.

297
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:38,485
All right.

298
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:45,645
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

299
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:49,324
I'm Chen Qingqing.
I bought some snacks from you before.

300
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:52,145
I'll reach your place in 30 minutes.

301
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,875
Okay, thank you.

302
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,125
Hey.

303
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:01,445
Qingqing.

304
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,445
It hurts.

305
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,364
I'm warning you, Situ Feng.

306
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,924
I'm in a bad mood today.
Don't mess with me.

307
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,045
Hey.

308
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,044
-I want to ask whether you need my help.
-Your help?

309
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,165
I beg you.

310
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,964
Please control your precious Xinya.

311
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,985
Don't let her disturb me.

312
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,815
As for you, Situ Feng,

313
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,484
stay away from me!

314
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:26,085
-Hey.
-Unless you want me to slap you.

315
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:27,164
Do you hear me?

316
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:29,285
Hey, I was being nice.

317
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,675
Why are you so vicious?

318
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,505
-It hurts!
-Were you being nice?

319
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:37,164
All of you are like this.

320
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:39,724
You always impose
your own views upon others,

321
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:40,964
no matter they want it or not.

322
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,835
Where do you get your confidence from?

323
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:48,885
Please.

324
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,844
Who cares about your feeling?

325
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,325
Who are you?

326
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:53,724
The princess of ugly people?

327
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,535
My eyes are tainted by your ugliness!

328
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:03,645
Hey.

329
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,245
Gu Nanxi.

330
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:06,765
Hey, Qingqing.

331
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,445
Qingqing.

332
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,835
Did you ask the supplier?

333
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:19,004
Mr. Zhao told me that

334
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:22,564
the manufacturing date for the snacks
is on the first of May.

335
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,444
It's impossible that
the snacks are expired.

336
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:29,165
But all the receipts are gone.

337
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,645
There's no way to look at it.

338
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:34,964
I wonder if the whole school
knows about the problem.

339
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:37,284
Our Errands Service
has no business at all today.

340
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:38,405
Really?

341
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,284
Hello, are you responsible
for the school's surveillance?

342
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:51,285
Yes.

343
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,124
I need the surveillance video
of our class.

344
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,605
-No.
-Why?

345
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:56,364
It's the school's rule.

346
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,364
The rule is dead, but we're not.

347
00:21:58,365 --> 00:21:59,525
No.

348
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,375
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

349
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,225
Are you one of my fans?

350
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:21,585
Are you willing to help me?

351
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:22,765
Can you...

352
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:26,485
Can you dance for me?

353
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:36,345
Situ Feng, you skipped class.
What are you looking at?

354
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,995
Why are your dark circles getting worse?

355
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:46,645
Gu Nanxi, look at this.

356
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:49,844
This is our class' surveillance footage
on the night before the incident.

357
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:50,865
Someone came.

358
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:53,165
Okay.

359
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:58,185
It's enough to prove
Qingqing's innocence with this video then.

360
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,765
Wait a minute.

361
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,945
Were you watching the footage
for the past few nights?

362
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:04,885
I...

363
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,805
I wasn't.

364
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,525
You worked so hard to help her.

365
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:15,595
Shouldn't you two patch things up?

366
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:21,015
By the way, don't tell her that
I got the surveillance footage.

367
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,005
I seriously don't understand.

368
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:32,444
At first, you were the closest person
to Chen Qingqing.

369
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,085
Why did you two have a big fight?

370
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,484
You're still denying it.

371
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,525
How stubborn.

372
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,605
I'm sorry, I'm late.

373
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,524
Since everyone is here,

374
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:51,164
let's come up with an explanation
for Qingqing's Errands Service

375
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,685
to clear things up.

376
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:58,044
Let's watch this surveillance footage.

377
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:00,444
From the surveillance video
of this classroom,

378
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,484
someone entered Qingqing's classroom

379
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:05,245
around 12 a.m. on the night before.

380
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,204
Although the reason is unclear,

381
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:10,255
but all these things are linked together.

382
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:13,444
This evidence is enough
to prove Qingqing's innocence.

383
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:16,884
If there's no objection,
that's all for today.

384
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:18,765
The meeting is dismissed.

385
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:35,825
Situ Feng, come to my office.

386
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,605
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

387
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,764
What's going on?

388
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:47,925
I don't know.

389
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:53,764
Do you think it's related
to the maths test, during the last class?

390
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:55,475
By the way, Gu Nanxi.

391
00:24:55,725 --> 00:25:00,164
Fangfang and I want to treat you
this weekend to thank you.

392
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,255
Are you free?

393
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:04,825
-Sure. Okay.
-It's decided then.

394
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,965
Your maths result is bad.

395
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:13,044
You should spend more time
to do the questions.

396
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,755
It's okay if you can't answer it.

397
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:18,405
Why did you write down lyrics?

398
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,964
I had an inspiration so I wrote them down.

399
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:21,845
Excuses.

400
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,685
Situ Feng, you're an idol.

401
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:28,365
What's an idol?

402
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:30,364
A model and an example.

403
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:33,444
You had a chance
to be listed in the school history's book.

404
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,484
The saddest part is not that

405
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:37,044
you weren't able to do it.

406
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:38,764
You had the capability to do it,

407
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:41,524
but you let go
of an opportunity like this.

408
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,244
If you have the time today,

409
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:47,835
go to the College Archives
and look at your seniors' stories.

410
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,004
Qingqing, you're lucky today.
It's finally the secretariat's' turn

411
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,924
to clean the College Archives.

412
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,084
This place is huge.

413
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,724
Are we the only ones cleaning it up?

414
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,244
How is that possible?

415
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:01,835
You're on your own.

416
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:05,035
Thanks for everything.

417
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:18,564
<i>I thought it was going to be difficult
to enter the College Archives.</i>

418
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:23,955
<i>I can't believe that
I have this opportunity.</i>

419
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,724
You scared me to death!

420
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:37,405
Why are you here?

421
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:40,564
Ms. Chen punished me
to go through the school history.

422
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,524
Why are you here?

423
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,965
I'm here to clean this place.

424
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,805
Continue then.

425
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:49,445
I'm leaving.

426
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,885
I was so surprised. My goodness.

427
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:02,805
Why is it locked?

428
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,615
Hey, Chen Qingqing!

429
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:05,765
What?

430
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,565
Why is it locked?

431
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,185
Nice, we can't leave now.

432
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:47,004
<i>Did sand get into her eyes?</i>

433
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,604
<i>Should I give her some tissues?</i>

434
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:49,844
<i>What about the rest?</i>

435
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:54,185
<i>Why are there so little details?</i>

436
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:58,755
<i>I've already cut ties with her.</i>

437
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,564
<i>Ms. Chen?</i>

438
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:03,964
<i>So Ms. Chen knows my parents.</i>

439
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:09,115
<i>I wonder if she has news about my parents.</i>

440
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:18,125
There's a rat!

441
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:20,605
Situ Feng!

442
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,925
There's a rat!

443
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,365
Situ Feng!

444
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:26,644
What are you doing?

445
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:29,124
-I'm scared of rats.
-Don't move. Get down.

446
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,335
Get down first.

447
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,604
-I refuse.
-Listen to me. Get down.

448
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,965
I'm scared.

449
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,925
Get down.

450
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:36,815
Look at me.

451
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:38,975
Look at me.

452
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,325
Situ Feng.

453
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:15,125
When can we leave this place?

454
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,124
I don't want to stay here at all.

455
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:20,404
-Don't worry. I'll call Gu Nanxi.
-What did you say?

456
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,125
I'll call Gu Nanxi!

457
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,085
Hello?

458
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:36,025
Okay, I'll help you to open the door now.

459
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:38,605
Situ Feng!

460
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,275
Are you there, Situ Feng?

461
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:44,605
Situ Feng.

462
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:46,085
Are you two okay?

463
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:47,724
How are you, Situ Feng?

464
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:48,685
Nanxi.

465
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,324
Can you give me a hand?

466
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,165
Okay.

467
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,125
I was scared to death by a rat.

468
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:58,205
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

469
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,945
Give my headphones back.

470
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,245
Xinya, give me a hand too.

471
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,525
Gu Nanxi.

472
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:26,365
Fangfang wants to apologize.

473
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,164
Something came up so she couldn't come.

474
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:31,535
Only the two of us
will be eating together.

475
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,685
It's okay then.

476
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,405
I have a small secret to tell you

477
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:38,844
about proving your innocence last time.

478
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,305
What's the secret?

479
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:42,685
Xinya.

480
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:45,604
Why are you two here too?

481
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:46,445
Situ Feng.

482
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:49,365
Let's sit here with them.

483
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:53,444
There are so many empty seats.
Why do you have to sit here?

484
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:54,895
What a coincidence.

485
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,155
Why don't you sit with us?

486
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:58,165
All right.

487
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:03,635
Thank you, Feng.

488
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,925
Gu Nanxi! I demand a duel!

489
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,284
I'm not afraid of you.

490
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,525
Chen Qingqing! Come out!

491
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,124
<i>You have Hua Munian and Gu Nanxi.</i>

492
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,884
What's your relationship with them?

493
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,684
Are you asking me
to be his assistant for real?

494
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,764
What? Chen Qingqing is coming too?

495
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:41,604
Let's show him who's boss
on behalf of Mr. Wang.

496
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:42,884
<i>There's an extra scene.</i>

497
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,165
Can you really not swim?

498
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,324
They're doing it on purpose.

499
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:49,484
-Hey, beautiful lady. Where are you going?
-Hey!

500
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:50,565
Stop it.

501
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,844
<i>This is the first time
I brought someone here.</i>

502
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:53,965
Situ Feng.

503
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,124
Will you really fall in love with me?

504
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,795
