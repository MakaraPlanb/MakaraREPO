EPISODE 6

2
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,644
Qingqing, it was
under Xinya's recommendation

3
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:58,844
that you could join the Student Council.

4
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,644
So that makes the both of you
in the same department.

5
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:06,044
How can a snappy girl like you
have what it takes to work for me?

6
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,885
What a waste!

7
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,484
Qingqing, shake hands with her.

8
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:11,695
Be friends now.

9
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,564
You're going to deal with a huge burden
working at the secretariat.

10
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:24,764
Don't even think of living it easy
once you're in the Student Council.

11
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,244
As usual, we'll give you a one-week
probation period.

12
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:30,324
If you're incapable of satisfying us
within the given period,

13
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,275
I'm sorry, but you'll have to resign.

14
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,404
Well, I have something to attend to.

15
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,285
You be nice to each other, okay? Bye.

16
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,284
Splendor, I want splendor!
Don't you get it?

17
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,484
You have got to be kidding me
with that kind of budget.

18
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:49,004
We can't have an evening party like this.

19
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,164
Hua Munian, she'll be your assistant
for next week.

20
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,964
Don't hesitate to tell her
to do any chore.

21
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:58,204
That way, you'll help me see if she has
what it takes to be in the council.

22
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:03,084
If you find that she's unable
to satisfy us within the given period...

23
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,795
You can kick her out.

24
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:11,764
Hello, I am Hua Munian,
head of entertainment department.

25
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,645
Hello.

26
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,524
I am Chen Qingqing,
the head of entertainment's assistant.

27
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:17,975
Sorry, I don't like lame jokes.

28
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,564
I hope you don't mind.

29
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:29,345
I don't blame you, but personal hygiene
is my highest priority.

30
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:32,644
You know I always strive
to always keep my mind and body clean.

31
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,004
A rookie like you should be honored
to be able to join "Project Hua,"

32
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,684
even if it brings me grief.

33
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:42,535
Even though you're but a tiny screw
in our grand project, but--

34
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,845
That was gross!

35
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,845
I'm sorry!

36
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,925
-I'm sorry!
-Stop!

37
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,915
-Let me--
-I said, stop!

38
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:56,365
Do you know that water will ruin my coat?

39
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,364
God gave you a simple mind
and an ordinary look.

40
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,875
You should act the way you look.

41
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:07,465
I find the way you speak
quite interesting.

42
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,725
Hey, be serious.

43
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,044
How did you get into a conflict
with Lan Xinya?

44
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,764
You have to be careful around her.

45
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:19,444
The last time I wore the same outfit
as her, she gazed at me.

46
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,905
Boy, it scared me.

47
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:25,364
So can I begin with my first task now,
chief?

48
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,564
There are a few chairs over that side.

49
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,604
-Take them to the activity room.
-Okay.

50
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:32,175
-I'll wait for you there.
-Okay.

51
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:34,615
See you, chief!

52
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,605
A few chairs.

53
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,115
All right, we'll send them in a minute.

54
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,005
Chief!

55
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,255
I've moved them all!

56
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,595
Come here, baby!

57
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,895
Next, I'm going to give you
an even harder task.

58
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:09,484
"Supplies Procurement Checklist.

59
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,684
Bubble machines, dry ice machines,
salvo cannons,

60
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:15,364
inkjet posters, microphones,
audio systems, balloons..."

61
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,725
That's a lot!

62
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:20,564
-I have to get them all by myself?
-That's right.

63
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,284
Well, how much is the budget for all this?

64
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,815
Let me get it out.

65
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:25,765
Here.

66
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,685
Wait, there's more.

67
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:31,685
Go.

68
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,364
Are you kidding me?

69
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,125
Baby, come here.

70
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,924
I've heard about how well you ran
your errands service.

71
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:41,205
So I tailored this task just for you.

72
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,445
I have a really good news
to tell you guys.

73
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:54,165
-But don't be shocked.
-What is it?

74
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:56,765
Next Saturday at 8 p.m.,

75
00:05:56,845 --> 00:06:01,245
His Highness will sing for the newcomers
at the party!

76
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,324
<i>-Welcome to my domain
-My domain</i>

77
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,324
<i>-It won't take you a lot
-It won't take you a lot</i>

78
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,324
<i>-A toast and you're my homie
-A toast and you're my homie</i>

79
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:14,764
<i>-For nothing, don't call me!
-For nothing, don't call me!</i>

80
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:15,605
Look.

81
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:20,045
There's so much blood. It's so violent.

82
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:24,245
But I like it.

83
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,805
Are you nuts?

84
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,515
This is an insult to His Highness.

85
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,605
Who drew this?

86
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,045
"Hebiancao?"

87
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,325
Sisters, let's plunder his Weibo!

88
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:46,284
<i>So you think you're awesome?</i>

89
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,484
<i>Rocking the world
with that rotten pen of yours.</i>

90
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,204
<i>Hey, author, you're a piece of turd.</i>

91
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,364
<i>It will be a year's worth of gross
when I step on you.</i>

92
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:53,644
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

93
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,564
<i>Why don't you stand beside the sun?</i>

94
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,044
<i>Are you trying to pick on me?</i>

95
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:00,564
<i>Sure, bring it on!</i>

96
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:02,884
<i>What a bunch of scoundrels.</i>

97
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,044
<i>Your mouths reek of gutter oil
when you speak.</i>

98
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:09,705
<i>It's so bad, it pollutes the earth!</i>

99
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,215
Can you get back to work now?

100
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,595
It begins now.

101
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,284
-Your math tutoring.
-I have to go to the bathroom.

102
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:27,925
Then I have to go tell the witch.

103
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:35,005
Open your workbook
to page 29, question five.

104
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:39,075
Based on your IQ level,

105
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,325
we'll start from the basics.

106
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:45,605
Derive the angles
based on the known conditions.

107
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:51,285
<i>Baby, how is the funding going?</i>

108
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:02,525
What the hell?

109
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:05,295
Who told you to use the protractor?

110
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,085
Why can't I?

111
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,845
Situ Feng.

112
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,764
Your IQ level

113
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:15,005
is just like the oxygen in the Himalayas.

114
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,645
-And that is?
-Thin.

115
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,455
I have to rehearse. Bye.

116
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:28,605
Rehearse?

117
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:32,405
<i>When breathing hurts</i>

118
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:38,485
<i>Without you</i>

119
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,164
That was great!

120
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,284
Who would've thought Your Highness

121
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,404
could sing in such a mind-bending way?

122
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,724
You sang so well.

123
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:09,124
You hit those notes of despair and grudge
right to the bone.

124
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,364
-It reminded me when I was 17--
-But

125
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,525
you suggested

126
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,804
for "Breath" to be included
in your new album.

127
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,645
I don't think it fits.

128
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:22,084
Whether it fits the album or not
should be up for discussion.

129
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,444
Why doesn't it fit?

130
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:25,835
Can you tell us why, Ms. Wang?

131
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,035
From my perspective,

132
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,845
you're my product.

133
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,004
I truly appreciate your spirit
of exploration in music.

134
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,764
But you change your style a lot.

135
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,964
Your fans won't stick around

136
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,884
if you don't have a distinct personality.

137
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,044
The competition is so tough now.

138
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,084
It'd be suicidal if you keep doing this.

139
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,244
That was so insightful of you, Ms. Wang.

140
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:48,884
We've wasted so much effort
on your positioning and image.

141
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:52,484
At first, you were going to be
like the ruthless kind of performer.

142
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:55,484
Then all of a sudden,
you're crooning love songs.

143
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:59,545
-Isn't this--
-Can't I just write the songs I like?

144
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,564
I think that

145
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,684
his own works deserve some promotion too.
What do you think, Ms. Wang?

146
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:04,764
As you can see,

147
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,885
our agency takes care of the idols image.

148
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:10,435
Of course you are talented.

149
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,565
But for now,

150
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,045
we need you

151
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,205
to give the market what they want.

152
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,804
You have to take our business
into consideration.

153
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:21,885
But--

154
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,084
Daniel, I need to take this.

155
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,444
You guys go ahead.

156
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:30,445
-Talk to Feng nicely, okay?
-Okay.

157
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:32,885
Hello? Mr. Li.

158
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:37,055
The site for the press conference
is too small.

159
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,575
Don't be discouraged.
I'll try it again for you.

160
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,244
Why are you looking at me?

161
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,484
I'm also in despair.

162
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,455
You saw it!

163
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,805
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:31,255
<i>Ever since then,</i>

165
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,805
<i>I'm being punished</i>

166
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:40,965
<i>When breathing hurts without you</i>

167
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,404
If I have to choose the best one

168
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:49,155
among your compositions,

169
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,235
I'll choose this one.

170
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,115
Is it because of Xinyu?

171
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:57,605
Yes.

172
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:00,445
I wrote this song

173
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,845
just for her.

174
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:06,725
I wish

175
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,525
that she could listen to this.

176
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,644
But the agency won't let me promote it.

177
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,295
If I don't sing it at the party,

178
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,285
then...

179
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,705
I won't get another chance.

180
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:35,845
Situ Feng.

181
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,285
Where are you going so late?

182
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:39,765
To rehearse.

183
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,844
But I need to tutor you for math tonight.

184
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,284
The party is around the corner.

185
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,604
I have to practice my song.

186
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,364
Really? Hurry along then.

187
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:50,644
But don't ever hold up your studies.

188
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,884
We have a math test next week.

189
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:55,324
If you end up at the bottom again,

190
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,964
not only will you embarrass me,

191
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:59,595
but the headlines are going to go,

192
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:03,335
"Up-and-coming Idol Situ Feng
Flunks in College!"

193
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,865
Where are you going?

194
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:09,735
To the classroom.

195
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,125
It's locked. Come with me.

196
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,364
-Hurry.
-What are we doing here?

197
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,165
Gosh. Hurry.

198
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,085
Go in.

199
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,764
Aren't we studying math?
What are we doing here?

200
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,605
We are.

201
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:31,315
It's so peaceful and quiet here,

202
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,945
so it's the best place to study.

203
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,044
SITU FENG CAMPUS DEBUT
AND WORLD EXCLUSIVE PREMIERE

204
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,205
SUPREME MAPLE

205
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:49,925
Up next, presenting the star of today,

206
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:53,125
Situ Feng.

207
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,775
Love you. Go for it.

208
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:59,845
Go for it.

209
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,404
Good evening, everyone.

210
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,085
I am Situ Feng.

211
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:16,885
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

212
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,605
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

213
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,705
<i>Your Highness has arrived</i>

214
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:29,764
<i>There's a cool man at the top</i>

215
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:33,404
<i>Ordinary men should step down</i>

216
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,524
<i>Welcome to my domain</i>

217
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,164
<i>-It won't take you a lot
-Baby!</i>

218
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,964
<i>-A toast and you're my homie
-You're here!</i>

219
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,924
How did you get Feng to come here?

220
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,965
I'm his assistant.

221
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,735
I asked him to come and help
and he agreed to.

222
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,885
Situ Feng!

223
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,764
How much did a ticket cost?

224
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,644
A ticket costs them 1,000 yuan.

225
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,684
And there are 100 of them.

226
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,524
That makes it 100,000 yuan.

227
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:59,164
My evening party will be dazzling
with that amount of money.

228
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,665
-Thank you so much, baby!
-Stop!

229
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,905
<i>Your Highness has arrived</i>

230
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:14,044
<i>There's a cool man at the top</i>

231
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:18,135
<i>Ordinary men should step down</i>

232
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,044
I'll leave this to you.

233
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,165
And Feng too.

234
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,385
-I have to go, bye!
-Okay.

235
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:34,805
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

236
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:44,765
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

237
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,555
Thank you, everyone!

238
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:12,325
Fangfang.

239
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,124
Okay, you've worked hard today.

240
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,724
All the preparations went well.

241
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,285
The school's board looked pleased.

242
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,565
Especially with you both.

243
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:28,055
Thank you for the compliments.

244
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,085
Why aren't you happy?

245
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:45,044
Just don't take into heart
what our boss said.

246
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,804
She's just that kind of person, right?

247
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,684
-The hair is done.
-Okay.

248
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:52,684
The party is about to start.
I'll take you backstage.

249
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:53,525
Okay.

250
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,875
Is everything set?

251
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,545
Don't worry. I'll set it up.

252
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,635
What is set?

253
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,364
Set what up? Who's setting up?
I don't get it!

254
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,444
<i>Up next,</i>

255
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,284
<i>presenting our school's popular idol,
Situ Feng,</i>

256
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:13,764
<i>-to sing us a song.
-Your Highness!</i>

257
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,444
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

258
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:21,565
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

259
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:28,325
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

260
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:34,725
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

261
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,164
What's wrong with him?

262
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:39,875
Why isn't he singing?

263
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,525
What's going on?

264
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,324
-Are you in charge of the microphones?
-Yes.

265
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,644
-Do you know where you put them?
-Yes, they're backstage.

266
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,084
I know where they are. I'll get them.

267
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:54,885
You better find them,
or they'll wreck the stage!

268
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:59,764
What the hell happened?

269
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:00,885
Goodness.

270
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:06,355
I definitely put it here.

271
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,395
Who's there?

272
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,565
Stop!

273
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,484
What are you doing backstage?

274
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:19,365
I...

275
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,085
I didn't take the microphones!

276
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,805
Dalei!

277
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,404
I went to take the microphones.

278
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,525
Suddenly, a heroine appeared.

279
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,564
Then I lost the microphones.

280
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,965
-A heroine?
-Yes.

281
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,044
-I'm sorry!
-Hey, what are you doing?

282
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,005
Wait.

283
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,505
Isn't that Qingqing?

284
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,404
Where is the mic stand?

285
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:58,245
Mic stand?

286
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:02,365
It's me.

287
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,725
I'll be the mic stand.

288
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:06,885
You may start now.

289
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,525
I've never promoted this song before.

290
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:25,164
I'd like to dedicate it

291
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,525
to a special,

292
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:29,525
special person.

293
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,165
I hope you'll like it.

294
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,985
You are all useless!

295
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:47,135
<i>As the ocean falls into deep silence</i>

296
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,204
<i>The wind blows to the bottom of my heart</i>

297
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,444
<i>Looking at you from a distance
In my memories</i>

298
00:19:57,445 --> 00:20:01,404
<i>A familiar figure I see from behind</i>

299
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,585
<i>I didn't manage</i>

300
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:08,265
<i>To grab your hand</i>

301
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:15,885
<i>If I ever see you again</i>

302
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,925
<i>Even if just to say hello</i>

303
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,764
<i>Time will fish me out of the sea</i>

304
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:30,524
<i>While my heart is left adrift</i>

305
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,724
<i>All that's left</i>

306
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:35,044
<i>Is a chill in the air</i>

307
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:39,565
<i>To sigh with me</i>

308
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,755
<i>I took off my hand</i>

309
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,165
<i>And let you go</i>

310
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:55,885
<i>I couldn't pretend that you weren't here</i>

311
00:20:56,925 --> 00:21:00,095
<i>Ever since then,</i>

312
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,925
<i>I'm being punished</i>

313
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:09,245
<i>When breathing hurts without you</i>

314
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:11,564
He's singing so well!

315
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:14,995
<i>I took off my hand</i>

316
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>And let you go</i>

317
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:25,525
<i>I couldn't pretend that you weren't here</i>

318
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:29,085
<i>Ever since then</i>

319
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:32,925
<i>I'm being punished</i>

320
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:39,365
<i>When breathing hurts without you</i>

321
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:44,765
<i>When breathing hurts</i>

322
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:49,245
<i>Without you</i>

323
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,524
Why didn't you follow our plan?

324
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,955
You insisted on singing "Breath"!

325
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:30,425
Never mind.

326
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:32,485
Mei, take him to rest.

327
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:35,525
Damn it.

328
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,645
Hey! Fangfang, listen up--

329
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,805
Done.

330
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,285
Qingqing.

331
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:14,405
What is it?

332
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,325
I...

333
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:19,885
I forgot.

334
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:33,125
Please turn to page 32.

335
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,644
We will continue to talk
about the inscribed circle of triangle

336
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:41,165
and find the radius r
of the inscribed circle

337
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,124
based on the conditional angles
A, I and B.

338
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,644
We've discussed this diagram before,
so it's a common question...

339
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:50,085
Hey, what happened to your hand?

340
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:53,945
It's nothing, it's just a scratch.

341
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,085
What's that?

342
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,165
A band-aid?

343
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:18,805
Yes.

344
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:20,245
For me?

345
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:21,645
Yes.

346
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:33,325
Hey.

347
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,685
Is this a caricature of you?

348
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,165
It looks ugly.

349
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:43,995
-Hey. Give it back if you don't want it.
-I want it.

350
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:46,924
Who on earth would take back

351
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,305
what they just gave to someone?

352
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:53,805
Besides, I hurt my hands because of you.

353
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:58,355
So there's nothing peculiar
about sticking your head on it.

354
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:21,164
Are you humming my song from yesterday?

355
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,185
You picked it up so fast.

356
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:32,245
Who told you to keep the melody so simple?

357
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:35,465
Of course I'd pick it up fast.

358
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,325
Is something wrong with me?

359
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:51,525
It's 120 beats per minute?

360
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,085
Qingqing.

361
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,325
What's wrong?

362
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:01,285
I don't know what's going on.

363
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:04,565
My heart is beating strangely lately.

364
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,645
Sometimes, it throbs so fast.

365
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,085
Isn't there anyone you like?

366
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,205
Fangfang.

367
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:14,284
You have got to be kidding me.

368
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:16,925
I'm Chen Qingqing. Who do I like?

369
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:20,004
I'm about to go out.

370
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,044
Do you want me to buy something?

371
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,285
No, thanks.

372
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,685
He's so handsome.

373
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:00,245
Situ Feng!

374
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,164
The comic has got a new update.

375
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:10,924
Let's see how badly
he disses His Highness this time.

376
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:11,965
He says,

377
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:14,644
"His Highness sang a song of resentment."

378
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:17,825
And the lyrics sounds a lot like "Breath."

379
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:21,315
How about we upload
a recording of that song

380
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:24,215
-and see what the fans think?
-Yeah.

381
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:29,665
SITU FENG NEW SONG
"BREATH" IS SO PLEASANT.

382
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,324
<i>Since it's so well-received...</i>

383
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,484
We'll include "Breath"
into your upcoming album.

384
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:42,684
<i>Look at yourself.</i>

385
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:45,644
<i>Do you really think you could be
in Situ Feng's music video?</i>

386
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:47,884
This is Situ Feng's music video?

387
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:51,644
Are you not aware that they're looking
for someone with outstanding qualities?

388
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,564
<i>Qualities?</i>

389
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:56,495
<i>I have them.</i>

390
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,444
<i>So what if you've got so many supporters?</i>

391
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:02,404
<i>You can't even eat a bar of chocolate.</i>

392
00:28:02,405 --> 00:28:04,284
If you help me run errands...

393
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:09,324
<i>You could eat plenty of snacks.
Nobody would notice.</i>

394
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,575
