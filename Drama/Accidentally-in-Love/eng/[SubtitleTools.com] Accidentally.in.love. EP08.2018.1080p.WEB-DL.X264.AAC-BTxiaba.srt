EPISODE 8

2
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:57,824
<i>Situ Feng is so stingy.</i>

3
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,624
<i>Even the filming
of the music video is done at school.</i>

4
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:06,824
<i>What am I going to do
if someone recognizes me?</i>

5
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,984
The female lead is here.

6
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,385
-Hello.
-Hello.

7
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,384
-Let's go to the dressing room.
-All right.

8
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,584
Daniel, the female lead is here.

9
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,264
-Qingchen, you're here.
-I'll leave her to you.

10
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,304
Where's Situ Feng?

11
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,104
What's going on?
Even the female lead is here.

12
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,104
Look at her, Mei.

13
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:25,304
This is the music video's main actress
who's perfect in terms of acting skills

14
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:26,344
-and appearances.
-Hello.

15
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,584
Come here, everyone.

16
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,024
Please get to know the female lead.

17
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,304
All of you must have synergy
to create a good music video.

18
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:32,145
Hello.

19
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,675
What's with the scarf?

20
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:39,905
It was raining when I was coming here.

21
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,384
It's for me to cover
my hair from the rain.

22
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,895
-I see.
-You can remove it now.

23
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,015
Take it off.

24
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,415
Take it off.

25
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,185
It's you.

26
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,465
Hello.

27
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:20,865
Nanxi.

28
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:24,545
Nanxi.

29
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,505
Xinya.

30
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:28,745
You two...

31
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,135
Do you know each other?

32
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:33,145
Well, we've met once.

33
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:34,785
Hello.

34
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,704
When did you arrive?

35
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:38,784
This is our female lead, Qingchen.

36
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,125
Isn't she great?

37
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:41,305
Hello.

38
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:44,345
-Hello.
-Situ Feng.

39
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,545
Excuse me.

40
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,195
I think I should fix my makeup.

41
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,865
Sure.

42
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:54,584
Please excuse me.

43
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:57,264
Well, let's go through the script, okay?

44
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:00,024
-Come, let's go through it.
-All right, let's go.

45
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,245
Let's go, Mei.

46
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,624
I'm the Head of Entertainment
for Ming De College Student Council.

47
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,585
I'm here to provide aid.

48
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:14,435
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

49
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,545
You...

50
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,015
What's the color of your lipstick?

51
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,575
It's gorgeous.

52
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:30,024
Why is everyone so polite to me recently?

53
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:30,985
Right here.

54
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,104
This is the storyboard
for today's music video.

55
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,315
All of you can take a look.

56
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,265
Qingchen.

57
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,984
After this, we have a piano scene.

58
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:44,745
You don't have to actually play it.

59
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,065
Qingchen.

60
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,144
If you don't know how to play it,
I can teach you.

61
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:55,445
You should at least know
the basics if you want to act.

62
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:56,425
Hey!

63
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,805
I think I never said that
I can't play the piano.

64
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,225
My goodness.

65
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,024
I can't believe that you're so good at it.

66
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,625
A German classic,

67
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:23,785
Brahms's "Hungarian Dances No. 5".

68
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,345
Situ Feng.

69
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:30,224
Why are you filming the music video
on my birthday?

70
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,425
I don't care.

71
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,785
You and Nanxi!

72
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,704
Both of you need to celebrate my birthday.

73
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,064
Xinya, why don't you rest at home?

74
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,944
After we finish our filming,
let's watch a movie together.

75
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,304
You must keep your promise then.

76
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:45,265
Of course.

77
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,305
-Bye.
-Bye.

78
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,024
I think you will definitely

79
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,984
be the first generation
of a well-rounded artist

80
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,864
if you join our agency now.

81
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:00,985
Nanxi.

82
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:02,104
What are you looking at?

83
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,695
You're so into her.

84
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,155
She's the girl
I met at the wedding last time.

85
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,944
There were so many girls back then.

86
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:13,265
Why are you interested in her?

87
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,425
No, I just find her interesting.

88
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:18,985
Interesting?

89
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,704
With the agency's resources,
we can make a film just for you.

90
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:23,595
She's a bit interesting.

91
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,475
Aren't you only interested in Qingqing?

92
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,225
No way!

93
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,264
How is that possible?

94
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:35,675
Even someone who is picking
her nose is prettier than her.

95
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,904
The director is here.
This is our director.

96
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,384
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

97
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:45,984
For this music video,
it's about a tormenting love.

98
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:49,144
Situ Feng and Qingchen
is a couple who just broke up.

99
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,664
Situ Feng, you're trying to make her stay.

100
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:54,384
The two of you will look at each other
right next to the piano.

101
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:57,545
But Qingchen shows a determined face.

102
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,064
Okay, you two should rehearse.

103
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,325
Get to know each other first.

104
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,635
Let's go over there.

105
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,665
Well, Qingchen.

106
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:28,075
This is your first filming, right?
You can ask me if you have any questions.

107
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,555
Do you have any questions?

108
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,545
No.

109
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:35,775
I just want to say.

110
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,095
All the tabloids mentioned that

111
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,424
you're a cold-hearted king.

112
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:44,984
But I can't believe that
you're quite friendly

113
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:46,704
towards girls in real life.

114
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,705
Actually, I don't really talk to girls.

115
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:50,784
It's just that...

116
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:51,905
What is it?

117
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:54,595
It's nothing.

118
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:58,344
When we're filming,
you need to think about your sad memories

119
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,365
so that you'll feel down.

120
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,095
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

121
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:09,035
Did you notice that
Situ Feng's isn't as cold as usual?

122
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,545
I think I saw him smiling.

123
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:12,895
Am I dreaming?

124
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:14,905
No, you're right.

125
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,665
I noticed it too.

126
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:19,585
Three, two, one.

127
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,645
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

128
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:39,584
<i>You were so mean to me
when I was Chen Qingqing.</i>

129
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:43,544
<i>Now that I look beautiful,
you're trying to make a move.</i>

130
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,415
<i>Go to hell!</i>

131
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:48,985
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,625
Are you okay, Situ Feng?

133
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:53,824
I'm fine, sir.

134
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,155
All right, let's do it again.

135
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,585
I'm sorry, sir.

136
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,195
Let's do it again.

137
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,305
-That's all for now.
-I'm sorry.

138
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:19,785
Okay.

139
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:21,655
Let's take a break.

140
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:28,865
I was...

141
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,575
Why were you so careless just now?

142
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,655
You always put your foot below mine.

143
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,184
I'll get a glass of water for you.

144
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:39,504
<i> Despicable!</i>

145
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:44,655
<i>You always forced me to get water for you.</i>

146
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:47,024
I have a sensitive stomach.

147
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,904
I can't drink cold water.

148
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,984
All right, I'll get hot water for you.

149
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,685
Sorry for the trouble.

150
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:03,985
Mr. Situ Feng.

151
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,985
Do you want me to burn my tongue?

152
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,475
I'll get a warm water then.

153
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,545
Thank you.

154
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,335
You don't look like a local.

155
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,565
I'm from Jincheng.

156
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,385
I just came here.

157
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:35,144
I believe you haven't had time
to tour around Yuncheng.

158
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,905
Yuncheng is really fun.

159
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,385
Really?

160
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,264
You'll know it when I bring you out.

161
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,504
You know my friend, Nanxi.

162
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:43,625
Don't you?

163
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,504
Cut! That's all for today!

164
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,515
Thanks for your hard work.

165
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,464
Thanks for your hard work.

166
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,664
I can't believe that
you can play the piano well.

167
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,104
I heard you're from another city.

168
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:01,425
If there's a chance, I'll show you around.

169
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,704
There's no need.

170
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:06,544
I'm just having a short layover
before continuing my travel.

171
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,685
I'll leave after some time.

172
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,824
-Actually--
-It's okay.

173
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,775
I got her contact number.

174
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,725
I'll add you on WeChat.

175
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:18,575
For courtesy, we'll show you around.

176
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:21,265
-Yes.
-Since you insist...

177
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:23,945
All right.

178
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,865
My goodness!

179
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,384
I don't know who leaked the news.

180
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,224
Your fans have gathered outside.

181
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,904
I don't think they'll leave
if they don't see you.

182
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:33,264
What should we do?

183
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,545
What can we do?

184
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,824
We promised to watch a movie with Xinya.

185
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:39,544
If your fans discover us, it'll be...

186
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,135
Why don't you leave

187
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,464
while wearing this outfit?

188
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:44,105
-What?
-Again?

189
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,864
Okay, I'll check the situation first.

190
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,175
You should change your clothes.

191
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,305
Right, Qingchen.

192
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:59,064
I already transferred your pay.
Please check your account.

193
00:12:59,065 --> 00:12:59,984
That was fast.

194
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:01,664
-Yes.
-Didn't you say that

195
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,495
it will take some time?

196
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,024
It's my own money.

197
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:05,945
Yours?

198
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,115
That's right.

199
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,104
The entertainment industry is complicated.

200
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,104
Did you do this for another purpose?

201
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:14,664
Gosh, what are you saying?

202
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:17,264
I knew you need the money
so I wanted to help you.

203
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:20,685
Who knows when will
your payment be approved?

204
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:21,984
Take a look.

205
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,304
I borrowed money from 9FBank app.

206
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,784
Return the money to me
after your payment is approved.

207
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,064
I'll pay back the money then.

208
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,864
The interest is lower
than a credit card's.

209
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,544
Plus, the procedure is simple.

210
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,784
My kindness has gone to waste.
I shouldn't have helped you.

211
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,265
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

212
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,805
Today, we must see

213
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:43,384
the female lead of His Highness's
new music video.

214
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:47,024
That's right! We must judge
whether she's worthy or not.

215
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,115
You're right.

216
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,945
Could that be her?

217
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,864
It looks like her.

218
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,664
Her dress looks the same
from the fan club's morning news.

219
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:57,584
I guess she looks decent enough
not to embarrass His Highness.

220
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:59,415
She looks a bit strong.

221
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:04,225
Is she going
to do anything to His Highness?

222
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,664
She won't. Look at the man next to her.

223
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,144
They look so close.

224
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,304
I think it's her boyfriend.

225
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:11,265
Boyfriend?

226
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:16,025
-We don't have to worry then.
-We don't have to worry then.

227
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:23,064
Qingqing, thank you
for collecting the surgery fee.

228
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,765
But how did you get so much money?

229
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,824
I borrowed it from Situ Feng.

230
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,544
Didn't you say
that you're his fake assistant?

231
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:31,584
What happened?

232
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,785
Why would he lend you money?

233
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,065
You know that

234
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:39,345
Situ Feng is very warmhearted.

235
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,384
Plus, he earns so much money.

236
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,015
This much money is nothing to him.

237
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:48,225
But the money is life-saving to me.

238
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,584
I must thank him tomorrow.

239
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:51,064
That's not necessary, Fangfang.

240
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,344
You know it too, don't you?

241
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:56,085
Situ Feng won't admit that
he has helped others.

242
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:56,945
Right?

243
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,105
Fangfang.

244
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:19,255
Aren't you the guy
who stole the microphone?

245
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,224
Dalei, it seems like she recognizes me.

246
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:24,304
In case she knows that we're from Class 4,
will she inform our teacher?

247
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,224
Will the school expel us?

248
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,505
You're so dumb!

249
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:29,464
If you don't tell her
that we're from Class 4,

250
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,624
how could she know
that we're from Class 4?

251
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,864
Right, don't you dare say
that our boss is from Class 3.

252
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:38,064
Right, I can't tell her
that our boss is from Class 3.

253
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:40,745
Hey, idiots!

254
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:43,185
We're from the same school.

255
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,895
Can't you do everything in secret?

256
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,145
Chen Qingqing.

257
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:50,315
Why are you so afraid?

258
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,755
I just wanted to ask you out.

259
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,544
You won't reject me, right?

260
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:55,585
Yiyang!

261
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,704
Why did you bring us here?

262
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,144
We don't have any grudges with you.

263
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,305
Why won't you let us go?

264
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,744
Who brought her here?

265
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,265
Look at her, sir.

266
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:11,144
She's Qingqing's best friend,
Zhang Fangfang.

267
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:15,424
It's like "Buy one, free one."
I took her in case you needed her.

268
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,945
"Buy one free one"?

269
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:18,464
Did I give you the permission?

270
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:20,975
Do you think this is McDonald's?

271
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,105
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:34,584
I just want to use both of you
to meet an old friend, Situ Feng.

273
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,984
You won't mind, right?

274
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:40,165
You took us here so that Situ Feng
comes and save us?

275
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,024
Yiyang, I'm telling you.

276
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,944
Don't dream about it! It's impossible!

277
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,265
Situ Feng is a playboy.

278
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,144
He doesn't have the time for us.

279
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,425
We'll see later

280
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,995
whether he has the time or not.

281
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,105
Hello?

282
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,425
Situ Feng.

283
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:14,224
<i>I heard you're close with your deskmate.</i>

284
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,625
What do you want?

285
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,715
Qingqing is with me now.

286
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,495
She doesn't...

287
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:25,905
Look good.

288
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:28,144
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

289
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,605
Have you gone mad?

290
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:31,705
Let's have a chat

291
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,245
at Xiqiaotou Amusement Park.

292
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:36,555
If you don't come,

293
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,304
I can't guarantee Qingqing's safety.

294
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:43,365
You're dead if you touch
even a strand of her hair.

295
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,424
What's the matter?

296
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,295
Yiyang kidnapped Qingqing.

297
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:51,755
I'm coming with you!

298
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:56,505
Yiyang!

299
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:58,505
Hey, Yiyang!

300
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:01,525
Why are you doing this to Situ Feng?

301
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:05,144
Didn't you say that he won't come for you?

302
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,505
Cut the crap!

303
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,655
Nobody will get hurt if you cooperate.

304
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,105
I'm scared, Qingqing.

305
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,024
Don't be afraid, Fangfang.

306
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,504
Don't worry, I'm here.

307
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,344
Nothing will happen to us.

308
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,985
If they hurt us,

309
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:36,264
I won't let him go even if I'm dead.

310
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:39,465
Dalei, why don't we let them go?

311
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:42,344
Did you hear what she said?
She won't let us go even if she's dead.

312
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,705
Can you two cut it out?

313
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:48,505
You can either let us go

314
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,985
or operate this machine for us to enjoy.

315
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,464
All right. You want to play, right?

316
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:56,615
I'll let you two enjoy it.

317
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,965
Let me check your safety belts.

318
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:04,985
Let me tell you something.
Safety belts aren't safe.

319
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:06,864
When I was a child,

320
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,744
originally, I had an IQ of 250.

321
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,445
After that, while I was on a bus--

322
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,185
Let me go!

323
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,015
I'll let you fully enjoy it.

324
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:26,825
Hello?

325
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:30,065
Dalei! Don't mess with it!

326
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:33,505
<i>Stop it right now!</i>

327
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,464
<i>Stop it!</i>

328
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,295
All right, wait for me!

329
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,065
Ye Bei!

330
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,305
Dalei!

331
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,595
Hang on, I'll save you now.

332
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,065
Hurry!

333
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,265
You...

334
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,224
That's too dangerous!

335
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:10,135
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,105
Let's go.

337
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,375
WORK IN PROGRESS

338
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:17,745
Hang on.

339
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,485
Let's go in.

340
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,875
Where's Qingqing?

341
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:51,145
Your Highness.

342
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,175
Why are you so nervous?

343
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,424
Are you so worried about your girlfriend?

344
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,345
Yiyang.

345
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,544
Qingqing isn't my girlfriend.

346
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:00,515
Let her go.

347
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,024
Don't hurt the innocent.

348
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,184
If there's any problem, come at me.

349
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,105
Innocent?

350
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,664
Isn't Xinyu innocent as well?

351
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:10,784
For knowing a killer like you.

352
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:11,705
Yiyang!

353
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,744
It wasn't Situ Feng's fault.

354
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:15,205
Shut up, Gu Nanxi!

355
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,184
You're a goody-two-shoes
who acts nice to everyone.

356
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:21,144
-Are you getting used to being a dog--
-Yiyang!

357
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:22,744
I'll admit that it was my fault.

358
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,104
Don't drag others into this mess.

359
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,735
All right. You'll admit it, right?

360
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,984
Yet, you continue to be an idol.

361
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:30,944
You're still the descendant
of Situ family!

362
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:33,544
How can you say that you admit it?

363
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:37,704
You even used Xinyu to write a song.
Don't think that I don't know about it!

364
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,045
Let me tell you.

365
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:40,885
As long as I'm alive,

366
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,864
don't think of escaping
from the sins you have committed.

367
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you want to do?

368
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,325
Don't ever sing "Breath" again.

369
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,865
Xinyu's death was my fault.

370
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,745
I'll always owe her my entire life.

371
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,745
Yiyang, let me make it clear for you.

372
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,345
I will never owe you!

373
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:11,205
Qingqing doesn't owe you too!

374
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,535
Because of Xinyu,
you can't live like nothing has happened.

375
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:20,835
You keep on mentioning Qingqing.
Do you deserve that?

376
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:23,425
Stop it, Yiyang!

377
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,144
What's the point of hurting yourself
and Situ Feng?

378
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,265
None of you can live your lives normally.

379
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,184
Do you have a conscience?

380
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,864
He caused Xinyu's death!

381
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,424
How can I let him go?

382
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,745
It's Xinyu!

383
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:41,565
-It was just an accident!
-Get out of the way!

384
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:43,905
Yiyang!

385
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,645
Let go of him!

386
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,425
Situ Feng!

387
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:07,825
Get off of him!

388
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,785
Sir, Qingqing ran away.

389
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:18,464
-What?
-I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry!

390
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:22,024
-Chase after her!
-But she went into Hauntedland.

391
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,995
I'm scared.

392
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:27,304
Are you afraid of me?

393
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,744
Yes, but I'm more afraid of Hauntedland.

394
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:30,705
How useless!

395
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,345
Let's find her.

396
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,025
Situ Feng!

397
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:39,544
I'm warning you.

398
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,305
What happened today can happen again.

399
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:56,365
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

400
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:57,545
I'm scared.

401
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,655
Don't worry, Fangfang. Stay with me.

402
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,665
We'll be fine.

403
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,995
Fangfang, I think
there's an exit in front.

404
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,065
Qingqing!

405
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,505
Qingqing!

406
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,015
Where are you?

407
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,145
I'm scared.

408
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:45,625
Here.

409
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,824
Nanxi, go to that side.
I'll go to this side.

410
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:49,864
Let's meet at the exit.

411
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:50,985
All right.

412
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,105
Qingqing!

413
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:55,305
Qingqing!

414
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:12,665
Qingqing!

415
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,625
WORK IN PROGRESS

416
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:29,385
What a heroic act.

417
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:32,024
Why weren't you this brave back then?

418
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:34,584
-Yiyang, get out of the way.
-Where do you think you are?

419
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:37,504
Is this your house?
You can't leave as you please.

420
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:38,824
What do you want?

421
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:42,104
For Lan Xinyu,
you dragged an outsider into this mess.

422
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,024
It's pointless after all.

423
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:47,515
It's because she has
a relationship with you.

424
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,505
I can let her go today.

425
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:51,425
But

426
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:54,265
you must do what you promised.

427
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:57,265
Okay, I promise you.

428
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:13,055
Who is it?

429
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:14,105
It's me.

430
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:16,465
Yiyang?

431
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,125
What's the matter?

432
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:23,765
I sprained my ankle.

433
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,965
Give me your hand.

434
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,215
Don't waste time.
I'll bring you out of here.

435
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,735
Hang in there.

436
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,085
Get on the motorcycle.

437
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,455
You can put your arms around me.

438
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:22,905
Hello? Nanxi. I've saved Qingqing.

439
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,805
Wait for us outside.

440
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:28,145
This guy, Yiyang...

441
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:30,965
Is his brain flooded with powder?

442
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:42,065
Qingqing!

443
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:43,025
Qingqing!

444
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,785
Chen Qingqing.

445
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,505
You were awake just now, weren't you?

446
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,065
Chen Qingqing!

447
00:27:58,505 --> 00:27:59,345
Situ Feng?

448
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,045
Where is this place?

449
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:03,435
A Ferris wheel?

450
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,864
Wasn't I at Hauntedland just now?

451
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,885
Why am I here, Situ Feng?

452
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:11,435
Your acting is too much.

453
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,305
Let me take a look, Situ Feng.

454
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:19,135
What happened to your face?

455
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,735
I'm fine. How are you feeling?

456
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,545
I'm fine.

457
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,064
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

458
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,655
Let me take a look.

459
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,944
Thank goodness you didn't lie to me.

460
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:35,755
Don't you know that
you're being rude right now?

461
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:41,205
Do you know that it's rude to talk to me
because you're so short?

462
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,475
Come over here.

463
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,265
What do you want?

464
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:51,544
What's wrong?

465
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,344
Are you that great
just because you're tall?

466
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,504
Can you simply squeeze
my face just because you're tall?

467
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:58,015
Stop fooling around.

468
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:05,195
Do you still want to take advantage of me?

469
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:08,115
No one was taking advantage of you!

470
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:09,625
Qingqing.

471
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:11,544
I told you not to touch me.

472
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:13,464
-What's wrong?
-It's my fault for falling down.

473
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,704
Mind your own business!

474
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,984
Let me take a look. Don't move.

475
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,145
Get up first.

476
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,105
Can you get up?

477
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:24,504
Did you sprain your ankle?

478
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:25,744
Why are you so careless?

479
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,815
-Be gentle.
-Let me check.

480
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:30,264
You're always so careless.

481
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:31,105
So sloppy.

482
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,105
It hurts.

483
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:38,985
Does it still hurt?

484
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:45,005
Does it feel better?

485
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,784
I drove all over Yuncheng

486
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:03,584
to find an unattractive person like you.

487
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:04,984
Are you saying that I'm ugly?

488
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:06,785
Hey, you're so rough.

489
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,704
How would I know that you're so weak?

490
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,344
You fainted because you were scared.

491
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:12,104
It wasn't because I was scared.

492
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:15,225
I fainted because I fell down.

493
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:20,824
So you're not a coward,
but you lack the sense of balance.

494
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,424
You're strong-willed,
but your body is weak.

495
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,375
Who are you calling weak?

496
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:26,944
You're doing it again.

497
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,665
I'm sorry.

498
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,984
Stop fooling around. I'll send you home.

499
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:35,505
It's swollen.

500
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,745
Can you still walk?

501
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:39,985
I can't.

502
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,915
I'll carry you then.

503
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,785
Get on me.

504
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:29,544
Will anyone still believe
the words of a liar?

505
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:32,605
I'll tell everyone about your evil deed.

506
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,745
Why is it locked?

507
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:40,984
Did you know Lan Xinyu?

508
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:41,825
Hey!

509
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:45,424
<i>Don't meddle in other people's affairs,
especially in this matter!</i>

510
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,304
I don't want to release this song.

511
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,424
I'll bear the consequences myself.

512
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,784
You look so pretty today, Qingchen.

513
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,784
<i>Yes, we're friends.</i>

514
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,664
<i>So are you only friends
with beautiful girls?</i>

515
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,704
<i>Who is Qingqing to you then?</i>

516
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:01,375
