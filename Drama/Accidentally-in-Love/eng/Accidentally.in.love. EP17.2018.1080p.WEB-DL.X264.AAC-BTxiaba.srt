EPISODE 17

2
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,404
When I was little,

3
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,045
my mom gave me this guitar pick.

4
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,684
<i>I turned it into a necklace,
hoping it'd bring me good luck.</i>

5
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,724
<i>Now, I'm giving it to you.</i>

6
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,465
<i>Thank you, Situ Feng.</i>

7
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,525
<i>I promise to cherish it for you.</i>

8
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,065
Chen Qingqing!

9
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,084
Did you celebrate your birthday
with Feng last night?

10
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,084
So what if I did?

11
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:04,604
How many times have I warned you?

12
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,844
-Don't seduce Feng anymore!
-Hey, Xinya.

13
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,044
What are you doing?

14
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,644
Hey, what's going on?

15
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,644
What are you looking at me for?

16
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:12,485
Feng.

17
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,004
Why did you celebrate her birthday
without telling me?

18
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:16,965
Xinya.

19
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,844
Come on. Qingqing and I--

20
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:20,485
Stop defending her.

21
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:24,365
Chen Qingqing.

22
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,885
You're really, really, really annoying!

23
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:28,845
Xinya.

24
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,675
You've gone too far.

25
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:36,205
You didn't just say that.

26
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:43,485
Xinya.

27
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,765
Yiyang.

28
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:08,404
Xinya, what are you doing here?

29
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:13,915
I used to come here in the past
to watch you and Feng play basketball.

30
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,125
Here.

31
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,844
You still remember
that I liked to drink this?

32
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:29,725
Yes.

33
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,515
In glass bottles.

34
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:37,345
But someone
might've already forgotten about it.

35
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:43,205
Did someone bully you?

36
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:46,685
Do you think

37
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,284
Feng doesn't like me anymore?

38
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:52,965
That's not possible.

39
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:57,964
Then why does he act so indifferent
toward me?

40
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:00,385
I won the Miss Campus contest.

41
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:04,305
He had no intention to celebrate with me.

42
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:06,405
Instead, he was worried

43
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:10,095
about Chen Qingqing's birthday.

44
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,275
There's more.

45
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,505
He even scolded me
because of Chen Qingqing.

46
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,605
We grew up together.

47
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:26,164
But ever since Chen Qingqing showed up,

48
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,725
we've drifted apart.

49
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:34,185
I feel like I'm such a failure.

50
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,555
Come on, Xinya.

51
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:42,065
Stop crying.

52
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,804
-We need to get water.
-That's right.

53
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:02,985
Chen Qingqing!

54
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,845
-Lin Yiyang.
-Lin Yiyang.

55
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:09,665
What do you want?

56
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,165
I'm warning you.

57
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,484
Stay away from Situ Feng from now on.

58
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,485
Hey.

59
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,095
Your words were rather confusing.

60
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:19,524
Why should I stay away from him?

61
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,164
Stop pretending, all right?

62
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,924
Everyone knows that you two are close.

63
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,324
Whatever goes on between us
is none of your business.

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,644
Xinya's business is my business.

65
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,964
I'm not going to let her get hurt.

66
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,804
It's about Lan Xinya again.

67
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,855
You guys are so annoying.

68
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:35,444
I'm not in the mood to deal with her.

69
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,065
Fangfang, let's go.

70
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,085
Hey, Lin Yiyang!

71
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,044
Stop it. This might just
be a misunderstanding.

72
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,465
This is none of your business.

73
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,645
Hey.

74
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,524
Isn't this Situ Feng's necklace?

75
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:53,604
Why is it with you?

76
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,785
Who says you can touch it?

77
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:59,205
Hey.

78
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,245
Qingqing!

79
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,005
Qingqing.

80
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,285
Qingqing.

81
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,385
-Are you all right?
-My neck.

82
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,945
Let's go to the infirmary.

83
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,435
Fangfang, the necklace.

84
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,285
Goodness.

85
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,875
Is it really that serious?

86
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:35,005
Do I need to wear this?

87
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,564
Don't touch it.

88
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,924
Just stay here and get some rest.
Don't worry.

89
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:40,245
I'm all right.

90
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,965
I'll be alive and kicking

91
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:46,265
after I get this damn thing off tomorrow.

92
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:50,615
How could you still be laughing
after what happened?

93
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,525
By the way, Fangfang,

94
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,404
you can't let Situ Feng know
about what happened.

95
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,484
More importantly,
you must not let him know

96
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,284
that this has something to do
with Lin Yiyang.

97
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,924
I'm scared that he might start a fight
with Lin Yiyang.

98
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:06,325
-We must keep it from him--
-Chen Qingqing.

99
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:08,844
What happened?

100
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,004
How did you get hurt?

101
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,204
It was an accident.

102
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,045
I fell.

103
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,684
Was it an accident? Look at you.

104
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,565
I really did fall.

105
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:20,044
Tell me. Was it Lin Yiyang?

106
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,085
No.

107
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,964
This has nothing to do with Lin Yiyang.

108
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:24,805
I see.

109
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:27,075
Hey, Situ Feng.

110
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,425
Situ Feng!

111
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,924
Ye Bei, look at this new equipment
that I got.

112
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:35,965
Dalei.

113
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,244
A petrol tank.

114
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,564
This is dangerous.

115
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:39,485
Look.

116
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:40,955
This is helium.

117
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,524
It will create a magical effect
when people inhale it.

118
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,885
What kind of magical effect?

119
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,725
If people inhale this gas,

120
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,244
their voice will sound especially funny.

121
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:58,085
And they will also feel drowsy.

122
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,284
Who knows what might happen

123
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:02,575
when people are fuzzy-headed?

124
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,685
Be quiet!

125
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:24,365
Lin Yiyang!

126
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,605
Lin Yiyang!

127
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:31,644
-Situ Feng, what are you doing here?
-Cut the crap.

128
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:35,004
Didn't I tell you?
Don't lay your hands on Chen Qingqing.

129
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,564
There's no need to reason

130
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,764
with someone like you.

131
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,835
Is that so?

132
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,315
I'm not going to reason with you either.

133
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,924
Dalei, Yiyang is fighting with Situ Feng.

134
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,545
Should we help him?

135
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,404
Yiyang is strong.

136
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:58,865
He will definitely
take him down right away.

137
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:11,924
Yiyang, I've got him.

138
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,045
Hurry up. He's all yours.

139
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,845
I'm the one you want.

140
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,965
Hey, Ye Bei, Dalei!

141
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,764
They must have done something wrong.

142
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,444
How could you say that in front of us?

143
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:44,475
Can't you speak Mandarin?
What the hell? Let's go.

144
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,045
Hey!

145
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,545
Stop fighting!

146
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,775
Lin Yiyang, knock it off.

147
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,125
Qingqing.

148
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,324
You shouldn't be here.
Your neck is injured.

149
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,285
I'm fine.

150
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,965
Situ Feng.

151
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,204
I'm teaching you a lesson
in front of Qingqing.

152
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,925
Lin Yiyang, you must apologize now.

153
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,495
Apologize? No way!

154
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,995
Qingqing, what's going on?

155
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,284
I have no idea.

156
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,365
I know.

157
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,405
That tank.

158
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:19,385
That tank is leaking.

159
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,404
It must contain helium.

160
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,765
That's why our voice changed.

161
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,084
Inhaling too much of it
will cause hypoxia.

162
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,684
That's right. What should we do?

163
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,165
Hey, Situ Feng!

164
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:54,965
Fangfang!

165
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,085
Fangfang!

166
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:58,404
Are you all right, Fangfang?

167
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:00,525
Situ Feng.

168
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:03,124
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand.

169
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,085
Fangfang.

170
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:06,525
Fangfang.

171
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,324
What are you waiting for?

172
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,325
Situ Feng!

173
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,345
Situ Feng!

174
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,325
Fangfang, hang in there.

175
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,445
<i>Zhang Fangfang.</i>

176
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,255
<i>Why did you help me</i>

177
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:31,805
<i>that time?</i>

178
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,645
Lin Yiyang.

179
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,484
Since you're awake,
would you like something to eat?

180
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,445
No.

181
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:48,465
Suit yourself.

182
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:53,605
Qingqing.

183
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,605
Did I wake you up?

184
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,065
It's all right.

185
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:58,385
What happened?

186
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,004
It's nothing serious.

187
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,404
You hurt your arm.

188
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,844
But don't worry.
The doctor has taken care of it.

189
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:04,884
All you need to do now

190
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:07,284
is to get lots of rest
and change the dressing frequently.

191
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:09,604
You will be fine in two days.

192
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,605
Let me help you get up.

193
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,444
I've bought you something to eat.

194
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:14,725
Eat slowly.

195
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:26,495
Don't ever do that again. It's dangerous.

196
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,284
Shouldn't someone show gratitude

197
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:31,525
to his lifesaver

198
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,915
since she's awake now?

199
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:44,875
Have some more.

200
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,075
Yiyang, are you all right?

201
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,604
I came here as soon as I heard
that you're in the hospital.

202
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,545
I'm fine. Don't worry.

203
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,884
Why are you two here?

204
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,425
Because we had to rescue Yiyang.

205
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,004
Why don’t you ask him?

206
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:02,885
Yiyang.

207
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,585
What happened?

208
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:08,084
It's hard to explain everything now.

209
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,395
Have some more.

210
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,985
Zhang Fangfang, did you do it on purpose?

211
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,444
Does she have a thing for you, Yiyang?

212
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,615
What are you talking about?

213
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,164
Lan Xinya, stop talking nonsense.

214
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,124
Believe it or not, I will throw you out.

215
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,884
Would you hurt yourself
in order to rescue someone?

216
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,324
Well, some poor people
like to extort money from others.

217
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,164
They find wealthy people
and blackmail them.

218
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,564
Just tell us how much money you want.

219
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,604
Stop being pretentious.

220
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:36,524
-Xinya.
-I'm not.

221
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,845
Lan Xinya, get out now!

222
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:40,765
Xinya.

223
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,905
Let's go for a walk.

224
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,345
Give me a hand.

225
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:46,924
Hold on. I'll get a wheelchair.

226
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,965
Fangfang, just ignore her.

227
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,225
<i>How did it go, Gu Nanxi?</i>

228
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,084
Could you get in touch with him?

229
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,924
I've already called him several times.

230
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,564
I couldn't get hold of him.

231
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,165
What happened to Situ Feng today?

232
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,564
Did he merely get into a fight
with Lin Yiyang?

233
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,044
Yes. By the time I got there,

234
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,924
the two of them
had already started fighting.

235
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,244
Then, Fangfang got hurt.

236
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,684
I told him to give me a hand.

237
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,404
Later, I took Fangfang to the hospital.

238
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:16,044
I tried to contact him afterward,
but I couldn't reach him at all.

239
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,284
So I immediately called you.

240
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:20,524
When you were there,
did you notice anything unusual?

241
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,565
There was nothing unusual.

242
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,244
There was a lot of helium in the room.

243
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,644
If people breathe in too much helium,
they'll suffer from hypoxia.

244
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,245
-Hypoxia?
-Yes.

245
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,495
That's it.

246
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:36,395
What is it?

247
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,045
Gu Nanxi.

248
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,044
You know something, don't you?

249
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:41,925
Tell me.

250
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:46,564
Qingqing, we need to find Situ Feng
as soon as possible.

251
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,204
This isn't the first time he disappeared.

252
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,764
The last time he disappeared,

253
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,444
He was gone for three days.

254
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,604
We couldn't find him anywhere.

255
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,124
We didn't know what he went through.

256
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,844
He passed out as soon as he came back.

257
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,645
How could that happen?

258
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,805
Me, Situ Feng,

259
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,005
Lin Yiyang...

260
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:07,325
We were childhood friends.

261
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,335
At that time, we had another friend.

262
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,665
It was Lan Xinya's sister.

263
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,044
Her name was Lan Xinyu.

264
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,204
-Lan Xinyu?
-That's right.

265
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:21,525
Situ Feng and Lan Xinyu had an accident.

266
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:24,964
The two of them fell into the water.

267
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,045
Situ Feng was rescued,

268
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,565
but Xinyu wasn't.

269
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,925
Later, Situ Feng disappeared

270
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,385
from Xinyu's funeral.

271
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,244
-You said that he might have hypoxia?
-Yes.

272
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,804
The situation might be similar
to drowning.

273
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,924
It could have reminded him of the trauma.

274
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,215
Would he do something stupid?

275
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,124
We should go look for Situ Feng now.

276
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,564
Do you know where he might go?

277
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,884
-I don't know.
-You two grew up together.

278
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,324
Was there a place where you used to go
all the time?

279
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,495
Think about it really hard.

280
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:01,905
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

281
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:03,955
<i>You have to be safe.</i>

282
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:15,085
Situ Feng, give me a hand.

283
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:16,525
<i>Qingqing, I...</i>

284
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:36,245
Gu Nanxi.

285
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,324
-Let's go.
-Not just yet.

286
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:39,244
Hold on a second.

287
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,004
I've asked a friend to come help us.

288
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,284
It's better to be discreet
about this matter.

289
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,604
I called Hua Munian. He's very reliable.

290
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,405
Baby, I'm here.

291
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,535
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,875
I take back what I've said.

293
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,564
-Hey.
-Come here.

294
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:55,964
What's wrong with you?

295
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:57,844
Why did you bring
that troublemaker with you?

296
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,565
It's not my fault.

297
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,444
She was in the office when you called me.

298
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:03,764
She threatened to tell everyone.

299
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:07,415
-There was nothing I could do.
-What the hell?

300
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:09,855
Don't worry.

301
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,604
I didn't tell anyone.

302
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,804
Feng's business is my business.

303
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,244
I will definitely find him.

304
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:17,684
All right. Everyone has arrived.

305
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,564
Then I'll start distributing tasks.

306
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,004
Qingqing and I are a team.

307
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,284
Hua Munian, you'll pair up with Xinya.

308
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:25,764
Let's try to think of all the places
that Situ Feng might go

309
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:28,324
and notify each other
of the places that we've searched.

310
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,724
This will save us a lot of time.
Do you have any questions?

311
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,665
-No.
-No.

312
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:36,235
Gosh. It's rare that you two
can agree on something.

313
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:39,155
-We'll go first.
-Okay.

314
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:44,025
Qingqing, we should get going too.

315
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,645
Just relax.

316
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,835
We will look for him again later.

317
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,635
Did Situ Feng come here often in the past?

318
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,724
This is the only 24-hour coffee shop
in Yuncheng.

319
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:11,085
My sister liked to come here.

320
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:14,865
She introduced this place to Feng and me.

321
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,025
Later, Feng,

322
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:17,724
also took me here.

323
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:20,525
Situ Feng took you on a date here.

324
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,845
How romantic.

325
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:27,525
Xinya.

326
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:30,525
What's the matter? Don't scare me.

327
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:31,805
I know

328
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:35,075
that Feng took me here

329
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:38,324
out of the guilt he felt for my sister.

330
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,844
He wanted to take care of me
for my sister.

331
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,285
It wasn't love.

332
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:49,205
But I've gotten used
to being taken care of.

333
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,005
I can't let him go.

334
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:54,295
I want to be with him forever.

335
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,775
It doesn’t matter,

336
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,164
if he doesn’t like me.

337
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,285
Xinya, you...

338
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,685
Be good. Stop crying.

339
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:20,645
Hello?

340
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,365
We're in a coffee shop.

341
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,055
Where are you?

342
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,005
Not yet.

343
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,405
Hua Munian.

344
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,364
Hurry and finish your drink.
We'll start looking for him again.

345
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:37,525
Roger that.

346
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,085
Qingqing.

347
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,675
You don't look well.

348
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:49,084
Should I take you to the hospital?

349
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,284
That's not necessary.

350
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:51,325
I'm fine.

351
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:58,235
Why don't I take you back to school?

352
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,305
All right.

353
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,204
Don't worry too much about Situ Feng.

354
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,145
I'll find him for you.

355
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,485
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

356
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,125
<i>Where are you?</i>

357
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,205
<i>Are you all right?</i>

358
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:17,965
Feng.

359
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:19,145
Come here.

360
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:22,295
I'll teach you how to play the piano.

361
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:36,805
Xinyu!

362
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,725
Where did you go?

363
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,325
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

364
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,205
Situ Feng.

365
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:16,325
You really are here.

366
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,485
Did you spend the night here?

367
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:27,645
Hey, Situ Feng.

368
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:31,444
You didn't answer my calls
or replied to my messages.

369
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:33,444
Are you seriously going to ignore me?

370
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:34,945
If you ignore me,

371
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,495
I'm going to leave.

372
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,125
Qingqing.

373
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,075
Don't go.

374
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:49,125
Then promise me.

375
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,375
Don't ever disappear again.

376
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,365
Why are your hands so cold?

377
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,655
Here. Drink some hot water.

378
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:16,325
Qingqing.

379
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,195
I didn't mean to do that.

380
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:21,495
Fangfang...

381
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:23,715
How is she?

382
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:26,185
She's in the hospital now.

383
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:30,375
She will have to stay there
for a couple of days.

384
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:32,305
Situ Feng.

385
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,995
When I called for you last night,

386
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:40,215
why did you run away?

387
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:41,445
I...

388
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:45,565
I...

389
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:48,855
I felt like...

390
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,525
I was drowning.

391
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:55,765
Then...

392
00:22:58,725 --> 00:22:59,765
Then...

393
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,125
I...

394
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,485
I saw...

395
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,085
I saw...

396
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:07,445
Lan Xinyu?

397
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,524
When we were looking for you today,

398
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,285
Gu Nanxi told me

399
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:20,305
about the last time you disappeared.

400
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:24,085
Last night,

401
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:27,165
I saw Xinyu.

402
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,845
I was so frightened.

403
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,524
I was the one who hurt her.

404
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:39,515
It was only an illusion.

405
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,204
You didn't hurt anyone.

406
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:42,724
It was an accident.

407
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,045
No, it wasn't.

408
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,375
If I didn't try to be a hero,

409
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,365
Xinyu

410
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:50,945
wouldn't have died.

411
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,245
Feng.

412
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,924
I'm a better driver than you.

413
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,204
I'll drive Xinyu home today.

414
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:04,164
Yiyang, you're being too subjective
about our driving skills.

415
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:06,284
Xinyu should be the one who decides.

416
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,444
I can't make a decision.

417
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,444
Why don't you two fight it out?

418
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:11,964
Whoever wins will drive Xinyu home.

419
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,284
-All right.
-I'll stay with you if I lose.

420
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,205
Sure.

421
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,225
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

422
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,165
I won!

423
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:25,005
Hey!

424
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:26,515
You played dirty!

425
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:40,124
Feng, aren't you driving a bit too fast?

426
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:44,285
It's all right.
There aren't many cars on the road.

427
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:36,745
Situ Feng.

428
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,065
It was an accident.

429
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:44,445
You didn't want that to happen either.

430
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:46,524
I believe that

431
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,404
Lan Xinyu is in heaven now

432
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:50,804
and would want you to live happily.

433
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:53,105
She cared so much about you.

434
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,745
She would only want

435
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:59,204
to leave you with good memories,

436
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,525
not nightmares.

437
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:05,405
Situ Feng.

438
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,255
You know what?

439
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,325
In my heart,

440
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:12,535
you're always a very brave person.

441
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:16,004
You always face difficulties with courage.

442
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:16,965
So,

443
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,975
stop blaming yourself.

444
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:29,265
Chen Qingqing.

445
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:34,135
Will you always stay by my side?

446
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:36,435
Will you never leave me?

447
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,515
I didn't mean to hurt Fangfang.

448
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,015
She's your best friend.

449
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,395
I'm scared.

450
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:57,115
I don't want to lose
the most important person to me again.

451
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,964
That scared the hell out of me.

452
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,215
I didn't know what it was.

453
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:15,265
It probably ran away.

454
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:18,125
Thank God, it's gone.

455
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,405
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

456
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:25,815
This place has a lot of tillandsias.

457
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,204
So there are quite
a lot of spiders around.

458
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:29,335
Do you mind?

459
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,525
What's the meaning of tillandsia?

460
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,505
They are wild plants.

461
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:43,205
They don't have any meanings.

462
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,445
This kind of plant

463
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:49,324
who has broken free
from the constraint of soil

464
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:51,085
deserves a meaning.

465
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:53,805
For example,

466
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:56,505
the pursuit of freedom.

467
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,005
-Freedom?
-Yes.

468
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:03,525
It fits you.

469
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,395
Freedom is wonderful.

470
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:44,484
We're from two different worlds.

471
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,335
We should stay away from each other.

472
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:48,964
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

473
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:51,444
Can you just turn into a ball? Roll out!

474
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,325
I wouldn't let you go

475
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:55,805
because I was too stubborn.

476
00:28:56,525 --> 00:29:00,564
He can't even do a commercial.
How can he earn money for the agency?

477
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,445
Ms. Wang.

478
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:03,225
I will do it.

479
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,764
<i>You'll have to get into the water.</i>

480
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,385
Situ Feng, wake up.

481
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:13,175
<i>I can't lose you.</i>

482
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:14,405
<i>Qingqing!</i>

483
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:18,095
