<i>Later in the afternoon today,</i>

3
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,244
<i>we shall be hearing from Situ Feng</i>

4
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,365
<i>in his press conference.</i>

5
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,084
<i>He will be performing a new song</i>

6
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:44,005
<i>as a rebuttal of his recent rumors
on plagiarism.</i>

7
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,004
<i>Will he be able to live up
to the expectation</i>

8
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,804
<i>and create an excellent song</i>

9
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,844
<i>within a short period of only three days?</i>

10
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:54,884
<i>Let us anticipate the outcome and see
how it is going to affect his career.</i>

11
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:56,364
Please stay tuned.

12
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,535
Follow us for more updates.

13
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,884
Where is Situ Feng?

14
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,084
He's on his way.

15
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:14,085
I'll call him again.

16
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:17,205
Hello?

17
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,565
The line got disconnected.

18
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,895
What is this all about?

19
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:23,924
I've told you.

20
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:26,124
If anything goes wrong
with the press conference,

21
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,164
all of you can stop coming to work!

22
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,005
Of course nothing will go wrong.

23
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:32,445
Damn it.

24
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,244
-Daniel.
-You're here.

25
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,865
Where is Situ Feng?

26
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,555
I can't reach him at all.

27
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,445
Why is this happening?

28
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:45,804
The press conference will commence
in a short while.

29
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,204
Situ Feng and his team, please get ready.

30
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:50,325
You wait here. Let's go.

31
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,005
Hello, everyone.

32
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,684
I'm Daniel and I'm Situ Feng's manager.

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,804
I would like to thank every one of you
who made it here.

34
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:13,765
<i>As you know,
Situ Feng is such a devoted artist.</i>

35
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,765
He has worked so hard for this new album.

36
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,244
<i>Just for your information--</i>

37
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,244
<i>Daniel, can you stop
beating around the bush?</i>

38
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,885
<i>Where is Situ Feng?</i>

39
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:26,524
That's right. Is it because he wasn't able
to produce a new song so he chickened out?

40
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:29,804
<i>Doesn't this mean he is admitting
to the plagiarism rumors?</i>

41
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:31,684
<i>Please give us your honest response.</i>

42
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,645
<i>-Yes.
-Yes.</i>

43
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,924
Calm down, everyone.

44
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,645
We will definitely...

45
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,765
Just, please calm down...

46
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,695
We will give you an honest response.

47
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,044
I knew Situ Feng wouldn't be able
to create a new song within three days.

48
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,365
Sir, we have to celebrate.

49
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,745
-Come.
-Let's make a toast.

50
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,365
-What is this?
-Exactly!

51
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,764
What kind of press conference is this?

52
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:08,315
<i>Situ Feng, I have faith in you.</i>

53
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:12,765
<i>I believe you will come here
and prove everyone wrong.</i>

54
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:18,285
-Can you explain what is happening?
-Who does he think he is?

55
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,045
I knew it. I knew Feng would appear.

56
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:03,825
I'm sorry, sir!

57
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,865
Hello, everyone.

58
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,155
Sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,684
Today's press conference

60
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:15,444
is mainly being held for me
to clarify about the plagiarism rumors.

61
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:20,485
What I want to say is that
I did not plagiarize anyone's song.

62
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,284
As a musician and a songwriter,

63
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:29,795
it's an absolute shame
to plagiarize other people's songs.

64
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,765
Thus, I, Situ Feng

65
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,185
<i>will swear on my name that</i>

66
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:39,564
<i>what is being accused of me is not true.</i>

67
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:42,444
We're now still investigating the matter.

68
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,164
Thus, the main song of the album

69
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:45,964
shall be officially changed

70
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,644
to this new song that I've written

71
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:51,324
which I will be performing it live today.

72
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,695
I hope you will all like it.

73
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:03,575
-Go ahead.
-Hi.

74
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:06,764
I'm sure all of us are aware that
the main song of this album

75
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:10,084
will need to grab the listeners' attention
as soon as they hear it

76
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,524
and it shall determine
the quality of this album.

77
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:15,644
May I know, given the time limit

78
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:18,364
<i>how did you manage to complete the song?</i>

79
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,724
<i>Or was this new song casually written?</i>

80
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,324
Were you just trying to get done it with?

81
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:27,415
I hope you can listen to it
and judge for yourself.

82
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:35,865
<i>Actually, before I came today,
I thought about giving up.</i>

83
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:38,925
To give up clarifying for myself.

84
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,044
But I realized later that

85
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:43,404
this is something very precious to me

86
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,564
and no matter what the outcome is,

87
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,565
I have to try my best.

88
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,205
Hence, I came.

89
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,715
<i>I'm here to prove my love for music.</i>

90
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,665
This song, "To Be Your Love"

91
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,445
was written

92
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:06,645
for someone who has been
supporting me unconditionally.

93
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:10,355
Someone who's very important
and special to me.

94
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:14,475
I hope you will like this song.

95
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:30,685
<i>Lights touched your naughty curls</i>

96
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:34,085
<i>Lights kissed on your rosy cheeks</i>

97
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:39,325
<i>Lights quietly lit up
The freckles on your face</i>

98
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,525
<i>When you feel down</i>

99
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,165
<i>When you couldn't speak</i>

100
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,405
<i>How do I make you smile again</i>

101
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:53,725
<i>Get your cuteness back</i>

102
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:12,765
<i>Turning through the alleys</i>

103
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:14,405
<i>Where we first met</i>

104
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,965
<i>Those absurd moments</i>

105
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,405
<i>What is to be anticipated?</i>

106
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:26,245
<i>Let me stay in your heart</i>

107
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:29,365
<i>You affected me so deeply</i>

108
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,845
<i>I would give you my everything</i>

109
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,285
<i>No matter how it will end</i>

110
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,844
<i>The journey is sweet</i>

111
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:40,285
<i>Let me occupy your love</i>

112
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:43,725
<i>Never say no and hide it</i>

113
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:46,645
<i>I won't hesitate to kiss you</i>

114
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:51,285
<i>You'll be my exclusive sweetheart</i>

115
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,105
Thank you.

116
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,185
-Sir, please wait.
-Sir...

117
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,965
Hang on, everyone.

118
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:35,525
-Daniel, I'll leave this to you.
-No problem, see you then.

119
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,404
You may ask your questions to me.

120
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:40,684
What did you say?

121
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,444
The culprit has been found?

122
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:44,084
Lin Yiyang was the culprit?

123
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,004
What is the official date
of release for the new album?

124
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,325
It'll be soon.

125
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,604
All my dear media representatives,

126
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:54,924
there's an update that the real culprit
of this case has been caught.

127
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:59,205
We can now confirm it was all a setup
from the start.

128
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,065
Are you Lin Yiyang?

129
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:07,004
Who the hell are you?

130
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,444
We're supporters of His Highness.

131
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:12,155
You were the one
who started the rumors, right?

132
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:16,524
Aren't you leaving?

133
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:17,565
Go.

134
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,425
Take care!

135
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:20,565
Hurry.

136
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,484
-Now!
-Let's get him!

137
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:25,165
-Let's get him!
-Let's get him!

138
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,405
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

139
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:39,295
Thanks for your gift yesterday.

140
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:42,525
I thought you were going to ignore me.

141
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,885
Did you like it?

142
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,025
Of course.

143
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:47,845
Well...

144
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,895
How are you going to repay me?

145
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,815
That new song was written for you.

146
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,365
It was great. I loved it.

147
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:58,945
Thank you.

148
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:01,844
I should be the one thanking you.

149
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:02,964
If it weren't for you,

150
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,555
I wouldn't have made it through
that quickly.

151
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,125
Ye Bei, what's wrong?

152
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,685
Situ Feng, your fans are crazy!

153
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,345
Where's Lin Yiyang?

154
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,255
He is stuck back there!

155
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,204
Qingqing, wait for me here.

156
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,005
Be careful, Situ Feng.

157
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,525
-Punch him!
-Kill him!

158
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:04,245
-Punch him!
-Kill him!

159
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,225
-Punch him!
-Carry on!

160
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:20,165
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

161
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:23,565
-Carry on, guys!
-Kill him.

162
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,165
Punch harder!

163
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,684
We will punch you if we see you again.

164
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:31,615
You'd better watch out!

165
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,945
Why are you here?

166
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,235
Are you okay?

167
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,455
Yes, I'm still alive.

168
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:01,935
Have you forgotten?
I'm good with being attacked by people.

169
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,915
Why did you help me?

170
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:12,345
Because I can't just watch
you get beaten up.

171
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,305
Don't you know?

172
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,485
I was behind everything.

173
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:31,044
Yes, but I should thank you instead.

174
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:35,985
Having gone through the whole incident
made me grow as a person.

175
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:45,005
I did horrible things to you.

176
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:48,145
Why are you still being nice to me?

177
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:57,845
Because...

178
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:00,805
we're friends.

179
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,205
One, two, three, four, five, six!

180
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,084
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

181
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,605
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

182
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,204
Good morning!

183
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:49,005
Today is the day my errands service

184
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,605
resume its business.

185
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:52,965
Morning call!

186
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,125
Good morning, everyone.

187
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,805
Good morning.

188
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:02,365
Hello, sir.

189
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:07,205
Hello, good morning, sir.

190
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:11,605
<i>Listen to Qingqing</i>

191
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:15,525
<i>Wake up, wake up</i>

192
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,324
What's wrong with everyone today?

193
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:22,764
What's up with these early morning calls?

194
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,925
It's the weekend.

195
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,084
Why should I wake up so early?

196
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,645
Whatever.

197
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:32,385
I'm going back to sleep
for ten more minutes.

198
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,135
Qingqing, are you going back to sleep?

199
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,964
Fangfang, where are you going?

200
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,004
The library.

201
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,065
We have to go right now.

202
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,655
Fangfang, slow down.

203
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,295
Get over here.

204
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:58,604
What's wrong with everyone?

205
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,404
What did I miss?
Why are they walking like zombies?

206
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:04,124
Qingqing, it's two more weeks
to the finals.

207
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,324
The major finals
before our semester break starts.

208
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:07,755
Our major finals?

209
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,844
But isn't this a little too much?

210
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,495
Everyone has to queue up
to enter the library.

211
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,844
Let's go, shall we?

212
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:16,765
Okay.

213
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:21,885
Fangfang.

214
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:58,615
So many books?

215
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:00,964
Our college's examinations are tough.

216
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:04,284
They're difficult and strict.
It's worse than hell.

217
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:06,964
Although some students here
are from really affluent families,

218
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,524
but everyone will be treated equally
during finals.

219
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,964
If they failed to score well
for the exams,

220
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,164
the college will put up a notice.

221
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,005
Put up a notice?

222
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:18,404
Once they are listed in the notice,

223
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,924
it'll be difficult

224
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,924
for them to apply for scholarships

225
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,604
or good universities in the future.

226
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,604
Ming De is well known
for its academic achievements.

227
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:30,695
There's going to be strong competitions.

228
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:36,115
-I'm going to look for a book.
-Okay.

229
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,855
Qingqing, why are you here?

230
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,484
It's the finals week.

231
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,604
Fangfang brought me here to study.
What about you?

232
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:05,004
I'm here to study
the topics for our finals.

233
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,485
-Topics?
-Yes.

234
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:09,684
It's our college's regulations.
If we pick a national level topic,

235
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:12,475
there are going to be bonus points.

236
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:16,765
You're worthy of your title, Mr. Gu.

237
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:20,164
Qingqing,
do you want to have dinner together?

238
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,005
Sure.

239
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,884
I have something to discuss with you too.

240
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,484
I'll see you tonight.

241
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,595
-See you later.
-See you.

242
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:31,685
Right.

243
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:34,364
Let me tell you this.

244
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,404
Even if you get those bonus points,

245
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:40,195
I'm going to do better than you
in the finals.

246
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:44,445
Situ Feng.

247
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,964
Your fan club's representative came.

248
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,004
These are all gifts for you.

249
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:55,445
-It's so hard to remember.
-Look, your favorite chocolate.

250
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,404
I'm going to the library.

251
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,135
-Where?
-The library.

252
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,035
I'm going to study. Don't stop me.

253
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,484
Where did he say he was going?

254
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:04,725
The library?

255
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,615
Talk about when pigs fly!

256
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,075
I want to straighten up.

257
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:19,525
Sir, are you leaving us?

258
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:23,044
Sir, I admit I was careless
in handling Situ Feng's case,

259
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,405
but please don't leave us.

260
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,285
What I meant was

261
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:31,964
I want to live a normal life now
and stop causing troubles for myself.

262
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,905
As for the two of you,

263
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,484
you're always going to be my good friends.

264
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:37,404
I knew it.

265
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:40,044
Three heads are better than one.
He would never leave us.

266
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,005
Yes!

267
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,245
I'm leaving now.

268
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,255
Sir, where are you going?

269
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,025
The library.

270
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,855
Where the hell is Qingqing?

271
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,045
C is the answer.

272
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:00,205
Thanks.

273
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:04,484
How much did you score
for the monthly test?

274
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,244
It wasn't bad, I guess.

275
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,175
An average of 60 marks.

276
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:11,945
I scored 142 marks for my English test.

277
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:16,755
How about Math?

278
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,285
I failed.

279
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,685
What was your score?

280
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,215
It was 15.

281
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:32,724
How about this?

282
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:37,545
I will teach you Math like Einstein.
You can teach me English.

283
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:41,475
Wasn't Einstein an inventor?

284
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,205
Was he?

285
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:49,815
I thought Thomas Edison was an inventor?

286
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,705
-It's DaVinci!
-It's DaVinci!

287
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,775
-He was the one.
-Yes.

288
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,244
What do you feel like eating?

289
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:07,155
If I tell you what I want to eat,
would you buy them for me?

290
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:11,204
Of course, as long as
it can be found in Yuncheng.

291
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,164
But if it can't be found in Yuncheng,

292
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,605
I would take the plane.

293
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,245
I was joking.

294
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,435
Let me think.

295
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,845
I feel like having street food.

296
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,975
-Street food?
-Yes.

297
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,145
Don't you know?

298
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:33,875
There are stalls selling beer,
skewers and baked eggplants.

299
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,124
Well, now that's a problem.

300
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,364
I've never eaten those before.

301
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:41,564
What's the fun to be always eating
at fancy restaurants?

302
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:44,725
The real hidden gems are on the streets.

303
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,444
We should go and experience it ourselves.

304
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:47,564
Shall we go?

305
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:48,685
Of course.

306
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,155
Let's go.

307
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,324
Why don't we take the car?

308
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,285
Why drive? Let's walk.

309
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:55,924
This is how you can fully experience

310
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:58,885
-living as an ordinary citizen.
-Okay.

311
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,404
This place looks really nice.

312
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:02,785
I think so too.

313
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:12,365
Thank you.

314
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,445
Come. Cheers!

315
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:38,445
-Nanxi, I...
-Right, I...

316
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:41,525
-You first.
-You first.

317
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,885
No, you first.

318
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:45,365
Ladies first.

319
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:49,005
It's about Situ Feng.

320
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:54,885
What is it about him?

321
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,524
Like what you said to me,

322
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:00,845
Situ Feng has sacrificed a lot for me.

323
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:02,405
Hence,

324
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:05,924
I want to be serious
about our relationship.

325
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:07,555
I want to tell him

326
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,525
that I like him.

327
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,005
But...

328
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,525
-But what?
-Goodness.

329
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:17,685
But...

330
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,095
he still doesn't know

331
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,005
that I am Qingchen.

332
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,724
Are you serious? You haven't told him yet?

333
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:29,645
I am serious, Gu Nanxi.

334
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:33,645
I couldn't find a suitable time
to tell him.

335
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:37,124
You should have told him by now.

336
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,005
What should I do?

337
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:43,985
Should I just keep it a secret forever?

338
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:51,685
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng
is a very direct and sincere person.

339
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,244
If he finds out that his friends
hasn't been truthful to him,

340
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,125
he's going to be mad.

341
00:24:57,605 --> 00:25:00,935
But I think,
he will eventually understand.

342
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:03,524
So, if you really want
to take your relationship seriously,

343
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,884
you should be honest with him.

344
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,124
I already knew about it,
but I haven't told him yet.

345
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,164
If things go wrong later,

346
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,124
we'll have to carry the burden together.

347
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,604
Thank you so much.

348
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,564
Why are you thanking me?

349
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:17,725
Cheer up.

350
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,764
This is not the Chen Qingqing I know.

351
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,445
That's right, I'm a fearless witch!

352
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:27,044
Sir, I'd like half a dozen
bottles of beer!

353
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:28,724
It's examination period.

354
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:29,845
So what?

355
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,324
I've never failed my exams before!

356
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,445
I'm so glad to have you as my friend.

357
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:38,425
Let's drink to our heart's content.

358
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:43,245
Can you still drink?

359
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:44,525
Of course.

360
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,364
-I'm all right.
-Didn't you say you were good at drinking?

361
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:51,084
Was this what you called good at drinking?

362
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:52,085
Be careful.

363
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,735
I'll call a cab for you.

364
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:56,685
Hey.

365
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,165
Be careful.

366
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:07,964
<i>I'm going to show Feng</i>

367
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:11,425
<i>that Chen Qingqing
doesn't deserve his love.</i>

368
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:14,804
Gu Nanxi.
I thought you were my best friend!

369
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,365
My best friend

370
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,924
and the girl I love

371
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,285
treated me like a fool.

372
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,525
It hurts!

373
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:26,035
Is that what you think of me?

374
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,044
Am I such a horrible person?

375
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,245
Situ Feng, can we talk?

376
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:31,685
<i>You know what?</i>

377
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:37,575
<i>You're right, I am materialistic.
That's why I approached Situ Feng.</i>

378
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,455
