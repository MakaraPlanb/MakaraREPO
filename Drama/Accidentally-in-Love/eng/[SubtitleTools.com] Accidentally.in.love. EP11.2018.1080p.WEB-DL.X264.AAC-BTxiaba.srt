EPISODE 11

2
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,005
Ugly like me?

3
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,805
Don't you have anything nice to say to me?

4
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,685
Fangfang.

5
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,755
What are you looking at?

6
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,445
Fangfang.

7
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:32,685
Zhang Fangfang.

8
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:37,145
-What is it?
-What are you looking at?

9
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,405
Nothing.

10
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,484
If I'm not mistaken,

11
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,845
this is a man's jacket.

12
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,564
Come on, don't be shy. Just say it.

13
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,065
No, it's nothing.

14
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:52,444
We have class tomorrow.

15
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,524
You should go to bed now.

16
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,565
Fangfang, you're blushing.

17
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,765
-Hey, Qingqing!
-Yes?

18
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:13,844
The bonsai I gave you yesterday,
don't water it too much.

19
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:14,965
Goodness.

20
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,844
You should take care of yourself first.

21
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,215
Can't you be a little nicer?

22
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:23,925
Sometimes, you're quite interesting.

23
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,685
You can do quite a lot.

24
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,524
Can you just stop pulling that scary face?

25
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,255
You're the scaredy-cat here, Feng.

26
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:36,125
When I'm a little nicer, you like me.

27
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:40,164
But when I'm a little rude,
you chicken out right away!

28
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,655
Hey, since when do I like you?

29
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:47,965
I mean

30
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,844
who gave you the idea to determine
what girls should be like?

31
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,564
If we want to define ourselves,

32
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,924
we've got to be modest and gentle
to everyone else.

33
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,844
What era are we in now?

34
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,204
Actually, that's not what I meant either.

35
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,605
You just need half
of Qingchen's qualities.

36
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,405
Let me ask you this.

37
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:10,485
Do you know what Qingchen is like?

38
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:14,244
I see that she has a special place
in your heart.

39
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:17,124
She's the lead actress of my music video.

40
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,085
Not only she's gorgeous and polite,

41
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:22,204
but she's also approachable.

42
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,564
You should get to know her
when you get the chance.

43
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,364
You've got a lot to learn from her
to improve yourself.

44
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,045
Right, Gu Nanxi?

45
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,045
Yes.

46
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:32,165
And she's beautiful.

47
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,485
Her fingers were dancing on the piano keys

48
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,695
just like fairies.

49
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,325
Musical fairies.

50
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,645
Hey! You two rich kids.

51
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,124
Now, I really want to buy a huge mirror

52
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,725
so I can show you
what you really look like.

53
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,364
I want to ask the both of you.

54
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:01,845
Don't you notice anything strange

55
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,535
about this Qingchen?

56
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,615
She always shows up with a "bang"!

57
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,564
Right in front of you.

58
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:13,405
Then she goes "bang" again and disappears.

59
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,604
Comes without a shadow,
goes without a trace.

60
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:17,795
There's more.

61
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:22,885
Doesn't she always wear a very long dress

62
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:27,765
every time you meet her?

63
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:32,205
That's because she has no feet.

64
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:34,735
And no shadow.

65
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,365
Good point.

66
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,924
Every time I try to call her,
I couldn't get through.

67
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,385
And sometimes,
the number is out of service.

68
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,215
You'd only meet her

69
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:51,975
at a certain time and in a certain place.

70
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,965
Yet it's not so easy to see her.

71
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,545
Don't tell me

72
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,655
that you've been seeing a ghost?

73
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,735
Look over there!

74
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,215
Chen Qingqing, what are you up to?

75
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,565
Fangfang!

76
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,804
Why did I see you with Lin Yiyang?

77
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:13,645
No.

78
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,244
My clothes got ripped off.
Then he lent me his jacket.

79
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,764
I was just returning it.
There's nothing between us.

80
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:19,835
Is that so?

81
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:21,685
Listen, Fangfang.

82
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,444
You've got to stay away from Yiyang
if you don't need his help.

83
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,945
He's not what he seems to be.

84
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,725
Don't worry, I know that.

85
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,105
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

86
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,444
Fangfang, go back to the dorm.
I'll see you there in a minute.

87
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:38,405
Bye.

88
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:40,995
Hi, Ms. Chen.

89
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,844
-What is it?
-I want to ask you.

90
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,204
Is there a great alumnus in our school

91
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:48,245
that goes by the name of Xiao Jingnan?

92
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,305
Why do you ask?

93
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:53,625
It's like this.

94
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,485
The Students Council

95
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,164
is now sorting out the archives

96
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,084
of the school's most notable students.

97
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:02,284
So I'd like to get to learn more
and get to know him better.

98
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,844
He was indeed an excellent person.

99
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:05,725
Really?

100
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,685
Do you know him?

101
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,884
His data is at the College Archives.

102
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,324
If you want to know more,

103
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,644
you just have to go there.

104
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,204
Is there anything else?

105
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,285
No.

106
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,865
Thank you, ma'am.

107
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,044
May I have your attention, please?

108
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,644
The candidate list
for the school's play has been announced.

109
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,444
Come and see if you've made the cut
to share the stage with the stars!

110
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,385
Excuse me.

111
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,075
May I take a look?

112
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,305
"Instructed by Chen Xiao?" That means...

113
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,645
This is fantastic.

114
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,085
No way!

115
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,084
Even the witch can't keep her day job?

116
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:51,125
This is really weird.

117
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,444
Qingqing, look.

118
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:55,924
You made the cut.

119
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,524
I'm at the top of the list!

120
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,945
They really have good a taste.

121
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,284
This is the list of supporting actors.

122
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,585
The main cast is over there.

123
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,325
It's them again!

124
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:21,535
Do you think you can be the main actress?

125
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,964
-You'd be a laughing stock.
-Yeah.

126
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,684
This opportunity
is certainly made for Xinya.

127
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,804
You should just stick to being an extra.

128
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:29,685
Yeah.

129
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,444
You two take a good look at the list.

130
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:36,284
I don't know how many rungs
your names are below mine.

131
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,724
You didn't even make it as extras.

132
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,225
And as for you...

133
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,555
How do I put it?

134
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,324
I've never seen how well you act.

135
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,955
So you want to see

136
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:50,225
how well I strut my stuff on stage?

137
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,644
Then I'll just have to wait and see.

138
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:56,165
But you'd better not let me down!

139
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:58,775
Bring it on.

140
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,895
Bring it on.

141
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,145
What's wrong, Feng?

142
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,515
First of all,

143
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,844
congratulations for making the cut

144
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:19,524
<i>into the Beauty and the Beast lineup.</i>

145
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,395
In the next few hours,

146
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,044
I will conduct the drama class

147
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:24,915
on behalf of Ms. Wang.

148
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,845
And in two weeks,

149
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,215
we will have a performance.

150
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,484
Gu Nanxi, you managed to come up
with a good plan.

151
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:36,964
You shall be the director.

152
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,405
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:44,385
Next, we will assign your roles.

154
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,084
Your rehearsal begins now.

155
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,484
In this scene,
Belle trespasses the West Wing

156
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,724
and then she sees a rose.

157
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,244
The Beast drives her away.

158
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,884
CHIP, MRS POTTS, COGSWORTH, LUMIÈRE

159
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:58,205
Could it be that no one notices my talent?

160
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:01,895
I don't think
it's just a matter of talent.

161
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,085
COGSWORTH, LUMIÈRE

162
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,525
Feng.

163
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:14,484
This is my first stage play,
so I don't have any experience.

164
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,785
Can you give me some advice?

165
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,444
Well, Xinya, you're all good.

166
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,945
I believe in you.

167
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,545
All right.

168
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,605
Ready?

169
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:28,565
Action!

170
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,105
What are you doing?

171
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,105
Did you touch it?

172
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,325
I'm sorry!

173
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,655
Do you realize

174
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,844
that you could have damned us all?

175
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:48,685
But I didn't mean any harm.

176
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,645
Get out!

177
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,405
I'm sorry!

178
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,925
Get out of here.

179
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,765
Promise or no promise,

180
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,715
I can't stay here another minute!

181
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:02,685
Cut! Stop!

182
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,044
Nanxi, how did I do? Did I play it well?

183
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,085
Not...

184
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,485
Not too bad.

185
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,845
It's just that

186
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,685
you need to give your movements

187
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:14,924
a little restraint.

188
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,004
A little restraint?

189
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,545
Because you moved about so much.

190
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:19,524
We don't need that.

191
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:20,365
Got it?

192
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,244
Got it. A little restraint.

193
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,844
Okay, let's do it again.

194
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,805
All right.

195
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,245
Take two. Ready?

196
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:34,565
Action!

197
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:38,905
Did you touch it?

198
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,805
I'm sorry!

199
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,324
You could have damned us all!

200
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:45,645
But I didn't mean any harm!

201
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:46,925
Get out!

202
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,284
Promise or no promise,

203
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:53,955
I can't stay here another minute!

204
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,495
One more time!

205
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:58,965
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,285
I didn't mean any harm.

207
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,805
Get out of here.

208
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,564
-One more time!
-I didn't mean any harm.

209
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,485
Get out!

210
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,564
One more time!

211
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,845
I didn't mean any harm.

212
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:16,565
Get out!

213
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:21,445
Promise or no promise,

214
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:24,195
I can't stay here another minute!

215
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:49,565
Ms. Chen.

216
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,164
Can I be frank with you?

217
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,204
-Go ahead.
-I think that

218
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:57,604
if we want to improve the quality
of the play,

219
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,885
I think the role of Belle should go to

220
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,045
Situ Feng!

221
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:05,685
Qingqing.

222
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,244
You shouldn't joke around all the time.

223
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,644
Ms. Chen, I'm not joking at all.

224
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,364
Gu Nanxi can prove it.

225
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,164
Situ Feng's women's clothes

226
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:16,845
are really nice.

227
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,485
Yes, they are.

228
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,085
Gu Nanxi!

229
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:26,444
Are you both pulling a prank on me?

230
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,925
Goodness, seriously.

231
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:32,325
What I said is all true.

232
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,884
We're praising you,
so don't give me that look.

233
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,005
All right.

234
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,684
I want to tell you the truth too.

235
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,124
You're the best to play the Beast.

236
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,684
Who are you calling the Beast?

237
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,164
Look, your temper is much worse
than a beast.

238
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:49,004
Situ Feng, do you want me to send you
flying in the air with my spinning kick?

239
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,405
You dare?

240
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,155
Knock it off.

241
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,455
You're Belle

242
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,764
and you're the Beast.

243
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:57,085
-That'd be perfect.
-No!

244
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,455
At least, I gained something.

245
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,004
You both seem well-coordinated
when you were arguing.

246
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:07,564
So it'd be nice
for you to take these roles.

247
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:08,484
But Ms. Chen--

248
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,524
How about this?

249
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,004
Let's call a vote!

250
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:14,244
Hands up if you don't want Situ Feng
to play Belle!

251
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,245
Wait!

252
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,564
This is not fair.

253
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:18,604
No one put their hands up.

254
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:19,545
All right.

255
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,204
I've decided.

256
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,764
Qingqing will be the Beast

257
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:25,015
and Situ Feng,

258
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,205
you'll play Belle.

259
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,225
Hey, beauty.

260
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,855
As for Lumière,

261
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,525
Xinya will take the role.

262
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:35,485
Beauty.

263
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:36,605
Ms. Chen,

264
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,684
if we give Xinya a supporting role,
she won't accept it.

265
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,845
Ms. Chen,

266
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,804
Xinya doesn't think highly
of such petty roles.

267
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:46,164
How about you cast her as Gaston?

268
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,524
It's a lead role too.

269
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,525
Perhaps.

270
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:51,525
Sorry.

271
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,884
I was a little engrossed by it.

272
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,375
How did I do? A little better?

273
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,604
In this scene,
Belle trespasses the West Wing

274
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:03,164
and then she sees a rose.

275
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,275
The Beast drives her away.

276
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:10,044
They gave Qingqing the lead role.

277
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,845
What's got into that witch's eyes?

278
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,945
What are you doing?

279
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,404
Did you touch it?

280
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:24,365
No.

281
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,724
I didn't mean any harm.

282
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:27,975
Do you realize

283
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,775
that you could have damned us all?

284
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:32,935
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,245
Get out of here.

286
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,405
Get out!

287
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:44,725
Hey.

288
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:46,755
What's wrong?

289
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,445
Are you okay?

290
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,075
I'm fine.

291
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,604
Situ Feng, you're burning up.

292
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:56,365
Do you have a fever?

293
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:58,484
You'd better go get some rest.

294
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,565
Ms. Chen.

295
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,255
Situ Feng seems to have a fever.

296
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:04,965
Feng.

297
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:07,625
What happened to you?

298
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,044
His head is warm.

299
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:13,044
Hey, take him to the infirmary now.

300
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:13,965
Got it.

301
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:15,124
Take it easy now.

302
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,164
I'm going with him.

303
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,644
The rest should stay here.

304
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,404
You'll take his place.

305
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,495
-You'll act with Qingqing, okay?
-Okay.

306
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,085
Gu Nanxi.

307
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,525
Qingqing.

308
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,804
How's Situ Feng now?

309
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,404
He got a fever because of his cold.

310
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,525
He's resting at home now.

311
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,685
Maybe he caught a cold

312
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,724
when he fell into the pool
during his last photo shoot?

313
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,005
What?

314
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,565
-He fell into the water?
-Yes.

315
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,565
Now I get it.

316
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,085
What do you get?

317
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,605
Is he so afraid of water?

318
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:57,245
Yes.

319
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,644
You're kidding me, right?

320
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,465
He's such a big boy!

321
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:04,945
It looks like you're concerned about him.

322
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,125
Am I?

323
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,524
Of course, classmates have
to look out for each other.

324
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,684
We often ask about each other, right?

325
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,204
We often do that, right?

326
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,505
-Really?
-Yeah!

327
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,844
I care about you too.

328
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,164
It's always like that.

329
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,405
It always is.

330
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:28,125
Qingqing, I heard Feng is sick.

331
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,284
Aren't you his assistant?

332
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,684
-Well, I--
-Can you help us

333
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:33,444
send our little kind regards to him?

334
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,445
-Me too!
-Me too!

335
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,444
Settle down!

336
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,365
One by one.

337
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:42,005
-Thank you!
-That's great!

338
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,765
Qingqing.

339
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:51,305
It looks like you can't leave your job
as his assistant.

340
00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:00,604
Why do I have to do
something like this for them?

341
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,605
Hello.

342
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,364
Welcome to the Situ Residence.

343
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,085
And you are?

344
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,425
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

345
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:10,135
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

346
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:17,765
Hello.

347
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:18,685
Hello.

348
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:23,604
Who are you?

349
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,205
Hello, sir.

350
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,564
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

351
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:29,605
So you're Mei.

352
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,405
Yes, I'm Mei.

353
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,004
That's a lot you're carrying.

354
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,084
Carry them for her.

355
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,204
No. You really don't have to.

356
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:38,724
These are all from Feng's fans.

357
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,284
I have to bring them up myself.

358
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:41,244
Thank you, sir.

359
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,524
I'm going upstairs.

360
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:46,185
-Can you see where you're going?
-Yes, I can!

361
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,715
It looks like he's seriously ill.

362
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,805
Chen Qingqing!

363
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:19,884
What the hell?

364
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:20,885
I...

365
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,245
I was just helping you cover up.

366
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,564
You were drooling at my face!

367
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:26,965
What?

368
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:31,284
I'm not interested in some guy
who wears childish underwear!

369
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,285
Why you...

370
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,025
Don't tell anybody!

371
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:37,404
I'm doing some people a favor
by sending you these gifts.

372
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,645
They're here.

373
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:40,725
I'm leaving now.

374
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:41,764
Hey, Chen Qingqing!

375
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:42,685
What now?

376
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,505
Why are you drenched?

377
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,644
Did you get caught in the rain?

378
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:48,244
Yeah, it was raining.

379
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,105
It was raining heavily.

380
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:54,265
You better get changed,
or you'll catch a cold.

381
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,844
What are you looking at?

382
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:13,605
Nothing.

383
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:17,805
Those clothes should warm you up.

384
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:21,565
Feng.

385
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,365
Feng.

386
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,805
Lan Xinya.

387
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,484
-What is she doing here?
-I don't know!

388
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,244
What should I do now?

389
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:32,525
-Hide!
-Feng!

390
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:35,085
No.

391
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:36,844
She could see you here.

392
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:37,725
Feng!

393
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,485
No.

394
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,124
That's much worse!

395
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,604
Then tell me where to hide!

396
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:43,865
I don't know!

397
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:46,645
Feng!

398
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:47,885
Xinya.

399
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:49,484
I was worried sick about you.

400
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:50,724
Are you feeling better now?

401
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:51,925
A lot better.

402
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,924
I came right after class.

403
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:54,995
Let me see.

404
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,924
It looks like you're getting better.

405
00:22:58,925 --> 00:22:59,885
But...

406
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:02,244
your complexion doesn't look normal.

407
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,405
It doesn't?

408
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,524
Never mind about that.

409
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,764
Today, I'll be taking good care of you.

410
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,075
Please, don't--

411
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:10,155
Come on in.

412
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:20,364
You, open the window to let in some air.

413
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,084
You three, make the room completely
clean with detergent.

414
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,844
The nurses are on standby for 24 hours

415
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,644
to monitor Feng's condition at all times.

416
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,505
Okay everyone, move it.

417
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:34,244
You, change Feng's blanket
to a slightly thinner one.

418
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,545
-See what's over here.
-No.

419
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,685
Put it down.

420
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,205
Feng!

421
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:44,804
Your blanket is so thick.

422
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:46,244
-Just change it.
-No, thanks.

423
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:51,724
The doctor said to use thick blankets when
you have a fever so you'll sweat it out.

424
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,364
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

425
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,285
Get him another blanket.

426
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:57,455
Here you go.

427
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:04,325
Allow me.

428
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,845
Gosh, Xinya.

429
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:12,604
Suddenly, I feel so hot.

430
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,285
Take off my blanket.

431
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,945
Hurry, take it off.

432
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:19,725
Xinya.

433
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,305
What is it, Feng?

434
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,124
You'd better get going.

435
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,364
I need to get enough rest.

436
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,605
Feng.

437
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,725
But today,

438
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:30,364
I asked the school for a leave

439
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:33,045
just to be here with you.

440
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,005
Xinya.

441
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:41,005
Well, you should go now.

442
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:43,315
I know your good intentions.

443
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:45,765
Well, then.

444
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:46,765
Feng.

445
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:48,345
Go get your rest.

446
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:50,644
Okay, don't touch anything.

447
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:52,085
You can go back.

448
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:58,205
Go.

449
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:00,205
Go.

450
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,715
-Well, Feng.
-Yes?

451
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:06,085
-If you'll excuse me.
-Sure.

452
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:09,585
Leave quickly.

453
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:18,685
Feng.

454
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:19,885
What now?

455
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,044
Don't forget to call me.

456
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,175
Yes, I will.

457
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,325
-Feng!
-Yes?

458
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:30,485
So you have that kind of hobby.

459
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,485
What?

460
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,605
Xinya.

461
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,005
How do I look?

462
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:44,475
You look great!

463
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:47,905
-I'm going now.
-Yeah, bye.

464
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,165
Come out.

465
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:00,935
I was suffocating!

466
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,124
Situ Feng.

467
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:06,645
-How could you think of this idea?
-What else could I do?

468
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,105
Is that my phone?

469
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:13,825
It seems like it.

470
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,645
It's Gu Nanxi.

471
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:19,015
Hello? Gu Nanxi.

472
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,084
I'll go back to school now.

473
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:26,965
Bye.

474
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,204
What is it?

475
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:30,804
The witch is calling for a rehearsal,

476
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,324
so I've got to go back to school.

477
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,755
A rehearsal, now?

478
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,484
-But it's so late.
-Hey.

479
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:36,564
Get well soon, okay?

480
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,484
Once you're better,

481
00:26:37,485 --> 00:26:40,604
I'll wait for you to come back
and play on stage.

482
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,525
Hey, are you nuts?

483
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:48,844
I'm so tired.

484
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:50,124
We've been rehearsing all day.

485
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,924
That was completely inhumane.

486
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:52,805
Yeah.

487
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:55,564
This is clearly not her day job,
but she set her heart on it.

488
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,364
You know that witch is a workaholic.

489
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,245
Hey, you!

490
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,324
Are you done chatting?

491
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:04,485
Don't just sit there! Back to rehearsal!

492
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:06,435
Knock it off!

493
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:09,405
Come on.

494
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:11,995
I'll show you to your room.

495
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,645
My room?

496
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,364
But I thought...

497
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:18,225
Do you want to stay in the dungeon?

498
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:23,004
<i>No one makes slick and quick moves
Like Gaston does</i>

499
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:26,724
<i>No one shines in the midsummer
Like Gaston does</i>

500
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:29,844
<i>You make me tremble
When I stand beside you</i>

501
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:34,284
<i>-Oh my, Gaston is so perfect!
-Oh my, Gaston is so perfect!</i>

502
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,965
Stop!

503
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,684
You're such a nuisance.

504
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:43,805
Can you please rehearse somewhere else?

505
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,124
<i>No one's slick as Gaston</i>

506
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,924
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

507
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,404
<i>In a spitting match</i>

508
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,204
<i>Nobody spits like Gaston</i>

509
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:56,204
<i>And I'm so good at spitting!</i>

510
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,925
Cut it out, Xinya.

511
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,124
We'll move on to the next act.
You guys go rest.

512
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,484
-Not me--
-Come on.

513
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:02,445
Move it!

514
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:06,325
THE BEAST

515
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:12,804
Qingqing, let's do Act Six.

516
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,364
-The one with the piano.
-Okay.

517
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,564
They'll dub the music,
so you take it easy.

518
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:17,525
Go on.

519
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,205
I'll take it easy.

520
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,484
It's such a piece of cake,

521
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:45,285
yet she had to show off like that.

522
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:49,164
<i>That silhouette...</i>

523
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:53,365
<i>Where have I seen it before?</i>

524
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,804
<i>Qingchen</i>

525
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,924
<i>is Chen Qingqing!</i>

526
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,364
<i>But why?</i>

527
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,484
<i>Why did you disguise yourself?</i>

528
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:52,305
<i>What are you trying to hide from us?</i>

529
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,675
Thank you for seeing me
although you're sick.

530
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,995
No need to thank me.

531
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,745
We're best buddies.

532
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:17,845
You

533
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:21,335
are the only friend I have left.

534
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,044
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

535
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:27,124
Aren't you the good boy
who always goes to bed early?

536
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,604
Why are you up late now?

537
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:29,804
And you're sharing a cola!

538
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:31,085
What?

539
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,524
Can't I just chat with you for a minute?

540
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,715
It looks like

541
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,204
you've got a lot on your mind.

542
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:40,484
Say it. I'll straighten it out.

543
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:41,845
Oh, come on!

544
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,485
I can really tell.

545
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:46,145
You like Qingchen, right?

546
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,235
Cut it out!

547
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,684
You can't hide your thoughts from me.

548
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,795
So you like Chen Qingqing?

549
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,605
Hey, cut the crap.

550
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:59,605
Who'd be unlucky enough to like her?

551
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:09,325
Hey, we have never fought at all, right?

552
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:10,805
What?

553
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,004
Do you want to fight?

554
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,845
I mean,

555
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:15,845
if someday,

556
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,545
we end up fighting,

557
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:18,804
what would be the reason?

558
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:22,525
No matter what,
I'll never hurt my own friend.

559
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:23,525
Gu Nanxi.

560
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:26,485
What's up with you today?

561
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:31,415
Hold on, I need to get this.

562
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:34,604
<i>-Hello?
-My little master.</i>

563
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:36,604
<i>I've got to tell you something,</i>

564
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,444
<i>but you've got to brace yourself.</i>

565
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:39,845
What is it?

566
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:41,524
<i>Someone hacked our computers.</i>

567
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,764
<i>They uploaded the video for "Breath."</i>

568
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:44,925
What?

569
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,404
How did you get hacked?

570
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,644
<i>I can only say that the fans are
going all crazy by now!</i>

571
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,284
<i>But don't you worry.</i>

572
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,764
<i>We haven't announced anything.</i>

573
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,924
<i>And it hasn't spread far.</i>

574
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:55,004
<i>I hope it doesn't cause you trouble.</i>

575
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:56,165
Okay.

576
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:57,644
I hope it's all good.

577
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:58,564
<i>All right.</i>

578
00:31:58,565 --> 00:31:59,844
<i>You may go back to rest now.</i>

579
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:01,844
<i>I'll be here to see
how the situation unfolds.</i>

580
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:03,365
Okay, bye.

581
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,324
What's wrong?

582
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,565
Why do you look so serious?

583
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:10,225
Nothing, it's just the agency.

584
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,045
Hey.

585
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:22,165
It looks like you're all better.

586
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,804
A little game is all it takes!

587
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:26,204
You keep saying I'm so weak.

588
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,324
No, I didn't!

589
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,324
You're all okay now,

590
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:29,524
-shall we rehearse?
-Sure.

591
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:31,044
I've got it all down.

592
00:32:31,045 --> 00:32:31,885
Come on.

593
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:34,955
Come on! I'll show you to your room.

594
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:38,925
My room?

595
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,085
Go on!

596
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:42,685
Situ Feng!

597
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:56,644
Don't blame me for being mean to you.

598
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:59,195
Is he using me to threaten you?

599
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,884
<i>You and Lin Yiyang...</i>

600
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:07,684
That bitch Qingqing is about
to take Feng away from you.

601
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,875
Feng is mine!

602
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:11,244
Are you in love with her?

603
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:16,804
<i>I heard that Situ Feng took
the female lead in Beauty and the Beast.</i>

604
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:17,964
This photo was taken

605
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:20,804
<i>when your parents first met.</i>

606
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:23,045
Youyou, will you marry me?

607
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:24,725
I will.

608
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:28,675
