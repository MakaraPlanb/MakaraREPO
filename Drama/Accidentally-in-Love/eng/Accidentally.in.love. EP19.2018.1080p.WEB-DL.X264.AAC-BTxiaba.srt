EPISODE 19

2
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:37,025
FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY
NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED

3
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,265
Feng, you did a great job.

4
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,824
I told you that you could do it.

5
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,744
You're right.

6
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:01,755
His Highness went all out
for this commercial shoot.

7
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:03,904
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

8
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:04,984
Keep up the good work.

9
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:07,024
You have a bright future ahead of you.

10
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,335
Ms. Wang, I'll see you out.

11
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:16,465
Situ Feng.

12
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,264
You were amazing.

13
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:23,744
How did you manage to conquer
your fear of water in such a short time?

14
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,105
JINCHENG

15
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,544
You said that you were going
to have a chat with me,

16
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,695
but you started to doze off
the minute you got here.

17
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,384
Don't get me started.

18
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,475
You told me on the phone
that you were really sick.

19
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,304
I hurried back to Jincheng
that very night,

20
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:06,384
only to find out
that you caught a small cold.

21
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,925
And now,
you wouldn't even let me sleep in.

22
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:13,945
That's because I missed you so much.

23
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,575
You haven't given me a call

24
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,015
since I last saw you in Yuncheng.

25
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,595
Have you been spending all your time

26
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,545
with your deskmate,

27
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:31,265
Situ Feng?

28
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,904
Is that why you've neglected me?

29
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,685
Grandpa, what are you talking about?

30
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,465
We're just classmates.

31
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:40,785
Besides,

32
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:44,545
how did you know we share a desk?

33
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:48,264
Did you ask someone to investigate him?

34
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:49,784
That's not necessary.

35
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,984
He's just a singer, isn't he?

36
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:54,185
You did investigate him.

37
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,085
All right.

38
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,445
I'm here to keep you company now.

39
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,464
I've already asked for a leave.

40
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,464
I will spend the entire week

41
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:08,305
with you wholeheartedly.

42
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:09,625
-Really?
-Yes.

43
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,105
This makes me happy.

44
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:21,665
Grandpa.

45
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,495
Now, can you tell me

46
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,545
the story of my mom and dad?

47
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:33,965
Back then,

48
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,995
your mom went to Yuncheng
to pursue her studies.

49
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:43,744
She came home with your dad
right after she graduated.

50
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,735
She wanted to marry him.

51
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,824
Come to think of it, you and your mom

52
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,145
have the exact same temper.

53
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,345
She was my only daughter.

54
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:02,765
How could I let her marry
a teacher from a small town?

55
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:08,944
I tried to talk her out of it,
but she wouldn't listen.

56
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,104
She moved to Yuncheng with your dad

57
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,544
and they got married.

58
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,845
Then, she gave birth to you.

59
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,835
What happened later?

60
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,945
A few years later,

61
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:25,045
your parents went on a trip with you.

62
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,885
They had an accident.

63
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,625
Your mom

64
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,105
died on the spot.

65
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,505
Your dad fell off a cliff

66
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,575
and went missing.

67
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:45,785
I rushed to Yuncheng to pick you up.

68
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,175
You were still so young.

69
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,224
You had no idea what had happened.

70
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,145
You were skipping around

71
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,915
and asking for your mom and dad.

72
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,425
A few years after I took you in,

73
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:01,125
I received the news

74
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,585
that your dad's corpse has been found.

75
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,385
Grandpa.

76
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,584
Why didn't you tell me the truth

77
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:13,025
all these years?

78
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:16,005
In the past, I really believed

79
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:21,375
that your dad was to blame for the tragedy

80
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,985
because he took your mom away from me.

81
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,325
I held a grudge against him.

82
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,935
So I didn't want to talk about it.

83
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:36,765
But come to think of it,

84
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,145
I was too selfish.

85
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,665
You had the right to know the truth.

86
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,705
Qingqing.

87
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,975
You're not blaming me, are you?

88
00:06:58,905 --> 00:06:59,745
Grandpa.

89
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,105
You're my grandpa.

90
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,405
You're the only family I have left.

91
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,255
How could I blame you?

92
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,705
Qingqing.

93
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:19,105
You're my only granddaughter.

94
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:23,355
I'm happy. as long as you're happy.

95
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,855
I've thought it through.

96
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:31,035
I won't force you
to marry Jingyang anymore.

97
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,185
Really?

98
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,585
Yes.

99
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,464
But you must remember.

100
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:39,664
Although I'm not going
to force you to marry Jingyang,

101
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:43,304
it doesn't mean
that you can do whatever you want.

102
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,705
My future grandson-in-law

103
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,824
must be compatible with our Chen Family

104
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,105
and with you.

105
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,265
Hello?

106
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,425
What?

107
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:06,824
Tell me again.

108
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,825
I said,

109
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:10,485
I'm now at Jincheng airport.

110
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:15,505
No way, Situ Feng.

111
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,704
It's so early.
You should be home sleeping.

112
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,464
What the hell are you doing here?

113
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,464
I took the earliest flight to come here.

114
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:24,824
Qingqing, give me your address.
I'll go find you.

115
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:25,905
No!

116
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:29,585
I mean...

117
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:31,584
Hold on a second.

118
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,344
Grandpa, Situ Feng is here.
What should I do?

119
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,305
Grandpa.

120
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:42,185
Hello, Situ Feng?

121
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,745
I'm telling you.

122
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:47,425
My grandpa is very mean.

123
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,005
He's really mean.

124
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,065
Besides,

125
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:54,225
my family is not very well off.

126
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,795
I don't want you to see me now.

127
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,465
Grandpa.

128
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:02,705
Hello?

129
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,785
Are you Situ Feng?

130
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,715
Are you Qingqing's deskmate in Yuncheng?

131
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,785
<i>Hello, Mr. Chen.</i>

132
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,144
All right, then.

133
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:15,465
Our address is Canglan Village, Beijiao.

134
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,055
Come and we'll meet you here.

135
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:19,825
All right.

136
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,395
Qingqing, why do you look so scared?

137
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,665
Grandpa.

138
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,904
What should we do now?

139
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:31,025
He came all the way here.

140
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:33,344
And what did you say just now?

141
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:36,805
Canglan Village?
Where in the world is that?

142
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:38,355
Don't worry.

143
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,565
Just follow my plans.

144
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:45,165
You can take a good look at
Situ Feng's true colors.

145
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:46,805
Follow me.

146
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,405
<i>Hello, Qingqing.</i>

147
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,784
<i>Why haven't I arrived yet?</i>

148
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:13,305
<i>I've already driven
more than ten kilometers.</i>

149
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:14,545
<i>Keep going?</i>

150
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,545
Okay, I see.

151
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:24,505
CANGLAN VILLAGE

152
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,825
STOP

153
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:29,425
Situ Feng!

154
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,005
Chen Qingqing.

155
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:40,744
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

156
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:43,415
Are you taking me home with this?

157
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,955
What's wrong with it?

158
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,624
I'm a public figure after all.

159
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,984
I don't think this is a good idea.

160
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,424
I don't see anything wrong with it.

161
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:54,224
You're in the mountains.

162
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,104
You're lucky to even have this.

163
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,864
-Are you looking down on this?
-I'm not.

164
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,344
It's just that it seems like an antique.

165
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,984
I'm afraid that it might fall apart
if I sit on it.

166
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,384
You have a good eye.

167
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,184
This is indeed an antique.

168
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:10,505
My great-grandpa passed it down to me.

169
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,365
-Your great-grandpa?
-That's right.

170
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,345
Well...

171
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:18,785
Come on. Hop in.

172
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,275
-Pretty boy.
-No.

173
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:23,304
Let me do it.

174
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,144
-Do you know how to ride this?
-I think so.

175
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,065
Go ahead.

176
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,145
Be careful.

177
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,625
Hold on to it.

178
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:31,865
Let's go.

179
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,184
-Which direction?
-That way.

180
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:37,245
Turn around.

181
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:49,185
This must be embarrassing
for a top star like you.

182
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:54,245
This is so fun.

183
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,525
-Keep it up, Situ Feng.
-I can ride this forever.

184
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,025
You can do it.

185
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:06,265
You can do it.

186
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:09,835
Way to go.

187
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,655
We'll be there after that corner.

188
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,745
Go, Situ Feng!

189
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,145
Go, Situ Feng!

190
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:26,545
Go!

191
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:28,824
-Go, Situ Feng!
-Chen Qingqing.

192
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,005
Chen Qingqing.

193
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,285
This antique is seriously falling apart.

194
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:35,984
What should we do then?

195
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:37,295
How about this?

196
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:41,325
Why don't you push from behind
while I pedal?

197
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:44,725
-Let's do this. Get off.
-All right.

198
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,105
Be careful.

199
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,485
Give me a hand.

200
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:49,245
Come here.

201
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,715
-Be careful.
-Okay.

202
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,065
Let's do it.

203
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,184
-Let's go. One.
-One.

204
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,344
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

205
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,065
-Go!
-Go!

206
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,305
Go!

207
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:13,025
I didn't expect that one day,

208
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:16,584
I would be pushing a cart
in the mountains.

209
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:19,135
Situ Feng, I forgot to ask you.

210
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:23,344
Why did you come
to Jincheng all of a sudden?

211
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,335
You left without a word.

212
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:30,715
I was worried about you
so I decided to pay you a visit.

213
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:35,905
Let's go.

214
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,405
Slow down.

215
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:48,864
Okay, we're here.

216
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:49,945
Stop.

217
00:13:58,065 --> 00:13:59,305
I'm tired.

218
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,955
You must be really exhausted.

219
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,305
I'm all right.

220
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:09,664
Chen Qingqing.

221
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:10,584
Where's your house?

222
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,015
-My house?
-Yes.

223
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,525
<i>Which one did Grandpa tell me?</i>

224
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,195
It's probably...

225
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,705
It's probably in the front.

226
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:33,235
-That's right.
-Chen Qingqing.

227
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:34,944
Isn't it your house?

228
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,584
-Yes.
-How come you don't recognize it?

229
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,144
Of course it's my house.

230
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,904
I know. It's right ahead.

231
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:40,944
Take a look.

232
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,424
There's a flag with "Chen" written on it.

233
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,704
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

234
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:45,864
-I told you.
-Yes.

235
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,184
Come on. It's up ahead.

236
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,145
Let's go.

237
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:56,655
That's right.

238
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:58,105
This must be it.

239
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,385
What's the matter?

240
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:04,985
Qingqing.

241
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,195
Is this livable?

242
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,155
Although it's quite shabby,

243
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:15,065
it's still livable for people.

244
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,105
Why? Do you hate it?

245
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,465
No, I don't.

246
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:21,184
Hurry up and go in.

247
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,285
My grandpa is waiting for you in there.

248
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,305
Let's go.

249
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,705
Grandpa.

250
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,285
Situ Feng, this is my grandpa.

251
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,865
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chen.

252
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:54,785
Young man, you're here just in time.

253
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:59,624
What my grandpa meant is,
you came at the right time.

254
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,224
It fell down the minute you walked in.

255
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:04,304
-Did you feel its passion?
-I did.

256
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:06,055
You did, didn't you?

257
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:08,705
Grandpa.

258
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:12,024
What in the world are you doing?
Who are you trying to torture?

259
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,525
Stay out of this.

260
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,725
I want to see what kind of person he is.

261
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:18,625
Gosh.

262
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,265
This beam

263
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,505
is our family heirloom.

264
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,305
Your family heirloom?

265
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:32,825
Hundreds of years ago,
our family was at great risk.

266
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:37,475
Your great-great-grandpa risked his life

267
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,904
to go deep into a forest and bring back

268
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,064
this wood of Hainan plum-yew.

269
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:47,745
It protected our family for generations

270
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,784
from evil, sicknesses and disasters.

271
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,825
It was the lifeline of our family.

272
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,215
This is not an exaggeration.

273
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,635
But the minute this lad showed up,

274
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,745
it just fell down.

275
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,825
Grandpa.

276
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:05,625
Mr. Chen.

277
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,305
Qingqing, don't worry.

278
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,145
I will fix it.

279
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:11,505
Young man.

280
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:14,544
Can you keep your word?

281
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,745
Yes.

282
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:16,785
All right.

283
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:28,784
Situ Feng, be careful.

284
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,215
I will. It will be all right.

285
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:34,825
Grandpa.

286
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,105
Come on.

287
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,595
He came all the way from Yuncheng.

288
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,845
You should let him get some rest first.

289
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,384
Young people are full of energy.

290
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:47,864
They don't need to rest.

291
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,504
Am I right, young man?

292
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:50,345
Yes.

293
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:54,864
What's wrong?

294
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,065
It's nothing.

295
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,264
Did you hammer your finger?

296
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:58,525
No, I didn't.

297
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,944
-Be careful.
-Okay.

298
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,065
I'm fine.

299
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,335
It's nothing.

300
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:05,544
You feel sorry for him already?

301
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:06,625
Grandpa.

302
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,465
Don't push it.

303
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,805
I know what I'm doing.

304
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,464
-Situ Feng, take it slow.
-Okay.

305
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:23,424
<i>-Hello?
-Hello, Qingqing. It's Fangfang.</i>

306
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,345
Fangfang.

307
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,584
I got discharged and I'm back in college.

308
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,264
I heard that you took one week leave
to go back to Jincheng.

309
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,544
Are you all right?

310
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,104
My grandpa was ill.

311
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,975
So I came back to pay him a visit.

312
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,024
I'm glad that you're all right.

313
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,745
Did you just say
that Situ Feng is also there?

314
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,705
It's a long story.

315
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:47,464
<i>I will tell you everything
when I get back.</i>

316
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,205
By the way, Fangfang,

317
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,224
you have to take good care of yourself

318
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:53,845
while I'm away. Do you hear me?

319
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,395
I will. Bye.

320
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,905
<i>That's all. Bye.</i>

321
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,104
Zhang Fangfang, you're finally back.

322
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,825
Is your errands service still open?

323
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,335
I'm sorry. We've closed it.

324
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,895
What a shame.

325
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,224
I'm going to the cafeteria to get lunch.

326
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:13,864
Why don't I get something for you too?

327
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:14,825
Really?

328
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,904
It's a token of appreciation
for my old clients.

329
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,165
-Thank you, Fangfang.
-Thank you, Fangfang.

330
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,025
Thank you.

331
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,705
Give it to me.

332
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:44,384
I thought that you hated me.
Why are you helping me?

333
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:45,424
I don't want your wound

334
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,864
to open up again
by carrying these heavy things.

335
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:48,824
Don't worry.

336
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,455
I won't pester you

337
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:53,565
and ask you to be responsible for it.

338
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:12,024
-Mr. Chen, I've secured the beam.
-Yes.

339
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,904
You can live here without any worries.

340
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,515
Grandpa, step aside.

341
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,344
Hurry and take a sip.

342
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,264
Thank you.

343
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:19,824
Did you really fix it?

344
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:20,665
Yes.

345
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:23,025
You must be exhausted.

346
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:26,465
Mr. Chen.

347
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,184
You did all the hard work.

348
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,805
Why don't you take a sip first?

349
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:32,475
No, you first.

350
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:33,984
My grandpa didn't do anything.

351
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:37,024
He just stood there
and ordered you around.

352
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,135
Come on. Drink some water.

353
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,664
Young man, if you're conceited
about completing a small task,

354
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:46,704
you won't have
any great accomplishments in the future.

355
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,625
It's getting late. Let's go farming.

356
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,455
Qingqing, stay home

357
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,345
and make us lunch.

358
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,355
Qingqing, do you know how to cook?

359
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,825
-Qingqing is quite a cook.
-I...

360
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,235
Tell me. What is your favorite dish?

361
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,984
-She will make it for you.
-It's all right, Mr. Chen.

362
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,605
I can eat anything.

363
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:11,255
All right. Let's go.

364
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,005
Stay home and cook.

365
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:16,784
Be careful.

366
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:20,635
Qingqing, I'll be back to help you
in a minute.

367
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,145
Help me?

368
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:26,895
I think that you can't even help yourself.

369
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:40,705
We're going to start digging.

370
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:41,785
Mr. Chen.

371
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:44,585
I don't know how.

372
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,225
Are you telling me

373
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:48,335
that you want to quit?

374
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:50,385
No.

375
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,464
That's not what I meant.

376
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:54,275
Do you want to learn?

377
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:55,584
I'll teach you.

378
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:56,865
Yes.

379
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:03,345
One.

380
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,745
Two.

381
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:06,945
Three.

382
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:10,985
One.

383
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:12,945
Two.

384
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:53,625
Mr. Chen.

385
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:55,425
I did it.

386
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,985
I conquered this land.

387
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:01,925
You only conquered a small piece of land.

388
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:09,585
Mr. Chen.

389
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,864
I want to learn something harder.

390
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,775
-Is that really what you want?
-Yes.

391
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:30,384
Do you want to learn something
even harder?

392
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:31,785
Yes.

393
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:37,264
Mr. Chen, it's okay.

394
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,984
-It's all right, Mr. Chen.
-Listen to me.

395
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,504
-It's okay.
-Take your time and learn.

396
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:41,624
You'll definitely ace it.

397
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:45,335
-Mr. Chen, no--
-Don’t worry. I'll teach you.

398
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,345
Here.

399
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:50,344
Manure the field
with our heirloom fertilizer.

400
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,775
Sure, no problem.

401
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,105
Mr. Chen.

402
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,745
This fertilizer smells good.

403
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:06,384
It has got the smell of fresh grass.

404
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:07,744
No wonder it's a family heirloom.

405
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:08,705
Of course.

406
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:10,824
It grew up eating fresh grass.

407
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,295
Its feces smell especially good.

408
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,885
-Feces?
-That's right.

409
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,105
-Whose feces?
-Its feces.

410
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,064
How are you doing, young man?

411
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,925
Are you feeling better?

412
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:44,955
Yes, I am.

413
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,424
I think that you're quite talented.

414
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,355
No. You taught me well.

415
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:56,625
I hear that you're a celebrity.

416
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,584
You're willing to come
to this impoverished place.

417
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:01,864
That's admirable.

418
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:04,105
Don't say that, Mr. Chen.

419
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,275
I honestly think

420
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,805
that this is a nice place.

421
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,905
No wonder Qingqing is always so cheerful.

422
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:19,944
Growing up in a simple
and modest place like this

423
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:22,975
must have been a very happy experience.

424
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:29,865
Hey.

425
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,024
Look, Mr. Chen.

426
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:33,305
Qingqing has finished cooking.

427
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,905
It's about time.

428
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,305
Mr. Chen.

429
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:39,464
Is your house on fire?

430
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,425
No way.

431
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:41,585
Qingqing!

432
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,225
-Qingqing.
-Qingqing.

433
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:45,464
Qingqing, you...

434
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:47,264
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

435
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,944
-Grandpa, you're back.
-Yes.

436
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:50,384
I've made dinner.

437
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,624
-You've made dinner?
-Yes.

438
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,745
Qingqing.

439
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:54,744
What happened to your face?

440
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:55,984
What's wrong with my face?

441
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,915
You look like a kitten.

442
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,695
My face is so black.

443
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,984
I'm all right. I was cooking a fish.

444
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:05,664
When I put the fish in the pan,

445
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,025
the fish started jumping.

446
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,105
It looked really painful.

447
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,235
So, I added some oil.

448
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:15,184
But after I added the oil,
it jumped even harder.

449
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,784
There was a lot of smoke.

450
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,904
I didn't know what to do.

451
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,624
I immediately poured some water into it.

452
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:24,024
And the fish just jumped out of the pan
and hit my face and body.

453
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,405
It made a mess.

454
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:26,984
Did you burn your face?

455
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,955
-I'm okay. It was hard to make a fire.
-Qingqing.

456
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,704
Why are you here?

457
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:34,144
How could you say that?

458
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:38,024
You didn't tell me you came back.
Am I still your best friend?

459
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:40,304
Lan, you came at the right time.

460
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:42,464
Come on. Let's eat together.

461
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,345
Sure.

462
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:44,905
Lan?

463
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,865
-Lan.
-Yes?

464
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:53,345
Nalan Yiyi.

465
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:56,264
What are you and my grandpa plotting?

466
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,745
Qingqing, I missed you so much.

467
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,104
Don't blame me.

468
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:02,864
Your grandpa asked me to come here.

469
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,464
Now, I'm the village beauty, Lan.

470
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:05,785
Don't blow it.

471
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,375
Who's this young man over here?

472
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:10,504
Hello, I'm Situ Feng.

473
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,224
I'm Qingqing's classmate.

474
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:14,835
I'm Lan, Qingqing's best friend.

475
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:16,185
I know you.

476
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,585
I love your songs, Feng.

477
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,905
Let's go eat.

478
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:22,735
All right. Let's go.

479
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:32,345
Qingqing.

480
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,185
What did you make?

481
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:35,955
Take a look.

482
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,825
Fried chocolate bananas.

483
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:44,415
And this is steamed perch.

484
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,095
Pumpkin and black fungus congee.

485
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,344
You'll be amazed by this one.

486
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:52,465
Healthy water beetles soup.

487
00:27:58,905 --> 00:27:59,915
I'm sorry.

488
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:04,185
That's all the ingredients
we've got right now.

489
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:06,545
Please bear with me.

490
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:12,015
Although these dishes don't look great,

491
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,115
they're Qingqing's favorites.

492
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:17,625
Do you know why?

493
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:19,465
-Why?
-Why?

494
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:23,085
Take this braised perch for example.

495
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,805
It's steamed perch.

496
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:27,704
-Steamed perch.
-That's right.

497
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,904
It has got quite a story.

498
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,704
We used to be really poor.
We didn't have money to buy meat.

499
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:34,424
We had to go fishing
if we wanted to eat fish.

500
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:36,535
Qingqing had a tough life.

501
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:38,264
She followed me from dawn until dusk.

502
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:41,224
We went through a lot of ups and downs.

503
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,784
That's why we treasure our food.

504
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:45,424
For example, this water beetle soup.

505
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,624
We didn't have money to buy meat.

506
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,384
When it was raining outside,

507
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,584
Qingqing and I would go out

508
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:54,144
to catch water beetles
and snails from ditches.

509
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,184
Look at this one. Look at its leg muscles.

510
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,224
Doesn't it look plump?

511
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:00,145
-Look, isn't it plump?
-Yes, it is.

512
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,465
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

513
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,245
I didn't know

514
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,245
that you had a tough past.

515
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,695
It must have been difficult.

516
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,345
It was all right.

517
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:18,824
Feng, you just came back from farming.

518
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,445
You must be hungry.

519
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:21,345
Here.

520
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:23,925
Go ahead and eat.

521
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:28,525
Young people should eat a lot.

522
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:30,945
Here, have a piece of fish.

523
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:32,825
Here.

524
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:34,824
Steamed perch.

525
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:35,824
Take it slow.

526
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,735
-Take it slow.
-Thank you, Mr. Chen.

527
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:40,205
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

528
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,424
You're an elder.

529
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:44,264
I should serve you a bowl.

530
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,225
Here.

531
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,545
Try this.

532
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,455
Pumpkin and black fungus congee.

533
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,785
Come on. Try it.

534
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,465
All right.

535
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,585
Lan.

536
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,744
Let me get some for you too.

537
00:29:58,745 --> 00:29:59,585
Here.

538
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:04,705
Thank you.

539
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,544
Grandpa, since you're an elder,

540
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:10,025
you should take the first bite.

541
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:14,184
The guest should take the first bite.

542
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,304
That's right.

543
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,725
Feng, you should try it first.

544
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:19,665
Then...

545
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:23,275
I will be the first to take a bite.

546
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,785
How does it taste?

547
00:30:58,385 --> 00:30:59,825
It's quite good.

548
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:01,995
It's just...

549
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:05,465
It's just a bit overcooked.

550
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:07,984
It's all right, Feng.

551
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:09,464
If the dishes are not to your taste,

552
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,275
let's have some soup.

553
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:12,775
That's right.

554
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:16,705
That's right. Water beetle soup
is good for you.

555
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,105
This soup is nutritious.

556
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:21,145
You must drink more.

557
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,865
Feng?

558
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:25,395
You two seem so intimate.

559
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:28,515
In my opinion,

560
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:30,385
Feng and Lan...

561
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:35,184
He's talented. She's beautiful.
They match each other perfectly.

562
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,425
-Don't you think so?
-Yes.

563
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,765
I feel the same way too.

564
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,315
That's good.

565
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,755
Lan, eat a little more.

566
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,385
Thank you.

567
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,175
It's delicious.

568
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:04,675
Have some too.

569
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:13,775
Feng and Lan.

570
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,135
Go and hang this bedsheet.

571
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:17,485
-Okay.
-Okay.

572
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:23,655
Let's go.

573
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:25,705
Come on.

574
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:27,725
I can do it by myself.

575
00:32:27,785 --> 00:32:30,085
Did you like today's dishes?

576
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,105
Grandpa.

577
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:52,225
Grandpa.

578
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:57,035
What are you and Nalan Yiyi
conspiring against me?

579
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:00,395
Why are you so concerned?

580
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,664
Are you afraid
that he would elope with her?

581
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:04,665
Sit down.

582
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,975
Have some tea with me.

583
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:19,425
Here.

584
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,105
Grandpa.

585
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:36,005
Situ Feng is my best friend.

586
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,944
You've already given him a hard time.

587
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:43,024
What's the purpose
of putting on that show just now?

588
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:44,185
Your friend?

589
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,424
Does he still want to be your friend

590
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,425
after seeing the ugly

591
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,104
and poor side of you?

592
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,225
Grandpa.

593
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:56,015
How could you ridicule
your own granddaughter?

594
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,065
Besides,

595
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:00,335
I believe that Situ Feng

596
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,305
is not such a superficial person.

597
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,445
If this young lad

598
00:34:06,225 --> 00:34:08,945
can't even overcome this challenge,

599
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:12,155
he doesn't qualify as your friend.

600
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:25,464
I will do it.

601
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:26,424
That's not necessary.

602
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,435
I can do it on my own.

603
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,104
Don't be so polite.

604
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,584
You're the guest.

605
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,555
I should show hospitality as the host.

606
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:47,224
I'm polite to you simply
because you're Qingqing's best friend.

607
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:50,784
I don't want to put her
in a difficult position.

608
00:34:50,785 --> 00:34:51,845
Actually I--

609
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:55,785
Goodness.

610
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:00,225
Get up.

611
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:02,845
Chen Qingqing.

612
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:15,704
Hey, Qingqing.
Don't tell me that you came to Korea?

613
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:17,664
<i> I hope that I could always
keep you company.</i>

614
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:21,184
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

615
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,184
<i>Even if no one likes me,</i>

616
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:25,184
-I don't care.
-I like you.

617
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:28,105
<i>Situ Feng has done so much for me,</i>

618
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,264
<i>yet I've been lying
to him this whole time.</i>

619
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:31,385
<i>Qingchen.</i>

620
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:35,344
<i>The granddaughter of Chen Xiaotian,
the wealthiest man in Jincheng.</i>

621
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:38,265
Chen Qingqing, if Situ Feng finds out

622
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,104
<i>that you've been lying to him,</i>

623
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:41,785
<i>what will happen?</i>

624
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,735
<i>I have the answer now.</i>

625
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,835
