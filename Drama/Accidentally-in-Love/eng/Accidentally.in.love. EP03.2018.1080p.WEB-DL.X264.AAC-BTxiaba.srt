00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,765
EPISODE 3

2
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:37,364
<i>This is the school where Dad and Mom
studied and fell in love.</i>

3
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,845
<i>I finally found you.</i>

4
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:55,805
Sir.

5
00:01:55,885 --> 00:02:00,125
-I'm getting off work.
-I came to pay the tuition fee.

6
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,164
Okay, let me take a photo of you.

7
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,005
Okay.

8
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:16,625
Sit properly.

9
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,524
Raise your head.

10
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,565
Don't smile.

11
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,884
Sir, I'd like to ask you something.

12
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,275
Who's the man in the portrait?

13
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,924
That is Mr. Xiao Jingnan.

14
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,484
He's an honorary alumnus
of our school.

15
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,924
He used to be
the president of the Student Council

16
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,524
and has made great contributions
to the school.

17
00:02:56,525 --> 00:03:00,525
Sir, is Mr. Xiao teaching at this school?

18
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,445
No.

19
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,524
He left school after graduation.

20
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,884
Do you know where he went?

21
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,045
I don't know.

22
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,204
Why are you asking about this?

23
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,045
Nothing.

24
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:13,924
Okay, here is your student ID
and your admission information.

25
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,164
Classes start tomorrow.

26
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,484
You can go to the dormitory, unpack

27
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,364
and familiarize yourself with the campus.

28
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,724
-Okay.
-Off you go.

29
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,055
-Bye, sir.
-Bye.

30
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,685
NAME: CHEN QINGQING

31
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,435
What happened, my little devil?

32
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,564
What do you mean what happened?

33
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,084
When did you get a fiancée?

34
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,604
<i>Jiujing News, Yuncheng Evening News</i>

35
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:40,925
and all kinds of social media

36
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,164
are keeping a close eye
on your personal life.

37
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:45,764
In our contract, we said you were an idol
with positive influence.

38
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,004
Do you know what that means?
Is it important that you can sing?

39
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,525
-Yes.
-No.

40
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,124
Is it important that you can act?

41
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,125
-Yes.
-No.

42
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,484
Is it important
that you're not in a relationship?

43
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,685
Is it?

44
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,085
Yes!

45
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:01,244
You must not allow any female creature
to get ten meters near you.

46
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,045
You must be detached.

47
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,284
You must be lovable.

48
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,084
Your fans will have the impulse
to nurture you the moment they see you.

49
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,525
They will say, "Poor thing,

50
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:10,964
I must spend money on you, baby."

51
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:13,844
That means there can't be any rumors
about you being in a relationship.

52
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:17,385
Can you stop creating trouble,
my little devil?

53
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:21,164
See? Even the paparazzi is calling me.

54
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:24,975
I don't know how they are
going to blackmail us.

55
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:27,525
Mr. Li.

56
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:28,844
<i>-Hello.
-Hi.</i>

57
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:32,084
Yes, we haven't been in touch
for quite some time.

58
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,604
<i>My line of work keeps me busy.</i>

59
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,484
<i>Many celebrities are making news recently,
even your Situ Feng.</i>

60
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,964
<i>I have received some photos here.</i>

61
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,444
<i>But I have some questions
that I want to confirm with you first</i>

62
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,564
<i>before I publish it.</i>

63
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:42,685
No problem.

64
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,204
If you have any questions,
you should talk to me immediately.

65
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,045
Please.

66
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,804
<i>Then I'll be straight.</i>

67
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,844
<i>In the photos,
Situ Feng is kissing a girl.</i>

68
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:53,484
<i>That girl is too ugly
to be Situ Feng's girlfriend or fiancée.</i>

69
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,484
<i>I just want to know
if there is an inside story.</i>

70
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,844
<i>Who is this girl?</i>

71
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:59,004
<i>Is she one of Situ Feng's crazy fans?</i>

72
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,724
That girl is a new assistant
in our agency.

73
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,524
This is a misunderstanding.

74
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,804
<i>-A misunderstanding.
-You're too good to your assistants.</i>

75
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,644
<i>How about you give me
an exclusive interview?</i>

76
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:10,444
<i>I want to interview your assistant.
She must really want to be famous.</i>

77
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,404
No problem. I'll arrange it.

78
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,124
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

79
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,325
Okay, bye.

80
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,805
This...

81
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:30,605
Situ Feng,
from which garbage dump did she come from?

82
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,284
I was worried about the rumors earlier.

83
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,204
Now, it seems completely unnecessary.

84
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,364
It's impossible for you two
to be together.

85
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,445
Gosh.

86
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,675
What a relief.

87
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,204
Well, let's get our story lined up.

88
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:44,165
Just say she's your fan.

89
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,785
What's her name?

90
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,325
Chen...

91
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:56,805
Chen Zuipao?

92
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:57,845
Chen Zuipao?

93
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,575
Is that a real name?

94
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,325
I can't remember.

95
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,125
Where is she now?

96
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,124
-I don't know.
-You don't know where the first person

97
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,015
you kissed on screen is?

98
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,395
Come in, please.

99
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,924
I just transferred here this semester.

100
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,204
My name is Chen Qingqing.

101
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,004
Hello, my name is Zhang Fangfang.

102
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:32,244
The superintendent
has already informed me.

103
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,195
You can call me Qingqing.

104
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:35,484
May I call you Fangfang?

105
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:36,365
Sure.

106
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,645
Nice to meet you.

107
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,525
This dormitory is great.

108
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,125
Qingqing.

109
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,724
Did you just bring this one bag with you?

110
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:55,565
Yes.

111
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:59,835
How will you go to bed
if you don't have a bedsheet?

112
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,015
I thought the school would prepare one.

113
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,445
No, they won't.

114
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:06,884
Shall I take you to buy them later?

115
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,044
-That would be great.
-Okay.

116
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:09,404
Then you should rest first.

117
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,285
Okay.

118
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,484
-Fangfang.
-Qingqing.

119
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,684
What did you buy?

120
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:25,965
I bought a lot.

121
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,684
A drinking cup, toothpaste,
toothbrush and slippers.

122
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:30,525
Look.

123
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,164
I bought them

124
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:35,804
following "The Must-have List
for the New Semester."

125
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,124
By the way, Fangfang.

126
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,525
Do you know where are

127
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:42,324
the shelves for cameras and computers?

128
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,565
-The computer shelf?
-Yes.

129
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:51,205
That is the library.

130
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,735
-This one?
-Right.

131
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:55,195
That is our dormitory building.

132
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,155
That's where we go to classes.

133
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,055
-It's so beautiful.
-Right?

134
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:20,605
So handsome!

135
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,644
Fangfang, is there
something interesting there?

136
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,164
Let's go take a look.

137
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,404
-We'd better not get involved.
-What's wrong?

138
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:33,804
Listen, there are three popular guys
in our school.

139
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,845
Be careful when you talk about them.

140
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,404
The first one

141
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,084
<i>is the gentleman, Gu Nanxi,</i>

142
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,764
<i>who was elected as the president
of the Student Council unanimously.</i>

143
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,004
<i>As a good student who has won many awards,
he has lots of admirers.</i>

144
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:50,044
<i>He's not only good in his academics,
he's also good in sports.</i>

145
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:55,964
<i>He dominates the basketball court
and the grades list.</i>

146
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,684
<i>His killer move is his smile.</i>

147
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,364
<i>No matter how strong his opponents are,</i>

148
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,044
<i>as long as they are hit by his smile,</i>

149
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:06,725
<i>they will feel powerless
and be disarmed instantly.</i>

150
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:10,644
The second one

151
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:14,044
is the school bully,
known as the devil of Ming De,

152
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,044
<i>Lin Yiyang.</i>

153
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:19,324
<i>Rumor has it that he is shallow, vulgar
and capable of anything.</i>

154
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,004
<i>Anyway, all the students
are afraid of him.</i>

155
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:26,804
<i>Remember to never look into his eyes
for more than three seconds,</i>

156
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:29,175
<i>or...</i>

157
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:34,165
No!

158
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:36,125
No!

159
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:42,844
And the last one

160
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:45,164
is the number one popular guy
in the school,

161
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,295
an idol with countless fans.

162
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,165
So handsome.

163
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,765
Situ Feng?

164
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,644
Qingqing, do you know him?

165
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:08,764
Are you his fan too?

166
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,085
No way!

167
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,965
That good-for-nothing jerk!

168
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,285
Jerk?

169
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:37,645
Fangfang.

170
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,285
Make a guess.

171
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,804
Do you think I can hit that jerk

172
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:44,285
with this potato chip?

173
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,564
Qingqing, please do not mess
with Situ Feng.

174
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,164
He has so many fans in school.

175
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,395
You just transferred here.
Don't you want to stay here?

176
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:12,885
Fangfang, is that Lin Yiyang?

177
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,655
Yes, let's get out of here.

178
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:18,125
Situ Feng.

179
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,324
Your fiancée is there.
Why don't you look after her?

180
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,085
-Fiancée?
-Fiancée?

181
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:30,524
I saw it on the internet yesterday
that he was kissed by someone.

182
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:31,795
But the woman...

183
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,985
-No way.
-No way.

184
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,615
Is that the woman who kissed him?

185
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,165
-No way.
-No way.

186
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,364
I don't have a fiancée.

187
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,525
I don't know that person.

188
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,205
Don't mind him.

189
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,805
Don't mind him, Qingqing. Let's go.

190
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:08,755
I'm furious.

191
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:15,745
-You again?
-You again?

192
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,165
You are really obsessive.

193
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,444
You even chased him to school.

194
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:25,004
What will you do this time
to harass Situ Feng?

195
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,284
-It's none of your business.
-Who the hell are you?

196
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,164
How dare you speak to Xinya like that?

197
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,364
Do you know that we are
the Goddess members?

198
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,765
The Goddess?

199
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:39,444
A group of women
who are beautiful, rich and powerful

200
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,165
in Ming De College.

201
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:45,165
Our lives are simply unimaginable to you.

202
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:48,565
Rich?

203
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,085
Beautiful?

204
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:54,205
Your faces seem to disagree with you.

205
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:55,125
You...

206
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,444
What did you say?

207
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:58,524
You stained Xinya's clothes.

208
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,804
Qingqing, can you wipe it off?

209
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,364
Civilians are civilians.

210
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,604
Do you know how expensive this dress is?

211
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,645
Wipe it off?

212
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:07,405
Right.

213
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:12,724
I know you are the kind of person
Situ Feng hates the most.

214
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,524
Xinya, don't waste your time
talking to her.

215
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,644
Make her pay for your clothes.

216
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,924
Well, why don't I take you to the bathroom
and clean it for you?

217
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,355
How can I wear the clothes
that you touched?

218
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,565
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:33,805
It's hard for a civilian
to control our emotions.

220
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:36,484
How much is the cost
of your clothes in total?

221
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,364
Anyway, it's the first day
of the new semester.

222
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,684
You should wear new clothes.

223
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,924
Consider it as my gift to you.

224
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,365
Or charity.

225
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,035
You're rude!

226
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,465
What's going on?

227
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:47,964
This girl doesn't belong here.

228
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:49,964
I don't know how she got into our school.

229
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,764
I'm a student of this school.

230
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,165
She really is.

231
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:54,204
Aren't you a liar?

232
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:58,185
How could you afford
the tuition fee for our school?

233
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,764
Miss, do you have
the student ID of our school?

234
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:04,275
I do. Fangfang, help me hold it.

235
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,924
Where is my student ID?

236
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,844
-Did you leave it in the dorm?
-I guess so.

237
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,284
-I'll get it for you.
-Thank you.

238
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,835
Zhang Fangfang,
you'd better stay out of this.

239
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,684
Sir, it poses a great threat
to our personal safety

240
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,495
to let outsiders get into the school.

241
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:26,004
It's a very serious security failure.

242
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,364
I will retain the right
to complain to the security office.

243
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:30,684
I'm sorry, Ms. Lan.

244
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,585
I'll take her away now.

245
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:37,045
I'm really a student of this school.

246
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,805
I want to sue!

247
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:48,685
I want to sue the society
for judging people by their looks!

248
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:53,044
Qingqing, I went back to the dormitory
to get your student ID,

249
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,164
but it was taken away
by the Goddess member.

250
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:56,884
It's the Goddess again.

251
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,885
And I went to find the school lecturers

252
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,164
but they were not there.

253
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:05,395
I can only get a temporary student ID
for you tomorrow.

254
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,725
Thank you, Fangfang.

255
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,885
You are my first friend in this city.

256
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,644
So what are you going to do today?

257
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,124
What else can I do?

258
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,044
I can only look around
the surrounding neighborhood.

259
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,284
Is there any interesting place
I can go to?

260
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,964
Would you like to join me?

261
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,115
Wait a minute.

262
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:26,725
Yes?

263
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,765
Okay, I'm on my way.

264
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,004
Qingqing, there is an emergency.
I have to go.

265
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,655
I'll call you later.

266
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,884
Hello? Have you had dinner, Grandpa?

267
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:04,964
So you still care whether
your grandpa has had dinner or not.

268
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,164
I thought you had forgotten me.

269
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:10,684
How could I forget my grandpa
who's so handsome and wise,

270
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:14,005
majestic and powerful?

271
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,285
That's enough.

272
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:19,665
At least let me know
where you are right now

273
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:22,804
<i>or I will be worried.</i>

274
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,324
Okay, I'll tell you.

275
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,564
<i>I'm in Yuncheng.</i>

276
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,564
Do you think I will believe that?

277
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:29,844
I'm telling you the truth.

278
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:30,924
I'm not going back.

279
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:36,044
<i>-Bye.
-Don't think I can't find you if you--</i>

280
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:38,524
<i>No one will send me food,</i>

281
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,804
<i>I'll have to look for food
every day myself.</i>

282
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:44,985
<i>It's so tiring.</i>

283
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,175
Qingqing already knew

284
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,444
that I sent people to find her
in Yuncheng.

285
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,515
She must have already left.

286
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:59,484
Send more people to look for her
in the surrounding cities.

287
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,685
She shouldn't have gone far.

288
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,485
Yes, sir.

289
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,725
FENG CAFE

290
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,665
Miss, excuse me,
do you accept credit card?

291
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,324
No, we only accept cash.

292
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,405
There's an ATM over there.

293
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:26,045
PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

294
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,015
YOUR BALANCE IS 100 YUAN

295
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,445
Miss, I'm back.

296
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,165
-Here.
-Thank you.

297
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:39,525
"His Highness's favorite food?"

298
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,244
<i>How much influence does this guy have?</i>

299
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,164
<i>Never mind.</i>

300
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:50,284
<i>We won't see each other again anyway.</i>

301
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:51,125
Miss.

302
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:53,605
I want this one.

303
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:08,524
Miss, bill please.

304
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,485
Okay.

305
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,285
It's 120 yuan.

306
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,135
-It's 120 yuan?
-Yes.

307
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,365
Miss.

308
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,005
I only have 100 yuan.

309
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,564
I'm 20 yuan short.

310
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,204
Can I owe you for now?

311
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:25,725
The boss is coming.

312
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,125
I'm coming.

313
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,925
IOU AGREEMENT

314
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:46,645
Miss.

315
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:50,765
I have already written you
an IOU Agreement.

316
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,685
You...

317
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,004
Who told you to use this?

318
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,964
This is Situ Feng's limited edition
poster that I collected.

319
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,845
You ripped it apart.

320
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:06,885
Look.

321
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:10,325
Half of His Highness's face is gone.

322
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,085
I'm sorry, miss.

323
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,605
Do you know

324
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,084
she reserved all the front row seats

325
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,005
to get this poster?

326
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:26,644
It has his autograph on it.

327
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:28,785
And the sweat of his hands!

328
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,325
You tore it apart?

329
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,115
Who the hell are you?

330
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,245
Then I'll pay.

331
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:37,284
I'll pay you back.

332
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,364
Do you think money can solve everything?

333
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:42,245
I'll make you pay!

334
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:54,124
I want you to apologize to His Highness.

335
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,204
What's so great about Situ Feng?

336
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,725
He's just a little bit handsome.

337
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:01,245
"A little bit handsome"?

338
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,804
When did you go blind?

339
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:06,124
We've all seen
his efforts and developments.

340
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,084
His singing, his dancing, even his smile

341
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,684
would light up our whole world.

342
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:12,885
Five, six, seven, eight.

343
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,405
HIS HIGHNESS IS THE BEST

344
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:21,165
-Wow.
-Wow.

345
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,844
<i>His Highness is on
the cover of Bourgeoisie.</i>

346
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,645
I bought 100 copies this time

347
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,644
and asked my relatives and friends
to buy it too

348
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,355
to pump up the sales.

349
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:38,765
Didn't you buy 20 VIP tickets
of His Highness's year-end tour last time?

350
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,244
How could you still have money
to buy so many magazines?

351
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,845
I'm jealous.

352
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:46,055
There's something you don't know.

353
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,084
-What is this?
-What is this?

354
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:51,444
This is the 9FBank app a friend
of mine recommended to me recently.

355
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:53,324
It's really convenient and easy to use.

356
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,565
Look, the credit limit

357
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,645
is up to 150,000 yuan.

358
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,404
So 20 tickets are nothing,

359
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,925
I can even afford 50 tickets.

360
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:05,524
His Highness's recent tour is for charity.

361
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,284
With every ticket sold, part of the money

362
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:10,324
will be donated to the unfortunate
children in the mountain area.

363
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:12,844
So I'd just consider it
as me doing charity.

364
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:17,845
To celebrate, let's order another one.

365
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:19,565
Hey!

366
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,125
Are you done?

367
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,084
It's about time you put me down.

368
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:26,205
You've gone too far.

369
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:29,055
Look, it's said on the internet

370
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:31,124
that there is a stalker
harassing His Highness.

371
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,205
-What?
-What?

372
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:38,205
"A crazy stalker of Situ Feng
was found in Ming De College?"

373
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,844
-You're the stalker!
-You're the stalker!

374
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,764
-Speak!
-Speak!

375
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,604
-What's your intention
-What's your intention

376
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,364
-coming to our fan cafe?
-coming to our fan cafe?

377
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:50,685
You won't talk?

378
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:52,205
Fine.

379
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,885
Unleash the punishment.

380
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,605
Hey!

381
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,705
What are you going to do?

382
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,284
In order to punish you,

383
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:04,365
today

384
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,084
you will have to wash 300 bowls
in this cafe.

385
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:10,284
Miss, what kind
of a weird punishment is that?

386
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,124
I have never washed any bowls in my life.

387
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,875
How long will it take for me
to wash 300 bowls?

388
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,924
If you don't want to wash the bowls,

389
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,964
then you have to tell me something.

390
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,365
What is it?

391
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,164
The kiss you had with Situ Feng.

392
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:27,965
I want to know all the details.

393
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,375
Is he a good kisser?

394
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,125
Are his lips soft?

395
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,415
What's the taste of his saliva?

396
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:38,764
Did your tongues--

397
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:39,605
Miss.

398
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,895
I'll wash the bowls.

399
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,435
I'll wash all the bowls, okay?

400
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:50,615
Since I was a kid,

401
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:53,444
I did everything
because someone forced me to.

402
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:56,764
But there wasn't a thing
I didn't finish perfectly.

403
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,765
Just some bowls...

404
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,315
How can they defeat me, Chen Qingqing?

405
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:05,525
Slow down.

406
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:08,025
They are very heavy.

407
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,065
It's okay, Qingqing.

408
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:25,555
You can cry when you feel sad.

409
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,205
-Fangfang.
-Yes?

410
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:46,435
Thank you for helping me.

411
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:49,044
You don't need to thank me.

412
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,555
Isn't that what friends are for?

413
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,685
It's probably because

414
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:58,355
I don't have any real friends growing up.

415
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,204
It's all because of that jerk, Situ Feng.

416
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,764
He deceived me and made me look like
a fool in front of so many people.

417
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:08,645
And then, he left me helpless.

418
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:11,644
I ended up washing bowls here
in the middle of the night.

419
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:13,405
If I see him again,

420
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:18,125
I'm going to kick him all the way
to the moon.

421
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:23,365
Actually, he's in our class.

422
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:36,645
Goodness, Fangfang.

423
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,725
Fangfang.

424
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,805
Qingqing, I got the student ID for you.

425
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:45,875
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

426
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:02,665
Class begins.

427
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:03,685
Stand up.

428
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,205
Good morning.

429
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:09,364
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning, ma'am.

430
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,205
Sit down.

431
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:17,165
Today, we have a new student in our class.

432
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,365
Come in.

433
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:23,644
-Why don't you introduce myself?
-Okay.

434
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,845
Hello.

435
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,445
I am Chen Qingqing.

436
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,365
Be quiet.

437
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:40,444
Have you forgotten how to behave
in class after having a vacation?

438
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:41,525
Chen Qingqing.

439
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:45,205
Only the seat in the last row
is not taken.

440
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:46,444
You can sit over there.

441
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,605
Yes, ma'am.

442
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:06,085
Hello, I am your new deskmate.

443
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,785
I'm Chen Qingqing.

444
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:21,484
...I could let go so easily?

445
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:22,605
Situ Feng.

446
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:23,884
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

447
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:25,764
<i>I would appreciate your advice.</i>

448
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,564
<i>I want you to say</i>

449
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:30,255
that you are Situ Feng's assistant.

450
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:31,884
-Assistant?
-Assistant?

451
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:33,444
<i>Chen Qingqing.</i>

452
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,484
<i>You broke into
the Student Council's office</i>

453
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:37,804
<i>and sabotaged school property
on the first week of school.</i>

454
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,084
If I don't pay...

455
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,404
-You'll be expelled.
-Sir.

456
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:43,844
I can kick you and your mom out
anytime I want.

457
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:44,765
Goodness.

458
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,245
Darling, here you are.

459
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:51,135
I've been looking for you everywhere.

460
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,615
