A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:04,805
EPISODE 15

3
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:23,765
Hello?

4
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:28,765
There's more to shoot?

5
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:34,285
Are you sure?

6
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,085
Why wasn't I aware?

7
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:38,565
All right.

8
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:57,285
"A music video series?"

9
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:02,005
Was I blind at that time?

10
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,325
How did I miss this part of the contract?

11
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,645
Qingqing.

12
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,725
Why are you up so early?

13
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:14,765
What's up?

14
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,245
It's nothing.

15
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:19,885
I guess I just fell into Situ Feng's trap.

16
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,125
A horrible trap.

17
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,245
I was told that you could even
skydive over there.

18
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:29,605
I want to go so badly.

19
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:31,205
-I really want to go!
-So cool!

20
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,245
Hey.

21
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,365
What are you guys talking about?
You sound so excited.

22
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:39,085
Hey, did you know, soon, we'll be leaving

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,925
for our college excursion.

24
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,565
College excursion?

25
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,485
It's for everyone in the Student Council.

26
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,405
A two-day and one night trip.

27
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,045
Is it like a field trip
for elementary students?

28
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,005
-What's so different about this excursion?
-Gosh.

29
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,525
Perhaps, you're not aware
that Ming De College excursion

30
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,845
has its traditions and is very popular.

31
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:59,285
It's the best time
to confess to the person you like.

32
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:03,445
Countless of romantic relationships
happened during this event.

33
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:05,765
Are you sure?

34
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,005
Of course, I am sure.

35
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,045
Look.

36
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,205
This couple.

37
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:11,845
That couple.

38
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,565
And that couple.

39
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,125
They were all a product
of last year's excursion.

40
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:20,325
Furthermore, the Leonids meteor shower

41
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,325
is happening this year.

42
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,685
The success rate for love confessions
will surely increase.

43
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:28,965
Qingqing, do you have someone you like?

44
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:29,965
Me?

45
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,605
-Yes, do you?
-Yes, do you?

46
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,565
-She's blushing.
-She's blushing.

47
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,725
-Who is it?
-No one!

48
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:46,205
All the guys here are too immature
for me to like them.

49
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,725
Class is starting.

50
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:51,045
Let's go.

51
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,245
Gu Nanxi.

52
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,805
-Yes?
-Class is starting.

53
00:02:59,005 --> 00:02:59,965
Yes, it's starting.

54
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,005
It's starting.

55
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,965
Most of you would have heard

56
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:24,925
that the time for
Ming De College's excursion has come.

57
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:29,605
Calm down!

58
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:33,925
For this excursion,
we'll be going to Luzui cliff.

59
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,405
It'll be a camping trip
for two days and one night.

60
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,845
The trip is set for this weekend.

61
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,125
Don't you have a music video shoot
this weekend?

62
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:45,765
How did you know?

63
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:49,805
I'm your assistant.

64
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,645
Isn't it normal for me to know?

65
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,085
There is going to be credits
given for this excursion.

66
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,165
Unless it is absolutely necessary,

67
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,765
you cannot excuse yourselves.

68
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,005
See.

69
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,325
I can't excuse myself.

70
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:12,205
If Situ Feng is going to the excursion,

71
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,885
does that mean I won't have
to shoot the music video?

72
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,365
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

73
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,125
Does it make you that happy
to go camping with me?

74
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,245
Situ Feng, why are you so shameless?

75
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:43,205
Hello, Daniel.

76
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,205
Okay.

77
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,565
I got it.

78
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:56,965
Okay.

79
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,565
That conversation was so short.

80
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,565
I suppose his manager is really efficient.

81
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:19,325
Hello, Daniel.

82
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:20,925
What's up?

83
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,365
Qingchen, here's the thing.

84
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:25,485
Situ Feng has plans for this weekend.
He's going to his college's excursion.

85
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:26,605
It's compulsory.

86
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,005
There'll be last minute changes
for our music video shoot.

87
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,725
Qingqing seems to be in a good mood.

88
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:33,925
Why is she giggling?
who is she talking to?

89
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,645
I see.

90
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,445
That's too bad.

91
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,725
I was all prepared for it.

92
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,045
But don't worry.

93
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,605
School is more important.

94
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:45,485
No, it's not cancelled.

95
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,005
We're just changing the location.

96
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,885
They will be going to Luzui cliff

97
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,285
so we'll shoot our music video there.
It was originally an outdoor shoot anyway.

98
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,045
Camping will start right after
the shooting.

99
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,645
We're killing two birds with one stone.

100
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,685
It might trouble you.
I hope you're okay with it.

101
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,445
No.

102
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,325
Don't worry, it won't affect you
that much.

103
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,525
I'll send you the schedule later. Bye.

104
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:07,325
Hello? I'm not finished yet. Hello?

105
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,325
Hello?

106
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,925
I wasn't even done yet.

107
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:18,965
What's wrong with you?
Are you high on drugs?

108
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,405
It's all because of you.

109
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,725
Because of me?

110
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,765
All right, you're dismissed.

111
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,405
Hand in your 10,000-word report
by tomorrow.

112
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:48,885
Ms. Chen.

113
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,045
Yes? How can I help you?

114
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,765
It's about the excursion this weekend.

115
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,485
Can I apply for a leave of absence?

116
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,725
Qingqing.

117
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:03,485
This is a compulsory trip
for all students.

118
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,565
We can't allow it.

119
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,765
Even Situ Feng can't excuse himself.

120
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:09,925
He has to come after his shoot ends.

121
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,285
Then is it possible for me
to go there a bit late?

122
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,005
I promise I won't be late
for the gathering, please?

123
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,005
Pretty please?

124
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:19,085
Can I?

125
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,205
All right.

126
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,925
Try to come as soon as possible.

127
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,605
Am I hallucinating due to extreme hunger?

128
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,685
The old witch is smiling now.

129
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,765
I think I'm hungry too.

130
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,445
LUZUI CLIFF

131
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,365
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

132
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,205
-Thank you, director.
-Thank you, director.

133
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:02,245
-Thank you, director.
-Thank you, director.

134
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:05,045
An assistant accidentally spilled
some of the warm water.

135
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,445
This is all we have left.

136
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:12,485
Qingchen, drink this. It'll warm you up.

137
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:14,005
Thank you.

138
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:17,245
Your hands are cold.

139
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:18,765
Why don't you drink it?

140
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,165
I'm all right.
My body can take it. I don't feel cold.

141
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:23,445
You should drink it.

142
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:26,205
The shoot was a success today.

143
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:29,445
The two of you look great together

144
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,445
and your chemistry has gotten better.

145
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,565
This...

146
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,645
How do you say it?

147
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,525
I have an eye for talent.

148
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:40,165
I've even thought
of your onscreen couple name.

149
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,125
Any guesses? Yes or no?

150
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,205
It's called Fengchen Couple!

151
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:45,445
Daniel.

152
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,165
Is my car ready?

153
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,125
-I'm in a hurry.
-It's over there.

154
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:50,365
Ready to go at your command.

155
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,365
What about me?

156
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,645
-How do I leave?
-Another car is on the way to fetch us.

157
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,725
-Just hang on for a while.
-Okay.

158
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:56,805
Hello?

159
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,805
What's the matter?

160
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:03,365
Well...

161
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,645
Our car broke down on the way here.
We might need to wait a little more.

162
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,925
So you're saying...

163
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,725
So I'm saying you can wait here with us.

164
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,845
Qingchen, are you in a hurry?

165
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,485
I...

166
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,805
Why don't you go with me?

167
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,685
My driver can drop me off
at the camping site

168
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,085
then send you off to town.

169
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,845
Should I tell him I'm heading
to the campsite too?

170
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:31,965
But we can't go together.

171
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,765
Don't trouble yourself.

172
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:36,605
I don't have any plans later
so I'm not in that much of a hurry.

173
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,005
Why don't you take his car?

174
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,205
I have no idea what time the other car
can make it here.

175
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:42,325
That's right, it's better to be in a car

176
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,085
-than to wait here.
-That's right.

177
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,525
They're right. Let's go.

178
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,285
Okay, screw it.

179
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:49,765
Okay.

180
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,205
Would the two of you follow us
to change your outfits?

181
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,205
Okay.

182
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,485
Fengchen Couple!

183
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,325
Isn't it awesome? Tell me it's awesome!

184
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,685
-It's awesome.
-Can't you add a little more zest?

185
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,525
Can't you say it like it's really awesome?

186
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,325
Qingchen, you did a good job today.

187
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,765
You did a better job than me

188
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,605
even with your packed schedule.

189
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,765
Whereas for me,
this is my only trip for today.

190
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,925
Right, last time I said
I'd take you to Yuncheng.

191
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:21,925
Gu Nanxi invited you several times,
but you weren't available.

192
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,285
There's always a chance next time.

193
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:28,365
Screw that. Let's do it today.

194
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,925
Luzui cliff is a popular destination
in Yuncheng after all.

195
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:34,125
But...

196
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,365
Didn't you say that you were free?

197
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,005
Yes, I did.

198
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,325
But the thing is

199
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:46,285
everyone there is your classmate

200
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,285
and I don't know anyone.

201
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,645
I don't think it's a good idea for me
to show up like that.

202
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:54,485
Don't worry, they're all really friendly
and Gu Nanxi will be there too.

203
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,485
You know him, right? Let's go.

204
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,045
But...

205
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,725
What do I do with Chen Qingqing now?

206
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:10,645
Gu Nanxi.

207
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,005
Qingchen?

208
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:17,725
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:20,005
You should thank your friend.

210
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:21,725
He dragged me here.

211
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:25,965
What a surprise, isn't it?

212
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:27,285
Yes, what a surprise.

213
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,125
But in a panicked kind of way.

214
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,045
Have a seat.

215
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:34,645
Please.

216
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,685
Situ Feng came with someone really pretty.

217
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,565
I saw them just now.

218
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,205
Could they be a couple?

219
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:46,405
Who would date Situ Feng?
His fans will get really mad at her.

220
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,125
-Hey, Xinya.
-Feng.

221
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,205
Why are you here?

222
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,445
Isn't this our beautiful Miss Qingchen?

223
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,525
Yes, it's me.

224
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,565
It has been a while.

225
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,925
You're not a student from Ming De College.

226
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,485
Why are you here for our excursion?

227
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:10,885
Xinya, stop it.

228
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,045
We're all friends.

229
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,805
That's right, we're all friends.

230
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,765
-Can't we just hang out?
-She's my friend?

231
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,005
Chen Qingqing is gone,

232
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,805
but now Qingchen is here.

233
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:22,125
This sucks.

234
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,245
That's right.

235
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:26,565
Where's Chen Qingqing?

236
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,485
She's going to be late.

237
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,765
She told me that she's still on the way.

238
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,085
Give her a call.

239
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,445
Why isn't she picking up?

240
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,445
Chen Qingqing is an idiot.

241
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,525
Why is she running off on her own?

242
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,085
Chen Qingqing is a smart person.
She's going to be fine.

243
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:49,965
Don't worry.

244
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:50,965
Yes.

245
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,285
I don't think that classmate of yours

246
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:54,725
is unreliable.

247
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,805
Maybe she just didn't want to come.

248
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,485
This isn't an easy place to find.
Could she have really gotten lost?

249
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:02,565
Of course she wouldn't.

250
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,045
She's always full of ideas.

251
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,525
-Let's inform the lecturer.
-No.

252
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,165
This won't do. I will go look for her.

253
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,885
-Gu Nanxi, take care of Qingchen for me.
-Okay.

254
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:13,925
Hey, Feng.

255
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,445
Look around.

256
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,325
It's too dangerous
to be going around alone.

257
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:19,725
Let's just wait a little longer.

258
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,285
Xinya, I will be back soon.

259
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,405
Qingchen, I'm sorry.
I'm going to look for someone.

260
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,805
I'm sorry, guys.

261
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,965
I need to go to the washroom.

262
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:33,405
I'll go with you.

263
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:34,885
It's okay.

264
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,965
I'd like to walk around on my own.

265
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,005
Don't worry.

266
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:41,125
I'm not going to get myself lost
like that friend of yours.

267
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:55,485
Chen Qingqing!

268
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:57,165
Chen Qingqing!

269
00:13:58,565 --> 00:13:59,685
Chen Qingqing!

270
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:01,485
Chen Qingqing!

271
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,485
Chen Qingqing.

272
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,765
Where did you go?
Why didn't you pick up your calls?

273
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,845
My cell phone's battery died.

274
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,165
What happened to your leg?

275
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:20,485
It's nothing. I'm here
because I wanted to use the washroom,

276
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,205
but when I came out of the washroom,

277
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:24,165
I noticed all the trees here

278
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,365
looked the same

279
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,405
so I walked around
and that's how I got lost.

280
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:30,285
Then I realized,

281
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:32,605
there were so many steps here

282
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:36,765
so I walked and walked
and sprained my leg.

283
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,805
Sit down, let me have a look at it.

284
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,485
-I...
-Mind yourself.

285
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:42,325
It's not a big deal. Seriously.

286
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:44,645
Where does it hurt?

287
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,005
-Here.
-Here?

288
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,765
It's your ankle again?

289
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,885
You're going to develop
chronic injuries, you know?

290
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:53,365
It's not that serious.

291
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:56,645
Don't lie to me.
Do you know everyone's worried about you?

292
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:58,525
Worried?

293
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,525
Are you saying you're worried about me?

294
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:08,405
Of course.

295
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,285
I was not the only one.

296
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,645
Gu Nanxi was also worried.

297
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,565
So was Fangfang.

298
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:14,845
Everyone was worried about you.

299
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,045
Can you walk?

300
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,285
Of course I can walk. Do you want to bet?

301
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,125
I can even run 100 meters

302
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,405
and be way ahead of you.

303
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:27,365
Just like this.

304
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,605
All right, save your energy for now.

305
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,005
Slow down.

306
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,765
Let's take baby steps.

307
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:37,085
Is your ankle really fine?

308
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,925
I have a friend to introduce you.

309
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,405
Friend? What friend?

310
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:43,565
Her name is Qingchen.

311
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:45,765
Qingchen?

312
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:48,285
Yes, I've told you about her many times.

313
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,605
Slowly. We're back.

314
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,045
-Hi, Munian. Gosh.
-Slow down.

315
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,925
-You're finally here.
-Yes.

316
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,605
You didn't pick up our calls.
We were really worried.

317
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,765
I'm so smart.
What could've happened to me?

318
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,605
-Am I right?
-You're right.

319
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,165
All you know is how to sprain your ankle.

320
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,485
I told you.

321
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,765
You guys were worried for nothing.

322
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:16,125
Hey.

323
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:18,245
Where's Qingchen?

324
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,645
Well, she said she wanted
to walk around for a while.

325
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:27,365
It's been half an hour.
Could something have happened?

326
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,005
Gu Nanxi.

327
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,125
This place is so isolated
for a girl to be alone.

328
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,165
You should look for her.

329
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:39,885
What's wrong with you?

330
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,085
Nothing. I just choked myself.

331
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,645
This is just a thought.

332
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,445
Maybe Qingchen

333
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,725
just wanted to have a look around

334
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:54,005
and spend some time by herself, you know?

335
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:57,365
Perhaps you guys shouldn't disturb her.

336
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,125
Hey, this won't do.

337
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,685
I brought her here.
I can't let her get into any accidents.

338
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,325
I'll have to go look for her.

339
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,885
I think I'm going to the washroom now.

340
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:14,045
I will be right back in a while.

341
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:15,805
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,005
Please help me look after this, thanks.

343
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:19,805
I'll be quick.

344
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:20,725
I'll be really quick!

345
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,165
Qingchen!

346
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,525
Were you looking for me?

347
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,405
We've found Qingqing.
I'll introduce you to each other.

348
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:35,485
-What?
-Let's go.

349
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:37,005
Where's Qingqing?

350
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:42,845
Qingqing, where are you going now?

351
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,005
To the washroom.

352
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,445
Where's Qingchen?

353
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,205
Hey, where's Chen Qingqing?

354
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,165
Where's Qingchen?

355
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,685
Where's Chen Qingqing?

356
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:01,805
Why is she gone again?

357
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,525
I'm going to look for her.

358
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:04,925
I'm sorry, please excuse me.

359
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,805
I need another visit to the washroom.

360
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,325
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

361
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,165
Gu Nanxi.

362
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,085
Why are you here?

363
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:34,125
Were you looking for Chen Qingqing?

364
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,765
Let me help you check
if she's in the washroom.

365
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,485
You don't have to pretend anymore.

366
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:43,765
I already know everything.

367
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:49,005
Qingchen is Chen Qingqing.

368
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,445
When did you find out?

369
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:04,325
Actually, it's been a while.

370
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,005
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:11,565
I believe you have your reasons.

372
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,965
Otherwise, you wouldn't want
to trouble yourself like that.

373
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,165
That's true.

374
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,045
The reason I'm here is because of my dad.

375
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,485
You probably didn't know this.

376
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:25,525
I've never met my mom and dad
since I was little.

377
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,885
My grandpa was the one who raised me.

378
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,725
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:32,565
No worries.

380
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,285
After my mom passed away,

381
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,445
my dad disappeared.

382
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,685
That's why I disguised myself.

383
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,765
I came to this college
without telling my grandpa.

384
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,845
It is all because I wanted
to search for my dad.

385
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:47,685
He graduated from Ming De College too.

386
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:50,045
Have you found anything yet?

387
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,965
This was what I found recently.

388
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,605
Not only was my dad an honors graduate,

389
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,725
he was also the president
of the Student Council.

390
00:19:57,365 --> 00:20:00,085
No wonder you've been asking me
about the Student Council.

391
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,685
So are you planning

392
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:06,765
to ever tell Situ Feng about this?

393
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,085
Actually...

394
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,405
I haven't thought about

395
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,165
how to tell him yet.

396
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:19,285
But I do realize that my lies
are slightly getting out of hand.

397
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:22,765
Once I have the information I needed,

398
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,885
I will leave this place.

399
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,845
Gu Nanxi.

400
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:31,485
Can you please help me keep this a secret?

401
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:34,125
Okay.

402
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:35,765
Qing...

403
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,285
Now, I'm confused over what to call you.

404
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:40,405
I can swear to you

405
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,525
that my name is real.

406
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,285
Chen Qingqing is my real name.

407
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:45,685
All right, Qingqing.

408
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:46,645
I promise you.

409
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,325
But you have to promise me this too.

410
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,645
If you're facing any difficulties,
you need to tell me.

411
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:53,845
Never keep it to yourself.

412
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:55,685
-Okay, I promise.
-Okay.

413
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,245
I was wondering about you guys.

414
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,205
Where's Chen Qingqing? Did you see her?

415
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:10,645
Well, Qingqing ate too much earlier

416
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:14,005
thus Qingchen and I think
we should let her rest.

417
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:16,125
Then I shall go look for her.

418
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,005
-Don't!
-Don't!

419
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,805
Well, she could be sleeping

420
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,805
so let's not disturb her.

421
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:24,885
That's right.

422
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,165
But Chen Qingqing...

423
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,245
Class President, where are you guys going?

424
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,285
It was on the news that

425
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,565
the meteor shower will start
around seven in the evening.

426
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,005
We will be able to see the meteor shower
if we go up the hill.

427
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,005
After that, it's the campfire party.

428
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,445
Don't let the lecturer hear us, let's go.

429
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,485
That sounds interesting. Let me tag along.

430
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,525
Feng.

431
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,605
Let's go watch the meteor shower.

432
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,645
What about Qingqing?

433
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,205
Don't you worry.

434
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,565
We should go watch the meteor shower
with Xinya.

435
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:07,325
Just as we said before,

436
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,325
we have to show Qingchen around Yuncheng.

437
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:11,765
You should come too.

438
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:14,725
Let's get going or we will miss it.

439
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:18,765
Let's go.

440
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,645
Fangfang, let's walk together.

441
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,325
Here.

442
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,405
It's steep here, mind your steps everyone.

443
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,525
This path seems dangerous.

444
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,405
Plus, there are so many girls with us.

445
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,165
I think we won't be able
to reach the peak in time.

446
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:44,125
There's no phone connection too.

447
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,525
For the sake of safety,
why don't we go back down?

448
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,005
I agree.

449
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:48,925
Yes.

450
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:49,925
Safety comes first.

451
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:54,085
It feels eerie here
and it gives me the chills.

452
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,285
Let's head back.

453
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:56,645
I agree.

454
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,845
Let's go then.

455
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:00,765
Okay, let's go.

456
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,645
-Feng!
-Xinya!

457
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:09,085
They fell down. What should we do?

458
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,725
No, I need to save them.

459
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:14,005
-Feng!
-Calm down, Xinya!

460
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,085
Situ Feng!

461
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,285
Qingchen!

462
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,245
Feng!

463
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:20,965
It looks very steep.

464
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,325
Xinya, why don't you go back with the rest

465
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:25,125
and call for the rescue crew?

466
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,165
No! They're in danger right now.

467
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:28,965
How do you expect me
to leave them like this?

468
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,285
We're not leaving them.

469
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,725
We just need to think
of an effective strategy to save them.

470
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,885
Hua Munian, please call
for the rescue crew.

471
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,925
Xinya, we need the rescue team
to save them.

472
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:40,645
Hurry up!

473
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:43,125
Don't worry.

474
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,005
Wait for me here.

475
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,205
I'll be back very quickly.

476
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,765
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

477
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:52,245
Class President, you should stay here

478
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,845
so the rescue crew will know
where to look for them.

479
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,525
I'll try to search for a way down.

480
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,005
Wait for me here.

481
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:26,605
Situ Feng.

482
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:27,965
Situ Feng, what's wrong?

483
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,205
Are you injured?

484
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,725
How are you feeling?

485
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:36,525
It should be fine.

486
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,445
Let's go. Let's move over there.

487
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:43,845
Slowly.

488
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:44,805
Slowly.

489
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:51,285
It should be fine.

490
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:01,965
I lost my phone. What should I do?

491
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:07,085
I lost mine too.

492
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:10,125
It's getting so dark here.

493
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,285
Without our cell phones...

494
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:15,845
What if Gu Nanxi can't find us?

495
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:17,965
What's going to happen to us...

496
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:20,565
Don't you worry.

497
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:21,605
I'm here.

498
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:28,285
Stop crying now.

499
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,405
It's freezing here.

500
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:34,085
Your tears will turn into ice
and it'll look really weird.

501
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,805
Why are you so talkative today?

502
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:43,085
Right, here.

503
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:44,885
Take it.

504
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,325
It'll keep you warm.

505
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,605
Gu Nanxi!

506
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:04,005
Gu Nanxi!

507
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:05,285
Anyone?

508
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,165
Hello!

509
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,005
Is anybody around?

510
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:18,125
Did we fall too far for them to hear us?

511
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:22,405
Probably, but I'm sure
they will come for us.

512
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,205
It's cold out here.
Let's go inside and rest.

513
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,205
This is a good opportunity to be a hero.

514
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,365
Gu Nanxi should be here.

515
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,565
I didn't expect
someone as serious as yourself

516
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,765
would choose a time like this

517
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:46,565
to make jokes about the situation.

518
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:57,245
Qingchen.

519
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,885
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

520
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,045
I'm not sure.

521
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:03,125
It hurts here.

522
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:04,565
Let me have a look.

523
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:10,765
You're injured here.

524
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:26,325
I like you.

525
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:33,805
Goodness.

526
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,925
What did I do?

527
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,245
Why am I being an idiot?

528
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,245
Qingchen.

529
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,165
When did you start liking me?

530
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,285
I'm not sure.

531
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:51,525
Maybe...

532
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,405
Maybe since the first time I met you.

533
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,845
Perhaps I've already liked you then.

534
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:04,965
I'm afraid that if I don't tell you now,

535
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,885
I might not have a chance later.

536
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:10,125
Qingchen.

537
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:12,725
I'm sorry.

538
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:17,085
I already have someone I like.

539
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,205
Who is she?

540
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:25,405
Chen Qingqing.

541
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,725
Chen Qingqing is the person I like.

542
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:39,805
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:43,125
So...

544
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:48,085
When did you start to like her?

545
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:50,165
Well...

546
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,365
At first,

547
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:58,965
I thought

548
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,685
she was rather special

549
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:03,165
even though she was troublesome at times.

550
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,365
She was

551
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:07,445
very stubborn.

552
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:11,165
She never cares if the whole world
thinks she's wrong.

553
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:13,925
She's still going to persevere.

554
00:29:16,165 --> 00:29:17,885
Whenever we spend time together,

555
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:22,685
I feel very comfortable and relaxed.

556
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:26,045
I can just be myself without feeling
the burden of being an idol.

557
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,285
Later on,

558
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,125
gradually, I realized that

559
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,845
unknowingly, I began

560
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,605
to take notice on everything she does.

561
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:37,165
I keep on looking for her.

562
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:41,405
Whenever she interacts with other guys,

563
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,565
I would feel frustrated,

564
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,565
 lousy and throw a tantrum at her.

565
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,125
Until one day,

566
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,125
I saw she was wrongly accused.

567
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:55,805
Then I knew

568
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:57,765
Chen Qingqing

569
00:29:58,485 --> 00:29:59,805
is just like any other girl.

570
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,965
She too needs to be loved and cared for.

571
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:06,125
From that moment,

572
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:07,805
I was certain

573
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:11,085
that I have fallen for her.

574
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:15,925
I have fallen deeply for her.

575
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:19,965
I want to hold her in my arms

576
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:22,845
and protect her

577
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,165
even if

578
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,845
the world is against me.

579
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,605
Qingchen, look!

580
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:44,125
It's the meteor shower!

581
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,485
If Chen Qingqing was here,

582
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:52,605
it would be perfect.

583
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:57,925
Let's make a wish.

584
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,565
Okay.

585
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,765
Qingqing, don't tell me

586
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,845
that you like Situ Feng too?

587
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,405
What do you think of Gu Nanxi?

588
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,805
Did she find out
what happened at the cave?

589
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,245
She seemed furious
whenever I mentioned Qingchen.

590
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,485
Where's Qingqing?

591
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,365
She asked me to tell you
not to go see her.

592
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,605
Excuse me.

593
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:42,925
Stop running, you pervert!

594
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:44,205
We need to catch this pervert!

595
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,325
The reason you came to this college
was because of your dad, wasn't it?

596
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,765
So it was all a lie.

597
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,165
Liar!

598
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,605
If you ever need help,
you should come and look for me.

599
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,725
-Happy Birthday, Qingqing!
-Happy Birthday!

600
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:57,965
How did you know today was my birthday?

601
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,645
Baby, you should thank our president.

602
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,445
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

603
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:04,565
