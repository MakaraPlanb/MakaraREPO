EPISODE 5

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,704
It becomes a proportional relationship
between the three horizontal segments.

3
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,775
The class is now dismissed.

4
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,424
Situ Feng is so handsome!

5
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,365
-He's so handsome!
-He's so handsome!

6
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,585
E-BOOK

7
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:17,265
I like it when he reads so quietly.

8
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,265
RECEIVABLES

9
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,765
Fangfang, are you ready?

10
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,145
Yes.

11
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:40,275
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

12
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:44,505
A school is a confined space

13
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,224
with a fixed number of individuals
and a fixed amount of purchasing power.

14
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:52,984
Thus, we can find a solution
for businesses to obtain greater benefits.

15
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,705
And we will also gain
the corresponding profits.

16
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,465
The school is full of people
who live in style.

17
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,704
When their desire for shopping

18
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:06,184
is over 1,200 steps far away
from their purchases,

19
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,464
their desire to purchase

20
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,584
will not be able
to prevail over their laziness.

21
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:13,144
So let's help them get past
these 1,200 steps!

22
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,304
It's a win-win situation.

23
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:16,984
This will already
fulfill their hidden demands.

24
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,735
And with the merchants, we can reach

25
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:22,584
a strategic cooperation.

26
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,835
You mean your errands service?

27
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,864
-Hello, everyone.
-May I have your attention, please?

28
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:35,025
Today is the first day of business
for Qingqing's Errands Service.

29
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:38,744
We'll run errands, get food from
the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.

30
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,224
Starting from just ten yuan per errand.

31
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,185
Ten yuan. Just ten yuan.

32
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,224
Really, it costs just ten yuan.
It's cheap.

33
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,904
Qingqing, I don't think
anyone is listening.

34
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:50,704
You'd better just let them come to us.

35
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,105
I have an idea.

36
00:03:57,225 --> 00:04:00,424
<i>We'll run errands, get food from
the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.</i>

37
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,264
<i>Starting from just ten yuan.</i>

38
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:05,064
<i>We'll run errands, get food
from the cafeteria and buy snacks for you.</i>

39
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,264
<i>Starting from just ten yuan.</i>

40
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,824
<i>Starting from just ten yuan.</i>

41
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,424
Hey, what are you doing?

42
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,104
Chen Qingqing, you're seriously
disturbing my studies.

43
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:17,435
You too, your studying is seriously
disturbing my campaign.

44
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:21,845
-Are you trying to argue with me?
-So what if I am?

45
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,625
He's so handsome!

46
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:36,185
Some people just come here
with an ax to grind.

47
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,344
I think you're not really studying.

48
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:46,515
Are you doing this just to please
your fans out there?

49
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,464
What are you looking at?

50
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:56,144
"To the ugly person, being peered at
is a kind of cruelty."

51
00:04:56,145 --> 00:05:01,885
<i>-Situ Feng!
-From Qian Zhongshu's Fortress Besieged.</i>

52
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,305
Are you done yet, Situ Feng?

53
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,245
Qingqing, that's enough.

54
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,504
I think starting a business is going to be
tough at the beginning.

55
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,824
No one changes their habits that fast.

56
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,915
That's right!

57
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,185
So, whenever there's a new product,

58
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:26,125
it will need a marketing trial
to give some input.

59
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:30,445
I need people to try the sample
to see if it works.

60
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,384
You mean, someone to promote it?

61
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,464
Do you need Situ Feng?

62
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,665
Oh, no.

63
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,265
You know Situ Feng.

64
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:40,144
He always puts up that sour face.

65
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,304
If we have him,

66
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,424
they'll surely think he's plotting
something with us,

67
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,685
or that I'm blackmailing him!

68
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,555
And most importantly,

69
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:50,935
I don't like him.

70
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,465
But I've found my first customer.

71
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:56,885
Don't you worry.

72
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,785
I'm sure he's the right candidate.

73
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:03,625
He has a good image
and is great at persuasion.

74
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:11,185
Qingqing.

75
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,824
Can you please get me a beef rice set
from the cafeteria?

76
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:14,824
Plus, a bottle of cola.

77
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,525
Sure, coming right up.

78
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,105
Here.

79
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:24,104
Okay, I've made payments for the meal
and the errands.

80
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,825
Thanks for coming, Mr. Gu.

81
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,904
Does anyone else want to try?

82
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:31,905
Anyone else?

83
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,385
-Me!
-Me!

84
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,105
-Me!
-Write it down.

85
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:39,384
-It's so lively here.
-What's going on?

86
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:40,864
-Let's check it out.
-Let's go see.

87
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:43,224
Who wants the set that Gu Nanxi bought?

88
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:44,425
-Me!
-Me too!

89
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,024
-Me too!
-That makes three.

90
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:46,944
What would you like?

91
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,064
-Coffee milk.
-Coffee milk.

92
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,024
-Coffee milk for two.
-Gu Nanxi.

93
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,584
-Could you get me some snacks?
-Sure, anything you want.

94
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,625
What is it?

95
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,105
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

96
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,575
Are you possessed?

97
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:02,435
This isn't the first time
you're surrounded by fans.

98
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,075
-Three for you.
-Okay, let's go.

99
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:19,805
SPECIAL PRICE

100
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:47,985
Fangfang, you go to Class 3
while I go to Class 1.

101
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,025
Guys, here comes your snacks!

102
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,264
Come and see which one is yours.

103
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,224
-Who does this belong to?
-This one...

104
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,824
This is the QR code for our service.

105
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:02,264
Everyone, please take note.

106
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,595
Please take note.

107
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,784
Chen Qingqing is so broke,
she's even running errands on campus.

108
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:12,344
The entire Ming De College
has fallen under her spell!

109
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,344
And she's sitting next to Situ Feng.

110
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:15,304
Shut up, will you?

111
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,904
-Here are your snacks!
-Thanks.

112
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:20,085
-We'll send them over after class.
-Sure.

113
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,905
Your afternoon tea is here, guys!

114
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:32,905
I want this one!

115
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:46,285
This is for you.

116
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,905
Chen Qingqing, you...

117
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:52,545
Just open it!

118
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,464
Sorry, I have to turn it down.

119
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,584
-I'm not opening it.
-Situ Feng.

120
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:02,645
Do you want me to read it out
in front of everyone?

121
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:03,745
Hey.

122
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,544
Let me make it clear.

123
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,175
I don't want to have anything
to do with you.

124
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:15,465
-Hey.
-“Dear--"

125
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,665
Chen Qingqing.

126
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,224
Just give it up already.

127
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,984
I've got fans queuing up all over.

128
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,675
-You'd better wait in line.
-Gosh.

129
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,425
Situ Feng.

130
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,224
I'm not the type who's going to...

131
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,145
Goodness.

What is this about?

135
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:53,345
This is our new errands service.
Delivering love letters.

136
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,305
These are all for you.

137
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,615
Do you think I would approve that?

138
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:01,384
I'm trying to keep you popular.

139
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,984
I heard that you can't possibly
turn down fans' love letters.

140
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:08,304
Rather than have them line up outside
and disrupt everyone else's studies,

141
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:11,464
how about I make this more
professional and systematic

142
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:14,895
so everyone will benefit the most
out of it?

143
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:16,265
Look.

144
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,304
This, for instance.

145
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:19,255
To show respect, 20 yuan.

146
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:22,135
To show affection, 30 yuan.

147
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,825
To show lust, 50 yuan.

148
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,055
An autograph will cost you 100 yuan.

149
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:29,984
And this is the best one.

150
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,625
A reply will cost you 250 yuan!

151
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:40,544
All right. You want the money so badly,
so I'll give you a chance to earn big.

152
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:42,265
How kind of you!

153
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:45,144
I want to treat everyone for a drink.

154
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,525
I want the extra-large bottles!

155
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,824
One bottle for each person!

156
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,395
You can charge how much you want!

157
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,225
Zhang Fangfang, our business is growing!

158
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,465
Come here!

159
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,385
We accept your deal.

160
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:00,545
Okay.

161
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,744
Here's the money.

162
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,385
You'd better deliver.

163
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:04,985
You bet!

164
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,745
Fangfang, take this.

165
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,225
Sit down.

166
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,624
Qingqing, why aren't you buying anything?

167
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,445
-Buy what?
-The drinks!

168
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,464
Is Miss Chen Qingqing in this class?
We're delivering some drinks here.

169
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:45,264
Yes, just put them over there.

170
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,145
Sure.

171
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:47,545
Hey.

172
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,944
The campus supermarket
must be doing great now.

173
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,864
We placed our order online
for them to deliver.

174
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,515
Don't you know that?

175
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:00,105
So you're trying to outwit me?

176
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,785
Chen Qingqing!

177
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,664
We're late for swimming class.
Let's go! Run!

00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,955
Gather around here once you've changed.

180
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:19,745
Fangfang.

181
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:21,975
Isn't that a bit too much?

182
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:26,504
I haven't mastered my swimming
for the past ten years or so.

183
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:30,315
So I've got to pass this one
with flying colors!

184
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:31,545
All right.

185
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:36,144
There are 15 minutes left before we begin
our swimming lessons for today.

186
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:37,584
You can do what you want for now.

187
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:41,424
After that, let's go over there
and get your swimming caps and goggles.

188
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,365
-I'll wait for you over there.
-Okay.

189
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,305
What's up with him?

190
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,264
What kind of person is Situ Feng?

191
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,955
He's always keeping his idol image.

192
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:00,065
He won't be swimming with us.

193
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,744
When they sneak-snap on him,

194
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,304
he would cover his eight-pack.
That's what I heard.

195
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,225
No way.

196
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:08,584
I heard that Feng is seriously
obsessed with cleanliness.

197
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,305
He will only swim in private pools.

198
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:13,304
That's an idol for you.

199
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:16,785
He even takes the finest details
so seriously.

200
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,465
Let's go.

201
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:42,345
Hey.

202
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,635
Why won't you swim with us?

203
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:49,885
Why do you care?

204
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,624
How dare you speak to me like that?

205
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,584
Do you want me to push you into the pool?

206
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,545
Listen here.

207
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,885
You can joke about anything else,
but this.

208
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:04,255
What the hell?

209
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,345
Situ Feng!

210
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,955
Situ Feng, you...

211
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:19,345
Help!

212
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,025
Help!

213
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:34,665
Lin Yiyang.

214
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:41,015
If you want to learn how to swim,
you've got to overcome your fear of water.

215
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,184
Qingqing, are you okay?

216
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:46,225
Fangfang, you scared me!

217
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,465
Let's be friends.

218
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,504
Hi, I am Zhang Fangfang.

219
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:01,864
Qingqing, this is--

220
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,265
I know. He's Lin Yiyang.

221
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:13,015
Hey, did you see what just happened?

222
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:16,945
-Qingqing fell into the pool?
-Yeah.

223
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:20,125
So many people saw it, but...

224
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,464
I heard that it was Lin Yiyang.

225
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:24,225
-Really?
-Yeah.

226
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,784
He pushed Qingqing's head
into the water without helping her up.

227
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:30,144
You know the fire in our campus'
chemistry lab last year?

228
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,295
He started it.

229
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,384
Why didn't they expel him yet?

230
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:34,744
He's got connections.

231
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:39,215
Guys, Li Yiyang didn't do that.
He actually saved Qingqing.

232
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:40,605
How do you know?

233
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:41,784
I saw it myself.

234
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:42,784
I saw it myself, too.

235
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,355
You just said you heard about it.

236
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:49,264
Everyone knows that Lin Yiyang
is the big bully on campus.

237
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,384
And there you go clearing his name.

238
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,015
Are you secretly in love with him?

239
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,745
-You guys go on. I've got to--
-Hold it right there.

240
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,915
What did you just say?

241
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:04,025
Nothing.

242
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,225
-Louder!
-Nothing!

243
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,385
Get lost.

244
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,145
Lin Yiyang?

245
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,625
Yes?

246
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:12,865
Just now...

247
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,105
Mind your own business.

248
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:25,455
Fangfang, who was screaming just now?
I heard it from inside.

249
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,464
It was nothing. Come on.

250
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:29,055
What's up with you?

251
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:40,544
Today was the best day of our errands
service's first week of operations.

252
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,605
Time to count our earnings for the week.

253
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,005
Let's do it!

254
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,305
We only got this much?

255
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,955
Is this enough to cover the compensation?

256
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,424
We did great, Qingqing.

257
00:16:57,425 --> 00:17:00,944
It's much more than what I earned
from my six months at the cafeteria.

258
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,725
I'll keep it for now.

259
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,624
<i>My errands service has opened
for business for a week</i>

260
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,264
<i>and it didn't even reach 100,000 yuan.</i>

261
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,944
<i>I'm due to pay him by tomorrow the latest.</i>

262
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,624
<i>And I haven't even
joined the Student Council.</i>

263
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:23,064
<i>Am I going to be kicked out of college
just because I don't have the money?</i>

264
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,145
DANIEL, CELEBRITY BROKER

265
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,744
Mr. Zhou, I've paid up
all the compensation.

266
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:32,904
-Don't break the rules next time.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,104
I'll follow what you told me.

268
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,315
May I go back to class now?

269
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:38,875
See you, sir.

270
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:44,815
-What are you doing here?
-Mind your own business.

271
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,185
Hey.

272
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,945
I heard you're now Feng's assistant.

273
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:53,144
Boy, the word got out fast.

274
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,944
That's right, I'm Feng's new assistant.

275
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:58,905
I'm his private, personal assistant.

276
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:03,135
Stop putting up an act.
I know that already.

277
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:06,345
But you're only an assistant by name.

278
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:09,225
That's what others think.

279
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,375
Now, I'm not only Situ Feng's deskmate.

280
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,235
I'm now his assistant.

281
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,425
His private, personal assistant.

282
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:18,745
And you.

283
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,345
You're none of that.

284
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,144
Did Qingqing really agree
to be your assistant?

285
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:32,344
That crazy bitch.

286
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:36,584
She said she wasn't a fan of mine,
yet she bought a lot of tickets.

287
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:38,584
I think you should be more careful.

288
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:42,704
You once said, whoever crosses you,
it's not going to end well for them.

289
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,755
I see that things haven't been great
for you lately.

290
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,825
This is the last one.

291
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,905
Thanks for coming.

292
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,145
-Bye.
-Bye.

293
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:00,545
Chen Qingqing.

294
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:01,984
What are you doing?

295
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:05,304
I didn't think your tickets
would sell so well.

296
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,704
All I did was post it
on the college's discussion forum

297
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,504
and everyone started asking
about the cost.

298
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:12,544
So I earned a lot
by reselling the tickets.

299
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,235
-Qingqing, you--
-Hey.

300
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,104
You didn't like her errands service,
right?

301
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:21,624
She'll stop the service
after she gets the money she needs.

302
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,635
Just like what you wanted.

303
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,345
What did you say about me?

304
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:27,705
Nothing.

305
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:33,435
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

306
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:47,425
Come on!

307
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:52,065
Golden VIP seats up for rent!

308
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,104
Right next to His Highness!

309
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,944
Nothing is stopping you to be with him.

310
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,224
Sometimes you may
run into him by accident.

311
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:02,265
It's a real face-to-face contact!

312
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,904
Limited seats available.
Hurry while stocks last!

313
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,224
SEAT FOR RENT - HIS HIGHNESS

314
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:10,464
Qingqing, don't you have
enough money already?

315
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:13,064
Even so, I can still earn more, right?

316
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,944
Besides, I've thought about it.

317
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:18,184
Neither of us want to share the same desk
with each other.

318
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,445
So instead, why don't I rent out my seat?

319
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:26,945
It just happens that I can help
those pure-hearted girls that like you.

320
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:30,704
Hey! What the hell, Situ Feng?

321
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:34,185
Your errands service
should stop right now!

322
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,025
You can go now.

323
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:39,025
Hey, don't go!

324
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,135
Situ Feng, why are you doing this?

325
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,275
Because you're my assistant.

326
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:50,375
Once you signed up to be my assistant,
if you breach the contract,

327
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:56,315
you'll need to compensate me more
than that painting is going to cost you.

328
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,385
Fine.

329
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,185
I am your assistant, Situ Feng.

330
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:03,425
Chen Qingqing is a woman of her word.

331
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:07,285
All right, my assistant.
Get me some water.

332
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:10,185
Go!

333
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,144
Hey, you spilled the water!

334
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,475
Aren't you going to drink it?

335
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:27,215
Hey, cold water? How many times do I have
to tell you? I have a sensitive stomach!

336
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:33,864
Hey, the water is so hot!

337
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:37,795
Do you want me to burn my tongue?
Get another one.

338
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:52,655
Your gym teacher has an emergency.
We'll have math instead.

339
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,775
Distribute the papers.

340
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,775
Let's see how badly you did.

341
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,385
Situ Feng.

342
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,225
I'm warning you.

343
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,384
You'd better not leave anything
I can use against you.

344
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,345
If not...

345
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:19,145
Situ Feng.

346
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,064
Do you know that you scored
the lowest in your class?

347
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:25,144
And you've lowered the class average
by three points.

348
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,065
When I call your names,

349
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,344
you'll be paired up into study groups.

350
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:31,545
Group One.

351
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:34,705
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng.

352
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:36,785
Group Two.

353
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,505
Ms. Chen, I don't want to be with her!

354
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,425
Ms. Chen.

355
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:46,184
I am very happy to accept
your arrangement.

356
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:47,744
As part of this class,

357
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:50,265
I am willing to help

358
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:51,704
someone physically underdeveloped

359
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,624
and simple-minded students

360
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,104
to step up with me
and defend the class' honor.

361
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,135
That's good.

362
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:00,535
Situ Feng, do you have any objections?

363
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:03,865
No, ma'am.

364
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:07,824
We're going to have a welcoming party
this weekend.

365
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:10,184
Every class has to come out
with a program.

366
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:11,955
Do you have any ideas?

367
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,344
Situ Feng should sing!

368
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:15,385
-Sing!
-Sing!

369
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:18,064
This requires the approval
of those involved.

370
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,935
Situ Feng, do you have any objections?

371
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:22,225
No.

372
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,544
Keep quiet now.

373
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:28,144
Let's discuss the papers.

374
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,944
Please refer to your papers.

375
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:32,575
First, let's look at question two.

376
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:10,024
<i>You were so pleased with yourself,
weren't you, Situ Feng?</i>

377
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:16,775
<i>Now, let me show you what you get
when you cross Chen Qingqing.</i>

378
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:21,624
Miss Chen Qingqing.

379
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,424
-We're so sorry for what we did.
-Yeah.

380
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:25,784
We didn't acknowledge you.

381
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:30,024
-We didn't acknowledge you.
-Yes, if you could just forgive us.

382
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:32,744
-We'll do anything to make it up to you.
-That's right.

383
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:35,504
You just have to share with us
His Highness's latest news!

384
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:38,325
Or you can just recommend us to him.

385
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:42,064
We're so envious that you can be
by His Highness's side every day!

386
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:46,585
That skin, those lips, that slender--

387
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,145
Okay, stop it.

388
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,825
I've told you before, right?

389
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,105
The reason why

390
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:57,344
they took pictures of me
with Situ Feng like that

391
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:03,545
was because we seem to be
good friends in private.

392
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:07,345
They didn't even care what sexes we are!

393
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,425
Besides,

394
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,015
for someone like Situ Feng...

395
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:16,305
He's usually quite unmanly, you know?

396
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,064
<i>Lucky for you.</i>

397
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:25,104
Everyone is getting ready
for the welcoming party.

398
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:27,264
We could use more hands here.

399
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:29,664
So I've told the secretariat about it

400
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:31,624
and they're willing to take you in.

401
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,955
I'll surely get the job done!

402
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:37,384
By the way, Mr. Gu.

403
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:38,824
Can I ask you something?

404
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:41,385
Which department is in charge

405
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,525
of our college archives?

406
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:47,344
Ming De's college archives are top secret.

407
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,264
Only those in the presidium
can access them.

408
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,275
Qingqing, why did you ask?

409
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:55,985
Oh, it's nothing. I'm just curious.

410
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:59,704
You've had a little misunderstanding
with someone in the council.

411
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:02,464
You're just in time to clear the air.

412
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:03,305
Come on.

413
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,705
Chen Qingqing...

414
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:18,185
Chen Qingqing...

415
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,335
Chen Qingqing, you're right on time.

416
00:26:31,585 --> 00:26:33,225
It's you again?

417
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,144
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

418
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:53,144
<i>I don't blame you, but personal hygiene
is my highest priority.</i>

419
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,264
<i>Aren't we studying math?
What are we doing here?</i>

420
00:26:55,265 --> 00:27:00,184
It's so peaceful and quiet here,
so it's the best place to study.

421
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,165
<i>I wrote this song for her.</i>

422
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:07,984
What the hell happened?

423
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:08,984
Who's there?

424
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:10,824
<i>Is something wrong with me?</i>

425
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,624
<i>It's 120 beats per minute?</i>

426
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,704
Isn't there anyone you like?

427
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:18,525
I'm Chen Qingqing. Who would I like?

428
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:22,995
