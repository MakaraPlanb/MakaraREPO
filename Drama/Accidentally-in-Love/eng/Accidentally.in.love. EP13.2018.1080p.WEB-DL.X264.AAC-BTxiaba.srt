EPISODE 13

2
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,735
Your phone, sir.

3
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:39,965
Hello?

4
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,244
Is that you, Qingqing?

5
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,085
Grandpa.

6
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,164
<i>I miss you.</i>

7
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:48,644
I thought you went away for a while
because you were upset.

8
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,945
I didn't think you'd be gone for months.

9
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:55,204
<i>Qingqing, listen to me.</i>

10
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,705
If you come back,

11
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,524
<i>I will do anything for you.</i>

12
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,885
Then please,

13
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,004
in the name of my mom,

14
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,324
<i>tell me the truth.</i>

15
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:10,685
Have you been lying to me
about Mom and Dad?

16
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,085
I had to hide some things from you

17
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,764
<i>for your own good.</i>

18
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:17,775
I was so--

19
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:22,404
<i>What did Qingqing find out
that she'd ask something like this?</i>

20
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:28,324
<i>She must have gone
to her parents' college after all.</i>

21
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,764
You were alone with that witch
for so long.

22
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:32,164
Weren't you scared?

23
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,785
You mean, Ms. Chen?

24
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,965
-Ms. Chen?
-Yeah.

25
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,964
You're now calling her Ms. Chen
behind her back?

26
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:41,275
Did she plant a bug on you?

27
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:46,045
Fangfang, this time,
I really got to know Ms. Chen.

28
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,045
She's a good person.

29
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,695
Did she cast a spell on you?

30
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,844
Qingqing, it's my day off tomorrow.

31
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,905
Do you want to hang out?

32
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:01,445
No. Tomorrow, I have
a date with a mysterious person.

33
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,125
-A mysterious person?
-Yeah.

34
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,565
Is it Situ Feng?

35
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,324
The both of you were so in character
during the play.

36
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,204
The more you acted,
the more real it seemed.

37
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:14,364
-You kissed like real lovers--
-Knock it off, Fangfang!

38
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:15,445
Gosh!

39
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,445
I see that you're getting even more...

40
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,845
What?

41
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:21,805
Gossipy.

42
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,445
Come here.

43
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,204
I need to ask you something.

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,045
Sit.

45
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,084
I want to ask you.

46
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:32,045
What's really going on between you
and Lin Yiyang?

47
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:35,075
Don't tell me you like him.

48
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,684
But he used to kidnap us, Fangfang.

49
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,005
No!

50
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,924
I just think that sometimes,
he's pretending.

51
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,605
It makes me curious.

52
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,924
Someone in this dormitory

53
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,845
has fallen in love.

54
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,285
Cut it out!

55
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,444
Like I said, about you and Situ Feng,

56
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:56,564
you were so into it
when you were on stage.

57
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,044
Your relationship developed so fast.

58
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,684
Cut the crap already.

59
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,644
He's just one of the good-looks club.

60
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,964
I look down on him, he surrenders to me.

61
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:08,044
There's already so much hatred between us.
There's no way for us to like each other.

62
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,364
That's not necessarily the case.

63
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,604
I remember an author once said,

64
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,245
"If we judge love,

65
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,564
by the majority of its results,
it resembles hatred

66
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:18,295
more than friendship."

67
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,724
Then the author was just fooling around.

68
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,964
But then again,
I want to ask you something.

69
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,525
How would I know

70
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:30,045
if I'm in love with somebody?

71
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,764
I've never talked about love,
but as they say in the books,

72
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,364
"When you can completely

73
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,644
be your own self in front of someone,

74
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,524
that means you're in love with him."

75
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,775
So what if I'm not myself,

76
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,644
but I've turned into
a completely different person?

77
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,764
Maybe you aren't
a completely different person,

78
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,675
but you've discovered your true self.

79
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:56,884
Fangfang, no one could've thought of that.

80
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,964
You could wipe out all the so-called
love experts on Weibo!

81
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,395
You're brilliant!

82
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,724
I want to ask you too.

83
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:05,484
Have you ever thought of

84
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,915
what kind of guy do you like?

85
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,045
I like...

86
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,165
By the way,

87
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:20,044
my grandma's birthday is in a few days.

88
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,124
Can you come and help me
carry the gifts tomorrow?

89
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,285
Okay.

90
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:26,524
I've been doing the same thing every year.
Why are you even asking?

91
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,245
I asked

92
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:31,524
simply to remind you
that another year has passed,

93
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,684
and I still don't have a girlfriend.

94
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:36,284
You're a good guy.
There will be someone for you.

95
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,605
Don't give up.

96
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:40,925
I heard that the whole campus

97
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,404
is asking me about my sexual orientation.

98
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,925
Of course.

99
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,604
You're warm, you're hygienic

100
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,924
and you don't have bad habits.

101
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:54,524
No one would believe it
if you said you were straight.

102
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,444
If they doubt your sexual orientation,

103
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,935
who do they think you're with?

104
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,405
Gu Nanxi.

105
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,924
You should keep looking for a girlfriend.

106
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,404
Why are you always sticking with me?

107
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,845
Don't tell me...

108
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,804
Do you really like me?

109
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,804
I don't have freckles
and I don't have curly hair.

110
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:17,444
I don't go around baring my fangs

111
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,684
and I don't speak with a thundering voice.

112
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:22,285
How am I supposed

113
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,115
to attract you, Your Highness?

114
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,485
Get out.

115
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:31,375
You can make a date with Qingchen.

116
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,564
I've tried so many times, but I couldn't.

117
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:42,524
So I gave up.

118
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:44,565
Why is that?

119
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,205
Beats me.

120
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,244
I'm so done talking to you about love.

121
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:51,545
I'll come with you tomorrow.

122
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,324
That place was really huge and lively.

123
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,164
Next thing you know, when he dropped by,

124
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,884
we have already finished our meal.

125
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:02,444
Your dad was left eating by himself.

126
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:03,285
Really?

127
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:04,245
Really.

128
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:06,005
Ms. Chen.

129
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,724
I really want to thank you

130
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:13,245
for being able to tell me so much
about my parents today.

131
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:16,924
Qingqing, shall we meet up again
next time?

132
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,444
Sure. You should hurry back now.

133
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,604
I'll pay the bills.

134
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,485
Okay, I've got to go.

135
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:34,605
Hey, Nanxi.

136
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,764
Isn't that Qingchen?

137
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:38,604
We just ran into her like this.

138
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:40,044
Come on, let's go there.

139
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:40,964
-No.
-Come on.

140
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,885
-Forget it.
-Come on.

141
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,285
Hey, Qingchen.

142
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,364
What a coincidence.

143
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,725
It sure is.

144
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,164
What brings you here?

145
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,295
Do you mind?

146
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,485
No, I don't.

147
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,125
Qingchen.

148
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:00,884
Are you busy after this?

149
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:01,725
Yes.

150
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:05,004
How about a little chit-chat?

151
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:08,245
It won't take up too much of your time.

152
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,025
Don't bother her.

153
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,684
Miss Qingchen, I'm sorry to bother you.

154
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,244
Situ Feng is going through

155
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,644
some sort of love-hate relationship
with a girl on campus.

156
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:21,524
So he's a little outgoing
and not quite like himself.

157
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:22,684
Hey, Gu Nanxi!

158
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:23,804
What are you talking about?

159
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,484
I want to go buy some gifts.

160
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:28,044
You guys should have a chat.
I've got to go.

161
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,525
Hey, Gu Nanxi.

162
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:36,725
Never mind.

163
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,725
Well...

164
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:38,764
My friend...

165
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:42,325
-He's a really nice guy.
-Yeah, I can tell.

166
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,364
They call you

167
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,565
"Your Coldhearted Highness."

168
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:49,565
But, you don't look as cold as they say.

169
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:51,884
Do you think so?

170
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,085
Yeah.

171
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,485
By the way,

172
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,165
Gu Nanxi just said

173
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,204
you have a love-hate relationship
with someone.

174
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,825
Who's that someone?

175
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,775
A crazy friend of mine.

176
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:05,885
But,

177
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:07,725
I realized that

178
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:10,804
I can be myself in front of her

179
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,324
more comfortably than before.

180
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,084
<i>"When you can completely</i>

181
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,524
be your own self in front of someone,

182
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,445
that means you're in love with him."

183
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,685
It looks like this friend of yours

184
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,765
is more than just a friend.

185
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,605
Yeah.

186
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:34,045
She is more than just a friend to me.

187
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,725
She's...

188
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,525
my best friend.

189
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,404
You should meet her sometime.

190
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:44,005
You've got to teach her
to be more ladylike.

191
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:48,565
Even so, it's nothing, really.

192
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,645
I think you should

193
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,364
get to know each other.

194
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,724
I see that your behavior
is a bit similar to hers.

195
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,165
I find that odd.

196
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,764
If you'll excuse me,
I have something to attend to.

197
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:06,435
Say goodbye to Nanxi for me. Bye.

198
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,645
Nanxi is...

199
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>That was close!</i>

200
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,724
<i>It makes me uncomfortable every time
I make up as Qingchen.</i>

201
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:25,124
<i>Then I met Situ Feng
and I don't know how to talk to him.</i>

202
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:30,004
<i>But then again, Qingchen is the real me.</i>

203
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:34,404
<i>Why should I be angry
when he's stepping on Qingqing?</i>

204
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:35,324
<i>Gosh.</i>

205
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:40,805
<i>Chen Qingqing,
you've got a split personality!</i>

206
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:01,925
Hey.

207
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,725
Qingqing, what a coincidence.

208
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:07,204
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:09,995
Weren't you having coffee just now?

210
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,525
Hey, how did you know that?

211
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,524
Look, there's a coffee mark
at the side of your mouth.

212
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,324
Not only you can't control your limbs,

213
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,924
you can't use your brain either!

214
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:24,324
Tell me, what are you doing here?

215
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:25,604
Doing some shopping.

216
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,445
And you?

217
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,765
I'm here to look for a part-time job.

218
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:32,665
Have you found one?

219
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,004
It's hard to get one here.

220
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,644
Chen Qingqing, don't you earn enough
from being my assistant?

221
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,804
Besides, if anyone catches you,
you'll embarrass me.

222
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:40,745
All right.

223
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,615
What a bother.

224
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,764
We can't help you get a part-time job.

225
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:46,884
But we can help you
save on your travel expenses.

226
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:47,925
Let's go.

227
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,965
-Qingqing!
-Yes?

228
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:59,884
-I heard you're from Jincheng.
-Yes.

229
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,764
We haven't properly
introduced you to Yuncheng.

230
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,655
We should come out
and enjoy ourselves more often.

231
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:11,004
Don't you know,
ever since I came to this college,

232
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:13,404
I kept running into sixes and sevens
without fail.

233
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,364
So I have no time to relax.

234
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,804
But my grandma's birthday is coming up.

235
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,985
Would you like to join me?

236
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:20,965
Yeah.

237
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,465
You've got to relax sometimes.

238
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,775
Can I bring Fangfang along?

239
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,805
Of course, you can.

240
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,084
Qingqing, do you have an evening dress?

241
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,284
Maybe I can buy you one.

242
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,764
Oh, no, thank you.

243
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:40,004
I hate that stuff.

244
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,135
Look at you.

245
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,804
I simply can't put up with you.

246
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,804
If I put on an evening dress,

247
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,985
you're going to freak out!

248
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:49,995
Step on it.

249
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:56,724
May you lead a life full of joy,
live long and smile always!

250
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:57,665
Thank you.

251
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,085
Sure.

252
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:03,725
Grandma.

253
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:05,404
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

254
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:10,665
Mom and I would like to wish you
to be always healthy and cheerful.

255
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,364
This piece of jade represents good luck.

256
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:16,364
It'd be good for you to put it on.

257
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:17,884
This is for you, Grandma.

258
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,444
-Good one.
-Happy birthday, Mother.

259
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:20,445
Thank you.

260
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,244
It's a jade bracelet.

261
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:24,404
It doesn't look that great.

262
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,405
Grandma, look at what I got you here.

263
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,764
A five-carat diamond necklace.

264
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,165
I wish you longevity, Grandma.

265
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,324
Here you go, Grandma.

266
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,245
Good boy.

267
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:37,764
As long as you gave them to me,

268
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,364
that would keep me happy.

269
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,965
Well, Grandma, please excuse us.

270
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:45,725
Take care.

271
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,085
Grandma.

272
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:54,035
I have something to attend to.
Rest well. I'll take my leave.

273
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,285
Let me get you a drink.

274
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,964
Every year, you've been doing nothing,
but boot-licking.

275
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,084
Don't forget who you really are.

276
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,924
You don't have the Gu family blood

277
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,484
and you will never have.

278
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,605
Gu Donglin.

279
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,945
Don't you forget,

280
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,524
Gu Nanxi is still taking care
of your gambling debt.

281
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,764
If it wasn't for him,
you'd be hacked to death.

282
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:24,764
Besides, you should be grateful for not
bringing your family to shame.

283
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:25,725
Situ Feng,

284
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:26,935
you shut up!

285
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,004
I didn't let you in here
to spew crap on us.

286
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:33,244
Besides, what right do you have
to meddle in our family affairs?

287
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,285
Donglin.

288
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,715
It's Grandma's birthday today. Cut it out.

289
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,765
Don't worry.

290
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:44,685
Qingqing.

291
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,564
This is my first time
to a party like this.

292
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,065
What should I do?

293
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,244
Fangfang, when the time comes,

294
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,524
you just have to follow me.

295
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,684
I've been to so many parties like this.

296
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,105
You won't make a mistake if you follow me.

297
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:00,885
Chen Qingqing.

298
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,044
What are you doing here?

299
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,465
Why are you stealing my lines?

300
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:08,484
What are you here for? Business?

301
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:14,235
It seems the rich kids around here
don't need any of your errands service.

302
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,545
If that's the case, you still owe me money

303
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,625
for my errands service.

304
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:23,924
Don't be so full of yourself.

305
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,004
Sooner or later, you're going to get it.

306
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:26,925
Really?

307
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:30,164
As a matter of fact,
every time it turns out

308
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,204
that you're the one
who always going to get it first.

309
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:34,245
Lan Xinya.

310
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:38,924
All the dirty tricks you pulled on me
only made me stronger.

311
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,765
Just think about it.

312
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,405
Hey.

313
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,565
You look great in that dress.

314
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:47,445
Really?

315
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:50,755
It's much better than the kid's clothes.

316
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,165
You don't say.

317
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,244
No one's elegance
reflects her inner beauty

318
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,165
more than your darling Xinya's.

319
00:15:58,245 --> 00:15:59,365
Yeah.

320
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,555
Xinya's also pretty today.

321
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:05,005
Sorry, I'm late.

322
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,045
Lanting.

323
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,044
Ting, you're here.

324
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:13,925
Lanting.

325
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,564
I miss you so much.

326
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:16,885
Lanting.

327
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,524
Why are you back?

328
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,484
I thought you weren't coming back
from abroad.

329
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,644
Of course I should be here
for Mrs. Gu's birthday.

330
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,485
Lanting.

331
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,244
Let me introduce to you.

332
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,844
This is Chen Qingqing.

333
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:29,324
And this is Zhang Fangfang.

334
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,124
They are all my good friends
from Ming De College.

335
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,245
Good friends?

336
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,125
-Hello.
-Hello.

337
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,845
So you are Chen Qingqing?

338
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:39,965
Yes, I am.

339
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,465
Do you know me?

340
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:42,765
Qingqing.

341
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:43,884
This is Lanting.

342
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,124
She's a childhood friend of ours.

343
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,444
She's older than us by just two years,

344
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:51,245
but doesn't she have a great aura?

345
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:52,445
Lanting.

346
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:56,355
She's wearing the same clothes as you are.

347
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,724
Wearing the same clothes is nothing.

348
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:02,164
I just won't wear this next time.

349
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:05,195
But the other person should be careful.

350
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,365
Qingqing.

351
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:15,375
That Yang Lanting.

352
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,755
Why is she so eccentric?

353
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,105
What do you mean?

354
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:22,765
Who knows?

355
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:24,764
Don't you see?

356
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:28,405
Every girl who grew up with Situ Feng

357
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,165
are all the same.

358
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:34,395
Maybe they're all infected
by that cold snap of his.

359
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,884
Anyway, you've got to be careful here.

360
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:40,124
Don't worry, Fangfang.

361
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,404
Chen Qingqing is never afraid of anybody.

362
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,015
The only thing I fear is myself.

363
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,725
-I've got to use the bathroom.
-Okay.

364
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,645
Lanting, your dress.

365
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,845
Chen Qingqing.

366
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,445
It's you again!

367
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,245
I get it.

368
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:16,644
It's because you're wearing
the exact same dress with Lanting!

369
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,164
You didn't look good,

370
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,884
so you spilled it on purpose.

371
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:20,845
I didn't.

372
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:22,165
What?

373
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:24,044
You're not going to admit it?

374
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,965
I told you to be careful around her.

375
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,685
What's going on?

376
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:29,765
Qingqing.

377
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:32,385
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

378
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,965
What's going on?

379
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:35,945
What happened?

380
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,155
Who did this?

381
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,205
She did!

382
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,365
Chen Qingqing.

383
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,844
Chen Qingqing,
apologize to Yang Lanting now.

384
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,764
Why should I apologize to her?

385
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:50,124
Did anyone see me spill juice on her?

386
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,124
It's obvious that she ran into it herself!

387
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,604
She's the one who's supposed
to apologize to me.

388
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:55,555
I didn't!

389
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,244
What an ugly attention seeker.

390
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,185
Lan Xinya!

391
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,804
How could you just bring
any ordinary person here?

392
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:07,085
Gu Donglin, you'd better watch your mouth.

393
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,285
Situ Feng.

394
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,764
Didn't I tell you not to stick your nose
into our family affairs?

395
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:14,884
Hey, can't you just be

396
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,404
-a little more reasonable?
-Shut your mouth.

397
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:19,525
-Guard!
-Young Master.

398
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:21,964
Who is this? Who let her in?

399
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,505
Miss, may I see your invitation?

400
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,564
You dared to come without an invitation.

401
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,364
Don't you have any shame?

402
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:33,365
Donglin.

403
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,515
Cut it out.

404
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,564
They're all my good friends.

405
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:40,244
Stop. They may be your friends,
but they're not mine.

406
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,245
Gu Donglin.

407
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,764
Since this is how you treat our guests,

408
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,724
we're not keeping you company anymore.

409
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,095
Sorry, Gu Nanxi.

410
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,804
Bring them back here!
They haven't apologized to Lanting.

411
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:53,685
Yes, sir.

412
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:59,804
Do you believe that
I didn't spill it on Lanting?

413
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,565
-I do.
-No way!

414
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,775
You don't believe me.

415
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,055
I believe you.

416
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,905
I don't have to think.

417
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,125
Qingqing.

418
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,605
What's the matter?

419
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,205
Something got into my eye.

420
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,764
Don't move. Let me see.

421
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,804
It's okay. I'll deal with it--

422
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:26,964
I said, don't move.

423
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,035
Let me see.

424
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,535
I think I see it.

425
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,625
Are you okay now?

426
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,925
Yes.

427
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,845
I...

428
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,215
Where did I leave Fangfang?

429
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,025
Chen Qingqing.

430
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,084
Can't you stop getting flustered
all the time?

431
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,884
Sorry, I'm always like this.

432
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,115
Can you lend me your phone for a minute?

433
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:57,945
Thank you.

434
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:03,665
Hello, Fangfang.

435
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,564
I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,804
I just had a situation just now.

437
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,604
So I had to run out first.

438
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,684
Can you return to the dorm yourself?

439
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,685
I know you're the best.

440
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:15,405
Wait for me there.

441
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,485
Bye.

442
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:21,204
How about you?
Are you going back to your dorm?

443
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:23,135
Where else should I go?

444
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,564
Let's go. Let me show you something.

445
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,724
Where are we going?

446
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:30,155
You'll see once you're there.

447
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,444
You're leaving me in suspense.

448
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:33,445
Come on!

449
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,375
Walk slowly. I'm wearing high heels.

450
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,124
Hey, why are you bringing me here?

451
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,484
To play basketball?

452
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:52,095
But you're so bad at basketball.

453
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:53,284
What are we doing here?

454
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,604
-Did you say I'm bad at basketball?
-Yeah.

455
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,044
The last time Nanxi played with me,

456
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,524
you didn't see the look on his face.

457
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,084
It was like he ate shit or something.

458
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,365
Because you play like shit, Situ Feng.

459
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,855
Do you want to bet?

460
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,485
As you wish.

461
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,924
Have you played basketball before?

462
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:23,925
No.

463
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:27,204
A girl's arms may be a little shorter.

464
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:30,375
So you've got to throw a little harder.

465
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:37,204
Situ Feng, I'm sorry. Is your face okay?

466
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,924
Why did you tell me to throw so hard?

467
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,905
My face is important to me, you know?

468
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,525
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:48,835
I said "girls."

470
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:52,845
Can't a brute like you restrain yourself
a little?

471
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,335
Watch and learn.

472
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:02,924
To score three points,

473
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,164
even when you hang in the air,

474
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:08,605
make sure your wrist angle
and your movements are perfect.

475
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:20,095
You mean, you can miss on purpose?

476
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:46,565
It went in!

477
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:49,804
Situ Feng, that was brilliant!
You really got it in!

478
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,724
What's the point of that?

479
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,764
I can only score at times like this.

480
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,795
I can't score like this
in front of everyone else.

481
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,324
You care so much about your image.
Why are you doing that?

482
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:07,324
You'll show everyone your true beauty
when you let go of yourself.

483
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,085
No, I won't!

484
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:13,164
They call me the Kaede Rukawa
of Ming De College.

485
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,715
Step aside, let me have a shot.

486
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:18,895
Throw it over there, a little lower.

487
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,205
One, two.

488
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:27,804
You could do it like that?

489
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:31,244
Are you the one-of-a-kind player
we've been looking for?

490
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:32,164
All right.

491
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:36,165
You can be our own Sakuragi Hanamichi.

492
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,685
I'm a genius!

493
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,875
Get out of my way!

494
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:50,485
Throw it!

495
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:00,565
One more time!

496
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,485
Situ Feng.

497
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:23,995
Are you asleep?

498
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:25,085
No.

499
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,735
Are you tired?

500
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:33,145
What do you mean?

501
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:34,845
I mean,

502
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,764
I can see that you know
how to play basketball,

503
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:41,084
but you're not doing it well.

504
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:45,045
When you're a star,
you have to disguise yourself.

505
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:47,084
It must have been hard.

506
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:47,925
Right?

507
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,235
I didn't choose to do this.

508
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,485
Because I don't want sympathy.

509
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,844
I'd rather you hate me

510
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,905
than to have pity on me.

511
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:01,844
And you hate me too.

512
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,924
We've hated each other since we first met.

513
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,365
And we still do.

514
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:13,724
Why don't we talk about what we don't like
about each other?

515
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:15,325
-Okay.
-You first.

516
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:17,924
You're too frank.

517
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:19,084
You pretend to be cool.

518
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:20,364
Your clothes are too colorful.

519
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:24,124
Your clothes are too tight
and you're not even muscular.

520
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,604
I'm not muscular?

521
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:27,415
Have you ever seen me

522
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:30,604
-do martial arts?
-You don't do martial arts.

523
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:32,295
I don't believe it.

524
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:36,485
Is this how you flirt?

525
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,365
It's so fake.

526
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,044
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes?

527
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:44,725
Can I say what I like about you?

528
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:46,444
You don't have secrets.

529
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,085
You're so lucky.

530
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:51,724
Look at performing artists like us.

531
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:55,615
We're bound to contracts
and hounded by paparazzi.

532
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:59,564
Even if you want to let go of the past,

533
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,735
they'd bring it up over and over again.

534
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:06,725
Qingqing.

535
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,564
I'm so envious of you.

536
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:12,615
How do you know I don't have secrets?

537
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:17,835
You have a big mouth.
You'd even leak secrets to the CIA.

538
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,245
You...

539
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,685
Are you saying that you like me?

540
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,604
Don't think too much about it.

541
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,085
Look at the context, all right?

542
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,764
What I meant by "like" is,

543
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:39,884
what I admire, what I appreciate

544
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:41,804
and what I envy about you.

545
00:27:41,805 --> 00:27:43,764
You're so good at languages,

546
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,445
but why isn't your math as good?

547
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,525
You're a retard.

548
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,605
Hey. Situ Feng.

549
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:06,005
Did you hear that?

550
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,924
It must be a mouse.

551
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,765
What?

552
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,725
A mouse?

553
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:20,004
Situ Feng, you've got to protect me!

554
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:20,925
But how?

555
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:25,284
Why do I always end up like this
every time I'm with you?

556
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,204
I hate this!

557
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,764
There's a mouse around here.

558
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,325
You hate it? Let's go find it.

559
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:34,085
Situ Feng, put me down!

560
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:35,045
Look.

561
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:36,565
Hurry, look.

562
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,695
It's not a mouse.

563
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,685
It's a kitten.

564
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,325
I like cats so much!

565
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,735
Why do you like cats?

566
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:11,375
Don't you have the ability
to think logically?

567
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,125
I hate mice.

568
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:14,695
Cats catch mice.

569
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,485
So I like cats.

570
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,005
Right?

571
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:19,845
Little kitty.

572
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,444
I want to take you home and keep you.

573
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:23,645
Okay?

574
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:27,684
Don't you want to give it a name?

575
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:28,925
A name?

576
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:30,125
Okay.

577
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:31,805
How about

578
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:34,395
I call you Kitty Chen?

579
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:36,165
-You like it?
-Hey.

580
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:38,524
Why is it a Chen, not a Situ like me?

581
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:41,964
Can't you see my surname
is much more epic?

582
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:42,965
Epic?

583
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:44,665
Are you kidding me?

584
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:47,365
We found this kitten together.

585
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,364
We're the mom and dad.

586
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,244
I'm the dad. You're the mom.

587
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:52,764
Of course it'll take my surname.

588
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:54,695
Am I right, Kitty Chen?

589
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,275
That's right.

590
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:58,164
-Hey.
-Yes?

591
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,915
Why are you the dad?

592
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,485
Because I'm domineering.

593
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:04,964
Enough about that.

594
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:07,164
We should at least give it a nickname.

595
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,535
That would be...

596
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:11,845
Situ's Stupid Dog!

597
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:13,685
Hey.

598
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,025
Chen Qingqing, what are you drawing?

599
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,564
-Ming De's Yearly Miss Campus--
-Excuse me!

600
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:35,924
Why are you here?

601
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,364
I'm here to join the Miss Campus contest.

602
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:43,585
Our Student Council Secretariat
received a letter of complaint earlier.

603
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,724
You're doing this on purpose!

604
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:50,204
<i>I have something important to ask you.</i>

605
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:53,804
May I ask what motivated you
to stand on this stage?

606
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:56,684
Based on your understanding,
what defines beauty?

607
00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:00,585
The winner
of Ming De College's Miss Campus is...

608
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,115
