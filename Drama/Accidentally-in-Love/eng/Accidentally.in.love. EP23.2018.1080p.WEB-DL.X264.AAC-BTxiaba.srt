EPISODE 23

2
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:34,484
-I'm all right.
-Didn't you say you were good at drinking?

3
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,204
Was this what you called good at drinking?

4
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:38,605
Be careful.

5
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,295
I'll call a cab for you.

6
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,045
Hey. Be careful.

7
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,675
This seat has been reserved for Qingqing.

8
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:23,535
Is this yours?

9
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,845
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:40,925
Stop.

11
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,085
Sit down.

12
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,005
I said sit down.

13
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,705
Why are you crying?

14
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,435
It's nothing.

15
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,025
What can I do for you?

16
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:31,485
I want to study.

17
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:38,884
How do you do this?

18
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,305
YOUR DADDY IS HERE, FOOL. BAD.

19
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:50,695
About last time...

20
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,995
I am sorry.

21
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,404
Hello, Man. What's up?

22
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,244
<i>Guess what I saw yesterday?</i>

23
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:10,524
<i>Gu Nanxi hugged Chen Qingqing.</i>

24
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,605
What?

25
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,924
<i>I'm still following them.</i>

26
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,284
<i>We're at the zoo.
I've already told Situ Feng.</i>

27
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:19,204
<i>Let's reveal Chen Qingqing's
true colors to the world.</i>

28
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,585
Okay, I got it.

29
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,244
Hey, Lan Xinya.

30
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:28,564
Are you heading for revision now?
Let's go together.

31
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,364
Chen Qingqing and Gu Nanxi
are getting all intimate now.

32
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,364
I don't think I'm going to study.

33
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:34,884
I'm going to show Feng

34
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,345
that Chen Qingqing
doesn't deserve his love.

35
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,445
Wait for me.

36
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,155
Thanks for yesterday.

37
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:50,524
If it wasn't for you,
I would be on the news today.

38
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:54,415
"Young Lady Found Naked and Drunk
on the Streets."

39
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,375
Thanks, my friend.

40
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,884
Right, you said you had something
to tell me yesterday.

41
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,325
What was it?

42
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,364
Never mind, it's no big deal.

43
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,805
Come on.

44
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,124
You've already put up
with all my rambling yesterday.

45
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,005
Today is my turn.

46
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,115
Why don't you let me hear you out?

47
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:20,044
I'm afraid it's not going
to work out for me.

48
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:23,345
How would you know if you don't tell me?

49
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,365
If I were to tell you

50
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,164
the thing which has been bothering me

51
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,855
is that I like you,

52
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,245
what would you do?

53
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,925
Gu Nanxi.

54
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,445
Stop joking with me.

55
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,635
Do you think...

56
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,205
Do you think I'm still drunk?

57
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,245
I know

58
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:59,995
the person you like is Situ Feng.

59
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:04,604
After seeing so many things
happen between the two of you,

60
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,355
I've already let go.

61
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:11,484
It doesn't matter if you're Qingchen
or Chen Qingqing.

62
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,805
You're one of a kind to me

63
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,245
and you will soon become

64
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,505
my friend, Situ Feng's girlfriend.

65
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:28,015
Let's give each other a hug as friends.

66
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,965
Thank you, Gu Nanxi.

67
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,325
Was it true

68
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,225
what you just said?

69
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,385
You're actually Qingchen?

70
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:53,025
-Situ Feng, hear me out--
-You don't need to say anything.

71
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:56,445
Calm down, Situ Feng.

72
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,585
It's not what you think.

73
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:02,505
"Not what I think"?

74
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:06,135
Then what should I think?

75
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:07,545
All I saw was

76
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:09,525
my best friend

77
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,215
and the girl I love

78
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:16,765
treated me like a fool.

79
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,085
Tell me.

80
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,084
-How is it not what I think?
-Situ Feng.

81
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,265
-I didn't--
-Didn't what?

82
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,445
You didn't lie to me?

83
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,244
What should I call you?

84
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,765
Chen Qingqing or Miss Qingchen?

85
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:38,125
Were you ever honest with me?

86
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:41,685
Fine.

87
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,125
She's all yours.

88
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:49,405
Situ Feng, don't go. Listen to me.

89
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,964
I didn't mean to lie to you.

90
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,884
I went to look for Gu Nanxi yesterday

91
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,404
because I wanted to ask him

92
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,284
how should I tell you
about my true identity

93
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:59,884
so you won't be so angry as you are now.

94
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:02,204
So that's why you two ended up
hugging each other?

95
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,045
No.

96
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:12,125
-Situ Feng, let me explain.
-What is there to explain?

97
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,295
Do you mean it was just a casual hug?

98
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,804
That it was difficult for you

99
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,804
and even when everyone knew about it,

100
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:23,524
I was the only person
who was kept in the dark?

101
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,924
What are they quarreling about?

102
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,475
What true identity?

103
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,805
What do you think?

104
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:34,905
Chen Qingqing must have been
being a huge flirt and caused this.

105
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,165
Okay, let me explain it.

106
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:41,065
Gu Nanxi and I, we're just friends.

107
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,925
That hug you saw
was just a hug between friends.

108
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,885
Yes, I did lie to you

109
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,285
and I'm sorry about it.

110
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:53,365
But Situ Feng, I want to tell you

111
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,645
that you're the person I like

112
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:00,285
from the very beginning!

113
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,525
Hey.

114
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,045
Chen Qingqing.

115
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:14,125
Chen Qingqing, you're so shameless.

116
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,665
With all the evidence we have,

117
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,285
how could you carry on lying?

118
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:20,965
Think about it.

119
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,564
Ever since school started,

120
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:26,515
you've been involving yourself
with Feng and Nanxi.

121
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,675
Plus Hua Munian and Lin Yiyang too.

122
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,164
Are you playing a game?

123
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,644
Or are you collecting boyfriends?

124
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,084
Hey, my friendship with Qingqing
is as pure as the snow.

125
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:35,925
Shut up!

126
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,165
Hey, Situ Feng!

127
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,025
Chen Qingqing.

128
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:46,075
Feng has finally seen your true colors.

129
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:50,165
If you know the meaning of integrity,

130
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:52,845
please don't bother Feng anymore.

131
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,325
Qingqing, let's go back first.

132
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,935
Situ Feng needs time to calm down.

133
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,355
I will explain to him.

134
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,324
You're not completely sober
from yesterday.

135
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:15,015
I'll send you home.

136
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:19,255
It's okay.

137
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:22,975
I can go back on my own.

138
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,204
Qingqing, are you not feeling well?

139
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,805
You look tired.

140
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:45,085
Fangfang, I need to tell you a secret.

141
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,725
What's the secret?

142
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:48,925
Actually,

143
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,365
I'm Qingchen.

144
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,525
Qingchen is me.

145
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,965
What?

146
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,965
Are you really Qingchen?

147
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:10,125
My real name is Chen Qingqing.

148
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,524
I was trying to escape
from my grandpa's bodyguards.

149
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:18,365
That's why I switched my identity.

150
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,565
Fangfang, I lied to you.

151
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,195
Are you mad at me?

152
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,635
Silly girl, of course not.

153
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:31,965
Fangfang, what a relief!

154
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,805
Actually, I can understand it.

155
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:39,044
You must have your own reasons.

156
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,895
Thanks for understanding

157
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:46,285
but some might not take it well
like you, right?

158
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,665
Are you talking about Situ Feng?

159
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,924
Don't worry. He's so fond of you.

160
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,084
I'm sure he'll come around.

161
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,164
Fangfang, what are you talking about?

162
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,684
You think I didn't know
what's up with you and Lin Yiyang?

163
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:02,924
-We--
-The two of you

164
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:05,044
have been swapping outfits
all the time.

165
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:06,244
I've already seen it twice.

166
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:12,245
-What are you talking about, Qingqing?
-It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!

167
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,764
What's wrong, Chen Qingqing?

168
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:27,884
Why are you so quiet?

169
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,925
Don't you know how to greet someone?

170
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,844
If I see a decent human being,

171
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,345
I will greet her.

172
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,005
I didn't know you're capable

173
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,075
of being sarcastic.

174
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:49,724
Tomorrow is the exam.

175
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,044
If you have nothing else to say,
please don't waste my time.

176
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,284
Yes, our examinations
will be starting tomorrow.

177
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,645
Feng will be present as well.

178
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,605
I'm warning you.

179
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,244
Do not disturb him.

180
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:03,045
Do not talk to him.

181
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,404
Do not affect him during examinations.

182
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,604
I will talk to whoever I want to talk to.

183
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,845
Why should I listen to you?

184
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,804
You should because Situ Feng
and I grew up together

185
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:17,275
and he promised
to take care of me forever.

186
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:18,325
What?

187
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,865
Feng promised to take care of me forever.

188
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:28,115
It's not going to happen
between the two of you.

189
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:35,205
Lan Xinya, do you think
I will believe you?

190
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,124
It doesn't matter
if you believe me or not.

191
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,644
You're living in a different world
compared to Feng.

192
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,365
It's worlds apart.

193
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,485
Feng is a simple guy.

194
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,795
He's an affectionate person.

195
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,924
People like you
who likes to flirt with every guy...

196
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:59,575
I hope you'll quickly disappear
from my sight.

197
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,245
Lan Xinya.

198
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:04,444
Do yourself a favor. Keep your mouth shut.

199
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,255
Wasn't that the case?

200
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:09,245
First, it was Feng, then Gu Nanxi.

201
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:11,124
Two-timing in a relationship,

202
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,525
do you think it's charming?

203
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,804
Ugly people like to do strange things.

204
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,445
Listen up.

205
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,395
Feng is an only child.

206
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:25,465
He should date someone
from a compatible family.

207
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,995
A materialistic person like you,

208
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:29,644
I beg of you.

209
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,445
Just get lost already.

210
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,005
You know what?

211
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,004
You're right, I am materialistic.

212
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,964
That's why I approached Situ Feng.

213
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,385
How's that? Are you satisfied?

214
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,565
But...

215
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:51,284
It looks like Situ Feng
would rather fall for me,

216
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,364
someone who's materialistic

217
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:55,164
than to give a damn about you.

218
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,405
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

219
00:14:57,845 --> 00:14:59,885
Last but not least,

220
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,285
Situ Feng is mine.

221
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,785
Since you've admitted to it,
I have nothing else to say.

222
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,445
Girls, let's go.

223
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:03,705
Situ Feng,

224
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,805
can we talk?

225
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:14,524
Talk about what?

226
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:15,725
Actually...

227
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:19,645
It was not my intention

228
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,365
to deceive you.

229
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,364
It was because--

230
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,615
<i>You know what?</i>

231
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,764
<i>You're right, I am materialistic.</i>

232
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,884
<i>That's why I approached Situ Feng.</i>

233
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:33,305
<i>How's that? Are you satisfied?</i>

234
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:34,805
<i>But...</i>

235
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:39,644
<i>It looks like Situ Feng
would rather fall for me,</i>

236
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,444
<i>someone who's materialistic</i>

237
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,324
<i>than to give a damn about you.</i>

238
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,565
<i>Doesn't it drive you crazy?</i>

239
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,605
<i>Last but not least,</i>

240
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,085
<i>Situ Feng</i>

241
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:52,365
<i>is mine.</i>

242
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,244
Situ Feng, don't listen to it.

243
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,535
I said those things because--

244
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:02,444
Chen Qingqing,
there's nothing else for us to talk about.

245
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,135
I gave you my heart

246
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,245
and you trampled on it.

247
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,735
You made me feel like I'm a joke.

248
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,604
<i>That's why I approached Situ Feng.</i>

249
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:31,025
<i>How's that? Are you satisfied?</i>

250
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,125
<i>But...</i>

251
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,804
-What are you doing, Hua Munian?
-Get over here.

252
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,795
Gosh, you're hurting me.

253
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:46,725
You need to apologize
to Chen Qingqing now.

254
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:47,845
Apologize?

255
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:52,324
Why should I apologize to her?

256
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,485
She said everything herself.

257
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,004
I'm just letting people know about it.

258
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,885
If it wasn't for you,

259
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,765
would Chen Qingqing say those things?

260
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,865
I don't understand.

261
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,164
What is it about Chen Qingqing?

262
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,725
What did she do to all of you?

263
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,085
Why is everyone siding with her?

264
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,415
Why are you protecting her?

265
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,564
Because she's my friend!

266
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,925
I trust her!

267
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,635
Is that what you think of me?

268
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:29,185
Am I such a horrible person?

269
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,135
I am horrible.

270
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,485
I did all the bad things.

271
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,095
Are you happy?

272
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,975
If she's your friend,

273
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,625
then what about me?

274
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,085
You're different, you're...

275
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:20,865
Situ Feng.

276
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,205
Gu Nanxi, let go of me!

277
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:31,075
Situ Feng, you're not a fool.

278
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,635
Don't believe everything you heard
on the recordings.

279
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,845
Why? Why shouldn't I believe it?

280
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,724
Should I believe you
and Chen Qingqing instead?

281
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:45,724
You're right, I'm a fool
who's not sure what to believe in.

282
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,404
We didn't lie to you.

283
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,975
Didn't lie to me?

284
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,435
Then tell me.

285
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,765
When did you find out that Chen Qingqing
was Qingchen?

286
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,204
You can't answer me, can you?

287
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:58,605
Let me guess.

288
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,964
Every time I tried to hook you up
with Qingchen,

289
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,505
I wonder what were you thinking?

290
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,244
Every time when I poured my heart out
for Chen Qingqing,

291
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,324
I wonder what were you thinking?

292
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,205
Gu Nanxi.

293
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:13,215
I thought you were my best friend!

294
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,295
You are my best friend!

295
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,255
You're not my friend!

296
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,365
Can you wake up, Situ Feng?

297
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,185
I said it's not what you think!

298
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,884
No wonder you used to ask me
if we would end up fighting.

299
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:37,125
So this was what you meant.

300
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,564
You were preparing yourself
for today, am I right?

301
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,445
I was a fool

302
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,105
because I believed in the two of you!

303
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:50,745
Situ Feng.

304
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,315
Do you still remember how we met?

305
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:59,955
I was eight years old
and a transfer student.

306
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,975
Everyone knew I was an illegitimate child.

307
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,324
No one wanted to play with me.

308
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:10,225
It was the saddest
and loneliest time of my life.

309
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:13,535
It was you

310
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,964
who came to talk to me first.

311
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:21,175
You were the first person
who wanted to play with me.

312
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:24,405
Ever since then, I've always

313
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,425
thought you as my best friend.

314
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:29,805
I admit.

315
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:33,845
I did fall for Qingchen,

316
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,935
but after I found out who she really was,

317
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,765
I decided to let go of my feelings

318
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:46,125
because I would never betray
my best friend!

319
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:52,964
Do you think everything Chen Qingqing
has done for you were all lies?

320
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,405
That's all I'm going to say.

321
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:58,615
You can think about the rest yourself.

322
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,205
EXAM RESULTS AND RANKING

323
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,644
Hey, how did you do?

324
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,244
-It was just average.
-Did you make it?

325
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,204
How did you do?

326
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,924
-Look, who's that?
-Me too.

327
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,724
Lin Yiyang? Isn't he the guy
who always failed his exams?

328
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,924
I can't believe he made it
into the top 100.

329
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,285
Could it have been a mistake?

330
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,745
What are you reading?

331
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,244
If you're able to score well
for your exams

332
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,644
and make it into top 100,

333
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:39,085
I will tell you.

334
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,085
Deal.

335
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:50,604
Lin Yiyang seems like a different person.

336
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,204
I heard before the exams started,

337
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,724
he studied at the library every day.

338
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,005
Are you sure?

339
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,515
Look, it's Lin Yiyang.

340
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,804
He used to look so fierce
and unapproachable.

341
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,564
I didn't know he was good looking.

342
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,324
Are you interested in him?

343
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,755
Of course not, a guy like him

344
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:25,204
is too much for me to handle.

345
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,564
It's better for me to look
from a distance.

346
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,485
It's good that you know your limits.

347
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,324
<i>Hi, Hebiancao. I am Situ Feng's manager.</i>

348
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:56,644
<i>I would like to invite you to take part
in His Highness's next album packaging.</i>

349
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,844
<i>Your comic strips will be included
into the album.</i>

350
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:01,465
<i>Please let us know.</i>

351
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:07,275
If Situ Feng finds out
about my third identity,

352
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:12,004
and finds out that I was the one
who drew those funny things about him...

353
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,755
Wouldn't he kill me?

354
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,545
What should I do?

355
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:23,655
That's odd. It was such a good offer.

356
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:25,724
Why hasn't she responded yet?

357
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,645
Were my messages not sent?

358
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:29,765
Maybe.

359
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,245
Well...

360
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,925
Hey, we managed to solve the case.

361
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:39,804
Why are you still looking so gloomy?

362
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:42,764
This new album
is a top-quality production.

363
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,004
It contains comic strips
from your number one supporter

364
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,765
plus the handshake coupon.

365
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:49,764
It's going to become a hot topic

366
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:51,764
and it's definitely
going to become a huge hit.

367
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:52,724
That's right.

368
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:56,004
During my time, where could you
have found such a great deal?

369
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,125
All right.

370
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:59,895
Tell me about your plans.

371
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,325
Why don't you personally invite Hebiancao?

372
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,285
What?

373
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:17,765
<i>Hi, Hebiancao.</i>

374
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,244
<i>I'm Situ Feng.</i>

375
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:21,044
<i>Thank you for your support.</i>

376
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,244
<i>I hope to be working with you
on my new album.</i>

377
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:26,905
<i>Please let me know
when you've seen my video.</i>

378
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:28,805
Situ Feng.

379
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,595
Why are you so persistent?

380
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:39,085
<i>Why does it feel like a Cinderella story?</i>

381
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:42,484
<i>I haven't seen Hebiancao online
for several days.</i>

382
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:43,564
<i>If she heard about this</i>

383
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:45,724
<i>I'm sure she's going to be overjoyed.</i>

384
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,244
<i>Could it be that something happened?</i>

385
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,164
<i>I'm worried too.</i>

386
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:50,684
<i>I heard she once mentioned</i>

387
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:53,225
<i>that her college is in Yuncheng?</i>

388
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:55,604
<i>Lei, you can check her IP address.</i>

389
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,095
Wow, these people.

390
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,804
Are they trying to drive me to the edge?

391
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,524
If I don't agree to work with Situ Feng,

392
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:05,735
they're probably going
to find out all of my secrets.

393
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,685
Whatever! We shall wait and see.

394
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:21,365
Qingqing, why are you up so early?

395
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,964
Fangfang, your happiness
is in your own hands.

396
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:30,195
Now, I'm going to create my own history.

397
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:32,524
You have to work hard
to seize your own happiness.

398
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:33,725
Let's do it!

399
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:53,085
Are you Hebiancao?

400
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:55,725
Your Highness!

401
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:57,765
<i>He's our boss.</i>

402
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,844
<i>Do you think anyone can be his girlfriend?</i>

403
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:04,935
Why did you jump on the bandwagon?
You're so silly.

404
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,644
<i>Do you know there's a clock tower
in our college?</i>

405
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,684
<i>Legend has it that if you enter
the clock tower</i>

406
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,684
<i>and express your regrets sincerely,</i>

407
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,964
the clock will turn anti-clockwise
if it is touched by your sincerity.

408
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:17,155
You can talk?

409
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:24,815
