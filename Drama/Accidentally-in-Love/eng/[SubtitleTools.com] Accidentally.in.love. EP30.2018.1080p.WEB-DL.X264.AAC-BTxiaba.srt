00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,785
EPISODE 30

2
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,545
Chen Qingqing.

3
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,905
Do not disturb my sleep.

4
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:15,264
Never mind. It's not a big deal anyway.

5
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,984
It's just something related to your dad.

6
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:19,115
I'm leaving.

7
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:20,585
What?

8
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:23,375
Come back here.

9
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:27,104
The library is holding an exhibition
of the school history.

10
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,945
Then, I found this.

11
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:32,175
-You might be interested.
-What is it?

12
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:37,225
Isn't this just a pencil?

13
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,305
"Xiao Jingnan"?

14
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:48,055
-This was my dad's pencil.
-Yes.

15
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,815
There's more.

16
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:03,104
SKETCH BY THE OUTSTANDING ALUMNUS,
XIAO JINGNAN

17
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:07,795
I think that you inherited
your drawing talent from your dad.

18
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:10,325
Don't you think

19
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:13,695
that this sketch has a magical power?

20
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:17,945
I feel like this is a sketch

21
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,905
made by a boy

22
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,485
with all his heart.

23
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:25,775
That's right.

24
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,544
Chen Qingqing.

25
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:30,104
I've got another secret to tell you.

26
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:33,395
I feel the same way whenever you draw me.

27
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,285
Don't flatter yourself.

28
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,664
Situ Feng, I've made up my mind.

29
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:48,755
-I want to make drawing as my new goal.
-All right.

30
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,064
Chen Qingqing, you can do it.

31
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,304
If you work hard,

32
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:55,064
you'll definitely become
an outstanding comic artist.

33
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,305
Go get it!

34
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,785
Situ Feng.

35
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,065
I've decided.

36
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,264
I'm going to start drawing from today.

37
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,144
I won't disturb you then.

38
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:09,575
-I'm going to go now.
-Okay.

39
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:19,265
Go, Chen Qingqing!

40
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,645
I can't think of anything.

41
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,265
The BL comics I drew in the past

42
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:35,195
were all improvisations.

43
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,825
Now, I have to draw a whole story.

44
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:42,985
I don't have any inspiration at all.

45
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,025
Lan Xinya.

46
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:03,745
You've been looking
at the sea for two days.

47
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:11,395
What's so interesting about the sea?

48
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:17,785
As the school hunk of Ming De College,

49
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:21,585
it's humiliating

50
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:26,635
that I have to fish for food every day.

51
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,865
I, Hua Munian, is a stylish man.

52
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,065
Why am I doing such a down-to-earth work?

53
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,505
Hua Munian.

54
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,885
If you could just man up a bit,

55
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,545
just a bit,

56
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,595
I wouldn't find you that annoying.

57
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,845
-Hua--
-Xinya--

58
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:23,664
Hua Munian, did you kiss me on purpose?

59
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,915
I didn't do it on purpose.

60
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,635
Or did I do it on purpose?

61
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:31,744
-Hua Munian, why are you so--
-So manly, right?

62
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,745
I think your kiss broke my spell.

63
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,585
The frog finally became a prince.

64
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,024
You're a female frog.

65
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,944
The tadpoles are looking for you.

66
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,135
Cut the crap.

67
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,624
<i>A friend of mine owns
this comic publishing company.</i>

68
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,504
<i>You can go for an interview.</i>

69
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,144
<i>Start your career as an assistant.</i>

70
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:05,045
<i>You'll become a great comic artist
in the future.</i>

71
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,144
-Are you Chen Qingqing?
-Nice to meet you.

72
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:13,275
Take a seat.

73
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,544
-Just call me Matthew.
-Nice to meet you.

74
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,024
I've seen your drawings.

75
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,744
I really like your drawing style.

76
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:19,944
-Really?
-Yes.

77
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,184
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

78
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:24,664
Our interns only have to work
in the morning.

79
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,904
Then, do a handover at noon.

80
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,864
Their daily task is
to draw anywhere they want.

81
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,305
It's quite easy.

82
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:34,024
Are you saying
that I can start working right now?

83
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,335
Yes, go inside.

84
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,704
Just find a comfortable place to sit down.

85
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,344
-Okay. Thank you.
-Go ahead.

86
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,285
All right.

87
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,705
-Excuse me.
-It's all right.

88
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,065
Hello.

89
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,064
Sorry to interrupt.

90
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:56,665
Hello, I'm the new intern, Chen Qingqing.

91
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,505
Nice to meet you.

92
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:02,965
Is this seat taken?

93
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,465
Why are you two so serious?

94
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,704
I've got news for you.
Don't get too worked up.

95
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,205
News? What is it?

96
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,864
A company in the States has heard
your new album. They loved it.

97
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,895
-They've decided to sign you.
-Really?

98
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,424
Are you selling me off?

99
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,345
No.

100
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,504
The agency will send you to the States.

101
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,064
You'll receive training
and be repositioned.

102
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:09,424
This is to open up opportunities

103
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,744
for cooperation with the record company
on the West Coast.

104
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,024
America loves your new album.

105
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,704
They'll probably hire
the most famous producer, Adam,

106
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:18,464
to produce your next album.

107
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,024
He has produced four Grammy artists.

108
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,584
You might be the next.

109
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:25,584
That's right. This is a rare opportunity.

110
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,255
Your dream is about to come true.

111
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,984
You don't look excited at all.

112
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,305
Be excited.

113
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,745
I have to go to the States then.

114
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,065
Of course.

115
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,305
You might not come back.

116
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,864
Mei and I will also move there.

117
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,624
We'll buy a mansion in Los Angeles.

118
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:51,505
We'll watch the sunset
and play basketball with Kobe every day.

119
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,565
What about Chen Qingqing?

120
00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,545
She...

121
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:06,205
-She might go with you.
-That's right.

122
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,505
-Situ Feng.
-Qingqing.

123
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:23,945
Look, Situ Feng.

124
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:26,424
My first short comic has been published.

125
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,624
I'm even going to get paid.

126
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,184
You know what?
This gives me a sense of accomplishment.

127
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:32,544
I'm counting on your blessing.

128
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,424
I'll become a great comic artist.

129
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,825
Then, I will open my own studio.

130
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,824
What should I name it?

131
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,435
How about Hebiancao?

132
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,344
Help me out. What should I name my studio?

133
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,145
Name it after me.

134
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:50,065
No way.

135
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:55,125
Your fanatical fans are going to accuse me
of using your fame.

136
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:02,505
It seems like you're in a bad mood today.

137
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,555
I'm not.

138
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,745
Qingqing, I'm really happy now.

139
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:10,995
I believe that you'll become successful.

140
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:14,685
Thank you.

141
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:15,984
You know what?

142
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:21,125
This is the first time that I've felt
so accomplished in my life.

143
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,265
You haven't told her yet?

144
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,185
Not yet.

145
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,845
Then will you go?

146
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:58,864
I haven't decided yet.

147
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:02,155
But I think that it's a good opportunity.

148
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,465
Do you want Qingqing to go with you?

149
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,935
Qingqing has her own career.

150
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:25,205
I don't think that she'd want
to come with me.

151
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,585
Hold on.

152
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,465
If you leave, I will be all alone.

153
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,144
What am I going to do without you?

154
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:40,335
Knock it off.

155
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:43,824
I don't know what to do
about Chen Qingqing.

156
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:46,875
Please don't give me a hard time too.

157
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,104
You have to tell her sooner or later.

158
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:02,865
Or else you'll be lying to her.

159
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:06,824
Yes, I can't like people.

160
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,784
But has Chen Qingqing never lied to me?

161
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,025
Have you never lied to me?

162
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,224
-What are you talking about?
-Hurry.

163
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,235
He's here.

164
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:21,944
Your Highness, rumor says that
you're going to the States. Is that true?

165
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:25,384
Are you nervous about working
with great producers?

166
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,904
I haven't decided yet.

167
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,824
Please don't spread false rumors.

168
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,464
-What about your girlfriend, Qingqing?
-Come on. This is a college.

169
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:33,824
-You shouldn't be here. Stop asking.
-Please explain to us.

170
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:34,784
-Your Highness.
-Leave.

171
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:35,864
-Tell us.
-Leave now.

172
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,344
-Tell us.
-Your Highness.

173
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:38,504
Please leave now.

174
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,545
Let's go.

175
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:55,104
Qingqing, your latest work is amazing.
It's going viral on the internet.

176
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,045
Thank you.

177
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,344
I can't believe it was drawn by an intern.

178
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,544
You're so talented.
Your work is very appealing.

179
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,544
-Keep up the good work.
-Keep it up.

180
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:05,905
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

181
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,304
I've got good news for you.

182
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,405
It's totally unprecedented.

183
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,104
Since all of your previous work

184
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,424
have received great feedbacks
from the market,

185
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:18,304
the headquarters have decided
to transfer you to the office in Japan.

186
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:19,785
-Japan?
-Yes.

187
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,905
But I'm still in college.

188
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:25,624
It's all right.
There are many good schools in Japan.

189
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,184
Besides, you speak Japanese quite well.

190
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:30,765
You can continue
to pursue your studies there.

191
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,145
Look, Qingqing.

192
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,184
Many great artists started off in Japan.

193
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:39,415
You're just a step away from your dream.

194
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,855
Do you like this school?

195
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,115
I used to dislike it.

196
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,855
My life was like a math equation.

197
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,704
I had to take it step by step.

198
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,145
But after I met you...

199
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,904
What happened after you met me?

200
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,104
After I met you,

201
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,424
my life became a chemical equation.

202
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,855
I didn't know what to expect.

203
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:26,105
Of course. You were a bad student.

204
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,245
-There's something--
-There's something--

205
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,775
You go first.

206
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:41,305
My company wants me to go to Japan.

207
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:42,385
To travel?

208
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:45,345
No, to develop my career there.

209
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:49,335
I may have to transfer to a college there.

210
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,505
-Really?
-Yes.

211
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,955
Have you agreed?

212
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:57,225
Don't worry. I haven't.

213
00:15:58,865 --> 00:15:59,865
Because...

214
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:04,675
Because I want to stay with you.

215
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,465
I can draw comics anywhere.

216
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:12,025
I'm working on a long story now.

217
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,024
It'll be popular
after I finish drawing it.

218
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,465
I don't need to go to Japan.

219
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:21,055
What were you going to tell me?

220
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:25,475
My agency wants me to go to the States.

221
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:28,624
A record company on the West Coast
wants to sign me.

222
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,545
They want me to debut in the States.

223
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,544
They want you to go to the States?

224
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,225
Or you want to go to the States?

225
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:40,025
I...

226
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:42,784
I'm still considering.

227
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:45,585
Still considering? What about me?

228
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:47,864
Why don't you come with me?

229
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,784
Is that your decision after consideration?

230
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,315
Have you considered my situation?

231
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,384
SITU FENG LEAVING HIS GIRLFRIEND
FOR THE STATES

232
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,584
<i>His Highness, Situ Feng, admits
that he's leaving to the States</i>

233
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:05,055
<i>but didn't say a word
about his girlfriend.</i>

234
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,505
How ironic.

235
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:13,984
I found out the news about my boyfriend
from the entertainment news.

236
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:16,665
-They made it up.
-Made it up?

237
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,744
When were you going to tell me?

238
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,104
When you've got your visa

239
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,144
or after you've gone to America?

240
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,225
But music is my dream.

241
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:25,824
I didn't say that I was going.

242
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,024
Can't you consider my career?

243
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,695
Consider your career?

244
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:32,365
Have you considered me?

245
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,945
Kitty Chen.

246
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,705
Why was I so mad?

247
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:01,385
He came over to tell you about it.

248
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,025
He was just a bit late.

249
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,015
Did you have to overreact?

250
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:12,145
But at that moment,

251
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,544
he sounded like he was going to leave.

252
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,464
He's leaving. Are you leaving too?

253
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:17,785
Come back.

254
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,105
You can't go.

255
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,965
Situ Feng is going to leave.

256
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:26,905
<i>Let me stay in your heart</i>

257
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,385
<i>You affected me so deeply</i>

258
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,665
<i>I would give you my everything</i>

259
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,105
<i>No matter how it will end</i>

260
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,544
<i>The journey is sweet</i>

261
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:40,585
<i>Let me occupy your love</i>

262
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:44,505
<i>Never say no and hide it</i>

263
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,305
<i>I won't hesitate to kiss you</i>

264
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:52,025
<i>You'll be my exclusive sweetheart</i>

265
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,905
Feng, your music is great.

266
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,745
You're a genius.

267
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:14,415
I hope that our collaboration
will conquer the world.

268
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,985
Thank you.

269
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,384
Okay. Why the three of you
leave the room first?

270
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:24,664
I'll go through the contract
with Adam again.

271
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,845
-Sure.
-Okay.

272
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:36,904
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

273
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,184
I heard that Adam never gives compliments.

274
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:41,655
Everything is going really well.

275
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,104
That's right, Situ Feng.
Have you made up your mind?

276
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,775
You will have to make a decision.

277
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:48,545
I...

278
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,145
Hold on.

279
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,744
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICEMAIL

280
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,805
I need to answer a call.

281
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,465
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

282
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,375
<i>I've thought it through.</i>

283
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,744
<i>I shouldn't have thrown a fit at you.</i>

284
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,625
It's your dream after all.

285
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:20,545
I'm perhaps just a passerby in your life.

286
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,665
<i>If I care for you,</i>

287
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:26,625
<i>I should support you</i>

288
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,725
<i>in pursuing your dream.</i>

289
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,165
<i>When you're free,</i>

290
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:34,105
<i>remember to give me a call.</i>

291
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:38,095
<i>I'll always be here.</i>

292
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:51,744
Ms. Wang said that you could come in.

293
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,065
-Okay.
-Okay.

294
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:55,985
Let's go.

295
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,545
So Mr. Situ?

296
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,784
Are you willing to come to the States?

297
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:14,625
I...

298
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,985
I'll go to the States.

299
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,845
When are you leaving?

300
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:51,005
The day after tomorrow.

301
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,624
The day after tomorrow?

302
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,545
So soon?

303
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:02,675
Will you come to see me off?

304
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,885
I have a math test on that day.

305
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,495
I don't think I can go.

306
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,825
But I'm leaving.

307
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:29,085
Aren't you going to see me off?

308
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:34,345
Situ Feng.

309
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,625
Situ Feng.

310
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,585
I don't want to see you off.

311
00:22:58,105 --> 00:22:59,985
I just don't want to.

312
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:03,245
I won't be able to do it.

313
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:06,745
I can't bear to see you leave.

314
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,315
Let's say goodbye here.

315
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,225
Situ Feng.

316
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:17,545
Goodbye.

317
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,985
Everyone, take a look.

318
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,925
On the left side of the equal sign,

319
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,784
it's the law of cosine, isn't it?

320
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:47,905
What's on the right then?

321
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,784
It's the law of sine, right?

322
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:55,135
Why do we connect them with an equal sign?

323
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:59,255
All the sides are given, right? A and B...

324
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:05,145
Feng, your song "To Be Your Love..."

325
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,565
It's really infectious.

326
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:11,685
Can you share with me
the concept of this creation?

327
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,205
I wrote this song

328
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:22,565
for the most important girl in my life.

329
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,805
I've never seen a girl

330
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:28,705
so versatile.

331
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:32,985
<i>She's a math genius.</i>

332
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,785
<i>A champion in Taekwondo.</i>

333
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,345
<i>A musician.</i>

334
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:40,775
<i>A comic artist.</i>

335
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,755
<i>The female lead in my music video.</i>

336
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:46,945
<i>My number one fan.</i>

337
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,145
FENG

338
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:52,005
<i>To me, she's also the prettiest girl
on campus.</i>

339
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,215
<i>She's kind.</i>

340
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:54,705
<i>Courageous.</i>

341
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:57,784
<i>Has a strong sense of justice.</i>

342
00:24:57,785 --> 00:24:58,715
<i>Optimistic.</i>

343
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,145
<i>I'm affected</i>

344
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:02,665
<i>and encouraged</i>

345
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:05,464
<i>by her every move and every word.</i>

346
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,785
I can do it.

347
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:10,625
<i>I can do it.</i>

348
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:15,895
<i>I have already fallen deeply in love
with her before I realized it.</i>

349
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,945
When I broke all the chains

350
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,085
and was about to be bold in love,

351
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:49,335
I found out

352
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:53,645
that we had to part again.

353
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:58,504
I'm so moved.

354
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:00,664
It reminds me of my first love.

355
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,464
I can't do this. I have to go find her.

356
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:05,705
I have a flight to catch.

357
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:08,745
Adam, I'm sorry.

358
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:12,345
I made a decision
without following my heart.

359
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:16,944
I can't go to the States with you.

360
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:17,955
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:40,905
Where's Chen Qingqing?

362
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:42,304
She went to find you.

363
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:46,075
She said that she wanted
to give you chocolates.

364
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:55,985
<i>Lights touched your naughty curls</i>

365
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,585
<i>Lights kissed on your rosy cheeks</i>

366
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:05,265
<i>Lights quietly lit up
The freckles on your face</i>

367
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,865
<i>When you feel down</i>

368
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:13,745
<i>When you couldn't speak</i>

369
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:16,985
<i>How do I make you smile again?</i>

370
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,025
<i>Get your cuteness back</i>

371
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:38,225
<i>Turning through the alleys</i>

372
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:40,025
<i>Where we first met</i>

373
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:43,065
<i>Those absurd moments</i>

374
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:47,945
<i>What is to be anticipated?</i>

375
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:51,665
<i>Let me stay in your heart</i>

376
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:54,945
<i>You affected me so deeply</i>

377
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,945
<i>I would give you my everything</i>

378
00:29:58,025 --> 00:30:00,665
<i>No matter how it will end</i>

379
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:01,984
<i>The journey is sweet</i>

380
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:05,745
<i>Let me occupy your love</i>

381
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:09,105
<i>Never say no and hide it</i>

382
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:11,825
<i>I won't hesitate to kiss you</i>

383
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:15,185
<i>You'll be my exclusive sweetheart</i>

384
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:47,785
<i>Turning through the alleys</i>

385
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,465
<i>Where we first met</i>

386
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,745
<i>Those absurd moments</i>

387
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:57,425
<i>What is to be anticipated?</i>

388
00:30:57,865 --> 00:31:01,105
<i>Let me stay in your heart</i>

389
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:04,985
<i>You affected me so deeply</i>

390
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,665
<i>I would give you my everything</i>

391
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:10,385
<i>No matter how it will end</i>

392
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,145
<i>The journey is sweet</i>

393
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:33,505
Qingqing, no matter what happens,

394
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,835
I'll never leave you.

395
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:42,175
I love you.

396
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:24,624
<i>This is where my story will end.</i>

397
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,544
<i>It has sort of come to an end.</i>

398
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,345
<i>So what do I want to tell you?</i>

399
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:31,744
<i>I want to tell you,</i>

400
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:34,464
<i>that by running away,
I lost my protection,</i>

401
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:36,505
<i>I lost my loving family,</i>

402
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:39,944
<i>I lost the look that had accompanied me
the last 18 years.</i>

403
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:41,195
<i>I had enemies.</i>

404
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:42,904
<i>I ran into danger.</i>

405
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:44,215
<i>I made friends.</i>

406
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,015
<i>I found love.</i>

407
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:50,225
<i>I even found my true self.</i>

408
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,304
<i>I don't know
whether this story is a cliffhanger</i>

409
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,545
<i>or a comedy.</i>

410
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:58,865
<i>I can only say</i>

411
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,744
<i>that sometimes a story doesn't need
to have an ending.</i>

412
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:06,035
<i>It's the same for other people's stories.</i>

413
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:11,435
<i>You will only contradict yourself
if you want to define everything.</i>

414
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:24,655
<i>Lan Xinya is still a mean girl.</i>

415
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,864
<i>She said that she'd never
love another man.</i>

416
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:30,885
<i>But the truth is, Hua Munian
has already tamed her.</i>

417
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,224
<i>I don't know what happened on their trip.</i>

418
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:38,315
<i>Why did Hua Munian become
so manly all of a sudden?</i>

419
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:46,545
<i>Lin Yiyang has become really gentle</i>

420
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,085
<i>since he started to date Fangfang.</i>

421
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,705
Is this your coffee?

422
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:54,825
Come on.

423
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:58,715
I'm sorry. That's just who he is.

424
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,464
How many times have I told you?

425
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,784
Don't throw other people's things away.

426
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,295
I can't help it.

427
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:16,065
<i>I'm still not used to his change.</i>

428
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:30,024
<i>Gu Nanxi said
that he would never find true love again.</i>

429
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,585
<i>But he met someone</i>

430
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,585
<i>who made him feel</i>

431
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:35,744
<i>the effect of slow motion,</i>

432
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:36,935
<i>with a blower</i>

433
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:39,505
<i>and background music.</i>

434
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:42,584
-Nalan Yiyi.
-Hi.

435
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:43,984
Why did you come to Yuncheng?

436
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,704
Mr. Chen asked me to pay you a visit.

437
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:48,064
So I decided to transfer
to Ming De College.

438
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,784
That's great. Sit down.

439
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:51,184
Let me introduce you.

440
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:53,985
-This is Gu Nanxi.
-Hi.

441
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:55,385
Situ Feng.

442
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:58,264
-You've already met him.
-Yes.

443
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,465
Gu Nanxi.

444
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,445
So is your English nickname Nancy?

445
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:11,344
Yiyi, since we seem to get along so well,

446
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,264
why don't I show you around the school?

447
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:15,065
Sure, let's go.

448
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:20,735
Don't come home tonight.

449
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:24,944
Let me check on them.

450
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:26,424
<i>As for Situ Feng and me,</i>

451
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:29,704
<i>a publisher is going to publish
my comic book.</i>

452
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,824
<i>Becoming a famous comic artist
is happening soon.</i>

453
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:34,325
<i>As for Situ Feng,</i>

454
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,984
<i>ever since he gave up going to the States,</i>

455
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:39,265
<i>his career has plummeted.</i>

456
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,464
<i>He completely depends on me now.</i>

457
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:44,665
<i>And of course, we have our own kid.</i>

458
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:48,185
<i>He's a family man now.</i>

459
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:52,304
<i>He stays home and takes care
of our kid every day.</i>

460
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:54,225
HIS CAREER HAS PLUMMETED

461
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:58,355
Hey, what is this? This is ridiculous.

462
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,865
"My career has plummeted"?

463
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,304
My fans have never left me. All right?

464
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,064
And about having a child,

465
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,584
you told me
that you didn't want a kid so soon.

466
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:08,865
Situ Feng.

467
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,104
I have to adapt our story
in order to cater to the market.

468
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:13,475
Adapt our story.

469
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:16,984
I have to make your life seem miserable.

470
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:20,784
Don't worry. Trust me.
You'll make a strong comeback.

471
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,415
I won't accept it.

472
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,185
Situ Feng.

473
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:26,344
I can change it if you don't like it.

474
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,584
I can change the story.

475
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,835
Something like someone
from your agency breaks your leg?

476
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:44,145
<i>ACCIDENTALLY IN LOVE</i>

477
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:49,825
THE END

478
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:52,595
