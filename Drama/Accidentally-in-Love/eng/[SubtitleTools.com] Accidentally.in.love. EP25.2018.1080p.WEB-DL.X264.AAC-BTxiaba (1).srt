EPISODE 25

2
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:00,665
<i>Qingqing.</i>

3
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,944
<i>This is the first time
we're going on a trip together.</i>

4
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:03,944
That's right.

5
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:07,105
This is my first real trip with friends.

6
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,184
Ever since I found out
about your relationship with Lin Yiyang,

7
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:12,344
I've begun to find him very attractive.

8
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,175
Love me, love my dog, as they say.

9
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,704
Cut the nonsense.
There's nothing going on between us.

10
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,424
But as for you and Situ Feng,

11
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:21,424
his attitude toward you has changed

12
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,584
since you came back from the tower.

13
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:26,184
Did the legend of the tower come true?

14
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,584
-Are you two together?
-Don't make wild guesses.

15
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,455
You'll find out later.

16
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:35,064
The driver has been waiting for two hours.

17
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:38,224
Gosh, we needed to put on makeup.
Don't you know?

18
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,344
Could you show me some respect?

19
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:41,745
-Shut up.
-Hey.

20
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:44,464
Fine, I will forgive you.

21
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,944
I will carry your suitcase for you.

22
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,024
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

23
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:47,985
That way.

24
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,305
Hello, Lanting.

25
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>Xinya, have you left with Situ Feng?</i>

26
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,904
I'm about to leave.

27
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,504
I don't know about him though.

28
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,985
<i>Aren't you two coming together?</i>

29
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,285
<i>I thought...</i>

30
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:01,535
What is it?

31
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:04,144
<i>I thought that Feng was going
to pick you up.</i>

32
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:07,064
<i>He told me that he was going
to meet up with someone.</i>

33
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:07,945
I see.

34
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:18,395
Hello, Hua Munian. What are you doing?

35
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,584
Cut the crap.

36
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:22,584
Meet me in ten minutes.
You're going to the beach with me.

37
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:23,664
Can you stop talking?

38
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:27,025
Do you want the budget or not? That's it.

39
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,115
Hello, Gu Nanxi.

40
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,345
-You're here.
-Xinya.

41
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:58,624
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,424
Why? Am I not welcome here?

43
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:04,885
We're all friends.
Of course, you're welcome to join us.

44
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:08,384
Nanxi, Feng,
I'm going to look for Yiyang and Lanting.

45
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:09,504
I'll meet you at the beach.

46
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,185
Okay. See you later.

47
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,544
Gu Nanxi, let us get some rest.

48
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:16,855
We're starving.

49
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:19,104
I will give you your room keys.

50
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:22,205
Situ Feng ate two-thirds of our snacks.

51
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,885
Don't say that.

52
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,465
Go check in first.

53
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,224
By the way, Lanting is throwing
a barbecue party on the beach.

54
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,064
Come and join us when you get enough rest.

55
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,184
We're sharing a room.

56
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,365
Chen Qingqing.

57
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,585
Hua Munian.

58
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,825
Xinya kidnapped me here.

59
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:42,224
She threatened me with the budget.

60
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,905
Mr. Gu, please help me out.

61
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,575
I'm struggling to survive.

62
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,944
-Qingqing, lend me your sunscreen.
-Yes?

63
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,584
I was in a hurry, so I didn't bring it.

64
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:55,504
You're a man.
You don't need to wear sunscreen.

65
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:58,345
UV light can damage your skin.

66
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,904
It causes your skin to age and become dry.

67
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:03,585
It's 80 percent the sun's fault.

68
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,864
If you wear sunscreen every day,
why are you still so tanned?

69
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,965
-Fangfang, let's go to our room.
-Hey?

70
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,105
Situ Feng.

71
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,304
You have such pale skin
and you're also an idol.

72
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,225
You must have sunscreen.

73
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,355
Gu Nanxi, let's go.

74
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,385
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

75
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:29,835
Welcome back, Lanting.

76
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:34,185
When Lanting went abroad to study,
I secretly cried.

77
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,984
I missed all of you when I was abroad.

78
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,984
I could only stay a day
the last time I came back.

79
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,264
I didn't get to spend time with you.

80
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,344
I got on a plane the minute
I finished my thesis.

81
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,105
Welcome back, Lanting.

82
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,184
I haven't seen you guys in a while.

83
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:50,824
It seems like we have a lot to catch up.

84
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:53,235
Everyone has changed after all.

85
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:55,065
This lady.

86
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,184
I've seen you at the party last time.

87
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,624
My name is Zhang Fangfang.

88
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,745
Yiyang.

89
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,645
Your taste is very plain lately.

90
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:10,584
Excuse me.

91
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:14,024
Don't try to bully Fangfang
when I'm not around.

92
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,384
Qingqing, don't think too much.

93
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:19,545
Situ Feng's friend is also my friend.

94
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:22,825
Come on. Let's make a toast, everyone.

95
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,345
Here.

96
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,845
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

97
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,565
Let's play something.

98
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,064
How about dodgeball?

99
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,615
-Sure.
-All right.

100
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:41,744
We used to play that when we were young.

101
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,184
-I'm up for it.
-Let's do it.

102
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,385
Okay.

103
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,005
Do you know how to play?

104
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,184
We've played together since we were kids.

105
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:58,144
We're not used to having outsiders
in our team.

106
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,464
Will it be all right if you three
are on the same team?

107
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,744
Sure, no problem.

108
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,304
Fangfang, I will protect you later.

109
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:06,665
Will you three be all right?

110
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:07,944
Of course we will.

111
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,904
It's not fair for you three girls.

112
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:12,064
-I'll join your team.
-Okay.

113
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,824
Lin Yiyang, I'm glad you're here.
Look at Yiyang.

114
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,495
What did you mean by three girls?

115
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:20,225
I'm absolutely a--

116
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,065
I think that this is a great idea.

117
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,944
I think that this is a great idea too.

118
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:32,585
I hope that someone wouldn't cry
after getting hit in the nose.

119
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,375
Let's go.

120
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,125
-Hua Munian.
-Chen Qingqing.

121
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,064
I will explain the rules.

122
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,424
Each team will take turns to serve.

123
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:45,944
The boys have to protect the girls
from getting hit.

124
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,544
Hands are allowed to touch the ball.

125
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,824
One point will be deducted
if the ball hits the body.

126
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:52,304
Three points will be deducted
if it hits a girl.

127
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,384
All right. Let's assign our jobs.

128
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,424
That's not necessary.

129
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:58,744
Feng, protect Xinya.
You're in charge of protecting me.

130
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,175
-Okay.
-I agree.

131
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:05,375
I've never played this game before.

132
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,864
When the ball is coming after you,
hide behind me.

133
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,505
How about this?

134
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:14,944
Hua Munian, you boys
are in charge of protecting Fangfang.

135
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,304
I'll be all right
because I have good reflexes.

136
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:18,864
What do you say? Let's do this then.

137
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,815
Let's go.

138
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,205
-Come here.
-Protect Fangfang.

139
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:39,385
Come on.

140
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,465
Fangfang.

141
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,315
Fangfang, watch out.

142
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,855
Fangfang, are you all right?

143
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,225
Just hide behind me.

144
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,464
Why did you come to the front?

145
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:55,385
Mr. Lin.

146
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,784
Why are you so brave today?

147
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,704
How dare you bully my girl?

148
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,625
-Your girl?
-Your girl?

149
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:02,824
You won't get points from Fangfang.

150
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,624
Don't even try to get points from Xinya.

151
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,505
Come on.

152
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:09,385
A hero saves a damsel in distress.
Let's play.

153
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,785
Come on.

154
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,825
Hold on.

155
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:23,945
Why does your team

156
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,984
always target the weak girl?

157
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:27,975
You're not playing fair.

158
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,624
All right. We won't bully the girl.

159
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,424
We'll aim at you, the tomboy.

160
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,025
Hold on. Pause.

161
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:36,504
-Hua Munian, protect me.
-Hey.

162
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,735
-Come on, Situ Feng.
-Wait.

163
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:50,985
Qingqing.

164
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,264
Qingqing, are you all right?

165
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:57,185
Did you get hit in the eye?
Let me take a look.

166
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,224
Situ Feng, are you okay?

167
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,465
Let me see.

168
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:01,744
I was acting.

169
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,865
You're crazy.

170
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,784
I did get hit in the eye just now. Gosh.

171
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:08,705
Really?

172
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:10,535
Yes, my eye got hit.

173
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,424
-Chen Qingqing.
-Come and get me.

174
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,105
Hey, Chen Qingqing.

175
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,864
You pulled a prank on me again.

176
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,735
Xinya, it's all right.

177
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:23,495
We'll have a good time with her later.

178
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:26,704
Hey, you will lose if you go on like this.

179
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,345
How about this?

180
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,064
The girls will protect the guys instead.

181
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,344
Sure, I would like that very much.

182
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:37,224
Why not? Cross-gender acting
has always been Situ Feng's strong suit.

183
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,944
Gu Nanxi, don't betray your teammate.

184
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,265
Can you do it?

185
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:47,075
Chen Qingqing,
you'd better step up your game.

186
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:50,685
I'm not afraid of you.

187
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:59,664
Baby, can I do anything to help you?

188
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:01,104
-Yes.
-What is it?

189
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,065
Shut up.

190
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:07,424
We've got a point.

191
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:09,304
Baby, you're wonderful. You saved my life.

192
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,304
Don't get carried away.

193
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:12,584
I've been protecting you
since the beginning.

194
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,575
Come on. Let's continue.

195
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:17,265
Over here.

196
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,905
Hurry, throw over there.

197
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,545
-Hit her.
-Again.

198
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,605
Come on, Lan Xinya.

199
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,464
You're good.

200
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,264
Lanting, it's only a game.

201
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,264
Take it easy.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

202
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,264
There's no such thing as taking it easy.

203
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,544
If you want to play,
you have to play seriously.

204
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:48,824
I believe that Chen Qingqing

205
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,424
is not the kind of person
who surrenders easily as well.

206
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:53,785
Qingqing, let's take a break.

207
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:57,725
It's all right. I can still play.

208
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,115
Let's surrender.

209
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,584
How can we give up?

210
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:04,104
I'm not going to lose to Lan Xinya.

211
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:06,184
Situ Feng, have faith in me.

212
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,555
Be careful then.

213
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:12,945
Come on.

214
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,745
Hey!

215
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,225
Hey! Stop.

216
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:25,365
-Stop playing.
-What is he doing?

217
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:27,825
Qingqing.

218
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,144
Qingqing, are you all right?

219
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:31,025
Qingqing.

220
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,655
-Are you okay?
-I'm all right.

221
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:37,585
Come on.

222
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,985
What's the matter?

223
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,264
The game's over.

224
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,464
We're all tired.

225
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,024
Let's go back to the hotel
and get some rest.

226
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:48,945
Okay.

227
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:53,425
I agree.

228
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:58,315
Wait a minute.

229
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,624
Since there's a winning and a losing team,

230
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,104
shouldn't there be a punishment?

231
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:06,664
That's right. Don't be a sore loser.

232
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:09,184
Besides, the sea breeze is nice.

233
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:11,584
What's the rush to go back to the hotel?

234
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:14,765
Why don't we sit down and have a chat?

235
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:16,584
All right. Let's sit down for a while.

236
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:17,545
Let's go.

237
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:29,755
The winning team is allowed

238
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,984
<i>to make the losing team
play Truth or Dare.</i>

239
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,744
You can only pick either truth or dare.

240
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,985
So? Who's going to be first?

241
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:42,985
Xinya, Qingqing should receive
the punishment for her team.

242
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,664
She was the player
who lost the most points after all.

243
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,225
What do you think?

244
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:48,585
I think--

245
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:49,744
I've got an idea.

246
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,705
Feng?

247
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,625
Let me hand out the punishment.

248
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,025
You're all my friends.

249
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:03,544
There's something
that I don't want to hide anymore.

250
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:06,335
I hope all of you would understand.

251
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,385
Especially Xinya.

252
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,185
Feng.

253
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,125
Chen Qingqing.

254
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,685
Here's your punishment.

255
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,255
Be my girlfriend.

256
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,704
Situ Feng. No one does it like this.

257
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:41,795
What's the matter?
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

258
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:43,865
Yes.

259
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,464
Let me introduce you.

260
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:54,305
This is my girlfriend, Chen Qingqing.

261
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,695
Qingqing, why didn't you tell me?

262
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,305
We've been through so much lately.

263
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:04,944
We went to great lengths

264
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,905
to be together.

265
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,544
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

266
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,665
Bottoms up.

267
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,365
Baby, congratulations.

268
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,424
Please don't tell anyone about it yet.

269
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:21,064
We're a family.
Let's keep the news to ourselves.

270
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:22,744
Xinya, are you all right?

271
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,755
Don't cry.

272
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,544
I know that you did a lot for Situ Feng.

273
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:30,655
But he has never laid his eyes on you.

274
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:34,425
Situ Feng!

275
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:37,735
I've always liked you.

276
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,435
Didn't you know that?

277
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:45,784
You promised to take care of me forever.
Did you forget that?

278
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,435
Xinya, you must have misunderstood.

279
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:50,344
I did promise to take care of you.

280
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,645
But just as a little sister.

281
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,264
Feng, Xinya has stayed by your side
for so many years.

282
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,064
Have you ever liked her at all?

283
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,855
Have you ever had feelings for her?

284
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:03,265
Enough.

285
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,745
I'll go check on her.

286
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:21,665
Lan Xinya.

287
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,405
What are you doing?

288
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,504
Are you trying to make fun of me?

289
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,245
Lan Xinya, calm down.

290
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:30,344
It's just a man.

291
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:32,035
You'll get over it.

292
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:36,875
This is merely a small setback
in your life. Do you hear me?

293
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,385
If Feng is not with me,

294
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:44,035
I would rather not live this life.

295
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:47,145
Xinya.

296
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:49,865
Lan Xinya.

297
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,125
Xinya, open the door!

298
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,075
Lan Xinya, open the door!

299
00:16:58,745 --> 00:16:59,585
Xinya.

300
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,344
Situ Feng, hurry, go check on Xinya.

301
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:25,864
She didn't have dinner.
So I wanted to bring her some snacks.

302
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:28,104
I knocked on her door,
but she didn't answer.

303
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,504
I asked the reception.
No one saw her leave the hotel.

304
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:33,125
What? Let's go and take a look.

305
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,664
What should we do?

306
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,505
Xinya!

307
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,545
Xinya!

308
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,065
Xinya!

309
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,424
Situ Feng, what's the matter?

310
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:44,424
Chen Qingqing, you'd better pray
that she's all right.

311
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:48,575
If anything happens to Xinya,
I will not let you go.

312
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:52,744
Step aside. The manager
is going to open the door.

313
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:54,495
Sir, it's this room.

314
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,385
Hey!

315
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:01,785
-Xinya.
-Xinya.

316
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,705
Wake up.

317
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,225
What's going on?

318
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,865
Sleeping pills.

319
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,664
Qingqing, how is she?

320
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:12,995
She still has a pulse.
Hurry, take her to the hospital.

321
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:16,315
Open the door.

322
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:17,705
Let me.

323
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:19,664
Chen Qingqing, don't cause more trouble.

324
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:24,185
If you weren't here,
things wouldn't have been like this.

325
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:30,985
Doctor, Is my daughter all right?

326
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:32,955
Don't worry.

327
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,144
The patient is now in a stable condition.

328
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,864
She needs to get some rest.

329
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,915
Please don't disturb her.

330
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:40,865
Okay.

331
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,625
Hello, Grandpa.

332
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,744
Why did you call me so early?

333
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,544
Did you stay up late working?

334
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,465
No.

335
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:16,975
I couldn't sleep
because I was missing you.

336
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:20,425
Qingqing, where are you now?

337
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:21,545
<i>Me?</i>

338
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:26,105
I'm with a friend right now.

339
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,824
What's the matter, Grandpa?

340
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,704
Have you started coughing again?

341
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,105
No, I'm all right.

342
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,984
My throat itched, that's all.

343
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,065
Grandpa.

344
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:41,184
Don't lie to me like I'm a three-year-old.

345
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,295
Have you fallen ill again?

346
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,584
Where are you?

347
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,385
I'm at home.

348
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,824
Wait for me, Grandpa.

349
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:50,064
I'm going to get a plane ticket
and fly home right away.

350
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,685
Wait for me. I'll be home soon.

351
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:07,825
Lan Xinya.

352
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:09,965
Is she all right?

353
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,245
She should be fine.

354
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:14,464
They've pumped her stomach.

355
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:18,984
The doctor said that she'll need
to be hospitalized for a couple of days.

356
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,784
I'm glad to hear that.

357
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,895
My grandpa just called me.

358
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,104
He has fallen ill.

359
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,705
So I have to go back
to Jincheng right away.

360
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:31,785
Okay.

361
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:35,025
Take good care of your grandpa.

362
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:41,545
I should get going.
Take care of Lan Xinya.

363
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,745
Okay.

Okay.

367
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,305
I'll miss you.

368
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,265
Me too.

369
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,715

371
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,424
Sir, could you please drive faster?

00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:31,265
Okay.

373
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:46,865
Grandpa.

374
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,265
I came back to see you.

375
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,465
Xinya.

376
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,144
How are you doing? Are you feeling better?

377
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:11,075
Do you want some water?

378
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:18,865
Xinya.

379
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,855
Just get ready to become Situ Feng's wife.

380
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:40,624
<i>Situ Feng, come to the hospital now.
Something happened to Xinya.</i>

381
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,705
<i>What if</i>

382
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:44,064
I can't come back to Yuncheng?

383
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,344
<i>What will you do?</i>

384
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,744
<i>No matter how deep their love is,</i>

385
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:48,624
<i>but if they can't see each other,</i>

386
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,184
<i>their feelings will definitely fade.</i>

387
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:51,465
Situ Feng.

388
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,744
What the hell is this?

389
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,024
What do you mean I need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

390
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,544
<i>How could you do this to Qingqing?</i>

391
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:58,624
<i>The heir of the Chen Family,
the most prestigious</i>

392
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,824
