EPISODE 14

2
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,925
Chen Qingqing, what are you drawing?

3
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,185
Qingqing.

4
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:44,464
Look, there's meteor shower.

5
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:46,425
-Hey, Situ Feng!
-Hey.

6
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,784
Why are you drawing cartoons of me?

7
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:02,344
This was something I saw online,
drawn by one of your fans.

8
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,424
I‘m just copying her drawing.

9
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,795
I didn't mean to offend you.

10
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,264
These are drawings of people
not wearing clothes.

11
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,325
Is that me and Gu Nanxi?

12
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:16,825
What's that?

13
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:19,515
-Let me have a look.
-Get lost.

14
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:38,345
Hey!

15
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,435
Please stop looking.

16
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:42,985
Why?

17
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:45,584
The drawings on the few last pages

18
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,744
are mostly of how attentive
you are in class

19
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:50,264
and how great you are at maths.

20
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:55,935
Which are different qualities from
the idol image you're trying to portray.

21
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,105
Qingqing.

22
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,845
Come with me to my office.

23
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,905
Have a good chat.

24
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:36,665
Grandpa.

25
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,704
What brought you here?

26
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:40,745
Qingqing.

27
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:43,704
Look what have you turned into.

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,224
You've got to come home with me!

29
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,464
I don't want to go back with you.

30
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:50,824
There's a limit to being rebellious.

31
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,565
Look at yourself now.

32
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,864
You could've lived a comfortable life
as an heiress,

33
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,384
but yet you chose to stoop so low!

34
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,144
Grandpa, what do you mean
by stooping so low?

35
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,184
For these past few months,

36
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,544
although I'm not under your supervision

37
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:06,384
and I don't look as pretty as before,

38
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,785
but do you know

39
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,944
that this is the first time in my life

40
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:12,424
I was able to make my own decisions?

41
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,144
I am very happy now.

42
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:15,705
Don't lie.

43
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:20,065
You grew up under my protection.

44
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,665
Everything you did was planned by me.

45
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:28,825
Without me, you're going to hurt yourself.

46
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,065
Grandpa.

47
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:33,945
What you're saying now is hurting me.

48
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:38,385
Why can't I depend on myself
to live a good life?

49
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,904
By looking at how you look right now?

50
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,744
Those idol dramas
must have gotten into your head!

51
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,625
Look at yourself now.

52
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:48,544
You look like an ordinary girl!

53
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:51,184
You're never going to make it far in life.

54
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:55,584
Since that's what you think,
I'm going to prove you wrong.

55
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,075
How are you going to prove it?

56
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:02,905
MISS CAMPUS

57
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,824
Since you've brought it up,

58
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:12,625
I am going to use my current image

59
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,424
to win the Miss Campus contest
and prove you wrong.

60
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,785
-You'll be the winner?
-Yes.

61
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,664
If I become the winner for this contest,

62
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:23,845
you'll have to let me stay in Ming De.

63
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:25,785
Okay.

64
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:27,664
But what if you lose?

65
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,704
If I fail to win first place,

66
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:34,264
then I will follow your wish
and go back to Jincheng with you.

67
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:36,245
I accept your conditions.

68
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:40,815
But I hope that you will
keep your promise.

69
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,065
You'll never know who wins or loses.

70
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,824
Come here and take a look.

71
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:01,304
Ming De's Yearly
Miss Campus contest is here

72
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:03,344
and it's going to be beautifully amazing.

73
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,624
As for this year,
it's going to be a tough competition.

74
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,625
Hua Munian!

75
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:09,584
Sorry, excuse me.

76
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:10,504
Chen Qingqing.

77
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,065
Why are you here?

78
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,864
I'm here to join the Miss Campus contest.

79
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,984
-Join Miss Campus contest?
-That's right.

80
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:18,945
Excuse me,

81
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:22,424
this is a campus beauty contest
not a campus Joker contest.

82
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,544
Although, I have to say
you do look quite comical,

83
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:25,944
but this is a search for beauty.

84
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:26,865
Beauty!

85
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,144
Are you only referring to external beauty?

86
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:32,205
How shallow.

87
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,945
What is beauty?

88
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:38,305
True beauty is
a form of beauty from within.

89
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:41,985
Rubbish.

90
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,424
Beauty is beauty.

91
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,904
Why are you spouting nonsense?

92
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,715
Do you see the dorms?

93
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,424
Isn't it over there?

94
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,424
Come closer.

95
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,144
You should go back and tidy up.

96
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,584
-This really doesn't suit you.
-Hua Munian!

97
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:57,475
Ugly ducklings can turn out
to be beautiful swans.

98
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,304
Never stop someone
who overestimates themselves.

99
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:06,225
As you might end up missing a touching

100
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:08,155
and inspirational story.

101
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:11,544
Ms. Lan, are you here
to support Chen Qingqing?

102
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,384
Now, people shouldn't forget

103
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:16,904
the reason ugly ducklings
can turn into beautiful swans

104
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,065
is because

105
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,665
they were swans to begin with.

106
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:30,184
You seem to be so interested in swans.

107
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:33,355
Don't tell me you're craving for swans?

108
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,384
Only a toad would crave for swans.

109
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:39,535
Hua Munian, give me the application form.

110
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:44,905
You're very clever.

111
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,885
What are they discussing?

112
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,225
They look so passionate.

113
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,904
If it's this time of the year,

114
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:02,744
I'm guessing the list
for the Miss Campus contestants are out.

115
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:03,745
How silly.

116
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,904
Maybe you should take a look.

117
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,624
Aren't you looking for a girlfriend?

118
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,625
Very funny.

119
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:22,544
Someone from our class was selected.

120
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:25,064
This is our time to unite together
and support Chen Qingqing.

121
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:25,984
Class president,

122
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:29,024
our competitors aren't that strong,
but it's our own team member who is weak.

123
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:31,424
We can't let others look down on us.

124
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,104
Let's gather everyone

125
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:34,264
and cheer for Qingqing

126
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,945
-all the way.
-Yes.

127
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:45,224
-Chen Qingqing, we will support you.
-Chen Qingqing, we will support you.

128
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:49,865
-Qingqing is going to win it.
-Qingqing is going to win it.

129
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,665
Thank you.

130
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:52,664
Thanks, everyone.

131
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:54,665
Thanks for the support.

132
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,225
Situ Feng.

133
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:10,584
I will be participating in Miss Campus.

134
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:13,075
Could you write a song for me?

135
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:15,344
Why did you join the contest?

136
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,504
It doesn't suit you at all.

137
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:18,704
I won't allow it.

138
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:21,024
What makes you think you can stop me?

139
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,664
This competition is important to me.

140
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,944
Why are you always
drawing attention to yourself?

141
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:27,384
Others think that you're a joke.

142
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,505
Are you even aware of it?

143
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,505
Mr. Gu.

144
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,945
There's something

145
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,504
I would like to speak to you in private.

146
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,345
Okay.

147
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:57,945
Let's go.

148
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:16,375
Why are you playing with that
instead of darts?

149
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:18,665
Gu Nanxi.

150
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,584
I want to ask you something.

151
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,745
What did Chen Qingqing ask you just now?

152
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,585
She said

153
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,344
it was regarding the Miss Campus contest.

154
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,744
She asked for my help.

155
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:33,905
What?

156
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,185
Asked for your help?

157
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:38,545
Yes, why?

158
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:41,705
Nothing.

159
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:44,185
Well...

160
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:50,625
I was just thinking
that she's not that pretty.

161
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,465
That's what I meant.

162
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,304
It seems to me that
you're quite concerned about her.

163
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,104
Do I? I'm not concerned about her.

164
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,845
Not concerned at all.

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,665
No.

166
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:21,535
It should be this instead.

167
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,424
I like the combination
of these two instruments.

168
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:49,904
I should compose songs
using these in the future.

169
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:54,344
Then I'm afraid Chen Qingqing
might ask you for copyright fees.

170
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,264
She's the one who came up with this idea.

171
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:59,585
Plus, she's playing it for the contest.

172
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,385
-Chen Qingqing did this?
-Yes.

173
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,305
From an errand runner,

174
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,464
to scoring A for her studies,

175
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,575
to having such a talent...

176
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:12,295
She's like a box of chocolates.

177
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,875
You'll just never know what you'll get.

178
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,904
All right, just leave it here.
It's good here.

179
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,715
Let's just start now.

180
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,705
What a busybody.

181
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:33,744
Chen Qingqing, where are you going?

182
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,584
Aren't you going to practice?

183
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,064
I'm going to change my outfit

184
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:39,785
into something nice and sexy.

185
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,144
That is how the judges
will give me a higher score.

186
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:44,265
Don't you agree, Mr. Gu?

187
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,375
What are you looking at?

188
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:17,585
Nothing.

189
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:28,144
Oh, right, Situ Feng.
I just want to tell you in advance.

190
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,664
Even though I'm letting you
be our audience today,

191
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,664
you're not allowed to disturb us.

192
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:37,795
This Miss Campus contest
is extremely important to me.

193
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:40,855
Let's begin, Gu Nanxi.

194
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,425
Nanxi.

195
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,385
Xinya.

196
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,224
What brings you here?

197
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,944
Were you looking for me?

198
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:16,824
Our Student Council Secretariat
received a letter of complaint earlier.

199
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:17,945
Complaint?

200
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,405
What kind of complaint?

201
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,824
This complaint is about
the leader of the Student Council.

202
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,565
A complaint about me?

203
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,935
Come over here.

204
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,744
They're suspecting

205
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,144
your relationship with Chen Qingqing

206
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:39,064
since you're not only helping her
as one of the judges for the contest,

207
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,624
you're also performing along with her.

208
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,625
This is really unfair
to other contestants.

209
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,065
Well--

210
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:52,745
Lan Xinya.

211
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,825
Do you think I'm blind?

212
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,584
Most of these people who complained

213
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,624
are girls from your circle

214
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,584
or the girls from the Goddess club.

215
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,945
You're doing this on purpose!

216
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:06,505
That's only your wild guess.

217
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:09,024
Everything that's written on the letter

218
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,304
are in fact happening right now.

219
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:14,184
Plus, if the person
who complained about this

220
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:15,904
informs the school leaders,

221
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,704
you won't only get disqualified
from the contest,

222
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,285
Nanxi's title as
the Student Council President

223
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,225
might also be removed.

224
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:26,944
This is a piece of advice.
You should drop out of the contest now.

225
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:30,525
Stop making a nuisance
of yourself and others.

226
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:44,904
It might not be as serious as you think.

227
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:49,024
The rules for the Miss Campus contest
was approved by the principal.

228
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,424
But as a judge for the contest,

229
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,304
I shouldn't have
helped one of the contestants.

230
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,584
This is my fault.

231
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:55,624
Don't worry.

232
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,624
As long as you stop helping Chen Qingqing,

233
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,515
I believe the other students
will drop the matter.

234
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,625
Qingqing.

235
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,145
It's okay.

236
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,624
I shouldn't have asked for your help
given your position.

237
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,304
The fact that you actually agreed...

238
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,165
I really appreciate it.

239
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,064
Actually, there's someone else

240
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,344
who knows how to play this song.

241
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:17,465
Someone else?

242
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,784
Nanxi, you might as well save your breath.

243
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,224
Don't you ever forget that

244
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:25,384
she's the one who almost
got you into trouble.

245
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:26,385
Let's go.

246
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,445
Why are you here?

247
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:51,185
I have something important to ask you.

248
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,824
I need to win first place
for the Miss Campus contest.

249
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:55,945
Otherwise,

250
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:59,535
you won't be able to see me anymore.

251
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:01,865
Why?

252
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:05,345
I can't tell you now.

253
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,224
How would you like me to help you?

254
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:12,035
Gu Nanxi told me that

255
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,144
besides himself,

256
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:17,104
there's another person who knows
how to play that song on the piano.

257
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,235
I'm guessing

258
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,064
the person he's referring to

259
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:21,225
is you.

260
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:24,464
<i>I knew sooner or later,
you'd ask for my help,</i>

261
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:26,544
<i>but if I give in too easily,</i>

262
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,725
<i>wouldn't it hurt my pride?</i>

263
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,385
This song,

264
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,885
I did play it once before.

265
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:39,855
But I'm not in a good mood now
and I don't feel like helping you.

266
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:48,745
You...

267
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:52,505
<i>Shouldn't you at least ask me again?</i>

268
00:16:56,985 --> 00:17:00,305
HUA MUNIAN,
HEAD OF ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

269
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,585
Show me your lips.

270
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:09,965
I knew this would be a great color on you.

271
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,985
Why am I so talented?

272
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:30,424
Has the standard
of the beauty contest dropped?

273
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,624
Seriously, with her looking like that,

274
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,664
I don't even know
how she managed to be selected.

275
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:36,944
Why are you guys complaining?

276
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:38,424
She can hear you.

277
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:43,395
If she ends up in the last place,
wouldn't it be good for us?

278
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:55,285
-Bye.
-Bye.

279
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,304
Xinya, you look so pretty today.

280
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:00,744
I agree. You're so pretty.

281
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:01,865
Thanks, guys.

282
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:05,255
You would probably win again this year.

283
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,944
Dear all department heads and teachers.

284
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,425
Dear all students and friends.

285
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:27,025
-Good evening to all of you.
-Good evening to all of you.

286
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:32,024
The Yearly Miss Campus contest
by Ming De College shall begin now.

287
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,984
There are two rounds to this contest.

288
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:34,904
In the first round,

289
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,504
each contestant will take turns
to show off their beauty

290
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:40,064
and answer questions given by the judges.

291
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,385
For the second round,

292
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:44,264
each contestant are
to show off their talents

293
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,304
in order to bedazzle the audience.

294
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,504
After these two rounds,

295
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,744
judges will judge
based on the contestant's performance

296
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,224
to pick out the winner
for Miss Campus tonight.

297
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:54,824
Without further ado,
let's begin the contest.

298
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,175
Let's welcome our contestants.

299
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,344
Chen Qingqing.

300
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,085
You have our support!

301
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:27,624
Keep going all the way!

302
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,784
Dear teachers and fellow students,

303
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:30,905
good evening.

304
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,624
Ming De College's Miss Campus contest

305
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,984
goes way back in history.

306
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:38,024
It has become one of Yuncheng's
well known cultural event.

307
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,424
If I emerge as the winner,

308
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,704
I will use this opportunity

309
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,344
-to help Ming De...
-What's wrong?

310
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,585
Thanks.

311
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,965
I wanted to look skinny,
I haven't eaten for two days.

312
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,704
Please hang on tight.

313
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:55,225
If you collapse now,
all your hard work will go to waste.

314
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:02,625
Sir.

315
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:05,555
Miss Qingqing is up next.

316
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:08,945
Mr. Chen.

317
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:13,104
It was such a last minute visit.
I couldn't attend to you properly.

318
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:14,864
I was just passing by on my business trip.

319
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:19,104
You came here just in time
for our Miss Campus contest.

320
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,864
<i>-Knowing that you're visiting...
-Qingqing.</i>

321
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:22,904
<i>You're just as stubborn as your mom.</i>

322
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,144
<i>But this time,</i>

323
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:28,305
<i>I won't allow you
to make the same mistakes as her.</i>

324
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,385
Chen Qingqing.

325
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,344
The judges will begin
to ask you various questions.

326
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:49,945
Are you ready?

327
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,265
I'm ready.

328
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:56,104
Chen Qingqing, I have a question for you.

329
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,104
Please go ahead.

330
00:20:57,105 --> 00:21:00,695
As you know,
Miss Campus is a beauty contest.

331
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:05,744
All of the contestants on stage
looks the part and are talented.

332
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:08,744
But when it comes to your appearance...

333
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:11,144
There's really nothing special about it.

334
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,624
May I ask what motivated you
to stand on this stage?

335
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,944
Don't you think your participation

336
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,605
is an insult to other contestants?

337
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:31,224
To the student who asked this question.
please mind your words.

338
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,344
Qingqing, you don't have
to answer this question.

339
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,725
It's all right.

340
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,065
Before I answer that question,

341
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,105
I'd like to ask the judges too.

342
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,065
What is your definition of beauty?

343
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,344
I hope everyone can think about it.

344
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:52,035
Based on your understanding,
what defines beauty?

345
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,265
For instance,

346
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,475
I just ate so much food backstage.

347
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:01,905
Because I know

348
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:05,165
in order to stand on stage

349
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:08,955
I need plenty of energy
to perform for everyone.

350
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:13,824
I am aware we have a dominant standard
for beauty in the society.

351
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,495
A mainstream standard

352
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:17,345
which categorizes us

353
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:19,584
based on how we were born.

354
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:23,024
Our height, our physical attributes
and our age and so on

355
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,745
to define us

356
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,505
and then tell us

357
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:28,304
that's all we are.

358
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,144
This is how you are as a person.

359
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:32,695
This is how you live your life.

360
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:37,584
We too have adopted the same standard
to define what beauty is to us.

361
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:40,305
But throughout the ages,

362
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,945
from East to West,

363
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,704
no written literature

364
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:45,505
has ever declared

365
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,105
that beauty is only skin deep.

366
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:51,224
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.

367
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:52,624
That should define beauty.

368
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,024
A single strain of silver hair
on the head of a loving mom

369
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,704
should also define beauty.

370
00:22:56,705 --> 00:23:00,904
Everything that touches your heart
should be defined as beauty.

371
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:03,384
Beauty shouldn't be differentiated
based on country or region

372
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:05,704
nor should it be ranked or based
on a fixed standard.

373
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:08,384
If someone does not fall into
the mainstream standard of beauty,

374
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:09,864
are they not beautiful at all?

375
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:14,064
Are they not worthy
to be complimented and to be loved?

376
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,315
Who said that?

377
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,185
Who set the rules?

378
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:19,985
And who has the right to judge so?

379
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:23,224
Chen Qingqing, you're changing the topic.

380
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:24,984
And you're creating a scene on stage.

381
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:27,025
Quite the opposite.

382
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:29,575
I'm a product of this stage

383
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,625
and when I'm standing on this stage

384
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,265
it proves that this contest

385
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:38,784
has brought possibilities
to diversify the standard of beauty.

386
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:39,944
And that's all from me.

387
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,105
Thank you.

388
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,145
-Well done.
-Well done.

389
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,265
-Good job.
-Good job.

390
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,425
My fellow students.

391
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:12,485
Don't get carried away by her speech!

392
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:30,704
Next, let's welcome Lan Xinya's

393
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:33,465
-violin performance.
-Goddess!

394
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:35,545
-Goddess!
-Goddess!

395
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,985
Goddess!

396
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:56,745
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

397
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,984
Next, let's welcome Chen Qingqing's

398
00:24:59,985 --> 00:25:01,545
-performance.
-Yes!

399
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,384
You have my full support, Chen Qingqing!

400
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:11,665
QINGQING, YOU'RE THE BEST

401
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,305
You can do it.

402
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:41,664
A solo performance of the Zither.

403
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,425
Isn't it too simple?

404
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:46,405
Lan Xinya's performance seemed better.

405
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:22,024
I thought you said you're not
in the mood to help me out?

406
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:25,675
Well, I didn't want you
to embarrass yourself.

407
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:27,905
Oh, right.

408
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:31,185
Were you the first to applause just now?

409
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:32,465
What?

410
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:33,485
Who knows?

411
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,145
But you look really good today.

412
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:43,445
You're already the winner
of Miss Campus to me.

413
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:44,725
<i>My goodness.</i>

414
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:47,795
<i>Why is my heart beating so fast?</i>

415
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:10,944
After a fierce competition earlier,

416
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:11,944
I am here to announce

417
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:15,845
the winner
of Ming De College's Miss Campus is...

418
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,185
Lan Xinya.

419
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,265
Sir.

420
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:21,944
As you instructed,

421
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:24,024
I've transferred the votes
to other students.

422
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:26,995
Miss Qingqing failed to be the winner.

423
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,175
I got it.

424
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,445
You can go now.

425
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:52,005
What are you doing?

426
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:53,945
Fangfang.

427
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,415
I'm leaving the college.

428
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,544
Is it because of the contest?

429
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,424
Talk to us if you don't feel good
about it.

430
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,485
It's not what you think.

431
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,405
What do you mean?

432
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,345
<i>Qingqing.</i>

433
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:15,624
<i>Congratulations on your performance today.</i>

434
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,984
<i>It was splendid.</i>

435
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,984
<i>If your goal was to win Miss Campus,</i>

436
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,064
<i>you've actually already succeeded.</i>

437
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:22,995
<i>I will keep my promise.</i>

438
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,064
<i>You may continue to study
at Ming De College,</i>

439
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:27,704
<i>but you're not allowed
to expose your identity.</i>

440
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:30,985
<i>Once you're exposed, you must return home.</i>

441
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,944
Fangfang, I'm not leaving anymore.

442
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:36,565
I won't have to leave you guys!

443
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,544
Aren't you happy that I'm staying here?

444
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,384
-Aren't you happy?
-That's awesome!

445
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,305
-I'm staying.
-Great!

446
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,645
"A music video series?"

447
00:30:54,705 --> 00:30:57,384
<i>The two of you look great together</i>

448
00:30:57,385 --> 00:31:00,505
<i>and your chemistry has gotten better.</i>

449
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:01,745
Hey.

450
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,784
Situ Feng came with someone really pretty.

451
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:06,984
Chen Qingqing is gone,
but now Qingchen is here.

452
00:31:06,985 --> 00:31:08,744
That's right, where's Chen Qingqing?

453
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:10,185
Give her a call.

454
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,224
Why isn't she picking up?

455
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:15,544
A college excursion is the best time
to confess to the person you like.

456
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:17,525
-Okay, I promise.
-Okay.

457
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:22,064
We will be able to see the meteor shower
if we go up the hill.

458
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:23,065
Hey!

459
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:24,865
Qingchen!

460
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:27,755
