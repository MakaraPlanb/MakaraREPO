EPISODE 7

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,945
<i>When breathing hurts without you</i>

3
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:01,064
It's such a great song!

4
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:03,064
With more than a million reposts on Weibo,

5
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,585
goodness, this is an achievement.

6
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,344
We should take advantage
of the song's popularity now.

7
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:11,504
We'll include "Breath"
into your upcoming album.

8
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,504
This could be a great opportunity
to make a fortune.

9
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:15,984
What do you think, Ms. Wang?

10
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:16,825
Good.

11
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,904
Since it's so well-received,

12
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,265
you guys should give it a go.

13
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,225
Under one condition.

14
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:26,864
I want this song to go viral.

15
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:27,904
Not a problem, Ms. Wang.

16
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:31,664
I will do my absolute best
to make this album a hit.

17
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,264
Good, I have to go now.

18
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,984
Carry on with the discussion if you will.

19
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:35,904
-Got it.
-Okay.

20
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,045
We should see Ms. Wang off.

21
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,664
-See you, Ms. Wang.
-See you.

22
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,064
-Take care, Ms. Wang.
-Bye.

23
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:46,065
I didn't expect Ms. Wang
to have a change of mind.

24
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,945
Daniel, you're looking good today.

25
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,325
You're good at sucking up to others.

26
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,905
Daniel, thank you.

27
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:59,904
I'm your manager.
You don't have to be so polite.

28
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:03,784
Speaking of Hebiancao,
don't you remember anything about him?

29
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:04,665
Hebiancao?

30
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,184
Why are you bringing this up?

31
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,104
Look, there was only a small group
of media representatives that day

32
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,424
and I didn't see other people.

33
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:13,225
That means that Hebiancao

34
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,624
is very likely to be your classmate
who has admired you for a long time.

35
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,704
That couldn't be. Hebiancao created
the comic to spread rumors about me.

36
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:23,704
Hence, I have a reason to believe
Hebiancao is a girl.

37
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,944
They say they're not into you,
but their action proved otherwise.

38
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,384
They say they don't like you
when in fact they do.

39
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:30,905
What are you doing?

40
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,065
Did you forget that I am a girl?

41
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:36,184
I could sue you
for defamation of character.

42
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,704
I keep on forgetting
to treat you like a girl.

43
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,345
Chill out.

44
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:56,155
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE
OPEN FOR BUSINESS

45
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:09,024
Our secretarial department has been
documenting all new registrations.

46
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,905
It has been going well.

47
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:12,585
Chen Qingqing.

48
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:18,365
Are you waiting for my invitation
to take down the meeting minutes?

49
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,665
I'm ready, chief.

50
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,015
Please go ahead.

51
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:31,235
Moving on, we might need help
from other departments...

52
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:33,665
Bye.

53
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,904
Oh, right. Chen Qingqing.

54
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,424
I almost forgot to tell you.

55
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,925
Your final task for this training

56
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,984
is to take all of these student IDs,

57
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:52,744
make sure to stamp
and register each of them

58
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:55,384
before distributing
to the respective student leaders.

59
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,465
Please finish it today.

60
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,344
And thanks in advance for your hard work.

61
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,065
We've got to go now.

62
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,425
There's so much to do!

63
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,985
NAME: LAN XINYA

64
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:30,264
Are you trying to gang up on me?

65
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,635
Just you wait
until it's your payback time!

66
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,185
Fangfang.

67
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,715
What's wrong?

68
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,464
Are you not feeling well?

69
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,385
I'm okay.

70
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,795
I'll feel better after a nap.

71
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,664
Fangfang, what do you feel like eating?

72
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:53,625
Fangfang.

73
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,335
Is there something bothering you?

74
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,055
Actually, my dad is hospitalized.

75
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,264
What happened to your dad?

76
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,864
Should I go to the hospital with you?

77
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,984
It's all right.

78
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:09,185
My dad has always been sick.

79
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,624
This time he needs surgery.

80
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,144
It's going to cost more than 100,000 yuan.

81
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:17,624
I have no idea
how I am going to afford it.

82
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,544
Fangfang, don't you worry.

83
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,445
Take it easy, I'm here.

84
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,115
I will help you find a way.

85
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,584
It's okay, Qingqing.
I will try to solve it by myself.

86
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,824
I'm going to the hospital tonight.
I won't be having dinner with you later.

87
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,024
I've got to go.

88
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:33,985
Bye.

89
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,605
These three girls, aren't they...

90
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:54,944
They're here, let's go.

91
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:55,985
Xinyan.

92
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:57,555
Have you noticed?

93
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,024
The way people are looking at us today.
Isn't it rather strange?

94
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,105
Yes.

95
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,624
Judging by the way they look at us,
it seems like they're just admiring us.

96
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,805
Perhaps it's because of our powerful aura.

97
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:15,395
BARE FACE REVEALED
IMPENDING DOOM, ABSOLUTE HORROR

98
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:35,535
Fangfang, I've figured out a solution.

99
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,245
A solution for what?

100
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:43,845
A solution for us to raise a large sum
of money for your dad's surgery.

101
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,145
Look.

102
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:49,545
"Female Lead Audition for a Music Video"?

103
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,704
You're not missing
this important information, right?

104
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,545
"Prize money of 150,000 yuan."

105
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,544
But you missed
this important information here.

106
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,225
"Outstanding qualities are required."

107
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,865
Outstanding qualities?

108
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,385
I have them.

109
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,845
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

110
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:23,624
I know you're really trying to help me,

111
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,984
but you don't have to try so hard.

112
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,425
I'm not.

113
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,504
It's simply a role for a music video.

114
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:31,425
How difficult can it be?

115
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,545
Don't worry.

116
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,864
How can Chen Qingqing
be so full of herself?

117
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,505
Look at her.

118
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:39,064
She has the guts to join the audition?

119
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,465
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

120
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:44,144
Are you going to audition
for our campus' music video?

121
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:44,985
Yes.

122
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:49,224
The 150,000-yuan worth of prize money
is going to be mine.

123
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,864
My application form has been filled out.

124
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,384
I'll submit it after this class ends.

125
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,264
Then I'm off to practice
for my performance.

126
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:58,024
Hey, I suggest that you skip the audition

127
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:00,965
so that you don't trouble of yourself.

128
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:03,344
I, Chen Qingqing,

129
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,344
am not someone
who admits to defeat easily.

130
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,824
Don't assume that everyone is like you,
who judges people by their looks.

131
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:09,665
I--

132
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,335
I am going to use my talents

133
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:18,065
to prove everyone wrong.

134
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:21,015
FEMALE LEAD AUDITION FOR A MUSIC VIDEO

135
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,664
Wait for your number to be called.

136
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:24,585
Next.

137
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:29,435
Hi, I am here for the audition, thank you.

138
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:40,745
Hi.

139
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,584
You may go home and wait for our call.

140
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,705
-Next.
-Hey, wait.

141
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,704
The other girls are all waiting here.
Why should I wait at home?

142
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,475
Just go home and wait.

143
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,584
-Please leave.
-Exactly, hurry up and leave.

144
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,664
Stop blocking others from the queue.

145
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,945
-How annoying.
-Get lost.

146
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,784
There were rumors
about you joining the audition.

147
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,024
I didn't believe it at first.

148
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,725
Apparently, it's true.

149
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:10,664
So what if it's true?

150
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:15,264
Are you not aware that they're looking
for someone with outstanding qualities?

151
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,595
Look at yourself.

152
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:21,264
Do you really think you could be
in Situ Feng's music video?

153
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:22,105
What?

154
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:25,455
This is Situ Feng's music video?

155
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,185
Stop pretending.

156
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:33,304
Back then, you pretended to be
his assistant.

157
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,424
Now, you're trying
to approach him on purpose again.

158
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:38,064
Who wants to approach him?
I can't wait to get away from him.

159
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,304
Anyway, let me tell you this.

160
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,424
I'm going to be the female lead
in this music video.

161
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:44,255
It's better for you to give up now.

162
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:45,825
I almost forgot.

163
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:48,824
It seems someone's application
hasn't been accepted

164
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,144
and was eliminated right away.

165
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:51,305
Lan Xinya!

166
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,064
All right, I've got to go.

167
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,464
My time is precious.

168
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:55,345
Bye.

169
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,544
<i>A music video by Situ Feng?</i>

170
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:02,344
<i>There's no way I'll ever be in it
even if he begs me to!</i>

171
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,984
<i>But the prize money...</i>

172
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,064
<i>Gosh.</i>

173
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,424
<i>For the sake of Fangfang,
I will sacrifice myself.</i>

174
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,704
<i>No one will recognize me
without makeup anyway.</i>

175
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,664
<i>No.</i>

176
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:17,064
<i>Grandpa's men could already
be here in Yuncheng.</i>

177
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:20,224
<i>Why do I have to deal
with these shallow people</i>

178
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:22,224
<i>and put up with them ordering me around?</i>

179
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,784
<i>But without the prize money,</i>

180
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:30,305
<i>Fangfang won't be able
to pay for the surgery.</i>

181
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,025
Hi.

182
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,645
Your name is Qingchen?

183
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,624
I'm sorry, I didn't provide my picture.

184
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,335
That's not a problem.

185
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,744
I left out my phone number too.

186
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:03,664
No worries at all.

187
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,864
I think you're a great fit for the role.

188
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:07,385
Please take a seat.

189
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:08,745
Thank you.

190
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,264
I am so jealous.

191
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,715
-I'm so jealous.
-Who is that?

192
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,625
-Lan Xinya!
-Lan Xinya!

193
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,464
-She's outstanding!
-She's outstanding!

194
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:20,864
-She's lovely!
-She's lovely!

195
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,565
-She's the best!
-She's the best!

196
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,704
Welcome, everyone.

197
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,984
Congratulations, all of you for advancing
into the second round of the audition.

198
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,224
We have a test for you today.

199
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,504
Please act out an emotional scene
as if you've been dumped by your lover.

200
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,264
Your act should portray
how miserable you are after such breakup.

201
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,475
Shall we start?

202
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:46,065
Go to hell.

203
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,185
Why would you leave me?

204
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:52,065
How could you?

205
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,904
<i>Should I look it up online?</i>

206
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,655
HOW SHOULD YOU FEEL AFTER A BREAKUP?

207
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,465
That's it!

208
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:18,005
The girl without any facial expression.

209
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:19,745
Yes, you.

210
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,104
You have a unique style and composure.

211
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,384
I like how you stared
at the breakup text messages,

212
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:27,545
looking all dejected and exhausted.

213
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,145
Your acting

214
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,845
was how I imagined
the female lead to be like.

215
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,705
You were born to be an actress.

216
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,784
I think she's the right girl for the role.

217
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:49,265
However, why do I find your face familiar?

218
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,664
Have we met before?

219
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:52,944
Are you sure?
I don't find your face familiar.

220
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:53,864
As the saying goes,

221
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,424
"Swans are beautiful,
but they all look similar

222
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,624
while it's easy to spot an ugly duckling."

223
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,784
Since you're the chosen one,
I'll cut to the chase.

224
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:04,465
Situ Feng is the male lead
of this music video.

225
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,465
Situ Feng. Do you know him?

226
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,904
There's a reason
this audition was kept a secret

227
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,544
as we want to keep the mystery alive
for this music video.

228
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:18,784
I hope you'd understand.

229
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,225
Shooting will start next weekend.

230
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,824
You should get prepared before that.

231
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,104
Are there any questions?

232
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,944
I have a question about my prize money.

233
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,475
When can I get it?

234
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:34,685
You're selected to work with your idol.
Aren't you excited?

235
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,664
Why am I constantly
running into odd people these days?

236
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,184
As for that 150,000 yuan,

237
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:41,384
it will be given to you
once the shooting ends.

238
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,544
We can meet up then.

239
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:45,344
By the way, this video
that you'll be shooting

240
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,024
is Situ Feng's latest single.

241
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:47,865
"Breath."

242
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,025
"Breath"?

243
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:51,945
Yes.

244
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,104
Here's the demo.

245
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,555
Bring it home and listen to it.

246
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,635
Keep this to yourself or that 150,000 yuan

247
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:01,255
might slip away.

248
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,605
Qingqing, you're back.

249
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,585
Fangfang.

250
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,385
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,224
I didn't make it through the audition.

252
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,185
It's okay.

253
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,144
I'll think of other ways.

254
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,025
Fangfang, don't worry.

255
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:26,784
Before this coming weekend,
I'll solve this problem for you.

256
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,025
It's okay.

257
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,655
Please trust me.

258
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:31,424
-Let me handle this.
-Okay.

259
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,325
I'll make a move first.

260
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,405
QINGQING'S ERRANDS SERVICE

261
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,545
LITTLE BEE, A BOX OF CHOCOLATE

262
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:58,145
"Little Bee, a box of chocolate"?

263
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:05,565
Why can't I remember
selling chocolate to this person?

264
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:11,945
Little Bee?

265
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,745
What kind of name is that?

266
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:25,544
Weren't you eliminated from the audition?

267
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:27,104
Why are you so late?

268
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,245
It's none of your business.

269
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,945
Qingqing, don't be sad.

270
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,784
It's okay that you're eliminated.

271
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:40,395
I've already told her
not to embarrass herself.

272
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:43,864
From now on,
you should learn to talk less.

273
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:45,944
I don't want others
to know that you're my assistant.

274
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,504
I don't want to look stupid.

275
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:48,595
You're right.

276
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:50,415
I didn't make it.

277
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,744
Thanks for your concern.

278
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,825
I wasn't concerned at all.

279
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,664
You seem to be good at eating.

280
00:16:56,665 --> 00:17:01,325
If you join an eating contest,
maybe you will stand a chance.

281
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,115
Apologies, Your Highness.

282
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:12,424
You shouldn't have placed
your foot underneath mine.

283
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,544
Do you know it's blocking my steps?

284
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:18,504
Also, to have your foot stepped on
by someone like me

285
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,395
must have hurt real bad.

286
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,545
-Qingqing.
-Hang on.

287
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,664
Can you share some gossip
about Situ Feng with us?

288
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:32,225
I don't want to talk
about that person today.

289
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,065
But...

290
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,064
I have a question for you guys.

291
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,945
Do you know who is Little Bee?

292
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,184
Of course I do.

293
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,384
<i>Little bee buzzing
And off they fly into the bushes</i>

294
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:47,664
That's not what I meant.

295
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,105
That's not it!

296
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:53,985
I don't know about Little Bee,
but I do know about Situ Feng.

297
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:56,865
Hey.

298
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,144
Why don't you guys
go ahead to the canteen now?

299
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,264
You guys go ahead.
I left something in the classroom.

300
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:02,295
Wait for me.

301
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:16,465
LITTLE BEE

302
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:21,785
Little Bee!

303
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,145
I caught you!

304
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:30,424
-What are you doing?
-Lower down your voice.

305
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,024
-The class next door can hear you.
-Situ Feng.

306
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,544
The burden of being an idol

307
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:37,064
has robbed you of your abilities
to buy your own food?

308
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:40,664
I have to do this to stay in shape
and my diet is restricted by my agency.

309
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,865
Snacks are prohibited.

310
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:44,345
If I get caught,

311
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,584
it's considered a violation
of the contract.

312
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,775
So what if you've got so many supporters?

313
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:53,955
You can't even eat a bar of chocolate.

314
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:59,184
If you agree to one of my conditions,

315
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:01,704
I'll keep this a secret
and I won't tell anyone.

316
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,025
-Condition?
-Yes.

317
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,485
What condition?

318
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,025
If you agree to help me run errands,

319
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,784
then I'll keep this secret for you.

320
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:16,104
Are you trying to use me for publicity
to get more customers?

321
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,305
Listen to me.

322
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:20,665
It's never going to happen.

323
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,545
Situ Feng, think about it.

324
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,865
If you help me run errands,

325
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,344
it's an opportunity to exercise
and stay in shape.

326
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:31,744
You could eat plenty of snacks.
Nobody would notice.

327
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,024
What do you think?

328
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,365
Let me tell you.

329
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,785
This chocolate

330
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,825
honestly tastes amazing.

331
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:43,024
Do you want to have a bite?

332
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:46,345
Are you sure you're not going to have any?

333
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,025
Why don't I

334
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,545
give you two more? What do you think?

335
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,344
Isn't that Situ Feng?

336
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:02,304
It looks like he's delivering something.

337
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,385
Let's go.

338
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,505
Yang Menglin,

339
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,905
Zhang Jingwen.

340
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,065
Here are your snacks.

341
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,145
Here.

342
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:27,495
Here you go.

343
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,345
Here's yours.

344
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,285
How much are they?

345
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,025
Three plus five plus eight...

346
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:42,584
<i>We haven't worked out
the total cost in advance.</i>

347
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:45,584
<i>Chen Qingqing, you've trapped me.</i>

348
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,945
Situ Feng, you haven't
collected your money!

349
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,584
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

350
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,624
Situ Feng is now running errands?

351
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,824
It used to be Chen Qingqing, right?

352
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:57,184
What's going on today?

353
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:59,815
What's wrong with Situ Feng today?

354
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:02,144
I want Situ Feng
to run errands for me too.

355
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,265
It feels like

356
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,864
-he's delivering snacks as my boyfriend.
-Yes.

357
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,735
It must have been Chen Qingqing again!

358
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,585
That was quick.

359
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,305
Are you all done?

360
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,645
Here's your money.

361
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,385
That's a lot.

362
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,505
You're worthy of your title

363
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:24,585
of an idol.

364
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:26,264
Look how much tips you've got.

365
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,355
That's right.

366
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,425
Great job.

367
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:31,504
You seem a little weak.

368
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,345
Excuse me?

369
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,104
-Who said I'm weak?
-I'm saying that.

370
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:37,024
There were only two errands
and you're running out of breath.

371
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,865
I'm not out of breath!

372
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,264
Potato chips as a reward from your boss.

373
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,385
Catch.

374
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,315
Go ahead and eat it.

375
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,455
I shouldn't eat this.

376
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:59,784
Look how much control other people
are having over your life.

377
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,504
Don't you feel frustrated?

378
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:06,805
-Give it back if you're not eating it.
-Who said I'm not eating it?

379
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:10,024
I used to feel frustrated,
but I don't anymore.

380
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,944
That's because feeling angry or frustrated
serves no purpose for me

381
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,775
which is why I've chosen to let go.

382
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:20,264
Why is having a purpose so important?

383
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:24,104
Why is it that for everything we do,
we have to define its purpose?

384
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,464
If you're angry, just be angry.

385
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,504
Eat and drink whenever you want.

386
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:28,944
Eat, drink, play and have fun.

387
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:31,264
Eating is the most important thing.
Don't you know?

388
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,405
Why think about it so much?

389
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:34,985
Forget it.

390
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:38,985
I should say something useful.

391
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:41,235
One hundred and twenty-five!

392
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:43,104
Are you going to eat this?

393
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:45,305
Listen, Situ Feng.

394
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:48,224
With the calories we consume every day,

395
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,824
as long as you find a way to burn them,

396
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,824
you'll be able to stay in shape.

397
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:55,105
Keep going!

398
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:57,264
One hundred and twenty-eight!

399
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:59,395
One hundred and twenty-nine!

400
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,465
Come on, Situ Feng.

401
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:04,665
Five.

402
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,944
Don't even think about eating.

403
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:07,985
I'm not.

404
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:13,975
Are you still trying to be sneaky?

405
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:25,025
Focus on height rather than speed.

406
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,345
Continue, higher!

407
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,745
Come on, Situ Feng!

408
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:31,585
Keep going.

409
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:37,744
Situ Feng, why are you carrying
huge waterbottles?

410
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:39,145
It's hot outside!

411
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:40,175
I'm thirsty!

412
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,465
Situ Feng.

413
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:49,144
Was it raining outside?

414
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,304
Why are you all wet?

415
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,575
I went skipping.

416
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:53,085
Oh, skipping.

417
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,905
Skipping?

418
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,245
Chen Qingqing's sorcery is frightening.

419
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,375
Let me join.

420
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:10,104
Am I hearing this correctly?

421
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:13,304
Haven't you always said
playing basketball will mess up your hair

422
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:14,824
which was why you never joined us?

423
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,424
That's in the past. I'm playing today.

424
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:17,325
Catch this.

425
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:19,795
Let's go.

426
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:31,065
Excuse me.

427
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:32,945
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,384
Excuse me, please.

429
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,395
Excuse me. Let me through.

430
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:28,175
-That's so cool!
-That's amazing!

431
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,184
That suffocating burden
of being an idol...

432
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:58,325
It's none of your business.

433
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:10,875
Sorry, excuse me.

434
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:11,905
Thank you.

435
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:19,425
Hello?

436
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,785
Yes, speaking.

437
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:23,585
Tomorrow?

438
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,685
Where is the location?

439
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,465
Ming De College?

440
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:34,415
Okay, see you.

441
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,224
<i>What am I going to do
if someone recognizes me?</i>

442
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,825
It's you.

443
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,544
<i>Situ Feng.</i>

444
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:03,344
<i>Now that I look beautiful,
you're trying to make a move.</i>

445
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,584
<i>Chen Qingqing is with me now.</i>

446
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,965
Don't ever sing "Breath" again.

447
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:10,625
Situ Feng!

448
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:25,255
