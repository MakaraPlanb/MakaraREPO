EPISODE 4

2
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,535
Today, we have a new student in our class.

3
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,245
Chen Qingqing.

4
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,964
Only the seat in the last row
is not taken.

5
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,204
You can sit over there.

6
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:08,325
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,765
Hello, I am your new deskmate.

8
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,805
I'm Chen Qingqing.

9
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,565
Situ Feng.

10
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,844
I don't care who you are
outside of school,

11
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:37,265
you must be friendly
to your classmates here.

12
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,205
Situ Feng.

13
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,684
The new semester has started.
Let's begin the class.

14
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,685
Please open your textbooks.

15
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,204
-What is she doing?
-What?

16
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,845
Is she crazy?

17
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,835
Ma'am, I'm ready. We can start now.

18
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,044
Chen Qingqing.

19
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,565
What are you doing?

20
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:29,835
Go back immediately!

21
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,675
Don't laugh!

22
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,105
I'll write a few questions for you to do.

23
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,404
After being home tutored
for so many years,

24
00:03:54,405 --> 00:04:00,415
I finally know how it feels like
to study at college.

25
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,884
Do you think
if you pretend not to know me,

26
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,805
I would let it go?

27
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,924
I've given you the money.

28
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,695
What else do you want?

29
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,964
What about you? You even followed me here.

30
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,545
And you said you weren't my fan?

31
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,045
Hey, Situ Feng.

32
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,285
You are shameless.

33
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:57,645
I followed you?

34
00:04:58,245 --> 00:04:59,215
Do you know

35
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,804
how unfortunate it was for me to meet you?

36
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,124
Do you know how much
I've suffered because of you?

37
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,884
I didn't know they would take
a photo of us and post it online.

38
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,365
This thing is over.

39
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,205
And...

40
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,525
do not mention it again,

41
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:19,525
or it will only get more complicated.

42
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,405
Do you think this is something

43
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,905
I could let go so easily?

44
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,605
Chen Qingqing, Situ Feng.

45
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,705
Stand up, the two of you.

46
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:50,404
On the first day of school,
you disrupted the classroom.

47
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:54,404
As a punishment,
you two will clean the classroom today.

48
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:55,444
The class is dismissed.

49
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:56,285
Stand up.

50
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,685
Goodbye.

51
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,645
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

52
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:23,644
When will Your Highness
release another album?

53
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,524
-We like you so much.
-We like you so much.

54
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:31,764
Were the things I learned
as a child useful?

55
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,284
-Chen Qingqing.
-Yes!

56
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,785
Mr. Jin Taiyong, please teach me!

57
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,124
An ultimate move to win.

58
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,924
Front leg kick followed by
a 360-degree single leg whirlwind kick.

59
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,164
If you asked me a minute ago,

60
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:47,964
I would say they were useless.

61
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,484
But now,

62
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:52,124
I'll tell you,

63
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,665
they are very useful.

64
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:07,745
Excuse me, everyone, please move aside.

65
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,645
Chen Qingqing.

66
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:24,245
We can talk if you want.

67
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:27,165
Situ Feng.

68
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:29,125
Nice to meet you.

69
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,875
I would appreciate your advice.

70
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:53,725
Thank you.

71
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,604
That's her, the strange transfer student.

72
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,305
Let's go. Where did she come from?

73
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:22,484
That's her.
I don't know what trick she used

74
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,924
that she got to be Situ Feng's deskmate.

75
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,324
She's Situ Feng's stalker.

76
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,244
I heard she'd do anything
to get his attention.

77
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,364
She even kissed Situ Feng.

78
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,204
I'll say it one more time.

79
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,084
I'm not Situ Feng's stalker.

80
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,764
Aren't you his stalker?

81
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,804
I heard you told everyone
that you were his fiancÃ©e.

82
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,084
Hey, can you get your facts straight?

83
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:44,015
It was Situ Feng who begged me
to be his fiancÃ©e.

84
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:47,044
See, she said she is his fiancÃ©e herself.

85
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:47,885
Shameless.

86
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,044
-Who did you call shameless?
-You're shameless.

87
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,124
They don't really mean it.

88
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,204
-Let's go. We need to clean the classroom.
-Psycho.

89
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:54,225
So defensive.

90
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,365
That Situ Feng!

91
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:01,044
The teacher said clearly that
we should clean the classroom together.

92
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,385
But he got away.

93
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,004
What kind of person is he?

94
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:06,844
He really thinks he's as a superstar.

95
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,084
Then what does it make me?

96
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,484
Qingqing, you'd better keep a low profile
and stay out of trouble.

97
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,684
And remember what I told you,

98
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:17,245
-do not--
-Do not mess with Situ Feng.

99
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:19,244
Do you think I want to do that?

100
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:23,305
I don't want to have anything to do
with that jerk.

101
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:24,955
That's good.

102
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,665
And don't go against Miss Chen Xiao.

103
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,085
I didn't.

104
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,685
I'm serious.

105
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:36,965
Chen Xiao, known as the Old Witch,

106
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:40,244
has a reputation of being cold-blooded
and heartless.

107
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:44,684
Rumor has it that many years ago,
a student talked back to her in class.

108
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,705
And on the very same day,

109
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:47,865
he disappeared.

110
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,175
No one has ever seen him again.

111
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,315
That's horrible.

112
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,204
Anyway, we should focus on our studies.

113
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:01,284
Don't mess with the wrong people.

114
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,125
Okay.

115
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,925
You should clean the blackboard first.

116
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,085
Okay.

117
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:21,965
Jerk!

118
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,325
That big jerk!

119
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,364
-Leaving me here alone--
-Chen Qingqing.

120
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,205
What?

121
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,065
Situ Feng didn't feel well,

122
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,045
so he went to the infirmary.

123
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,405
Give me that eraser.

124
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,435
You should mop the floor.

125
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:45,324
You still have a little conscience left.

126
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,565
-Well, Chen Qingqing...
-What?

127
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:51,564
The day at the wedding,
I didn't mean to lie to you.

128
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,015
I didn't know that Situ Feng...

129
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,045
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:57,915
It's okay.

131
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,625
I won't hold a grudge against you.

132
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,475
Hello? Hello, who's this?

133
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,004
A delivery for me?

134
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,764
What kind of delivery service is this?

135
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:12,715
Why do I have to come to the rooftop?

136
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,885
What a coincidence.

137
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,724
You two have even become deskmates.

138
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,004
But based on the way you look,
I don't think I have to worry.

139
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:28,244
-There won't be any rumors about you two.
-Hey, who the hell are you?

140
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm Situ Feng's manager.
What are you doing?

141
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,025
For heaven's sake.

142
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,964
-Did you call your manager here
-You...

143
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,964
-to make me pay for the medical expenses?
-No...

144
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:40,004
Let me be clear. There's no way I'd pay!

145
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,125
Hey.

146
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,804
Do not assume everyone
is as bad as you are.

147
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,604
Are you trying to blame me?

148
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,485
Who brought me to your dad's wedding?

149
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,684
Who told everyone that I was your fiancÃ©e?

150
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,435
Who kissed me twice against my will?

151
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,445
Twice!

152
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,455
There are so many people out there.

153
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:02,884
Fine, I've given you the money.

154
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,524
And I've also helped you find your bag.

155
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,684
What else do you want from me?

156
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,924
Don't talk
as if you were the victim, okay?

157
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:11,245
Look at me.

158
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:14,365
I am the victim here.

159
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,385
No one has dared to hit me before.

160
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:22,884
You are the first one.

161
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:23,725
Fine.

162
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,755
Let me tell you this.

163
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,725
From now on,

164
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,605
I will hit you more often.

165
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,915
That's enough, stop fighting.

166
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,284
Take a look, did you post this?

167
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,805
What is it?

168
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,844
SITU FENG'S FIANCÃE
APPEARED IN MING DE COLLEGE

169
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,924
Who took such an ugly photo of me?

170
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:43,885
Who?

171
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,885
Who took it?

172
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,675
That's not the point.

173
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,364
Anyway, it's great
that you didn't post it.

174
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:54,084
I called you here today
to put an end to the rumors about you two.

175
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:56,124
If the media or fans ask about it,

176
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,365
I want you to say
that you are Situ Feng's assistant.

177
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:02,044
-Assistant?
-Assistant?

178
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:02,925
Yes.

179
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:05,564
Are you kidding me?

180
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,884
Hey, you don't want to? That's great.

181
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,124
I don't want you to be my assistant too.

182
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,685
I don't want to have anything to do
with a jerk like you.

183
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,604
If you weren't a woman,

184
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:19,355
-I would have--
-What would you do?

185
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,044
I know what happened at the wedding.

186
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,004
He's young and ignorant. Don't mind him.

187
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,455
Please accept this.

188
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:26,524
What's this? Is it a check?

189
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:30,045
This is a VIP ticket
to Situ Feng's concert.

190
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,325
-Concert?
-Yes.

191
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,764
Why would I want to go to his concert?

192
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:37,365
This...

193
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,964
Could you afford a VIP ticket?

194
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,244
It is worth 10,000 yuan.

195
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,644
Well, don't make rash decisions.

196
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:43,804
This is my business card.

197
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,364
Call me after you think about it
thoroughly.

198
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,325
Call me.

199
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:49,685
Situ Feng.

200
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,924
Aren't you afraid that your image
will be ruined?

201
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,884
Well, let me tell you this.

202
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:56,525
From now on,

203
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:59,605
I will be your archenemy.

204
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,415
I will spare no effort
to talk bad about you everywhere.

205
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:11,565
Hey.

206
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:15,305
This girl is a pain in the neck.

207
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,564
How many times have I told you?

208
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,044
Don't put on a cold face every day.
People will be offended, okay?

209
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:24,244
Although, nobody will believe
the story about this fiancÃ©e of yours.

210
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:25,404
I have told you many times,

211
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:28,204
you must keep a good relationship
with your classmates. You are...

212
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,604
Can you let me finish before you leave?
Can't you respect me a little?

213
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,675
Do you have to be like this every time?

214
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,555
Let's go have dinner.

215
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,924
I have something to do.

216
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,084
What do you want to eat?
I'll get it for you.

217
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,044
There's no need.
I'll eat before I come back.

218
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:46,445
I'm leaving, bye.

219
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:49,685
Bye.

220
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,004
Hello, ma'am.

221
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,365
I want Boston lobster pasta.

222
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:56,444
I want my lobster shelled.

223
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,604
For my fruits,
I want Hokkaido Yubari melon.

224
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,364
And A bottle of the 1990 Romanee-Conti.

225
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,325
Thank you.

226
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:06,645
Chen Qingqing.

227
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:10,404
I don't think they serve those
in the canteen.

228
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,095
Aren't these the most basic things?

229
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,325
Then what do we have here?

230
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:21,105
We have mantis shrimps, noodles with
soybean paste, cantaloupe and grape juice.

231
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,564
The school is so big.

232
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:31,084
Where can I find information
about my dad?

233
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:33,405
Chen Qingqing, can I sit here?

234
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:34,695
It's you.

235
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,205
Yes, I am Xiaobi.

236
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:40,385
This is Xiaosi, Xiaoyi
and that's the class president.

237
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:42,484
You just transferred
to a new school today,

238
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,255
don't you feel lonely?

239
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:45,404
It's all right.

240
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:47,484
You dare go against the old witch
on your first day.

241
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,684
Are you really a fan of Situ Feng?

242
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:51,924
I heard you claimed to be
Situ Feng's fiancÃ©e.

243
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:56,724
There are too many rumors going around.
Which one of it is true?

244
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:58,164
Do you really want to know?

245
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,084
-Yes.
-Yes.

246
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,885
These are all confidential information.

247
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,484
You must trade it
with the information you have.

248
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:07,765
Not to brag,

249
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,684
but there are only a few things
in this school that we don't know.

250
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,085
Go ahead and ask.

251
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:16,484
If I want to know the information
of a Ming De graduate, who should I ask?

252
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:19,964
I remember the graduation information
of all previous students

253
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,715
are in the Student Council's office.

254
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,964
Then can you take me there? Now.

255
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:28,044
The Student Council's office
is not open to anyone.

256
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,164
Yes and you're not a sophomore,

257
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,495
they won't let you join them.

258
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,525
I see.

259
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:37,205
Is there another way?

260
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:38,245
Another way?

261
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:39,164
There is one.

262
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,524
Gu Nanxi is the current president
of the Student Council.

263
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,485
You can try and ask him.

264
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:47,484
Although he seems to be
very nice to everyone,

265
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,865
he does everything by the book.

266
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,085
Is that so?

267
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:53,805
I see.

268
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,364
Okay, we've told you everything we know.

269
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:01,085
Now, can you tell us
what is your relationship with Situ Feng?

270
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:04,445
Situ Feng is...

271
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,005
Come closer.

272
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:19,804
Let me tell you,

273
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,165
Situ Feng is a very careless man.

274
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,204
You know what?

275
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,605
How could he be--

276
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:27,925
Also...

277
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,045
Chen Qingqing.

278
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:54,204
You broke into
the Student Council's office

279
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,524
and sabotaged school property
in the first week of school.

280
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:00,585
-It's just a lame painting? So--
-Lame?

281
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,524
This was painted by the art master,
Burton Goldman.

282
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:06,964
He personally painted this
for our first chancellor.

283
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:11,325
It's the most memorable piece of art
in Ming De College.

284
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,085
Sir.

285
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:18,924
How much do you think I should pay for it?

286
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,005
How about 100,000 yuan?

287
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,444
What? 100,000 yuan?

288
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,524
-I--
-It's famous, you know.

289
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:27,045
If I don't pay...

290
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,524
what will happen?

291
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,995
If you don't pay?

292
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,175
Let me see.

293
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:35,804
Breaking into a forbidden area,
sabotaging school property

294
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:36,964
and refusing to pay...

295
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,004
-You'll be expelled.
-Sir!

296
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:39,925
I'll pay.

297
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:41,845
I'll pay.

298
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,605
Can you give me some time?

299
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:46,565
Fine.

300
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,265
I'll give you a week.

301
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:50,565
Go.

302
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,225
Our chancellor...

303
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,165
This is bad.

304
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,405
It's 100,000 yuan?

305
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,475
Where can I get that much money?

306
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:11,725
Do I

307
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,005
really have to be

308
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:17,405
a fake assistant to Situ Feng?

309
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,764
Chen Qingqing, are you losing your mind?

310
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,415
How can you do that?

311
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,515
But what should I do?

312
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,005
Hey, Fangfang.

313
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:38,604
Hello? Qingqing.

314
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:39,885
Hello? Fangfang.

315
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,044
Where are you going?

316
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,684
I'm going to the library.

317
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:44,724
I'll come back later.

318
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,644
It's not appropriate
to make phone calls here.

319
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:48,244
I'm going to hang up now.

320
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:49,085
Okay.

321
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,445
What is she hiding?

322
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:06,485
Fangfang?

323
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:07,565
Qingqing?

324
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:09,404
Why are you here?

325
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:13,004
No, why are you here?
And why are you dressed like this?

326
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,964
I see you've been sneaking around
these days.

327
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,484
I don't know why you go out.

328
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:20,124
I was worried about you
so I followed you today.

329
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,484
Don't worry, I'm fine.

330
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,845
Really?

331
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:27,375
So all this time,
you've been working here?

332
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:31,764
Actually, I came to Ming De College
on a scholarship.

333
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,804
It only covers my tuition and other fees.

334
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:36,004
So I have to earn money
to pay for everything else.

335
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:36,965
I see.

336
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:39,324
Fangfang, you should have told me--

337
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,004
Are you enjoying your chat?

338
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,324
You didn't even hear
the customer calling you.

339
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:47,885
I paid you to work,
not to have some kind of free party.

340
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,675
I'll deduct your pay.

341
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,324
Ma'am, you've deducted
almost all of my pay this month.

342
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:53,804
There won't be anything left for me.

343
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:59,205
Then go bring out the coffee right now,
or I won't pay you a penny.

344
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:00,505
Okay, I'll go.

345
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,884
Qingqing, I have to go back to work.

346
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,244
You can take a rest here.

347
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:07,084
Fangfang, don't work here anymore.

348
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,095
Let's make money together.

349
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,444
Making money is not that easy.

350
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:15,865
Trust me, with my brain,
making money is as easy as that.

351
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,925
Fangfang, don't hesitate.

352
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:22,244
You go in right now and say goodbye
to that vicious woman.

353
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:23,765
Tell her, "I quit!"

354
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:27,804
Fangfang, hurry up and go.

355
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:28,965
Go.

356
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,265
You can do it.

357
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:41,285
Gu Nanxi.

358
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:44,404
Don't act like you are so perfect.

359
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,404
You are only an illegitimate child.

360
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,655
You have no inheritance right.

361
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:52,225
Don't get me wrong. I didn't mean that.

362
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:56,905
As a member of the Gu family,
I just want to do my duty.

363
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:00,275
You and your mom should lay low.

364
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:04,675
I can kick you and your mom out
anytime I want.

365
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,245
Goodness.

366
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,725
Darling, here you are.

367
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:12,615
I've been looking for you everywhere.

368
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:13,765
Chen Qingqing.

369
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,645
Why are you here?

370
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:16,605
Me?

371
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:19,315
I came to look for you, obviously.

372
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,725
Hey, who is this?

373
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,004
He is my cousin, Gu Donglin.

374
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,165
Your cousin? I see.

375
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:29,325
Donglin.

376
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:34,485
I really want to thank you
for taking care of my Nanxi.

377
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:36,884
There's not much coffee left in your cup.

378
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:39,035
Let me fill it up for you.

379
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,045
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,844
I'm so sorry, Donglin.

381
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:49,444
You see, I normally don't do
things like this.

382
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,484
But it doesn't matter.

383
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:53,924
I don't think you wanted
to drink it anyway.

384
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,815
You don't get to decide what I want.

385
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,525
Listen, Gu Nanxi.

386
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,804
I'm leaving now.
I'll talk to you next time.

387
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:03,245
Bye, Donglin.

388
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:10,085
Sorry, Gu Nanxi.

389
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,164
I happened to hear you two talk
from over there.

390
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:15,115
I couldn't stand him, so I came here.

391
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:19,225
I hope you could keep it a secret
from others.

392
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,404
If you need help in the future,
you can come to me.

393
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,364
I will do whatever I can.

394
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:27,085
You can help me now.

395
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:30,444
I want to join the Student Council.

396
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,164
-You want to join the Student Council?
-Yes.

397
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,005
But recruitment is already over.

398
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:40,284
I think there must be
something you can do.

399
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,125
Mr. Gu.

400
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:42,565
All right.

401
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,564
Let me ask you a question first.

402
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,364
Why do you want to join
the Student Council?

403
00:25:46,365 --> 00:25:47,645
Because...

404
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:51,844
Because I'm looking for another way

405
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:53,124
to learn new things,

406
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,244
to train myself,

407
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:56,315
to make myself more serious

408
00:25:57,085 --> 00:26:00,004
and more dedicated to my studies
so that I could be a useful member

409
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,925
of the society.

410
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:04,165
In that case,

411
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:07,435
I'll talk to the head of the departments.

412
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,665
I'm leaving now.

413
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:11,225
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

414
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:12,804
See you at school.

415
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,145
See you, Mr. Gu.

416
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,235
Bye, Mr. Gu.

417
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:22,965
Qingqing.

418
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:25,604
-Fangfang.
-Wasn't that Gu Nanxi?

419
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:26,445
Yes.

420
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:28,244
What did he say to you?

421
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,265
Nothing much.

422
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:31,644
I told him that I wanted to join
the Student Council.

423
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:33,804
-You want to join the Student Council?
-Yes.

424
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,204
Don't worry about that, Fangfang.

425
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:39,365
We should start our money-making
plan right now.

426
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,805
What are we going to do?

427
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,285
Well...

428
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,765
You will find out tomorrow.

429
00:26:56,645 --> 00:27:02,524
Today is the first day of business
for Qingqing's Errands Service.

430
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:03,865
This is for you.

431
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:05,324
Chen Qingqing.

432
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,724
Just give it up already.

433
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,804
SEAT FOR RENT - HIS HIGHNESS

434
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,444
Don't you have enough money already?

435
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:12,204
Your errands service
should stop right now!

436
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:13,644
Why are you doing this?

437
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:16,364
Once you signed up to be my assistant,
if you breach the contract,

438
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:19,444
you'll need to compensate me more
than that painting is going to cost you.

439
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:20,924
Hey, you spilled the water!

440
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:22,444
Do you want me to push you into the pool?

441
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:24,084
You can joke about anything else,
but this.

442
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,415
Situ Feng, you...

443
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:28,085
Help!

444
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,815
