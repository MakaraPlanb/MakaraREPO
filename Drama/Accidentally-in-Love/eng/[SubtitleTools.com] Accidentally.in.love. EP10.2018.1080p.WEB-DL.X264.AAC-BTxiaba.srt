EPISODE 10

2
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,455
Thank you, Feng.

3
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:11,864
What a coincidence.

4
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,785
Well, you're here too.

5
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:15,025
That's right.

6
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,264
What a coincidence.

7
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,215
Why are you two together?

8
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:19,985
Chen Qingqing.

9
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,104
Since I have some free time today,

10
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,665
I'll educate you about wine.

11
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,584
Give me the 1978 Burgundy wine.

12
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,345
All right, please wait.

13
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:36,095
Let me get this straight.

14
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:40,345
I was the one who invited Gu Nanxi
to dine here today.

15
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:45,705
-She's going all out.
-That's right.

16
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,785
I wanted to thank Gu Nanxi

17
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:50,304
because he saved me from being framed.

18
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:52,385
By the way, Xinya,

19
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,765
I really want to thank you.

20
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,375
Burgundy wine from 1978 is the best.

21
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,215
You should drink a lot.

22
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:07,304
But it's a pity that
you don't know how to appreciate it.

23
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,665
You're right. 1978 is a great year.

24
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,304
Too bad that it's too old
and causes instability.

25
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:16,224
If it was up to me,
I would choose the one from 2005.

26
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:19,024
Wines from that year
are very rich in flavor.

27
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:20,904
They are highly valued
among all vintage wines.

28
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:23,424
With their strong density
and great structure,

29
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:26,664
the wines are of the best quality
in recent years.

30
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,985
How did you know about this?

31
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:31,904
I was just bluffing.

32
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:34,785
I don't usually drink on normal days.

33
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,555
You're good at memorizing.

34
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,664
Since you're so knowledgeable,

35
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,785
you should drink more then.

36
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:46,824
Chen Qingqing, do you know how to drink?

37
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,105
Don't waste it.

38
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,424
It's none of your business.

39
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,744
Qingqing doesn't really drink.

40
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,505
I'll drink for her.

41
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,584
Qingqing, you're so almighty.

42
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,464
Even Gu Nanxi
wants to be your white knight.

43
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:03,865
Feng.

44
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,285
You need to drink for me.

45
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:24,545
Cheers! Let's drink.

46
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,305
Here.

47
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,145
Drink two more glasses.

48
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,465
I'm telling all of you.

49
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,345
I'm not drunk.

50
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,585
I can still drink.

51
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,225
It's late.

52
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,345
Let's go home.

53
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,065
Nanxi.

54
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,624
My driver is here.

55
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,335
Why don't I send all of you home?

56
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,465
Xinya.

57
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,344
That's not convenient for you.

58
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:10,744
I'll take care of Situ Feng.

59
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,515
You can go home first.

60
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,065
All right.

61
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,185
Bye.

62
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:28,825
If he couldn't drink,
he shouldn't have drunk so much.

63
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,064
Gu Nanxi, I'll go home too.

64
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,345
Look, Qingqing.

65
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:35,104
I have something that I haven't told you.

66
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,145
What is it?

67
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:40,224
Actually, Situ Feng was the one who helped

68
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:42,405
find the surveillance footage.

69
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,025
Really?

70
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,805
It's already late.

71
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,184
You should go home.

72
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,025
I'll take care of him.

73
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:56,745
Gu Nanxi.

74
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:59,045
Thanks for telling me.

75
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,235
-I'll go home first. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

76
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,025
Situ Feng.

77
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,425
Situ Feng.

78
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:15,505
Hey.

79
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,635
Where's Qingqing?

80
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:25,195
She went back to school.

81
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,865
School?

82
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,344
I'll go back to school too.

83
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,744
Hang on, I'll send you.

84
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,125
-There's no need.
-Be careful.

85
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,425
Slow down.

86
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,104
It's already so late.
Shouldn't you go home?

87
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,425
Why did you come here instead?

88
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,385
Gu Nanxi! I demand a duel!

89
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,384
You're already drunk.

90
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,095
Yet, you want a duel.

91
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,625
Cut the crap! Come at me.

92
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,165
Let's have a duel then.

93
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,065
I'm not afraid of you.

94
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,105
Come on.

95
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,155
Let's do it again.

96
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,635
What's wrong with you?

97
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,455
You're so fierce today.

98
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,464
I always told you not to act cool
during the match.

99
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,915
You never listened.

100
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,215
Your performance today was awesome.

101
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:24,785
Hey.

102
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,925
Hey! Are you asleep?

103
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,055
Where is he?

104
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:40,465
Chen Qingqing!

105
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,865
Chen Qingqing!

106
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,705
Chen Qingqing!

107
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,505
Chen Qingqing! Come out!

108
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,665
Situ Feng.

109
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:58,185
Hello, everyone.

110
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,305
Did anyone see Qingqing?

111
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,345
-No.
-No.

112
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,095
Who is it?

113
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,624
It must be a love confession.

114
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,715
Let's go and take a look.

115
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:16,875
That scared me.

116
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:19,585
Who is it?

117
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,184
-Is he confessing?
-Am I dreaming?

118
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,184
Isn't that Situ Feng?

119
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:26,495
-Why is it not working?
-What is he doing?

120
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,545
All right.

121
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,304
Chen Qingqing!

122
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,064
It's that Chen Qingqing again.

123
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,145
Chen Qingqing!

124
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,705
Chen Qingqing!

125
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:38,545
Go to him.

126
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,065
Chen Qingqing!

127
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,985
Come over here!

128
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,264
Do you want to die, Situ Feng?

129
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:54,325
Why did you come here
to scream at me at this hour?

130
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,305
Chen Qingqing.

131
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,624
I'm telling you.

132
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,024
Lower down your voice.

133
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:02,305
Don't let others know that I'm here!

134
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,355
Lower your voice.

135
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,025
Situ Feng.

136
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,744
Can you cut it out?
What do you want to say?

137
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,704
If you're not saying anything,
I'm leaving.

138
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:15,785
Chen Qingqing!

139
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,544
Wait up! I have a question to ask you.

140
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,505
What is it?

141
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:22,944
Chen Qingqing!

142
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:25,565
What's your relationship with them?

143
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:28,825
Them? Who are you talking about?

144
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,984
You have Hua Munian and Gu Nanxi.

145
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:34,824
That was for my errands service business.

146
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:38,445
They can help my store
and help me earn money.

147
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:39,705
Money?

148
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,705
I have a lot of money.

149
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,264
Look at this.

150
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,344
I'll give you my wallet.

151
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:45,225
Hang on.

152
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,705
Here. Five yuan, one yuan

153
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,105
and five mao.

154
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,745
I have coins too.

155
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,025
Three of them.

156
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:53,505
Situ Feng.

157
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,385
Can you cut it out?

158
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,385
Chen Qingqing.

159
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,395
Don't talk to them anymore, okay?

160
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,385
You're mine.

161
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:09,675
Situ Feng is going to kiss her.

162
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:20,905
Situ Feng.

163
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:23,665
Situ Feng.

164
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,784
How did he disappear so quickly?

165
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,664
-Gu Nanxi.
-Turns out, he was here.

166
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,875
He fell asleep.

167
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:31,345
Be careful.

168
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,224
He came to find you at this hour.

169
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,144
Did he have anything important
to tell you?

170
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:38,065
No.

171
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,984
It's nothing. He didn't say anything.

172
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,745
Bring him back quickly.

173
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,145
All right, have a good rest.

174
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,235
Let's go, Situ Feng.

175
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,145
It's this way.

176
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,105
Goodness.

177
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:52,265
Wake up.

178
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,385
Wake up.

179
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,385
My tooth hurts.

180
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,264
I'm sorry, everyone.

181
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:07,744
I'm sorry, everyone.

182
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,824
Sorry for disturbing you.

183
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,304
Let's go to sleep.

184
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,025
Let's go to sleep.

185
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,305
Dismiss!

186
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:21,555
What's wrong?

187
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,665
Fangfang.

188
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,815
Didn't you hear it?

189
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,665
Everyone is talking

190
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,055
about what happened last night.

191
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,905
Look at them.

192
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,065
They are mimicking him.

193
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,855
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

194
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,605
Situ Feng is here.

195
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,185
He's here.

196
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:59,904
Qingqing, I'm going
to hand in my assignment.

197
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,745
Fangfang.

198
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:45,464
If you want to study,
you should clear your mind.

199
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,264
See? You're holding it upside down.

200
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:50,264
As for you, you're going
to tear up the paper.

201
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:52,695
Are you thinking about breakfast?

202
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:54,545
Hurry up.

203
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,905
Study after you finish it.

204
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:00,345
Thank you.

205
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,705
I'll leave you two to it.

206
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,405
I'm going first.

207
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,304
Why are you looking for me?

208
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,784
Take a look at it.

209
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,544
You're really something.

210
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,464
What is it?

211
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:31,775
PITIFUL ASSISTANT WAS YELLED AT

212
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,345
This...

213
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,584
What do they mean by "pitiful assistant"?

214
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:36,985
Why am I pitiful?

215
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,775
Shouldn't they interpret this

216
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,304
as a love confession in the dorm?

217
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,384
I know you two don't like each other.

218
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,864
But can both of you
quarrel at the right place?

219
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:49,584
You fought in the middle of the night.

220
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:51,464
-But your appearance--
-What about it?

221
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,105
Nothing, it's great.

222
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,144
There won't be any gossip.

223
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:59,344
The press has been doubting
your identity as the assistant recently.

224
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:02,984
Plus, do you know what they will write
about the picture from last night?

225
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,245
But that's not what happened.

226
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:08,504
At this rate, we might
as well put on a whole show.

227
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,384
Situ Feng has a press conference tomorrow.

228
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,275
The press will be there.

229
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,225
You'll go with him.

230
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:19,104
Show them that both of you
are having a harmonious friendship.

231
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:21,264
Everything will be fine
after I send them some news.

232
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,465
Hang on.

233
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:26,064
Are you asking me
to be his assistant for real?

234
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,275
What else then?

235
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:35,584
My little master.

236
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,424
I know you want to focus
on producing music.

237
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,344
You don't want to know
about the business side.

238
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,544
But if we don't do any business...

239
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,144
If we don't do movies or commercials,

240
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,624
where can we get the money
to promote your music?

241
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,144
Do you know how much loss
the agency has suffered

242
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,584
because you suddenly wanted to cancel
the release of "Breath"?

243
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,384
The boss is really unhappy now.

244
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,384
He took back the funds for promotion.

245
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:58,635
I used my own money to promote your music.

246
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,064
Don't you believe me?

247
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,155
Look at this.

248
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,584
All of my credit cards are maxed out.

249
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:07,744
If it wasn't for the money
I loaned from the 9FBank app,

250
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:12,035
I would have exploded as well,
just like my credit card.

251
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,885
All right, I understand.

252
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,384
I'll do it, okay?

253
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,024
Tell me. What is it that you want?

254
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:22,365
The movie tomorrow
is directed by the famous Wang Jingwei.

255
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:26,544
Plus, Chen Qingqing is willing
to cooperate and be your assistant.

256
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:29,105
What? Chen Qingqing is coming too?

257
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,984
Don't worry, I'll be there tomorrow.

258
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,384
As long as you cooperate
with your deskmate,

259
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,984
I guarantee that nothing will happen.

260
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,575
All right, I'll go.

261
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:38,805
I'll go, okay?

262
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,885
Qingqing, you're here.

263
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,144
When we reach there,
you should focus on acting.

264
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:48,225
You just stay by his side.

265
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:52,184
If you see the press, both of you
should act nice to each other.

266
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,895
Leave the rest to me.

267
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,225
Hello? Yes, sir.

268
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,635
But I'm going with Situ Feng.

269
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,095
All right, I'll come back now.

270
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:06,805
-Daniel.
-Yes?

271
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:08,665
Are you leaving?

272
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,824
There's a problem at the office.
I need to deal with it.

273
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,785
What about us, Daniel?

274
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,824
As long as you don't fight,
you will be fine.

275
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,425
Remember my advice.

276
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,904
Maintain your smile
when you see the press.

277
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,384
Be humble when you meet the director.

278
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:25,385
Thanks for today, Qingqing.

279
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,605
See. The boss is calling again.

280
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,385
Hello? Yes, sir.

281
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:55,905
Situ Feng.

282
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,305
Can you hear me?

283
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:01,705
I can't.

284
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:08,985
Why did you come to my dorm that night?

285
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,025
You said that I'm yours.

286
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:14,944
That night, I wanted to say
that you're my assistant.

287
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:18,225
Don't create any trouble and embarrass me.

288
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:23,505
You came to my dorm at that hour
just to tell me that?

289
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,225
That's right.

290
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,504
What did you think I wanted to tell you?

291
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:28,385
Nothing.

292
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,915
I didn't think anything.

293
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,195
What should I say later?

294
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,865
You should just say anything you please.

295
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:46,224
How do you feel working
with Mr. Wang for the first time?

296
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,224
<i>It's an honor to work with Mr. Wang.</i>

297
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,464
<i>I'll take this opportunity
to learn from him.</i>

298
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,504
There's a rumor
that you bully your assistant.

299
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:56,295
Regarding the accusation,
what do you have to say?

300
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:00,064
<i>Hello, fellow reporters.</i>

301
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,104
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

302
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,424
I'm Chen Qingqing.

303
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,744
<i>Do I look like I'm being bullied?</i>

304
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,744
<i>I'm very close
with His Highness in real life.</i>

305
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:09,984
<i>It's the truth.</i>

306
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,864
<i>Am I right, Your Highness?</i>

307
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,744
<i>Yes, we're close.</i>

308
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,144
So please stand aside, everyone.

309
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:18,304
-Please move aside.
-You can't take photos.

310
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,635
Please come here.

311
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,185
Mr. Wang.

312
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,445
Situ Feng is here.

313
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:27,064
Hello, Mr. Wang.
It's a pleasure to work with you.

314
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,384
-Hello, young talent.
-Thank you, Mr. Wang.

315
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,544
This is my co-director, Li.

316
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,104
He'll explain to you later.

317
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,504
After his explanation,
you'll have to wait.

318
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,665
That's all.

319
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,195
-All right.
-Okay.

320
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:40,184
Your scenes will be filmed later.
You can wait at the side.

321
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:42,984
-I'll call you when it's time, okay?
-Okay.

322
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:45,175
-Please come with me.
-Okay.

323
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,525
This is your script. Please go through it.

324
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:59,265
-Do you want me to read it?
-You should understand it too.

325
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,925
Situ Feng. When will it be our turn?

326
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,715
I think we have to wait for a while.

327
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:20,965
Excuse me, Mr. Li.

328
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:22,944
I'm Situ Feng's assistant.

329
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:26,384
I want to ask you something.
When will it be our turn?

330
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,544
Take a look. There's a delay.

331
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,995
Both of you still have to wait.

332
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:33,535
Aren't you playing us for fools?

333
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,425
So what about it?

334
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,304
What I meant to say is

335
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,985
there's no heater here.
Everyone's suffering.

336
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,344
Everyone's working
in the same environment.

337
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,095
Wear thicker clothes if you're cold.

338
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,105
Qingqing.

339
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,465
Don't be angry.

340
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,744
It seems like it'll be a while
before our turn.

341
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,264
Here, wear my jacket.

342
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,624
Don't catch a cold.

343
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,984
If not, the press will say
that I'm torturing my assistant.

344
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,325
Aren't you cold?

345
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,465
Me? I'm fine.

346
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,265
It's your turn, Situ Feng.

347
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:32,224
You were supposed to talk
by the swimming pool, right?

348
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,384
-Yes.
-There's an extra scene.

349
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,035
You'll have to swim.

350
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:37,505
What?

351
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:39,505
Is there a problem?

352
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,584
You didn't say that I had to swim.

353
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:44,405
Plus, I'm not that good at swimming.

354
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,544
Can you find a substitute?

355
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:49,544
We're going to start filming now.
Where can I find a substitute for you?

356
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,504
Hurry up and prepare.

357
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:53,195
The whole world is waiting for you.

358
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:54,945
Situ Feng.

359
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,815
Is it our turn now?

360
00:21:58,105 --> 00:21:59,875
What's wrong with you?

361
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,825
There's an extra scene.

362
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:04,745
I need to swim.

363
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:05,625
Swim?

364
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,425
Can you really not swim?

365
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,424
If the sponsors
didn't insist on hiring him,

366
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,904
do you think Mr. Wang
would use a useless idol like him?

367
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:24,864
I'm telling you.

368
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:28,425
He's acting up just because
he has some fans.

369
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:32,745
Let's show him who's boss
on behalf of Mr. Wang.

370
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,385
For this scene,

371
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:36,824
both of you will stand here.

372
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:39,784
After Bao finishes her lines,
she'll push you into the water.

373
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,115
All right, ready.

374
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,305
Three, two, one. Action!

375
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:47,784
I really don't understand.
Why are you so angry?

376
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:48,704
Neither do I.

377
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:53,595
Even though my name means "precious,"
why does nobody treasure me?

378
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:54,825
Great. Cut!

379
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,145
Situ Feng.

380
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:03,865
Come up.

381
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,025
Thank you.

382
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:10,225
Hurry.

383
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:13,104
How are you?

384
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:14,504
Was the water too cold?

385
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,595
It was great.

386
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,544
Sir, there was a mistake.

387
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:18,865
A mistake?

388
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,835
Let's do it again.

389
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:25,745
Situ Feng.

390
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,784
They're doing it on purpose.

391
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:30,405
Qingqing, don't create any trouble.

392
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:34,345
Situ Feng.

393
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:38,545
You don't look like you can't swim.

394
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:41,625
Are you afraid of the water?

395
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:43,865
Mind your own business.

396
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,785
Mr. Wang.

397
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:57,784
-Mr. Wang.
-What's the matter?

398
00:23:57,785 --> 00:23:58,625
Excuse me.

399
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,425
Can I be Situ Feng's substitute?

400
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:02,465
You?

401
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:06,305
Sure.

402
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:08,505
We'll zoom out.

403
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,824
Are you okay with it?

404
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:10,864
Thank you, sir.

405
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,995
Let's continue after eating.

406
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:17,264
I've already informed the director.
I'll be your substitute.

407
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,344
What did you say?

408
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:19,624
I'll be your substitute.

409
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,984
Aren't you afraid of water?

410
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,944
I just learned how to swim,
so I'll replace you.

411
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,064
Chen Qingqing, have you gone mad?

412
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,024
I don't need a girl as a substitute.

413
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,345
The director has agreed to it.

414
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,225
There's nothing you can do.

415
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:35,465
Everyone, get ready.

416
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,345
Three, two, one. Action.

417
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:49,555
Why does nobody treasure me?

418
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:53,104
Let's do it again.

419
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,235
Why does nobody treasure me?

420
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,035
Let's do it again.

421
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:12,685
Okay, this is perfect.

422
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,425
Qingqing.

423
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:21,185
Situ Feng.

424
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:23,165
Don't come here.

425
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,895
I don't want to see you.

426
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:27,165
I'll help you.

427
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:28,425
I'm fine.

428
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:30,245
Pass me the towel.

429
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,224
<i>My makeup is ruined.</i>

430
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,264
<i>What should I do now?</i>

431
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:35,225
Qingqing.

432
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:36,944
Are you crying?

433
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:37,985
I'm fine.

434
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:50,625
Hey, beautiful lady. Where are you going?

435
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:51,745
What's this?

436
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:57,664
What's wrong? Don't leave.
Where are you going?

437
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:59,465
Let's have fun.

438
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,744
Come, let's play.

439
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:02,705
Hey! Stop it.

440
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,705
Who are you?

441
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:10,185
I'm Lin Yiyang.

442
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:14,705
Run.

443
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:21,025
Are you okay?

444
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:22,505
Why are you here?

445
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,184
I'm about to ask you.

446
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:25,585
Why are you here?

447
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:27,865
I work here.

448
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:32,175
-This is my family's restaurant.
-What?

449
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:33,105
Go home.

450
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,185
Hey.

451
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,975
I'll take you home.

452
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:15,785
This is my house.

453
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:17,265
I'm leaving then.

454
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,865
Baby, you're home.

455
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:24,225
"Baby"?

456
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:26,385
Who is this?

457
00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:27,544
He's my classmate.

458
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,144
He gave me a ride home.

459
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,425
This is my dad.

460
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:32,264
He likes to call me "Baby."

461
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,165
Hello, sir.

462
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,065
Hello.

463
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,155
Baby's classmate.

464
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:39,264
Thank you for giving her a ride home.

465
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:40,624
It's time for dinner.

466
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,205
Come inside and eat.

467
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:44,624
It's okay. He's busy.

468
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,224
How can you treat a guest like this?

469
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:48,704
Since you're here, don't be shy.

470
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:49,785
Come.

471
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,905
That's right. Come.

472
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:00,345
Let's eat.

473
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,264
Don't be shy.

474
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,625
Dig in.

475
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,225
Here, dig in.

476
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:07,705
Thank you, ma'am.

477
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:12,985
Baby.

478
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:14,744
Why aren't you eating?

479
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:17,664
Mom cooked all your favorite dishes today.

480
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,704
Aren't these your favorite too?

481
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,545
Just eat.

482
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,904
What are you so excited about?

483
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,265
Have some water.

484
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:32,115
-Drink up.
-Have a drink.

485
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,385
Okay.

486
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,065
Okay.

487
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:38,665
All right.

488
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,785
Our baby

489
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:45,705
has always been clumsy.

490
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,945
Thank goodness

491
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:52,715
she has a friend like you
to take care of her.

492
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,185
Hey, why aren't you eating?

493
00:28:58,265 --> 00:29:00,665
Do you not like the food?

494
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:02,304
It's not that.

495
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,305
When you're home,

496
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,304
what dishes do your dad
and mom cook for you?

497
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:09,664
I'll make it for you next time.

498
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,615
They aren't at home most of the time.

499
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:14,785
Dig in then.

500
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,025
Here, dig in.

501
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,025
Hey.

502
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:31,624
Why did you ask me to come here
early in the morning?

503
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,064
Don't ask so much.

504
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,544
You suddenly left
after yesterday's filming.

505
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:36,425
Qingqing.

506
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:39,005
Are you really okay?

507
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:40,555
I'm fine.

508
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,785
Well...

509
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,584
Are you not angry anymore?

510
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,345
When did I get angry?

511
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:51,665
You are weird today.

512
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,865
Could it be...

513
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:56,585
What?

514
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:58,704
What do you want to say?

515
00:29:58,705 --> 00:29:59,864
Don't dillydally.

516
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,144
-Let me take you somewhere.
-Where?

517
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,665
Cut the crap.

518
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,025
Follow me.

519
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:24,304
I can't believe such a place
exists in our school.

520
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:25,185
I know.

521
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,824
Is it for me?

522
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:32,825
Yes.

523
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,505
Thank you.

524
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,885
What is it called?

525
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,584
Its name is the same as yours.

526
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:41,225
It's called Qingqing.

527
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,424
It's called Qingqing too?

528
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,345
Yes.

529
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:46,765
Do you know why?

530
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:50,505
It's because it's ugly like you too.

531
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,065
How did you find this place?

532
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,544
I discovered it accidentally.

533
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:01,625
It was abandoned long ago.

534
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:03,225
Nobody came at all.

535
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:05,265
I needed a place to rest

536
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,645
so I cleaned up this place.

537
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:10,665
You're quite romantic.

538
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:13,545
Qingqing.

539
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:18,175
This is the first time
I brought someone here.

540
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:20,305
-Situ Feng.
-Yes?

541
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:23,065
Am I the first person

542
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:24,585
just because

543
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:29,024
you're thankful
that I became your assistant?

544
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:31,425
If I do it a few more times,

545
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:36,265
will you really fall in love with me?

546
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:42,135
Fall in love with you? It's better for me
to fall in love with the plants.

547
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:52,584
Today is His Highness's album release day.

548
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,704
Didn't you go to buy his album?
Why do you look like this?

549
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,745
I've already bought them.

550
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,465
But I discovered something odd.

551
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,515
What is it?

552
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:03,944
Look at the new album's song list.

553
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,525
"Breath" isn't here.

554
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:08,545
I thought it was hidden earlier.

555
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,224
But I listened to the entire album.

556
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:13,025
The song is not there.

557
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,945
It's not on the album.

558
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:18,464
I thought His Highness
wanted to try a new genre.

559
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,464
He even filmed a music video
for this song.

560
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:21,985
Right, I heard that

561
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,344
the agency went to all the trouble
to release this song.

562
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,704
Why isn't it on the album?

563
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:29,224
Did the agency stop him from releasing it?

564
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:30,385
It's possible.

565
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,665
I found it odd.

566
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,304
The agency only wants to earn money.

567
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:37,344
Why would they let
His Highness easily change his style?

568
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:41,304
We can't let all the hard work
of His Highness go to waste.

569
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:43,945
Yes, we must protect our idol!

570
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,375
All right, I hacked into their computer.

571
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,525
Did you find "Breath"?

572
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:57,595
Hurry, download it.

574
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,555
If I'm not mistaken,

575
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,985
this is a man's jacket.

576
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:13,384
<i>The candidate list for the school's play
has been announced.</i>

577
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:15,504
<i>Qingqing, look. You made the cut.</i>

578
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:18,695
Do you think you can be the main actress?

579
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:27,545
Feng.

580
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:32,705
-What?
-What's wrong?

581
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:34,104
Why do you look so serious?

582
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,425
Nothing, it's just the agency.

583
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:41,415
