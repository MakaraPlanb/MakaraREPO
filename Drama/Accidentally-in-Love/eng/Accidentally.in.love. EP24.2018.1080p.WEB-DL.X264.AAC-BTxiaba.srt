EPISODE 24

2
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,045
Are you Hebiancao?

3
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,965
Why are you wearing...

4
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,805
I'm His Highness's fan.

5
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,324
I'm afraid that I'll lose my composure
when I see His Highness.

6
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:56,644
His Highness might get frightened
by my facial expressions.

7
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:00,175
Therefore, I'm wearing a mask.
Is that okay?

8
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,605
-Sure.
-Okay.

9
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:03,804
As long as you're happy.

10
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,965
Thank you.

11
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:06,815
Have a seat.

12
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:07,685
Okay.

13
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:13,065
Slightly to your right.

14
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:19,805
Well...

15
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:21,724
Nice to meet you.

16
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,525
It's my pleasure to work with you.

17
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,525
Your Highness.

18
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,525
I'm your die-hard fan.

19
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,385
Your Highness.

20
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,435
Your skin is so white and smooth.

21
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,845
Your figure

22
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,965
is excellent.

23
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,485
You don't have any fat all.

24
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,244
-Calm down.
-How do you maintain your figure?

25
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,475
Please calm down, all right?

26
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,084
I'm sorry for losing my cool.

27
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,645
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:07,324
Please sit over there.

29
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,485
Over there.

30
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,165
Okay.

31
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:21,884
His Highness's manager, Daniel,
is still dealing with other things.

32
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,964
Please wait here for a while.

33
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,244
He'll be right here

34
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:29,004
to explain to you
the detail of this collaboration.

35
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:29,845
Okay.

36
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,565
Are you really Hebiancao?

37
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:43,835
That's right.

38
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,075
By the way,

39
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,404
I've brought some of my manuscripts.

40
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:49,155
You can take a look.

41
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,884
Chen Qingqing, what are you doing here?

42
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:11,325
Where's the cartoonist?
I thought she has already arrived.

43
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:13,965
I'm Hebiancao.

44
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,245
Hebiancao?

45
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,965
Are you Hebiancao?

46
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:21,164
The press is going
to have a good story to write.

47
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:26,475
His Highness's number one fan
turns out to be his personal assistant.

48
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,445
Sit down.

49
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:31,565
Qingqing, you should've told us.

50
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,815
This is a long story.

51
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,605
Qingqing Hebiancao.

52
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:39,204
I understand the meaning now.

53
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,644
Was it fun to make a fool out of me?

54
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,764
I didn't do it on purpose.

55
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:44,964
Since she's one of us--

56
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:47,964
If I didn't blow your cover,
you would've kept that mask on, right?

57
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:51,004
Situ Feng, I wanted to tell you the truth.

58
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,764
But so many things have happened lately.
I didn't have the chance.

59
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:57,284
What's the truth? Like how many
secret identities have you got?

60
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,604
I'll explain everything to you
if you give me a chance.

61
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:01,564
Explain everything?
Can you explain everything?

62
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:04,084
Situ Feng, can you drop that attitude?

63
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,164
If you were me,
would you not react the same way?

64
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,884
Is this necessary? It was just BL comics.

65
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,644
Can you two listen to me?

66
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,725
-No!
-No!

67
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,684
There's a press conference this afternoon.
Are you two still working together?

68
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:16,745
-Yes!
-Yes!

69
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:19,684
Daniel, make sure
that you pay every dime owed

70
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,285
for her works.

71
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,895
Unlike someone, I don't scam people.

72
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,235
Daniel, I won't accept a penny from you.

73
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,084
Please donate the money.

74
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,045
Unlike someone,

75
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,535
I'm a considerate person.

76
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:38,885
Why are they acting like enemies?

77
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,805
SITU FENG, CHEN QINGQING

78
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:45,365
Hello.

79
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,124
Are you collaborating with a fan
for your new album

80
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,284
to thank your fans
for their constant support?

81
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,524
Regardless of this collaboration,

82
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,084
I'm always thankful for the support
and trust that my fans have given me.

83
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:59,524
We're collaborating with Hebiancao,
mainly because the style of her drawing

84
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,804
<i>fits the concept
of my new album, Break Through.</i>

85
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:06,084
Hebiancao, why do I feel
like I've seen you before?

86
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:09,164
That's right. You used
to be Situ Feng's assistant, right?

87
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:10,165
Yes.

88
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,564
I used to be His Highness's assistant,

89
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:15,084
but I'm also his number one fan.

90
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:16,644
As your closest staff member,

91
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:17,764
Situ Feng, did you know

92
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,684
that you were the character of her comic?

93
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,795
I just recently found out.

94
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,865
I was very angry.

95
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:28,805
That was a joke.

96
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:30,964
I was worried
that they'd get into a fight.

97
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:36,505
Luckily, they're putting the interests
of the album above everything else.

98
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,525
Fangfang,

99
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,324
your happiness is in your own hands.

100
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,844
You have to work hard
to seize your own happiness.

101
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:56,355
That's right. I have to be confident.
I shouldn't look down on myself.

102
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,284
Excuse me. Where can I find this book?

103
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,515
It was still here yesterday.

104
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,335
Hold on. Let me take a look.

105
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:22,364
Is this the book?

106
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:23,964
Someone borrowed the English version.

107
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,505
Do you want the Chinese version?

108
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:29,084
-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

109
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:30,924
Why is this book so popular lately?

110
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,155
Everyone wants to borrow it.

111
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:34,765
Really?

112
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:38,905
Excuse me.

113
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,164
Can you call Lin Yiyang for me?

114
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,045
Hold on.

115
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,964
Lin Yiyang isn't here yet.

116
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,905
All right.

117
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,805
Fangfang.

118
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,245
Are you looking for our boss?

119
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,964
Are you an idiot?

120
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:58,604
Ever since our boss decided to study hard,

121
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:01,484
his attractiveness
has increased drastically.

122
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:06,324
So many ignorant girls have come
to confess their feelings to him.

123
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:10,645
Dalei, are we going
to have a sister-in-law soon?

124
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,804
He's our boss.

125
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:16,085
Do you think anyone can be his girlfriend?

126
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:17,485
Fangfang.

127
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:20,125
We're friends after all.

128
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:21,245
Right?

129
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:23,644
Why did you jump on the bandwagon?

130
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,085
You're so silly.

131
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:26,965
I didn't.

132
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:34,125
What's the matter?

133
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,355
It's nothing.

134
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,685
Pricks.

135
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,285
Why did you say to her?

136
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,644
How dare you make fun of my friend?

137
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:48,965
Stop laughing.

138
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,865
Stop crying.

139
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:39,445
Lin Yiyang.

140
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:43,705
I really don't know what to do.

141
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:47,805
I know that we're from different worlds.

142
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,084
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,645
Aren't we friends?

144
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,165
We're friends.

145
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:04,565
Whoever

146
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,955
upsets you from now on

147
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,405
upsets me, Lin Yiyang.

148
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,105
Do you hear me?

149
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,425
All right. Stop crying.

150
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,745
Where is my book?

151
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,585
Is it this one?

152
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,825
Mine is in Chinese.

153
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,565
It should be this one then.

154
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:44,775
It was you who borrowed this book.

155
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:51,804
Why did you ask me
what book I was reading then?

156
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,545
What are you reading?

157
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:55,364
If you're able to score well
for your exams

158
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,484
and make it into the top 100,

159
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:58,925
I will tell you.

160
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,565
I didn't know

161
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,164
that you would read such cheesy poems.

162
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,965
It gave me goosebumps.

163
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,065
Come on. It's really romantic.

164
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:33,935
Everyone has shown
a big improvement in this exam.

165
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:39,125
Especially Situ Feng.
You've improved your math grades.

166
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,435
Congratulations.

167
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,404
Situ Feng.

168
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,964
You should thank your classmate,
Chen Qingqing,

169
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,044
for taking the time to tutor you.

170
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,225
Chen Qingqing.

171
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:54,475
Thank you so much
for what you've done for me.

172
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,364
There's no need to thank me.

173
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,365
I was glad to help.

174
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,525
All right, everyone.

175
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,444
Go wild and crazy during your long break.

176
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,795
You're officially on vacation.

177
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,205
Qingqing.

178
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,555
Why aren't you eating?

179
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,565
I'm not hungry.

180
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,044
Qingqing, it's the holidays.

181
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:37,644
Why do you look so down?

182
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,844
You don't have any appetite
and look lethargic.

183
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:43,684
People might think
that you're going through a breakup.

184
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,875
I'm afraid that it's over

185
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,265
before it even began.

186
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:49,364
Is the guy

187
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:51,125
our classmate?

188
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:52,444
Hey, Xiaoyi.

189
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,724
Look at Qingqing's condition. Stop prying.

190
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,564
So, is he our classmate?

191
00:12:56,565 --> 00:13:00,044
Gosh, it's nothing.
I'm having a bad year, that's all.

192
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,484
Nothing is going my way.

193
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,404
How about this?

194
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,844
Why don't you put the school legend
to the test?

195
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,204
-What legend?
-What legend?

196
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,324
Do you know there's a clock tower
in our college?

197
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,724
Legend has it that if you enter
the clock tower

198
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,924
and express your regrets sincerely,

199
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,404
it would turn anti-clockwise
if the clock is touched by your sincerity.

200
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:18,604
You'll be able to return to the past.

201
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:19,844
Why don't you give it a try?

202
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,164
You have nothing to lose anyway.

203
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,764
The clock tower is spooky.

204
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,724
Usually, there's no one there.

205
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,955
Aren't you scared, Qingqing?

206
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,284
I've made up my mind.

207
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,355
I'm going to do it now.

208
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,865
Please clear the table for me.

209
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,205
Go, Qingqing.

210
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,845
Xinyu taught us how to play this song.

211
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,195
Xinyu said it was the perfect song to play

212
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,405
when we start to fight.

213
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:18,605
And surprisingly, we would calm down
every time we heard this song.

214
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,655
Xinyu was amazing.

215
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,164
I still remember that Yiyang
and you used to fight over her.

216
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:29,885
Actually, I really liked Xinyu too.

217
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,735
I don't know why.

218
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:38,085
I swore to you that we'd never
fall for the same girl.

219
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:43,175
But people always contradict themselves

220
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,875
and often say things that they don't mean.

221
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,595
If I could go back in time,

222
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:53,685
I think,

223
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:57,475
I would still make the same decision.

224
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:04,045
Some things are destined to be.

225
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:07,565
My best friend and I,

226
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,675
fell for the same girl

227
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:10,845
twice.

228
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,125
I didn't have much choice in life.

229
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,164
Therefore, I panicked every time I ran

230
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,025
into a multiple choice.

231
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:25,555
In the end, I narrowed down
the answers to just one.

232
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,485
Gu Nanxi.

233
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:40,955
Sometimes,

234
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:44,004
I'd rather fight it out with you

235
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,404
than listen to your confession.

236
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,325
It truly wears me out.

237
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,615
But I've finally understood this time.

238
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,715
So what's your decision?

239
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,245
You'll find out soon.

240
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:36,945
Nice to meet you.

241
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,444
My name is Chen Qingqing.

242
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:46,575
Rumor has it

243
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:50,165
that you can reverse time.

244
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:51,435
Is that true?

245
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,085
If you could take me back in time,

246
00:16:55,925 --> 00:17:00,085
take me back to the day
I ran away from my wedding.

247
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,045
<i>I wish I had never come to Yuncheng.</i>

248
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,204
<i>I wish I had never met him.</i>

249
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,245
No.

250
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,284
That one doesn't count.

251
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:13,564
Take me back to the day
when he confessed his feelings to me.

252
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,485
<i>I should've come clean at that time.</i>

253
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:18,725
If I had,

254
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:22,165
he would have gotten mad at me.

255
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:27,685
Then, all the good memories
of that night wouldn't have existed.

256
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,325
Oh, dear clock.

257
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,405
Can you tell me?

258
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,245
If I could really go back in time,

259
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,095
I don't know which day I should choose.

260
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,985
You're the only one who can decide.

261
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,645
This is crazy.

262
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,085
You can talk?

263
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:07,015
You're the crazy one.

264
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,764
I'm going to reverse time.

265
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,844
I'm going to take you back to Jincheng.

266
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:14,125
And make your grandpa lock you up forever.

267
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:23,765
Chen Qingqing.

268
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:25,625
Chen Qingqing.

269
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,245
Situ Feng.

270
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:33,575
Are you crazy?

271
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,025
Chen Qingqing.

272
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,004
Did you actually believe
in this stupid legend?

273
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:39,935
What's gotten into you?

274
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,044
And you even made
such a sappy love confession.

275
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,324
Why are you here?

276
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,124
Did you come here
to turn back the time too?

277
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,605
Time will only reverse

278
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,725
at 3:10 p.m.

279
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:55,004
You can only make your wish at that time.

280
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:58,124
The clock will then decide
whether or not to grant your wish.

281
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,924
Please, can't you transfer students,

282
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:03,325
at least get your facts straight?

283
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,805
Or else, it's useless.

284
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,124
You're making up all these stories
and ridiculous lies,

285
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,764
I think that you're the idiot here.

286
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,285
We're both are.

287
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,775
Perhaps, we're both idiots.

288
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,225
Chen Qingqing.

289
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:25,445
I was mad

290
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,084
because the person
who went through everything with me

291
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,125
was Chen Qingqing whom I came to know.

292
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,915
Everything that has happened to us
was so real.

293
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,545
I want to cherish

294
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,765
every second,

295
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,345
every minute of it.

296
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,405
I thought

297
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,655
that Chen Qingqing

298
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,045
was merely a disguise.

299
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,165
But ever since I met you,

300
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,644
I've started to feel confused

301
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,485
about the real me.

302
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:03,124
Gu Nanxi taught me how to simplify
a multiple choice question.

303
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,415
Whether you're Chen Qingqing,

304
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:06,565
Qingchen,

305
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:09,445
or Hebiancao,

306
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,305
I don't care.

307
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,005
I just like you.

308
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,645
Hello?

309
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:55,645
Qingqing.

310
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:56,925
I'm home.

311
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,255
That was fast.

312
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,685
So...

313
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,125
Are we

314
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,325
<i>a couple now?</i>

315
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,045
Yes.

316
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,125
You're my girlfriend.

317
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,695
<i>-I'm your boyfriend.
-Hey!</i>

318
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,844
<i>By the way, Situ Feng.</i>

319
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,085
Our relationship

320
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:27,275
shouldn't be made public for now.

321
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:31,924
Although it's our personal business
to date each other,

322
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:36,525
<i>I'm afraid of affecting your career.</i>

323
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,684
<i>I will think of what to do.</i>

324
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,724
You'll be affected for sure
if it's made public.

325
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:48,125
But at least,
we have to let the people around us know.

326
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,164
Qingqing, I have to answer a call.

327
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,275
<i>-Give me a second.
-Okay.</i>

328
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:55,484
Hello, Lanting.

329
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:56,645
Hello, Feng.

330
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:57,964
<i>Are you back in town?</i>

331
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:58,964
<i>I'm on a vacation.</i>

332
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,164
Let's catch up if you have time.

333
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,084
<i>I was waiting for you to say that.</i>

334
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,945
How about this weekend?

335
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,764
Let's also invite Xinya,

336
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,195
Yiyang and Nanxi.

337
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:10,324
Let's have a party on the beach.

338
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,564
Don't tell me that you're not available.

339
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,405
No.

340
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,164
If you say so, I'll be there.

341
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:19,204
All right. I have to hang up now.
I'll see you this weekend.

342
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,045
Bye.

343
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:24,724
-Qingqing.
-Hello?

344
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:26,295
I've got an idea.

345
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:27,735
What's that?

346
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,924
Come somewhere with me this weekend.

347
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:30,765
Okay.

348
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,244
How did it go, Lanting?

349
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:39,124
Feng agreed to it, didn't he?

350
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,315
Don't worry. I've got it.

351
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:45,164
I will make Situ Feng listen to me
during this trip.

352
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,525
Lanting, I'm counting on you.

353
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,775
Take a look.

354
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:11,684
I've gone through every project
that we'll be collaborating.

355
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:15,645
I've purposely brought
all my newest manuscripts.

356
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:18,084
This one is for the album cover.

357
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:20,964
I can also sell you the copyright
of the cute version.

358
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,935
Here are the manuscripts. Take a look.

359
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,085
Qingqing, you're so talented.

360
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,364
I'm going to show them to my colleagues
in the Planning Department

361
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,124
and also bring you the contract.

362
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,965
-Thank you, Daniel.
-You're welcome.

363
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:38,725
Hey.

364
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,924
You're using me to earn money again.

365
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:45,724
What's wrong?
Do you have a problem with that?

366
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,925
No, I don't.

367
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:50,765
Ask me for more if you don't earn enough.

368
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,165
Hey.

369
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:57,484
I'm not happy with one of the pictures.

370
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:58,425
Which one?

371
00:23:58,685 --> 00:23:59,645
This one.

372
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,085
-This?
-Yes.

373
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,825
There's only the male lead

374
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,684
in this picture.

375
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,675
Where's the female lead?

376
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:10,915
Here. Give it to me.

377
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:15,245
Done.

378
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:19,045
What is that? It's a stick figure.

379
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,295
You're talented in drawing,

380
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:24,405
but I'm quite creative too.

381
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:27,885
I'll show you my creativity.

382
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:34,245
I designed everything in this box.

383
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:35,445
Look.

384
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:39,085
The most popular box

385
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:41,164
out of the six boxes

386
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:42,295
is this one.

387
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,565
Situ Feng with a naked butt.

388
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,925
Chen Qingqing, you...

389
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:51,285
Come here.

390
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:56,404
Oh, my God. What are you two doing
in the office?

391
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:58,084
I can't look at you two.

392
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,804
Situ Feng, you are really...

393
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:01,125
Damn.

394
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,245
Daniel.

395
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,884
Have you prepared the car?

396
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:05,925
Of course.

397
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:09,604
You will have to work nonstop for a year
after you release your new album.

398
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:13,164
I went to great lengths
to make the boss arrange a car for you.

399
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,764
You must be careful during the trip.

400
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,564
Make sure you put on sunscreen.

401
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:19,284
And don't let the press
take pictures of you...

402
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,655
Stop doing this.

403
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,844
The news of His Highness

404
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:24,804
and Hebiancao's collaboration
has been released.

405
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:26,765
-Take a look.
-What?

406
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:34,885
Isn't she His Highness's assistant?

407
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,884
The news has gone viral on the forums.

408
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:39,204
The fan who has been supporting

409
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,565
His Highness all this time

410
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,764
was His Highness's little assistant.

411
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:45,505
Isn't this inspiring?

412
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,844
A little fan, who managed
to become her idol's assistant,

413
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:50,804
anonymously promoted
her idol's career on the fan page.

414
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:52,284
And eventually, on her own efforts,

415
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:54,324
she got to perform
on the same stage with her idol.

416
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:57,844
She's the winner of everything
that a fangirl dreams of becoming.

417
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,655
I admire her so much.

418
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,444
I'm so looking forward
to His Highness's new album.

419
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,365
Me too.

420
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:14,884
<i>This is the first time
we're going on a trip together.</i>

421
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:17,044
-What are you doing here?
-Why? Am I not welcome here?

422
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:18,364
Let's play something.

423
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:19,604
<i>How about dodgeball?</i>

424
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:22,715
We'll have a good time with her later.

425
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:24,965
Hey!

426
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:30,164
There's something
that I don't want to hide anymore.

427
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,604
I hope all of you would understand.

428
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:33,645
Especially Xinya.

429
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:36,684
Situ Feng, hurry, go check on Xinya.

430
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:37,885
Xinya!

431
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,844
Chen Qingqing, don't cause more trouble.

432
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:44,884
If you weren't here,
things wouldn't have been like this.

433
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:47,295
