1
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,869
At the age of 29,

2
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,463
you're still shining.

3
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:36,937
But I'm not...

4
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:40,561
by your side.

5
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:45,765
My life of eternity...

6
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,809
has finally come to an end.

7
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,433
Times after my death,

8
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:56,957
you are still here.

9
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,661
You've forgotten me...

10
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,885
and your life is perfectly
complete with me gone.

11
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,339
I have to disappear.

12
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,363
To make you smile.

13
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,460
This is the decision I have to make.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,200
I have to end my life.

15
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,960
In the end,

16
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,260
that's the decision I made.

17
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,290
Mister.

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,820
What?

19
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,090
I can't tell who's the one in a rush.

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,620
Do you see me now?

21
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,090
Yes.

22
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,920
Are you mad at me?

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,290
- Why would I be?
- Then why are you mad?

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,790
How far back are you going?

25
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,160
I feel like I'm collecting
all the accrued miles.

26
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,290
I did not.

27
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,090
See? You're mad now, too.

28
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,090
Who do you think you are?

29
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,920
Who are you to keep calling me?
You're so noisy.

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,490
Why do you get me flustered?

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,690
Why do you get me confused?
Who do you think you are?

32
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,220
You should've removed the
sword when I asked you to...

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,460
since that's your worth.

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
I was just...

35
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
That's why...

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
I said I'd remove the sword.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,990
You're the one who wouldn't talk to me.

38
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,290
I thought you were waiting
for the first snowfall...

39
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,420
since that was the promise.

40
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Forget it.

41
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,790
You may have time to kill
since you live forever,

42
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,490
but I'm an average human being...

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,490
so time is gold and money.

44
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,290
How long must I be on standby?

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,620
I'm busy with school and my part-time job.

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,490
- Tomorrow.
- Why not today?

47
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm free today.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,760
Not today. Tomorrow.

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,560
It's too nice out today.

50
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,160
I want to take a walk with you.

51
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Tomorrow.

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,860
Again? Why?

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,090
Let me do it before I go to school.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,220
The weather stinks today.

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
I'll need to pick you up later.

56
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,690
Tomorrow.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,920
One more day.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,160
Why not today?

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,160
Just one more day.

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
No way.

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,280
It's snowing.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,280
It's the first snowfall.

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,910
Why is it snowing already?

64
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,250
That's crazy.

65
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,880
I like it because it's pretty,
but the flowers must be cold.

66
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,810
Right?

67
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,980
We're seeing the earliest snowfall ever.

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,620
This is you, right?

69
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,910
You wanted me to pull out
the sword when it snowed.

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,350
I'm sorry for being selfish,

71
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,450
but I wanted something to remember by.

72
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,880
How long are you going to enjoy this?

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,550
You better hurry up and get pretty.

74
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,880
Okay, now.

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,210
All right. It's time to make you pretty.

76
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,510
Any last words?

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,950
Every moment I spent with you...

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,120
shined.

79
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,850
Because the weather was good,

80
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,310
because the weather was bad,

81
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,910
and because the weather was good enough...

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,750
I loved every moment of it.

83
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,410
Also,

84
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,410
no matter what happens,

85
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,210
it's not your fault.

86
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,810
Are you...

87
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,480
really going to turn into a broom?

88
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,780
That won't happen.

89
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,650
I'm glad.

90
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,210
Here I go.

91
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,950
Why can't I grab it?

92
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,250
I can see it, but I can't pull it out.

93
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,480
Did you put enough pressure?

94
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,780
Here, let me try again.

95
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,250
You said earlier that it's not my fault...

96
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,050
no matter what happens,

97
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,810
- so don't take it back.
- Hey.

98
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,380
- How can the goblin's bride...
- I said, don't take it back.

99
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,080
Just stand still.

100
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,510
I'm more surprised than you.

101
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,450
I'm standing still. How can
I get more still than this?

102
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,980
Give me that agreement.
I'm going to burn it.

103
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Wait.

104
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,980
I know what it is. This must be it.
I get it now.

105
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,410
- What is it?
- The cursed prince.

106
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,850
You know, the ones in fairy tales?

107
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,980
What about them?

108
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,310
A kiss.

109

111
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,670
Why? Are you in pain?

112
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,330
By any chance, is it because of the sword?

113
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,770
Ajusshi.

114
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,240
I can grab the sword.

115
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,470
Wait a minute.

116
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,420
Wait a minute, I'll pull it out for you.

117
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,720
It is moving.

128
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,060
Ajusshi, are you okay?

129
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,150
I think I should be the one asking that.

130
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,400
Is that right?

131
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,790
Oh, what an ordeal.

132
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,130
I'm sorry. You were startled a lot, right?

133
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,750
Ajusshi didn't know that
it would hurt like this.

134
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,940
Since no-one has ever grabbed it before.

135
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,370
By the way, you can really fly.

136
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,780
I wasn't asking you to show me this way.

137
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,890
That's a piece of gum
(CAKE, HOMONYM FOR SWORD).

138
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,380
We should toughen up our hearts.

139
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,900
I see now that this is not
something to be taken lightly.

140
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,590
But to be honest, I was more surprised
that I could move the sword.

141
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,100
Aren't you really relieved?

142
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,900
With that, it has been proven that I
am really the Goblin's bride, right?

143
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,620
I'm glad.

144
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,590
Are you not glad?

145
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,390
I'm glad.

146
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,950
See... I am really the bride.

147
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,210
This was fate.

148
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,210
Fate.

149
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,430
It's cool.

150
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,180
Why is this Uncle not home yet? I can't
get my allowance until I fulfill my task.

151
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,490
Let's see what commotion there was today.

152
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,140
It is him.

153
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,790
Uncle, you were on the second floor?
I was waiting all this time.

154
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,630
Uncle, hurry up and look at this.

155
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,680
By any chance, was this you, uncle?

156
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,650
So how can you sit around like this?
Take care of it.

157
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,490
- Was this really you?
- I don't have any energy to explain, so don't ask.

158
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,980
We don't have any time. Hurry.

159
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,830
What on earth did you do?

160
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,500
Grandfather, listen to what I'm
going to say now, carefully.

161
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,260
Uncle... no, not me. Uncle!

162
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,410
Mr Kim, listen to what I'm
going to say now, carefully.

163
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,348
From this very moment,
by gathering up the

164
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,400
entire secretary's office
at Cheon Oh Group...

165
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,440
No, not me.

166
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,390
It's not about me!

167
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,530
Uncle down the hall, we
have to go somewhere.

168
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,850
Where?

169
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,490
Since uncle lacks social
skills, he shattered society.

170
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,390
From this moment, you are
to request all the sites

171
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,880
which have links to the video
remove them immediately.

172
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,397
Before it spreads, you are to
block it quickly and precisely.

173
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,490
You may utilize big data
and if you do make contact

174
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,243
with the person in charge, it might
be easier and more effective if

175
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,060
you tell them that Cheon Oh Group
will remove all its sponsoring ads.

176
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,750
Now... let's start.

177
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,960
Yes.

178
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Now, everyone.

179
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,420
Okay, firstly, those whose car or
property got damaged, please stand here.

180
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,300
Those who saw something disturbing
and got mentally disturbed.

181
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Please line up over there.

182
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,500
The car was mangled due to a
sudden gust of wind. That's all.

183
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,670
The money was just luck that
fell out of the sky. That is it.

184
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,290
Also, you did not see me today.

185
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,440
Okay, next.

186
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,850
I'm next. By the way, isn't
it really dark out here?

187
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,750
I wasn't feeling too good.

188
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,390
Could you please look into
my eyes for a moment?

189
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,230
The car was mangled due
to a sudden gust of wind.

190
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,030
The money fell down from the sky,
that is it. Today you did not see me.

191
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,520
Okay... next, next!

192
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,760
Yes, hurry, come this way.

193
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,190
Eyes, look at my eyes. Look.

194
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes, next person.

195
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,180
What's your car type?

196
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,800
It'll be done here once
we delete these files.

197
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,860
Can you look into my eyes for a moment?

198
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,390
I mean, what kind of couple fights
like that to demolish 30 cars?

199
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,400
Do you know how much Uncle down
the hall and I went through?

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,750
You did a good job. Thanks.

201
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,320
Don't be thankful. I just don't have
the energy to fight, that's all.

202
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,530
Let's postpone this fight. It's
disturbing enough as it is.

203
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,040
No matter how disturbed you
are, it's worse for me.

204
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,520
How do you know whether it's
not as bad or worse for me?

205
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,570
Hey, for me, this thing...
this much, like this...

206
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,480
Nevermind. Forget it.

207
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,400
Did you come back from
nearly dying or something?

208
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,170
What's wrong with you guys, again?

209
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,670
Buckwheat, we don't have to leave anymore.

210
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,350
I'm the real bride. Surely!

211
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, it hurts.

212
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,000
Ajusshi, what's wrong?

213
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,470
Surely, he's not dead, is he?

214
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,530
It's because of the medicine.
Let him sleep.

215
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,100
If he sleeps like that,
he won't get full rest.

216
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
You should carry him like this to the room.

217
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,830
Yes, do that. If you can do it that is.

218
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,140
What's wrong? Why did
you take the medicine?

219
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,030
Does it still hurt?

This grown-up adult passes
out and sleeps anywhere.

237
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,060
Because it hurts.

238
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,470
You're awake?

239
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,730
It smells like a pain relief patch.

240
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,710
I was hurting here and there.
Are you hurting a lot, too?

241
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,380
You said you were fine earlier.

242
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,460
It was a lie.

243
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,030
You're always lying.

244
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,500
Get well soon.

245
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,890
You don't even know where it hurts.

246
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,920
Where does it hurt?

247
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,390
First love hurts a lot.

248
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,390
She must've been really pretty.

249
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,440
I saw you wrote stuff down about it too.

250
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,900
A lot. Every day...

251
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,320
She's pretty.

252
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,190
You're not feeling well at all.
You're gravely ill.

253
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,010
Sleep a lot. So you can get well soon.

254
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,650
Don't do that.

255
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,550
Why? Why should I be nice to someone
who only thinks about his first love?

256
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,520
Is that something to say to your bride?

257
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,360
If you look closely, you
can see the pretty parts.

258
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,940
So don't leave.

259
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,950
Did I or did I not tell you not to
say words that begin with "ch"?

260
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,290
Psh! You're so petty.

261
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,690
Please put in all of the
vegetables and heat the bread.

262
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,060
<i>Yes.</i>

263
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,640
Here's the bribe you ordered.

264
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,230
Fine. The item?

265
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,590
Can you actually interpret this?

266
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,764
It is must for a third generation
Chaebol to finish studying

267
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:48,640
the Thousand-Character Classic
at the age of three...

268
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
- But what is this?
- Your Uncle's background information.

269
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,510
Especially about his first love.
It's our secret.

270
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,360
This little girl. I enjoy digging
up background information.

271
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,660
This is letter means "to hear".
In case you don't know it.

272
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,680
You can't not know what this means
after eating up all the sandwich.

273
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,690
- It's not allowed.
- It's a love letter.

274
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,490
- A love letter?
- Yeah.

275
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,530
It's a sad love confession.

276
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,300
After living for one hundred days, one day,

277
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,160
on an ordinary day...

278
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,920
I had my suspicions. I guess it's just as
I thought. It's fine, I know who it is.

279
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,460
- Who is it?
- I heard all about it.

280
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,321
Well, that can happen.
There can be one woman

281
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,590
you can't ever forget
after 900 years.

282
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,600
- He said there's just one person?
- It's not?

283
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,550
- I wouldn't know about that.
- Oh, I got scared.

284
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,330
Anyway. About Kim Shin...

285
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,390
Who's Kim Shin?

286
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,090
- Your Uncle.
- My uncle's name is Kim Shin?

287
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,560
Our uncle's name is Yoo Shin Jae.

288
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,580
Well. It's a long story.

289
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,400
Anyway, about the sword
in your Uncle's chest.

290
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,520
Our Uncle has a sword in his chest?

291
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,030
- Ah, what do you know about him?
- What's the sword about?!

292
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,013
If you only tell me a
little here and there, I'll

293
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,780
get a gum-plex. (PLAY
ON COMPLEX, GUM=SWORD)

294
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,920
If you keep doing this, I won't tell
you something that only I know of.

295
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,420
What is something that only you know of?

296
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,950
You said he cried after
looking at this painting?

297
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,530
Yeah. He was completely bawling.

298
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,950
I kept telling him he couldn't,
but Uncle down the hall

299
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,750
- kept asking to see...
- He cried? Why?

300
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,790
I don't know. Go tell him off, Uncle.
Let's get angry at him.

301
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,940
Hurry. Huh? Huh? Huh?

302
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,530
Why did you look at my painting?
He said he tried to stop you.

303
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,020
He said you cried. Why would
you cry when I don't even cry?

304
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,660
I was flustered too, so I
thought about it a lot.

305
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,236
Stendhal's syndrome. (strong reaction
to art or something personally

306
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,560
(significant) I'm thinking maybe
it's something like that.

307
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,890
It was really touching, and
I felt really overwhelmed.

308
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,500
But who is it? The girl in the painting?

309
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,630
What are you going to do
with that information?

310
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,770
It seemed like I saw her before.

311
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,260
Who's the girl that you saw? The
girl that I know is my sister.

312
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,290
- You had a older sister, Uncle?
- Have you really seen my younger sister?

313
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,420
Think about it carefully.
Where you saw her.

314
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,630
Ah, younger sister.

315
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,742
I think it's one of
the deceased I was in

316
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:52,080
charge of, but I'm not
sure about that either.

317
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,110
This girl reincarnated? When?

318
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,205
I told you I'm not sure. Do
you know how many people

319
00:28:57,217 --> 00:29:00,090
I've taken? How could I
remember all their faces?

320
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,260
It just seemed like I saw her before,
so I am making that assumption.

321
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,760
I don't have memories, only feelings exist.

322
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,870
It was just really sad.

323
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,200
My heart ached.

324
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Uncles, I got it. I think I know.

325
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,075
What if Uncle down the hall is a
reincarnation of your younger sister?

326
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:28,040
Uncle down the hall, try call him
Orabeoni (OLDER BROTHER) once.

327
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,120
- I'll kill you.
- I'll kill you.

328
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,140
O...

329
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,790
Orabeo...

330
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,720
Sunbaenim, have you heard?

331
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,220
About Kim Cha Sae from Jangamdong?

332
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,230
What about Kim Cha Sae from Jangamdong?

333
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,850
He went to get the deceased, but it turned
out to be his wife in his former life.

334
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,800
So he classified her as a miscellaneously
omitted and they ran off together.

335
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,290
- And then what?
- That's all.

336
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,050
I don't know what happened after that.
They probably got caught though.

337
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,480
How did he remember his past life?

338
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,460
I don't know. That's
why everyone is uneasy

339
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,600
these days. I drink every
day these days, too.

340
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,332
You only end up being filled
with thoughts. They say if you

341
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:28,320
commit a huge crime in your past
life, you become a grim reaper.

342
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,530
What wrongdoing did I commit in my previous
life, and how bad would it have been?

343
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:34,450
Could it be that my memory was wiped
so that I wouldn't be agonized by it?

344
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,360
That I should repent my past
wrongdoing by doing this kind of work?

345
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,760
It must be a consideration
on the part of God.

346
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,130
If you remember, you do.
If you don't, you don't.

347
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,320
It should be all God's intention. However,
to give back someone's lost memories,

348
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,250
I'm curious to what God's intention is.

349
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,640
In many ways...

350
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,560
Joon Yeong!

351
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,070
Mom!

352
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,120
Was it fun?

353
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,190
What shall we eat?

354
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,070
I'm leaving.

355
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,130
Drink alcohol in moderation.

356
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,060
Work hard.

357
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,750
Mom. Where is this place?

358
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,990
I think it's a tea place.

359
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,780
Ah. What are we going to drink?
What are you going to order, Mom?

360
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,140
Mom ordered Heaven.

361
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,330
To give to Joon Yeong.

362
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,670
Heaven?

363
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,800
The Heaven that you have
ordered has come out.

364
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,960
Thank you.

365
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,380
Mom. Why are you crying?

366
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:47,404

367
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,910
- What are you doing?
- You surprised me!!

368
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,770
What are you doing here right now?

369
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,620
I was on my way to the library.

370
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,340
How about you? Do you know this house?

371
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,250
Who are you?

372
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,500
Stay out of my way for a sec.

373
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,620
Open the window, let some fresh
air in, and button up your shirt.

374
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,910
You'll need this.

375
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,460
Let's go.

376
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,730
Daddy!

377
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,160
How did you get here?

378
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,470
I called a taxi and showed
the address to the driver.

379
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,320
It cost $5.20.

380
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,930
I want to go to this place.

381
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,010
I know where it is! Wear your safety belt.

382
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,040
- Daddy, I'm hungry.
- Huh?

383
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,900
Here you go.

384
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,190
Daddy, I missed you.

385
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,900
Me too.

386
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,870
Today too... you were a little cool.

387
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,420
Sometimes the parents, the
children, or the siblings

388
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,750
become the guardian guards for each other.

389
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,160
I merely gave him the sandwich.

390
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,850
It was his daughter who saved him, not me.

391
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,400
That's cool as well.

392
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,450
The price of a sandwich is no joke.

393
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,320
It's a good thing that President
Yoo earns good money.

394
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,630
By the way, about the sword,

395
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,990
why did it suddenly move?

396
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,250
When I wasn't even able
to grab it before? Right?

397
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,520
<i>Shouldn't there be something more
powerful than the sign on the back?</i>

398
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,290
<i>For example, real love?</i>

399
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,910
Hey, don't you have anything to tell me?

400
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,920
- No, I don't.
- I'm sure you do.

401
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,220
- Ohh, that? There is one thing.
- See?

402
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,456
You do have something to say.
Don't hold back and

403
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:31,500
say it. It's so apparent, so tell me.
It's ok.

404
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,772
Whatever you say, you
know that I'm the kind of

405
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,850
person who will accept
it without judgement.

406
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,680
I know that you're rich,

407
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,790
but are you alright with just
being at home all the time?

408
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,050
That's what you wanted to say?

409
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,180
All you did was serve the country
during the Koryeo Dynasty, right?

410
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,360
Hey, are you done with talking?
I've had jobs, too!

411
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,800
It won't be eternal,

412
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,810
but it'll keep you from being
drunk for a very long time.

413
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,190
It won't be eternal,

414
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,200
but it will be fragrant
for a very long time.

415
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,340
It won't be eternal, but it will
be useful for a very long time.

416
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,290
But why are you speaking very informally?

417
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm sorry dear customer.

418
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,950
- Mr. Yoo Jae Shin! - I'm sorry
(SAID IN INFORMALY) - Hey!

419
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,420
I'm sorry about that too. (INFORMALLY)

420
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,000
That's why you've always been home.
Because you got nothing. (EARN MUCH)

421
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,750
Got nothing? What do you mean?

422
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,940
What do you think it means?
It means you're lacking.

423
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,866
It's my first time hearing
that kind of things being

424
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,560
said to me! It's really my first time!
Really!

425
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,367
I guess your first love never
gave you these constructive

426
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,000
criticisms. Seeing how you've
never heard it before.

427
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,660
Are you jealous right now?

428
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,540
What?! Why would I be jealous?

429
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,270
I don't even know if she was from
the Koryeo or the Joseon Dynasty.

430
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,830
When did you meet her?
During the Koryeo Dynasty?

431
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,430
The Joseon Dynasty? In the beginning
of the dynasty? The middle? The end?

432
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,230
She probably very beautiful
in a sophisticated way.

433
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,230
But you see, first love
usually never works out.

434
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,870
Go back home. And don't wait for me

435
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,010
since I'll be late.

436
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,680
Who says it doesn't come true?

437
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,040
I don't like it...

438
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,520
Hey, why would you respond to my
"Hey" by saying "Ho"? (YA-HO=HOORAY)

439
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,530
Don't you find it funny?
All of us found it funny.

440
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,190
It's lame.

441
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,780
By the way...

442
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,730
your birthmark has faded a lot.

443
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,820
Really? Could it because I'm getting older?

444
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,990
But why do you keep spending money to buy
this for me when I can't even drink it?

445
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,550
It's a waste of money.

446
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,100
Who else would take care of
you by getting you coffee?

447
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,880
Did your national exam go well?

448
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,890
Yes, of course.

449
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,930
That's why you should tell
me before it's too late.

450
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,290
Other ghosts

451
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,022
are so enthusiastic about
asking me to listen

452
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,580
to their stories and
remove their sorrow.

453
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,150
But why do you not ask me for anything?

454
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,410
I won't be able to come here
often once I get into college.

455
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,310
Then, can you come here
just once to see me?

456
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,230
With some pretty flowers?

457
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,500
I'm in Paju.

458
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,140
Yes, I'll come.

459
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,840
But... how did you die?

460
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,070
While on my way to the graduation ceremony

461
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,000
from a car accident...

462
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,130
Anyway, I'll be waiting for you!

463
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,030
I wonder what her story is.

464
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,500
Welcome!

465
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,090
How do you keep finding out where I am?

466
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,230
It was me who was more surprised. Why do
have to happen to be here of all places?

467
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,240
I heard that the number of
chicken restaurants in Korea is

468
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:09,210
greater than the number of
McDonalds in the entire world,

469
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,270
so why does it have to be <i>this</i> place?

470
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,000
Because it's the chicken restaurant
that Mister Goblin found for me.

471
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,140
As always, he's never helpful to my life.

472
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,740
What is it now?

473
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,970
Why do you keep showing up randomly
like this and making my heart drop?

474
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,357
Why do you think I came
to a chicken restaurant?

475
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:27,740
It's to buy some chickens.
Get me some chickens.

476
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,380
Stop talking nonsense. I
know that you're vegetarian.

477
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,700
Even though you know that,
give me some chicken.

478
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,180
That one! With lots of radishes.

479
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,440
Seriously?

480
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,720
Is this a meeting that
had been pre-arranged?

481
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,280
The scene of that pre-arranged meeting,

482
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,450
did I come upon it? Very coincidentally?

483
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,170
Hey, what are you doing?! You're not
allowed to touch this hat so carelessly!

484
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,860
You're not supposed to be seen
by people so carelessly either!

485
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,810
Go there and remain silent in that corner.

486
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,810
Then, I can give you an extra drumstick.

487
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,530
Welcome!

488
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,560
Have you been well?

489
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,960
Sit wherever you'd like.

490
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,100
Please sit down. What
would you like to eat?

491
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,850
I've been thinking that we could
have some chicken for dinner today?

492
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,870
Don't you feel like you want to have
chicken for dinner for some reason?

493
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,020
There is no other way but to
have chicken for today's dinner.

494
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,180
I'm sorry for being egoistic,

495
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,550
- but today's dinner should be chic...
- Shut up. ("SHUT" SOUNDS LIKE CHICKEN)

496
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,920
Mr Reaper, come see me for a sec.

497
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,660
Go ahead and eat first. I'll be
back before the crusts cool down.

498
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,770
Oh, I'll just go back to noth...

499
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,250
Why do you keep coming to my restaurant?

500
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,720
It wouldn't be because of me.

501
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,400
By any chance, is it because of my boss?

502
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,200
It's nothing like that. Only, I'm
just going there to see her.

503
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,400
As long as you don't reveal my identity,

504
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,000
I think everyone can be at peace.

505
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,590
Just worry about yourself
not saying anything.

506
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,610
The fact that Tae-Hee oppa came to my
part-time work and smiled brightly at me

507
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,250
and that he took two orders when
he left is a secret between us.

508
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,300
Secret?!

509
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,840
He came to see you at your part-time work?
And he smiled brightly at you?

510
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,400
Let's say that smiling brightly at you
is something that should be kept secret.

511
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,620
But why is getting some to go a secret? Be
honest. How many coupons did you give him?

512
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,090
Hey, you be quiet. How many
times did that punk come by?

513
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,220
Let's say that he came by five times. Then
how many coupons should he ideally get?

514
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,560
I told you to be quiet!

515
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,740
Hey, do you know thanks to whom
he's such a great baseball player?

516
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,440
It's all thanks to me who used to be
his guardian god a long time ago.

517
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,020
You don't know anything and what?!

518
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,458
Let's say that's true.
But do you really think

519
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,950
you should take all the
credits for his success?

520
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,977
It's all due to my first
love's strong persistence.

521
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:02,510
Don't you know about
human persistence?

522
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,000
Look at me! I eventually
managed to grab your sword!

523
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,870
- Let's see if I let you become pretty or not.
- Hey, hey.

524
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,220
Tell me how the untimely
death system works.

525
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,960
I'll try to figure it out somehow if
you just tell me the basic principles.

526
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,470
And I'll resolve the chicken
coupon problem for you.

527
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,491
- Why would I ask for
your help when I know a

528
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:24,360
- faster way to resolve it? Eun Tak!
- Hey.

529
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,870
- Ji Eun Tak!
- Wow!

530
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,500
<i>I'm tell you, someone put back
the piano without being noticed!</i>

531
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,393
<i>How could someone put
something back so large and</i>

532
00:43:40,405 --> 00:43:42,120
<i>not even be noticed by
any of the neighbors?</i>

533
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,680
<i>It's like a ghost did it. It's so weird.</i>

534
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,580
Hey, Ji Eun Tak.

535
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,620
You have a second, right? There's
something I'm curious about.

536
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,030
Did you do well on your national exam?

537
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,970
You could say that... Why?

538
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,230
I guess you did really well on it.
That's annoying.

539
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,120
You must have done well,
too, since you're smart.

540
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,500
But you don't even take extra lessons
outside of school. That's cool of you.

541
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,350
- Are you being sarcastic?
- I'm actually being sincere.

542
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,730
Which universities did you apply to
as early action? In case we overlap.

543
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,078
Even if it's to the same
universities, we wouldn't

544
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,450
overlap since I'm a social
consideration candidate.

545
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,710
So... are you getting accepted?

546
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,110
What are you talking about?

547
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,790
I heard you can see ghosts. Don't
ghosts tell you things like that?

548
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,460
I'm also curious as to whether
I'm going to be accepted or not.

549
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,940
So that's what you were curious about.

550
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,700
But I like that you're direct
instead of talking behind my back.

551
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,300
I can't help suppressing
my curiosity by nature.

552
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,170
That must why you are good at studying.

553
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,490
I just see them, they
don't tell me anything.

554
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,150
I'll be going now.

555
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,740
For 3 years we were in the same class.

556
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,750
We had a 3-years worth of
conversation all in one day.

557
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,450
You have your interview for Seo-Un
University tomorrow, don't you?

558
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,260
Good luck with it.

559
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,520
Y-you too.

Ohh, my scarf!

Be careful, there's someone behind you.

583
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,090
I'm sorry.

584
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,910
I was going to avoid bumping into them.

585
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,360
Your eyes are really big and clear,
so everything gets reflected! Really!

586
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,070
Yeah, alright, so get on the bus.

<i>A pickpocket! He's a thief!</i>

588
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,680
Why you? You weren't in that scene...

589
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,610
What did you say?

590
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:44,220
My mom will kill me this time if I
do badly on my interview again.

591
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,310
I wish there was an accident instead.

592
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,020
Hey, don't say things like that. They
say be careful what you wish for.

593
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,590
Whether I die by my mom's
hands or in an accident,

594
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,290
people all die anyway.

595
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,400
Hah!

596
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,720
Oh, this is so tiring so early morning!

597
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,990
Please have some coffee.

598
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,660
Hey, it's me who said was feeling tired.
Why do you only give him coffee?

599
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,150
I told him not to get one for you.

600
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,060
- Are you still mad at me?
- Who says that I am mad?

601
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,070
Everyone says so that you're still mad.

602
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,240
As long as you know.

603
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,710
There are people that I don't recognize.

604
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,030
Even those from Han-Nam area volunteered.

605
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,360
It seems like it is indeed a huge accident.

606
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,320
I heard that even the volunteering team
each got five sheets. But you have a lot.

607
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,960
It's my jurisdiction.

608
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,290
Hyeon-Jeong Kim, Age 34.

609
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:56,530
Su-bin Park, Age 2, Accident.

610
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,080
It seems like it's mom and child.

611
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,960
I guess I'll have to
prepare a Heaven again.

612
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,790
Pardon?

614
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,260
Why don't you close up early and go home?

615
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,530
I haven't even started selling
yet you want me to close up?

616
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,840
I mean, what are you talking about?

617
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,220
It means that I'm going to
buy everything you have.

618
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,060
Why are you so impatient?

619
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,320
Do you even know what these are?

620
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,570
They're socks. So how about it?
Will you agree to it?

621
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,120
...

622
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,860
This crazy bastard!

623
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,690
You're that bastard from the
bus stop the other day, right?

624
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,580
Who are you to keep following me?

625
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,820
Who do you think I might be?

626
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,670
The money you stole is only $23, $32,

627
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,280
$10, and three vouchers.

628
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,050
Do you how many people could have
been dead today because of this?

629
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,170
What are you? A cop?

630
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,279
The owner of this wallet
you just pick-pocketed

631
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,500
from will have to be
hospitalized for three weeks.

632
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,538
He will go to work without even
wearing a cast because he'd be

633
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,470
fired if he missed three weeks of work.
All because of you.

634
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,660
What the hell are you talking about?
Is this wallet yours by any chance?

635
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,402
He'll have to use his salary as his
hospital fee, and his not wearing

636
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,050
a cast will cause him to get a shock
later in life. Because of you.

637
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,820
Shut up if you don't want to die.

638
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,170
I'm asking who you are, you bastard.

639
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,770
I don't like letting someone like you live,

640
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,454
but it would be a side-effect
of my intervening in the

641
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,100
life and death of human
beings, so just go on living.

642
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,270
Don't think that you've received
enough punishment by this encounter.

643
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,110
You're going to be punished
again even after your death.

644
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:57,570
However, an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth. This is my method.

645
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,220
It will hurt a bit. Bear it.

646
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:11,640
Ouch, ouch... ouch.

647
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,960
Get ready. Today's task will start soon.

648
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,390
Yes, yes.

649
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,930
The bus in question is approaching now.

650
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,390
Oh, it's Mr. Reaper!

651
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,070
Did that girl just see you?

652
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,600
Is she really seeing us right now?

653
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,010
Some of the people confronting their
imminent death can be like that.

654
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,540
I feel sorry that she's so young.

655
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,430
Why is she there?

656
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,740
Does anyone have Ji Eun Tak on their list?

657
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,360
Who are you talking about?

658
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,640
That's true.

659
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,259
There's an extra person
on the bus who's not

660
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:13,720
listed. Wasn't everyone
supposed to die?

661
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,230
Wait a sec, what happens
if one is left out?

662
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,940
I don't think any accident will take
place today. We came here for nothing.

663
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,720
What? Why?!

664
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,180
Ohh, the bus is not supposed to
just continue going like that!

665
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,925
It shouldn't be moving normally.
There's supposed to be

666
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:38,600
an accident happening right now!
It's leaving safely!

667
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,000
What should we do? Don't we
have to cause an accident then?

668
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,060
The bus... just went...
without anyone dying.

669
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,560
This never happened during my 300
year long career of a Reaper.

670
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,080
Seriously. What should we do?

671
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,610
It's my first time witnessing the coming to
existence of Miscellaneous Ommitted People.

672
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,540
This is indeed a miracle!

673
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,540
Miracles do happen...

674
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,030
- Wow.
- "Wow"?

675
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,990
Do you know how much paper
work this miracle entails??

676
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,710
What should I do with this little thing!

677
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,300
I'm sorry, sir. I was just very amazed.

678
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,000
But how did you predict this?

679
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,330
What a scare!

680
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:29,400
I-I think it's a Goblin.

681
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,060
Why? Don't I look like one?

682
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,100
Let's have a conversation.

683
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,970
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why do you keep on interfering with human lives?

684
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,390
Ji Eun Tak nearly died today.

685
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,650
If that's that child's fate,
it cannot be avoided.

686
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,500
Says who?

687
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,760
The only thing I cannot
grant is my own death.

688
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,550
Do you want to see me interfere with
every human life for that child?

689
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,700
You! In someone else's workplace...

690
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,120
But... the accident was strange,
regardless of how I think about it.

691
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,180
A few days ago, I already saw the accident.

692
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,420
But Eun Tak wasn't there. I also saw
that child's future 10 years from now.

693
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,630
But this was an accident that
would have definitely killed her.

694
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,770
It is because that accident that
you saw wasn't part of her fate.

695
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:20,150
She only got into that
accident as a variable.

696
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,280
Because you were going to save her.

697
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,190
Oh, thanks to the Miscellaneous Omitted
Person whose boyfriend is a Goblin,

698

to die ended up living.

You made me have to work overtime.

700
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,130
Would you like to eat some
chicken for midnight snack?

701
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:38,350
Have you really not had any
thoughts of turning into ashes?

702
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,610
It was a joke. Don't
take it that seriously.

703
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:51,050
I'm wondering what exactly it
means to turn into ashes...

704
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:55,060
Is it like dispersing
as dust, wind, or rain?

705
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,550
To somewhere in the world?

706
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:02,240
Why do you even wonder? The Miscellaneously
Omitted can't even grab the sword.

707
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,500
Eun Tak... grabbed the sword.

708
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,620
The sword even moved, so I...

709
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,900
I almost killed that child.

710
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,410
It hurt so much.

711
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,440
It was first time I felt that kind of pain.

712
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,120
Don't you think you should
tell her the truth now?

713
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,530
About what will happen when
the sword is taken out?

714
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,150
No.

715
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,720
If possible I want to hide
it, for about 80 more years.

716
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,710
- Why?
- That's a human lifespan exactly.

717
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,370
That is the maximum years a
19 year old can live to be.

718
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,340
I want to do that.

719
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,500
But will that happen?

720
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,110
Will it not be possible?

out just so that I would be comfortable.

did you decide to start
selling socks from today on?

I was surprised that you
were the first to call me.

Especially because you called me ten times.

wanted to tell you when I was working late.

said it had to be that name.

01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:44,880
<i>I love you</i>

851
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,340
<i>Therefore, I'm keeping a secret</i>

852
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,100
<i>and asking a higher
power for its permission</i>

853
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,830
<i>For another day</i>

854
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,820
<i>so that you don't know about
it even for another day,</i>

855
01:11:59,832 --> 01:12:01,290
<i>so that yo don't know about
it just for a hundred years</i>

856
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:53,450
You know me, right? There are some
things that I should let you know.

857
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,690
You have some time, don't you?

858
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:58,480
Be quick, will you?

859
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,650
I'm not in the right mood to
face a Goddess at the moment

860
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:10,380
Something went wrong...

861
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,650
Probably

862
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,570
everything started from you.

863
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:29,470
Where on earth did he go?

864
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,580
That's why I told him to
let me know before leaving

865
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:38,090
although he could appear without telling me

866
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,320
What are you curious about?

867
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,450
Oh, yes.

868
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,840
I think I already told you once.

869
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:54,561
You'll have to prepared
for me to leave to a

870
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:56,390
place that's further away
once the bride appears

871
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,090
There's something that
I'm feeling weird about.

872
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,370
About the sword in Mister Goblin's heart,

873
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,920
What will precisely happen

874
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,130
when the sword gets pulled out?

875
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,700
He kept mentioning that he
was going to go somewhere

876
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:15,440
<i>So you're not leaving anymore? For now.</i>

877
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,340
<i>I might have to prepare to
leave for a place further away.</i>

878
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,680
Where is that place he referred to?

879
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,990
Get that sword pulled out
of you as soon as you can

880
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,310
Get it pulled out and disappear

881
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:42,790
You appeared out of nowhere, and the first
thing you're telling me is to die...

882
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,290
You should at least me explain your reasons

883
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:47,820
You've lived enough.

884
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:50,450
But that's not the case for that kid.

885
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,230
I was really happy when I found
out her identity. Therefore, just

886
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,090
brings things to an end right now.

887
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,160
It's so enigmatic.

888
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,590
I don't know what decision
you're talking about, and

889
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,820
when I was first born

890
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,710
You marked me.

891
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,850
Aren't I your child?

892
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:17,000
That's why I'm telling you all this.

893
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,900
For my kid whom I wanted to be happy

894
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,810
It's something you'd want the most.

895
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,040
What do I want? / You
want that kid to live.

896
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,290
If you don't die,

897
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,090
Eun-Tak will die.

898
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,730
What you're saying is that

899
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,030
it's because he wants to die

900
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,800
that he asked me to become his bride

901
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:48,510
and pull out that sword?

902
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,240
So,

903
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:00,200
if I pull out that sword,

904
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,050
he will die?

905
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,250
That is,

906
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:16,110
if I pull out that sword,

907
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,050
he will disappear?

908
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,160
From this world? Forever?

909
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:38,960
Ever since she was born, she's been
fated to pull out that sword for you.

910
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,140
To be more precise, you caused
her to be born with that fate

911
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,440
If she fails to execute her task as a tool,
the reason for her existence will disappear

912
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:52,170
because then there won't be any
reason why she should exist

913
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,520
Therefore, if she doesn't
pull the sword out,

914
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,950
she will keep facing death

915
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,310
I'm assuming that she's already
confronted death multiple times

916
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,390
You're thinking right, those accidents.

917
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,790
There will be more in the future.

918
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:19,230
Those accidents will be take place more
frequently, and they'll be more intense.

919
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,940
Even you almost killed her

920
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,480
with your own hands

921
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,450
<i>It's moving!</i>

922
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,100
One day after living one
hundred years like that,

923
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,450
When the day is good enough,

924
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,380
there came first love.

925
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:57,880
Please let me be able to confess

926
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,320
I'm seeking

927
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:04,610
the permission of the sky.

928
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:24,000
♫ <i>Where are you, who I am</i> ♫

929
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,320
