00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,830
So, if that sword is removed

3
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,080
Ajusshi will disappear,

4
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,750
from this world, completely?

5
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,640
End the goblin's immortality
and make him cease to exist.

6
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,680
That is the Goblin's Bride's fate.

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,160
Even you almost killed her once

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,610
with your own hands.

9
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,080
It's moving

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,260
The moment you pull the sword out

11
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,160
he will go to be dust and wind.

12
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:25,380
This world... to another
world somewhere, forever.

13
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,960
This is not your fault
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,900
If you are thinking that we are accomplices
or on the same side, then I feel wronged.

15
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,250
The one who did not say was Kim
Shin and I just replies sincerely.

16
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,230
And this moment that I am talking
to you, I am on your side.

17
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,670
Thank you for telling me. Please rest.

18
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,570
This place too...

19
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,400
was not my home either.

20
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,060
This lifetime

21
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,100
I must not have a home.

22
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,700
Let's go Buckwheat. Let's go.

Episode 9
Han Mi Stationary Store

24
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,580
Excuse me.

25
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,330
It's been a long time. Would
you like to have a drink?

26
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,850
I am so angry right now.

27
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,760
Alcohol... will you be buying?

28
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,330
I don't have a card these days.

29
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,960
I, who have lived a hundred years.
On a day that's just right

30
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,160
it was first love.

31
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:39,160
So that I could confess. So
that the heavens would permit

32
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,190
I am asking.

33
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,680
The last word you leave is?

34
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,380
All the time I have spent with you

35
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,550
were all blindingly bright.

36
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,890
Because the day was good,
because the day was not good

37
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,410
because the day was just right.

38
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,340
All the days were good.

39
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,080
And also, whatever happens...

40
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,720
It is not your fault.

41
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,510
That was a parting greeting?

42
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,890
Seriously... should I kill you?

44
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,390
That day Miscellaneous Omitted Person...

45
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,600
walked for a long time in someone's tears.

46
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,250
If possible, for the Goblin's
death to be as far as possible

47
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,680
She's not here. She hasn't come
back and I can't call her.

48
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
I think she ran away.

49
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,850
That is...

50
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,360
Her bags are not here and even Mr.
Buckwheat.

51
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,160
That is...

52
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,910
What is Mr. Buckwheat?

53
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,760
Sh'es not on the beach too.

54
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,400
She didn't go to school either.

55
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,100
She's not near the door in the library that
she followed me through Canada through.

56
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,340
Not even near the park where she
summoned me the second time.

57
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,510
The ghost who has seen Ji Eun Tak.

58
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,340
Where is that store that you
always bought chicken from?

59
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,680
The chicken store that Ji Eun Tak works.
Even the ghosts don't know her whereabouts.

60
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,520
You bring this along with you?

61
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,950
I thought you would be looking for her.

62
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,520
The true culprit is me.
I told her everything.

63
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,210
What?

64
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,730
Did you perhaps?

65
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,090
Yeah. If she pulls out
the sword you would die.

66
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,220
I told her everything.

67
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,380
Are you crazy? Why would you tell her?
You told me never to tell her!

68
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,925
I did... but this time,
as expected I am on the

69
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,280
same side with Miscellaneous
Omitted Person.

70
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,490
What kind of meddling is that? On
what are you on the same side?

71
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,390
You dying... I don't want that.

72
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,380
There's no other meaning to that.

73
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,780
It's just that if you return to
nothingness, it would be boring.

74
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,950
You can get mad.

75
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,360
How could I get mad? How?

76
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,590
The one who wants me to die
is telling me not to die.

77
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,380
I get no guarantee on getting
pickled radishes either.

78
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,670
If you would refrain from using those
coupons, then I would be thank-

79
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,120
Oh no... a friendship really formed.

80
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,220
Looking for a part-time worker.

81
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,470
Don't contact me from now on.

82
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,780
Don't greet me even if we meet.

83
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,070
Happy New Year.

84
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,960

85
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,230
Orabeoni (BIG BROTHER).

86
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,170
Why are you looking into my store?

87
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,830
Perhaps... are you applying
for a part-time job?

88
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,650
That's not it. I am in the middle of
searching for the part-time worker here.

89
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,490
2500?

90
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,220
Clothes, watch, shoes. From head to
toe, you are dressed in a total of 2500

91
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,291
what would a person like
that need to be looking

92
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,130
for my part-time worker
who earns 6300 won?

93
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,320
Perhaps is the one who made her cry, you?

94
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,230
Are you him who made her conscious while
eating and works for the country?

95
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,960
Did she cry?

96
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,620
So it's you. The one who
cut my part-time worker.

97
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,850
This is totally adding up to me.

98
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,850
Are you perhaps a married man? Is that
why you just let her go like that?

99
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,770
I'm not married but I have a bride
so your judgment isn't wrong.

100
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,290
Then, let's meet again.

101
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,900
I think the complicated ill
fate is not only with me.

102
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,390
Look here.

103
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,380
Look here! Orabeoni (BIG BROTHER)!

104
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,800
You didn't find her?

105
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,250
You said you didn't turn in Eun Tak's
papers, right? Turn the papers in for now.

106
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,100
What documents?

107
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,890
Miscellaneous Omitted Person documents.

108
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,200
The documents need to be there for
the date of her death to be set.

109
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,140
You are hoping for the child to die are you!

110
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,220
I need to know where or how she
would die for you or me to go.

111
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,350
What do you mean?

112
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,690
Why would Miscellaneous Omitted Person die?
I don't even have the desire.

113
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,560
There must be another reason.
What on earth are we?

114
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,830
How could both a Goblin and Grim Reaper be
together but can't even save one child.

115
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,020
I will get the documents.

116
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:31,790
But then... during that while,
what if something happens?

117
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,620
Go and come back. If something happens,
I would be able to feel something.

118
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,670
If at that crucial moment the person that
she would be looking for is me, that is.

119
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,700
These are the documents for
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

120
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,300
Process it as fast as possible.
It's an urgent one.

121
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,270
Tomorrow afternoon.

122
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,410
That's late.

123
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,030
Today afternoon.

125
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,290
Ji Eun Tak?

126
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,140
Isn't she the one, whose name you
were looking for at the bus station?

127
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,570
Who is she?

128
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,830
Goblin's bride.

129
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,210
What? This person... really?

130
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,290
Ah, so is that why the
Goblin was there that time?

131
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,850
Get your sandwich, eat it,
while eating it realise

132
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,440
"Ah, my flattery was excessive.
Let's shut up." Start.

133
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay.

134
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,290
Those people don't live here,
they moved out a long time ago.

135
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,570
Aigoo, what a nuisance. How
much debt do they owe?

136
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,160
Sorry.

137
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,750
Where does this girl live?

138
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,770
Why are you looking for Ji Eun Tak?

139
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,136
Her exam results arrived,
but Eun Tak doesn't

140
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,900
come to school anymore,
I'm the class president.

141
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,630
Ajusshi, who are you? How
do you know Ji Eun Tak?

142
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,150
(I KNOW HER) well.

143
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,670
I'll hand this to her. Well.

Is these grades good or what?

147
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,800
What?

148
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,630
Ah... yes. With those grades, you
can get into a college in Seoul

149
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,130

You think it doesn't exist?

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,990
What do you want? Sorry.

155
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,620
I'm not in my right mind right now. You take
these. Grim Reaper must need to buy socks.

156
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,297
Breaking news. The bodies of
skyscrapers have been covered

157
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,700
in thick fog. Only the tops of
the building's are visible.

158
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,600
The incessant fog is also mystic
as if it's something divine.

159
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,180
Breaking news.

160
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,790
This scene that appears to be from a Sci-Fi
film, is the night sky of Seoul today.

161
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,400
Between the buildings the
super moon is shinning high.

162
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,360
With the giant fog and the
purple moon now...

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,710
The citizens cannot hide their concern.

164
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,670
Quickly draw out that sword.

165
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,290
Draw that sword, and go into nothingness.

166
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,690
If you don't go into
nothingness, Eun Tak will die.

167
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,680
If I... make that choice,

168
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,130
you have to be ready with an excuse.

169
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,810

of death, excessive blood loss.

Ah, hot!

175
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,680
Father?

176
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,200
A-

177
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,770
Father?

178
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,960
Oh! Father, did you come back alive,
father? You lost so much blood. This is...

179
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,310
Did you get up?

180
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,576
In front of my eyes, he just
woke up, he's alive. He

181
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,550
had excessive blood loss, but
he body colour was good.

182
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,030
The list of names just burned up.
Is this a possible event?

183
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,440
It is possible, if that's the Goblin's fire.

184
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,430
This must be yours.

185
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,380
What is this?

186
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,920
The Goblin's apology.

187
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,520
Apology?

188
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,290
It's socks...

189
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,644
Is apologising in advance enough?
You caused the trouble, so why does

190
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,120
the Grim Reaper have to do the overtime?
How dare you burn our list?

191
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,500
Has living forever made you go blind?
You two's tragic fate is unfortunate...

192
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,760
but that doesn't mean you can meddle with
a human's life, you senseless goblin!

193
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,490
I just... wanted someone to see it.

194
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,460
It would be good if the deity saw it.

195
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,060
It would be better if Eun Tak saw it.

196
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,290
If you say it like that,
what does that make me?

197
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,960
I shouldn't have said anything.

198
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,770
I should've just let the Miscellaneous
Omitted Person pull out the sword.

199
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,170
You're right. That would've been better.

200
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,590
In this world...

201
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,760
there are many weird beings that
are unexplainable with words.

202
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,140
At times, they're closer
to us than we think.

203
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,380
I think, that you already had an idea.

204
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,990
Yoo Jae Shin.

205
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,830
Sorry.

206
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,460
Eh-hey!

207
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,710
One man who doesn't age, I know one.

208
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,450
Okay...

209
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,256
The passport I made and
accommodations, I prepared

210
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,920
in Nice and making me stay
by Deok Hwa's side...

211
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,750
I believe that you gave me these
jobs to recognise on my own.

212
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:15,000
Have you by chance spoke of
that existence anywhere?

213
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,920
There is none.

214
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,580
Actually, he is the one who picked you.

215
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,180
He made a child without a dream and money,

216
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,250
take the entrance exam, gave him a dream,

217
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,480
enrolled him in a university, who do
you think is that faceless helper?

218
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,250
Remember. The person's real name is...

219
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,420
Kim-to, Shin-believe.

220
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,580
Hey, Kim Shin. The supermoon and
the fog, was you right, uncle?

221
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,480
No.. why are you creating such a
mess to find a high school girl?

222
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,080
I'm really scared that NASA
would actually take you away.

223
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,100
Did you drink alcohol?

224
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,090
Yesterday, I drank.

225
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,360
Now, I'm sober.

226
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,033
Anyways, if I do find
her, what would you do

227
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,790
for me, uncle? Will you
give me a credit card?

228
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,670
If I cant find her, how will you?

229
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,683
She wouldn't have gone far. She
has no money. She has to be

230
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:31,720
somewhere in Korea where you can go by bus.
I have my ways..

[NEWS ALERTS]

237
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,190
I found her. Right now,
she's at a ski resort.

238
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,710
What if...

239
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,360
I say I don't want to be your
bride anymore, what will happen?

240
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,500
Ah...

241
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,420
This sword won't be pulled out.

242
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,470
Only you can do it.

243
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,970
The sword needs to be pulled out...

244
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,210
I...

245
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,770
to become pretty. Right now, I'm not pretty.

246
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:44,700
You don't know, but I'm crazy
for laughing in this situation.

247
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,340
Crazy person.

248
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,720
Not today, today I'll just laugh with you.

249
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,240
When the first show comes?

250
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,780
First snow?

251
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,730
You don't need a broom then.

252
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,530
When the first snow comes.

253
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,860
There's a lot of snow.

254
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,930
Let's go home.

255
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,260
You shouldn't stay here alone.

256
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,200
I don't have a house.

257
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,850
None of the places I thought were
my home, was actually my home.

258
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,220
People just kept me close, for
some because of insurance.

259
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,250
And for some because they wanted to die.

260
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,300
I now understand it all, I'm the tool
to end the goblin's immortality, I am?

261
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,650
I missed the opportunity to tell you.

262
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,130
Because I missed the
opportunity, I was glad.

263
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,360
If possible, until the moment of death

264
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,800
I was about to lose every opportunity.

265
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,350
But I shouldn't do that.

266
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,220
The blood of thousands is on this sword.

267
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,880
The weight of a person's life

268
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,630
it should not be up to my judgement.

269
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,900
So take this sword out. I ask of you.

270
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,710
No.

271
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,930
I don't want to. I don't
want to even if I die.

272
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,680
So don't look for me. Don't look for me

273
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,930
and let's live as separate people
who don't know each other.

274
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,400
Go far from me,

275
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,290
and live for a very very long time, Mr.
Kim Shin.

276
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,010
Do you understand?

277
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,850
Don't appear again.

278
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,590
If you appear in front of my eyes again,

279
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,740

302
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,030
I was happy to have this as an excuse.

303
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,610
Even like this,

304
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,380
an excuse that I can come see you.

305
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,280
What do you want to do after seeing me?

306
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,830
What do you plan to do
after getting that excuse?

307
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,270
Live together or die together?

308
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,790
If you appear before me again,

309
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,700
did I tell you that I would kill you or not?

310
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,890
Fine, come here.

311
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,430
I will pull out the sword.

312
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,150
If that is your wish so bad then
I will pull it out for you.

350
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,440
He's asking to have it done within one hour.

351
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,800
Why isn't Chief Kim coming?

352
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,660
I'm rotating right now so
he will probably come.

353
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,280
Let's wait. - Yes.

354
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,950
Why are you alone? What about
Miscellaneous Omitted Person?

355
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,000
You didn't meet her? - I met her.

356
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,790
But she's not coming. -
What on earth happened?

357
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,910
It's my first time waiting for
a document to be processed.

358
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,390
Miscellaneous Omitted Person's roll is out.

359
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,820
Are you sure it's Eun Tak's?

360
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,500
It's empty. - There is writing.

361
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,810
What on earth is this situation?

362
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,870
It was as if someone pushed for her death.

363
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,120
That's not me.

364
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,840
And all the more not you. - It must be me.

365
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,190
I have to die for her to live.

366
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,710
If I live then she dies.

367
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,330
That is the fate of that child and me.

368
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,840
This is the punishment
that was bestowed to me.

369
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,670
God had a greater reason.

370
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,080
Don't say something so weak.
Even if it was God's will

371
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,900
but it is not mine.

372
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,730
You will also be the same.

373
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,160
One hour from now, the time of death.
You should hurry.

374
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,420
The phone is turned off.

375
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,050
This person is not able to
be reached at this time.

376
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,260
Death will constantly
come before that child.

377
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,870
She probably has encountered
it several times.

378
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,260
She will face more in the future.

379
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,970
More times than the accidents
now and more severe.

380
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,130
It's the first snow, Mister!

381
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,340
But why is the first snow so early?
It's so fascinating.

382
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,240
I wish you would continue to need me.

383
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,220
I wish you would ask that of me.

384
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,740
I wish I could use

385
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,170
permission as an excuse.

386
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,670
I need you.

387
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,390
That's all I ask of you.

388
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,240
I love you.

389
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,840
♫ See you never gone away ♫

390
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,180
♫ It will be better someday ♫

391
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,830
♫ Never far away ♫

392
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,860
Ji Eun Tak. Have you come to your senses?

393
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,280
This is the hospital.

394
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,150
You showed symptoms of
hypothermia and concussion.

395
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,660
It's a relief that you're okay.
If you were even a little

396
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:18,890
bit late, your condition
would've become dangerous.

397
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,000
Ah.

398
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,770
How long have I been in this state?

399
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,790
A day and a half.

400
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,470
Ah.

401
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,700
Then, what about the hospital fee?

402
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,510
Ah. You don't need to worry about that.

403
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,420
But, what is your relationship
with the CEO of Cheonho Group?

404
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,385
The Chairman himself came
in to admit you into the

405
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:47,140
hospital. The entire
hospital was in an uproar.

406
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,720
If you want, you can be discharged.

407
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,290
I recommend staying here for your safety...

408
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,170
I'm sorry, but

409
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,060
by chance, does anyone
have a match or lighter...

410
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,550
Pardon?

00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,930
You should've told me you were leaving...

432
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,860
I thought you weren't coming back so I...

433
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,670
I came early and waited.

434
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,040
Who told you to come early? You should
come when I blow out the candle.

435
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,940
You should've come there. You should've
appeared in front of my eyes.

436
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,540
I came here to hold your hand.

437
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,450
I don't know. Whatever.

438
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,940
Me, too.

439
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,300
What?

440
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,500
If you don't know, never mind.

441
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,060
I know it though.

442
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,220
Then that's good.

443
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,250
I... have something to confess.

444
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,220
I can't see anything else about you, Mister.

445
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,300
You're tall, your clothes look
expensive, and your eyes are amazing.

446
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,290
That's all I see. So,

447
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,100
I can't pull out the sword for you anymore.

448
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,200
I won't pull it out, even if you smile.
In my eyes,

449
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,780
you're still really pretty.

450
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,760

00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,270

♫ It's a beautiful life ♫

461
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,890
♫ Beautiful life ♫

462
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,570
His face is pale white and his lips are red.

463
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,310
He has black clothes.

464
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,390
And is holding a black hat.

465
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,470
Oh my.

466
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,090
What is it? Why?

467
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:48,020
By chance, did you exchange your names?
He's the Grim Reaper.

468
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:52,320
What did I tell you? I told you to
be careful of men with black hats!

469
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,830
Do you make enough money to eat? Do you
have any other customers besides me?

470
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:01,470
This woman, if you're wary
of men, you can't date!

471
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,200
Grim Reaper? You have to be believable
if you want to write me a talisman.

472
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,150
Then who is this man? He's very tall.

473
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,320
He seems a little older than me and
looks kind of like Gong Yoo...

474
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,433
His voice... if you listen
to him, you feel as

475
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:21,770
though you're at the smallest
cafe in the world...

476
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,420
Gong Yoo?

477
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,870
Then stay well.

478
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,570
Did you receive a sparkling
item from somewhere?

479
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,890
- How did you know that?
- Throw it away.

480
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,130
You can't take things whose
previous owners are unknown.

481
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:49,960
You don't know what's inside. There might
be the owner's crimes, sins, desires, etc.

482
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,000
What crimes, what sins,

483
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,510
and what desires would be inside this?

484
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,620
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to cause you trouble.

485
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,860
I always have to contact him first.

486
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,440
Right now?

487
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,620
Aish.

488
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,370
- Are you busy? - Yes. I'm
so busy, I'm going insane.

489
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,960
What are you doing right now?

490
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,758
I'm trying to figure out my passcode.
I want to

491
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,580
turn it off, ust in case
it makes another sound.

492
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,860
The passcode failed. Try
again in one minute.

493
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,510
(WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?)

494
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,770
(WHY AREN'T YOU TRYING TO CONTACT ME AGAIN?)

495
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,350
Oh... That's...

496
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:05,970
Firstly, because I feel sorry about
having erased your memory. Secondly,

497
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,480
Who are you, and why are you so beautiful?

498
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,830
I thought I started to have
a crush on someone else.

499
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:24,910
I'm sorry. I am also feeling very
confused about myself for being this way.

500
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,750
It seems like you've gotten a message.

501
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,160
I miss you.

502
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,470
- Me too.
- Why am I constantly like this...

503
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,670
No, I haven't heard anything.

504
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,160
I didn't hear anything, I didn't
hear anything, I didn't...

505
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:58,930
Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah

506
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,880
I know that you're there!
Come out and show yourself!

507
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,850
How dare a lowly ghost is
trying to harm a human being?

508
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,520
Come out, not get out! Get lost!

509
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,570
If you don't obey me,
I'll sing the song again!

510
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,620
Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah

511
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:18,170
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah.

512
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,370
Why are you empty-handed? What about your
luggage? Weren't you on your way home?

513
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,080
No, I was on heading to my workplace.

514
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,580
Since it's Christmas season, they pay
really well. I'm glad I didn't get fired.

515
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,512
Let's finish up what we're
supposed to do. Then,

516
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:36,150
let's buy some beef
and go to Geumweewon.

517
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,720
Until when? Until when are
you going to be here?

518
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,190
What do you mean by until when? Until all
of February's snow at the ski resort melt.

519
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,620
You can go back home first.

520
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,000
What? February?!

521
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,020
President Yu. Yes, President Yu, it's me.

522
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,520
I was going to ask you to fire
someone using your vast network.

523
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,909
Otherwise, I'm planning to
quickly melt all the snow

524
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:00,050
at the ski resort. Which
option shall I go for?

525
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,340
I'm back.

526
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,760
I'm sorry. You would have worried a lot.

527
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,353
I worred a little, this
guy's the one who worried a

528
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:14,970
lot. / The one who found out
about you was Deok Hwa.

529
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,660
And the one who got you here is me.

530
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,550
It's the first time to have a place
to return to, so I'm feeling weird.

531
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,190
It feels like this place
is now really my home.

532
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,261
This girl's starting again...
You have a sad story

533
00:55:28,273 --> 00:55:30,070
to tell each time I ask
you about something!

534
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,460
I'd feel afraid to ask
you to come back home.

535
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,290
Just wear it. You should come with me.

536
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,700
Where are you going to take my Ajuhshi?
That's something I feel sensitive about.

537
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,170
'my'... she said 'my' Ajuhshi...!!

538
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:53,020
I can hear everything, you cheesy Goblin!

539
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,320
He said he was happy that you
referred to him with the pronoun "my"

540
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,760
Follow me quickly! Leave that soup there!

541
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,530
Btw, who are you submitting this report to?

542
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,960
Are you submitting it directly to...?

543
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,198
It doesn't get handed in to that far up.
They probably created

544
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,460
our jobs because they didn't want
to read all of those reports.

545
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,450
I think they should be of
the same handwriting though

546
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,690
I'll say that it's been written with my
left hand, so just shut up and write!

547
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,370
Btw she seemed pretty - the ownder of the
chicken restaurant you visit frequently

548
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,600
You met her? You didn't tell her
anything useless by any chance, did you?

549
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,490
What I told her wasn't something
that was particularly useful.

550
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,110
You told her? That I was a Reaper?

551
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,170
You told her too! That I would disappear
to nothing once the sword gets pulled out.

552
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,150
Did you really tell her? Really?

553
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:54,170
Wow, how can you...?
You... really... you / Ohhh how...

554
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,950
How... how... someone's
coming in, coming in!

555
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:02,880
Hey there, I'm really sorry, but it's
an emergency... Could I use the toilet?

556
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,280
This is a human being, right?

557
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,540
It's not an immortal for sure... But
human beings cannot enter this place!

558
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,380
Wow

559
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,030
Please... What should I do...
It's urgent!! AAA!!!

560
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,960
Thank you, thank you. It's really urgent.

561
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,210
Wow... There is no door that a human
being's desperation can't open.

562
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,760
I can't believe it even after witnessing it.

563
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,064
You even believe in God
that's not visible. Then, why

564
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,220
can't you believe a human
being, which is visible?

565
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,092
That's called the persistency
of a human being. The power

566
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,890
that enables them to change
their destiny on their own!

567
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:37,410
How can an immortal's tea-place be
a human being's mark of territory?

568
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,980
How can I write an explanation
report for this case...!

569
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,090
Sit.

570
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,250
Write this one too, it
happened because of you!

571
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,580
You can make Deok Hwa do
it when you get home.

572
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,430
Hiring

573
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:59,090
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,550
I am Ji Eun Tak.

576
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:26,990
I lost my parents at age nine and...

577
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,650
You can ask me about anything
that you're curious about.

578
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,090
FYI, I can adjust myself so that I
can satisfy all your requirements.

579
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,230
Do you have any plan later on?

580
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,630
No. / Then, today is our
official first day together.

581
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,160
You can work here.

582
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,830
Yes! I'll take care of
everything very methodically!

583
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,530
Btw, how did you come to a better place?

584
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,730
Life has very simple explanations.
I returned my apartment-on-lease.

585
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,000
How did you find me here without
even calling me beforehand?

586
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,860
I have my own means.

587
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,430
Even ghosts would be surprised.

588
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:27,720
Are you a beggar? How can an
elementary student not even have $1?

589
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,320
You guys don't have money either!!

590
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,660
That's why I'm telling you to bring it.
Then, we would have it.

591
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,900
Don't hit me! Strong wind!!

592
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,860
This kid must be crazy.
He said 'strong wind.'

593
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,280
Your mom ran away since you
read comic books all the time.

594
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,360
Hey! You guys are being so
cowardly despite being males!

595
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,930
Come here, come and get hit yourselves too!

596
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,880
Let's go, let's go.

597
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,800
Are you ok?

598
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:07,120
Someday, you'll be able to shoot a real
strong wind. Where's your home? Is it near?

599
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:23,810
The results would have come out already...
ohh..ohh What should I do

600
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,120
I don't know.

601
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,400
Oh noo

602
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,270
Ooohh

603
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:47,090
Ohhh no oh no

604
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,100
Now, let's print out the
tuition request form!

606
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,650
I'm not joking, someone
else paid for your tuition.

607
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,700
He told me to mention his name, Shin Kim,
if you ever call me for confirmation.

608
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,260
Mr. Shin Kim? You paid my tuition?

609
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,330
Hey...

610
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,190
I beseeched them to keep it secret.

611
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:41,510
According to her, you asked her to make sure
to let me know that you had paid it for me.

612
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:45,130
She insisted on knowing my name,
so I couldn't help but tell her

613
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,957
According to her, she kept
asking you about the name

614
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:50,700
of the student, but you
kept telling her your name.

615
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,360
I'm not sure if this would be an
appropriate university acceptance gift.

616
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,120
This pretty bag...

617
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,200
It's appropriate! Wow that's great, wow!
It's appropriate!

618
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,070
I knew it would be appropriate.
Congratulations!

619
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:11,360
I really missed you! A
purse, perfume, five...

620
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,860
There's no 5 million won. I
paid your tuition with that.

621
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,060
Ahjussi...

622
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,130
Don't be too moved. I'm lending it to you.

623
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,490
I know... why did you give it to me at
first, but you're lending it to me now?

624
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,020
How could a person's heart change?

625
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,890
You're the only mortal in this house.
How can you not know that yet?

626
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,160
- Daebak...
- 5208 won per month...

627
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,990
Pay it over 80 years. You
can't miss even a month.

628
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,230
80 years?

629
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,260
Yeah, you can't pay back sooner either.

630
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,530
- What? You don't like it?
- No.

631
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,790
If you're so determined like this, I
made up my mind. I set my mind to it.

632
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,000
About what?

633
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,940
A date.

634
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,800
Dummy... when I was at the ski
resort, not my report card...

635
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,560
If you had brought this purse, I
would've came back with you right away.

636
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,990
Wow... that's exactly
what I was going to do.

637
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,890
- The Grim Reaper ahjussi stopped you, huh?
- Yeah!

638
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,780
As expected... the Grim Reaper
ahjussi saved someone's life.

639
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,230
Or I would've killed you on the spot.

640
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,780
Don't eat mine. Eat yours.

641
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,320
I ate all of mine.

642
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,610
- Don't smile and keep eating.
- Just one bite.

643
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,660
- But you know...
- What now?

644
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,090
Do these things have love
out there somewhere?

645
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:41,130
Look carefully. I tried my
best to put them in there.

646
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,191
Here is the list of gifts
you asked for that

647
01:03:49,203 --> 01:03:51,860
female highschooler or
college students prefer.

648
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,730
BTS?

649
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,530
What do these boys do?

650
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,540
♫ Why do you make my heart waver?
Make my heart waver? ♫

651
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,520
Oh... they work to change people's hearts.

652
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,670
They're wavering people's
hearts quite a bit these days.

653
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:17,100
EXO? Is that an alcoholic beverage?

654
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,560
No, it's not.

655
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:24,600
♫ Growl, growl, growl. ♫

656
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,710
Being an executive assistant
is an extreme job. Yeah...

657
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,120
I enjoy my job very much.

658
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,800
I'll choose number three for the gift.

659
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,950
Oh...

660
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:43,790
I know what digital camera is.

661
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,460
Dear Ji Eun Tak, you worked hard.

662
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,560
I hope each moment is remembered forever.

663
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,890
From Yoo Shin Woo

664
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,720
- Oh, you scared me!
- Aigoo, he scared me.

665
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,890
Since when were you standing here?

666
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,370
Why are you so shocked? Did
you do something wrong?

667
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,830
I was surprised by my face.

668
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,300
I'm handsome, huh? I'm too much...
too much...

669
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,260
You said you don't even have any money.
What's with the camera?

670
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,130
Ah, it's yours.

671
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,700
Why is that mine?

672
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,240
A gift from my grandpa. My
selfie if my gift to you.

673
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,160
Really?

674
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,700
I'm so touched.

675
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,651
The only gift I ever
received was a building. You

676
01:05:40,663 --> 01:05:43,330
must be so happy to
receive a digital camera.

677
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:47,800
Please tell the Chairman
I'm so, so grateful.

678
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,900
Please give me my camera.

679
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,260
Give me ten minutes.

680
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,980
- Give it back.
- Five minutes.

681
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,130
- Give it back - Fi-, Five Minuites.

682
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,400
Ah, give it!

683
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,260
Three minutes.

684
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,660
Give it now!

685
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,230
Three minutes.

686
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:05,940
Give it!

687
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,970
Three, Three. Oh it's the goblin!

688
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:16,590
If there's kids in a house, it
really does make the house livelier.

689
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,520
I would've told you if I did.

690
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,260
Anyway I was curious. What will you do now?

691
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,940
Do you remember that man who barged
into your tea room, one time?

692
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,450
How could I forget him? But why?

693
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:41,030
A human's desperation can open any door.

694
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:46,500
Maybe that one door opens in a way, that
could be a variable in the deity's plan.

695
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:51,640
So I plan to start searching, desperately.

696
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,360
What door do I need to open,
to change the deity's plans?

697
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:01,355
It might take 100 years, or
10 months, I don't know, but

698
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:04,850
for now I have decided to
stay by that child's side.

699
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:10,440
And then I might be able to open a door.

700
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,600
I just hope it's not the room to my door.

701
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,370
But why would a deity be
involved in a human's passings.

702
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,480
Why is the reason for the deity to do that?

703
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,310
I was feeling reay touched right then.

704
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,220
Uncles!

705
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,780
Me too! Me too!

706
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,430
Me too, me too, me too!

707
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,880
Now... are you ready to take it?

708
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,300
Why are you here? Just the two...

709
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,150
I don't want to! I sat here first.

710
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,040
I'm going to take it.

711
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,260
Ah.

713
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:07,520
I have a question, I'll move if you answer.

714
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,160
Ah, what is it now?

715
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,701
Backing out suddenly
while driving, solving

716
01:08:13,713 --> 01:08:15,440
math problems writing
with mechanical pencil...

717
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,150
Smiling when she talks.

718
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,080
Keeping off the roads away from the cars

719
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,090
Our boss, you'll never know what she wants.

720
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:23,300
Be ready for anything.

721
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,240
What are you doing since then?
After calling 100 times...

722
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,260
It's dangerous, so I want you to
walk on the inside of the pavement.

723
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,360
By acting that awkwardly?

724
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,620
You had something to say, so say
it first since I'm curious.

725
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,020
I have no religion.

726
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,500
What?

727
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,600
Why does he talk so well?

728
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,140
By any chance, do you have a religion?

729
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,420
Where you still thinking
about that until now?

730
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,950
I didn't get to tell you last time.

731
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,060
Why have you been smiling so much since?

732
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,950
Me? What? Does my makeup look weird?

733
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,260
Don't you think I'm cute?

734
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,380
Where? Why didn't you meet me on Christmas?

735
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:18,190
You would have been cute that if you
came that day. What did you do?

736
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,000
You wouldn't have a gone to a church.

737
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,320
Christmas is a bit... you know.

738
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,220
It's someone's birthday, it would
be wrong to go against it.

739
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:33,420
But, I said I have no religion, do
you seriously think I'm not cute?

740
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,810
Ah, goosebumps...

741
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:38,020
Did you have to go that far?

742
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,320
No, it's deja vu.

743
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,940
I remember this from before.
It's so fresh in my mind.

744
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,120
Ah, I got goosebumps!

745
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,140
You didn't have to walk me.

746
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,510
Why are you telling me that
now that we're already here?

747
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:58,890
See you.

748
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,720
Oh! It's the grim reaper!

749
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:07,790
Most of our sales come from that
person's pocket. Unlike someone else...

750
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,290
How much is fried chicken? I
could buy the whole shop.

751
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:15,240
Eh... you're scared of chicken
blood, I read up all on goblins.

752
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,650
I'm not scared of it, I just
like to keep a distance from it.

753
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:22,680
Wait... Is that why you got me a job
at chicken shop in the first place?

754
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,410
To keep away from me?

755
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,110
Ah, that was a while ago...

756
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:31,400
So it's true? Is that what you wanted,
I didn't even know that. Enough now...

757
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,931
I know so you can go now.
I will live over there

758
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:36,070
for 1000 years, don't
come looking for me

759
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,780
Coward!

760
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,330
What? What did you say to me?

761
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:41,920
Ah, It's the first time I've heard that been
said. It's really my first time, really!

762
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:48,690
Before people would say to me, 'Hooray!'

763
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,380
Shall I show you how brave I am?

764
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,780
Where are you going?

765
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:59,850
Our boss isn't like most other women.

766
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,810
By any chance is he the
man giving you trouble?

767
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:28,380
They can hear all.

768
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:38,850
You don't know my voice. It's isn't that
person's voice, that phone call from then?

769
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,700
They can hear all, shut up!

770
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,760
Is that so?

771
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,550
We meet again, I didn't know
that you two were friends...

772
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,300
He came to the old shop looking for you.

773
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,090
Ah, I see...

774
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:54,860
How much did you say? Not much.

775
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,270
Yeah, he didn't. So I still
don't know who he is.

776
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,190
Excuse me, but how old are you?

777
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,740
Don't ask if your excusing.

778
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,880
That's how you evade my question, huh?

779
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,020
I'm not evading. I'm flat
out denying to answer you.

780
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:12,140
You're words are so rude! Why?

781
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,860
Why is it?

782
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,480
I'm much older than I look,
I'm a quite complicated man.

783
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,211
Now, now... if you have
had enough, please

784
01:12:22,223 --> 01:12:24,740
leave. It's a time when
we get many customers.

785
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,600
I still haven't eaten yet.

786
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,080
No, you've eaten all. Now
please just go home.

787
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,930
Because of you things have gone weird!

788
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,970
Customer, you should both leave together.

789
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,700
Get up both of you, quickly!

790
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,690
No!

791
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,810
Let's see. What is X? What's X?

792
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,560
What are you doing?

793
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,950
You really don't know a lot about women.

794
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,520
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

795
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,830
Just drink your beer.

796
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,920
Excuse me, Kim Sun.

797
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,070
Two beers over here please.

798
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,140
Who?

799
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,410
Two beers.

800
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,360
Can I talk to you for a moment.
Outside, in private!

801
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,520
Ah, okay.

802
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,910
What!

803
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:51,740
What was what?

804
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:56,430
Just now, you called me Kim Sun.

805
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,630
What about that?

806
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,620
How do you know my name?

807
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:02,520
I'm sure that I never told you my real name.

808
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,510
Sorry, we didn't meet

809
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:14,130
How do you know it? Why do you know it?

810
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:20,520
I said Kim Sunny.

811
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,470
It very cold right? I'll get your coat.

812
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,290
I haven't finished talking.

813
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,740
What is this?

814
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,520
Something went wrong.

815
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,700
Maybe, it started with you,
that's what it seems like.

816
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,130
What's the matter?

817
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:07,830
Why exactly?

I was contemplating whether I should
hold your hand once more or not, Sunny.

841
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,680
Then, can you hold it today?
When I'm a year younger?

842
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,510
The history between those two...

843
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:15,780
