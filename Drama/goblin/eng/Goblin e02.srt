00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>[Lonely and Splendid Goblin]</i>

2
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:35,662
Wait.

3
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,560
But I'm not done talking.

4
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,029
Did you just come through
that door, following me?

5
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,949
But what's with this place?

6
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,329
What's going on here? Where is this really?

7
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,039
Canada.

8
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,849
Canada? That maple nation?
The aurora nation?

9
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,990
This is really abroad?

10
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,529
Amazing! You had this kind of power?

11
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,909
You do, too. What are you really?

12
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,180
If this really is Canada and if this is what
your powers can do, I've made up my mind.

13
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,939
- On what?
- I'm determined.

14
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,739
- About what?
- I'll marry you, Mister.

15
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,839
No matter how I think about this,
I really think you are a goblin.

16
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,860
I love you.

17
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,979
Look how you're acting like it's
the first time you heard it.

18
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,839
- Don't!
- Oh!

19
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,249
Look how you're not saying no outright.
Okay, let's go that way.

20
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,799
Think of it as our honeymoon.

21
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,350

Could you take a picture for me? I want

40
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,449
- If you look here, and you push this, and you hear a click...
- I know.

41
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,679
Oh, unexpected. Then, take it
after you go one, two, three.

42
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,350
I don't want to.

43
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,889
Seriously! Where are you going?

44
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,299
Hey, wait for me.

45
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,110
Maple nation, for sure.

46
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,489
Is this the place? The red carpet for me?

47
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,140
You feel honored to be
walking with me, right?

48
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,430
Good. I was nervous you might
say, "honored, my foot."

49
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,839
By the way, what's that sign?

50
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,459
Fairy sighting zone.

51
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,549
This is? Fairies come out?
Awesome. It's romantic.

52
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,869
How great for you.

53
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,909
Why is it great for me?

54
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,540
Fairy sighting. You met a fairy.
Tinkerbell.

55
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,999
I'm a little upset that I got caught.
How did they know I'd come?

56
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,519
They put that stuff there so people
can make romantic memories like this.

57
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,819
What's the name of this neighborhood?

58
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,199
Quebec.

59
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,389
Even the name's dashing.
But did you know this?

60
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,360
If you catch a falling maple leaf...

61
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,449
You caught it? Hurry and throw it away.

62
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,720
Why should I?

63
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,889
If you catch a falling maple leaf, you'll fall
in love with the person you are walking with.

64
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,769
Be honest. You just made that up, right?

65
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:31,399
I didn't. It's in the same category of a catching a
falling cherry blossom and your first love comes true.

66
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,649
You said you loved me.

67
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,199
- Are you a goblin?
- No.

68
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,199
That's why you should
hurry and throw it away.

69
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Why did you want to catch it then?

70
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,479
I thought I was walking
with that other guy.

71
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Other guy?

72
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm going to go close to the
handsome guy and take a closer look.

73
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,750
Ghost. Canadian ghost!

74
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,459
Scary.

75
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,529
I made eye contact with the ghost.
I'm nauseated.

76
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,019
You said you see ghosts often.
What's so scary?

77
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,290
He tried to talk to me in English. When a
ghost talks to me in English, it's scarier.

78
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,359
But this, Mister! Isn't this a hotel?

79
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,209
I know we are abroad, but don't you think this is too much
with a high schooler? You were saying this and that way.

80
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,839
You said you were going to marry me.

81
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,889
Are you a goblin, Mister?

82
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,820
I'm not. Rest here.

83
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,729
- Where are you going?
- I've got something to do.

84
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,249
What thing do you have to do?
Can't I come with you?

85
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,159
It's my first time abroad
so I'm very scared.

86
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,509
A kid who's so scared runs
around everywhere really well.

87
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,339
That's because... you were
by me and I trust you.

88
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,690
Will it take long? Who are you meeting?

89
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,889
Oh, you're meeting a woman then.

90
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,369
Right? To come all the way to Canada
must be because of some promise.

91
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,849
You must have had your reason to
say I wasn't the goblin bride.

92
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,769
I got it. See you later.

93
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,149
I have no money and no
passport and nobody I know.

94
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,180
My breathing's unstable, too, but
I'll just have to wait alone.

95
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,089
You know what I'm saying, right?

96
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,940
I don't.

97
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,989
It means, could you lend me $10?

98
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,009
You could abandon me. Well, intentionally or accidentally.
In that case, I'll need to call the embassy.

99
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,930
If I abandon you, summon me. That'll
be faster than the embassy.

100
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,899
It's not even $100 but just $10 but he reasons
it like that. Yeah, don't give me any.

101
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,859
Okay! Yeah? You're not.
You can't give it to me.

102
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,000
Give me a break!

103
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,880
Your change and receipt.

104
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,669
I'll enjoy it.

105
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,130
This is the miscellaneous omitted
person document you asked for.

106
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,579
They said it must be hand-written.

107
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay.

108
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,049
But how does a miscellaneous
omitted person happen?

109
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,999
I only heard of the existence of
a miscellaneous omitted person,

110
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,209
- I never handled one in real life.
- It's like a god's whim.

111
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,639
Humans call that a miracle.
And we call that

112
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,919
a miscellaneous omitted person.

113
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,649
Then, is your case a miracle, too?

114
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,899
It's even more peculiar. Her name isn't on the list of the
living or the dead, so I don't know how to apply this.

115
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,299
It sounds like a headache. When
will you ever get the papers done?

116
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,509
I know.

117
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,289
Anyway, Sunbae, I heard you moved.
You're not doing a house warming party?

118
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,989
It's a lease.

119
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,639
I need to move, too. I
can't seem to save money.

120
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,419
I don't know if the owner has supernatural sense but she keeps
saying the grim reaper appears in her dream. It's killing me.

121
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,879
That's why I keep telling you you
need to pick a good location.

122
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,009
It's just that I really want to
experience living in a rooftop house.

123
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:20,189
But isn't it really weird? We're grim reapers, but we need a place to
live. We get sleepy if we don't sleep, and we get hungry if we don't eat.

124
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,650
I'm so tired now from working
late these past few days.

125
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,749
These days, I live on this.

126
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,370
Oh, right. There's a really
pretty girl in the new '23 class.

127
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,759
Where are you trying to run
away to after hitting someone?

128
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,590
What?

129
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,419
Right? You drank alcohol, didn't you?

130
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,270
Work hard.

131
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,040
That's it.

132
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,359
Are you nuts? Who drank?

133
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,289
Hey, your limbs are fine
so stop throwing crap.

134
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,579
Let's go to the police. To the police!

135
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,339
Let go. Let go!

136
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,429
Let go, I said.

137
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,559
- Try to kill me!
- Let go.

138
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,089
Na Kyeong Won, Kim Eu Ryong. Byeongshin
Year, Moosul Month, Gimi Day.

139
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,060
02:22, car accident deaths.
That's you guys, right?

140
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,730
Drink it. It will erase
your memory of this life.

141
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,630
Must I really forget everything?

142
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,059
My resentment towards him, too?

143
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,559
Listen, woman. It's your fate. You're dead
already. Why bother depending on that now?

144
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,029
It's better that you do.

145
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,939
Oblivion is also a consideration from god.

146
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,169
But why do you only give
this to her and not me?

147
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,800
You need to remember what crimes you committed. It's
not even the first time you hit and killed someone.

148
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,769
First, you will regret this moment
you couldn't drink the tea.

149
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,299
Next, you will think about why you couldn't drink
the tea and you will come to a realization.

150
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,579
That you can't undo this moment.

151
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,740
And that you are already

152
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,870
in hell.

153
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,469
Your body will be ripped
in pieces every day.

154
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,189
Every second you feel pain you
will regret what you did.

155
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,589
But that pain will never cease.

156
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,490
Forever.

157
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,759
I did wrong.

158
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,950
Forgive me.

159
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,710
Well, he's quite impulsive.

160
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,760
I know someone who is living in hell with
all the memories of his life intact.

161
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm sure he's begged countless
times for forgiveness, too.

162
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,500
<i>But there was no use,</i>

163
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,340
<i>he was still standing
in the middle of hell.</i>

164
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:46,429
<i>The young grandson of the grandson of
the grandson who left Goryeo with me</i>

165
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,869
<i>is buried here.</i>

166
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,619
<i>I've once thought of
this living as a prize.</i>

167
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,730
<i>But in the end, my living was a punishment.</i>

168
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,410

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,059
Have you been well?

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,120
<i>[Yoo Geum Seon]</i>

171
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,550
And you guys as well? I'm
still alive like this

172
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,940
and was not able to be in peace.

173
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,840

174
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,370

179
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,290
I told you to stay quietly.

180
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,600
I was. You didn't even realize I came.

181
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,650
You had business here?

182
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,539
I'm done now. I was just about to leave.

183
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,729
But why is it that your grave is the
only one that doesn't have a name?

184
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,889
You always leave where you live like this?
How many times?

185
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,330
I haven't counted.

186
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,269
Hello, I'm Ji Eun Tak.

187
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,639
In about 200 years, I will be your bride.

188
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,119
That's not true.

189
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,669
Maybe not.

190
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,849
But even after 200 years,
you will still be dashing.

191
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,739
You're mean at times but you're growing
up well so don't worry too much.

192
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,020
Well then.

193
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,730
Let's go.

194
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,979
Did you live here for a long time?

195
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:05,209
From the time that place went from a cabin in a desolate
backwoods to a hotel, I went and came back and again.

196
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,599
This was the first place I settled
in after leaving my hometown.

197
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,059
What a shame. You should've
bought the cabin then.

198
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,040
Then that hotel would be yours.

199
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,019
Is that hotel possibly yours...?

200
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,220
What's with that look?

201
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,619
Do you want to eat this?

202
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,289
Where did you get this from?
You don't have any money.

203
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,609
So I stole it.

204
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,066
Hurry, eat up. We have to
eat and get rid of it.

205
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,289
What?

206
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,869
You believed that?

207
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,239
I stared at it because I was in awe
and they pitied me and gave it to me.

208
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,009
But is that hotel really yours?

209
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,449
- Aren't you running late?
- For what?

210
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,859
For school.

211
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,980
What's the time now in Korea?

212
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,420
10 am.

213
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,559
My teacher's going to kill me.

214
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,309
Should I just live here?

215
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,300
I mean, being an illegal immigrant
is better than being tardy, right?

216
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,570
I think that would be better.

217
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,820
I slept well.

218
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,829
I feel like I woke up from a dream.

219
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,829
I never imagined traveling abroad,

220
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,170
but thanks to you I could even go abroad.
Thank you for today.

221
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,519
Well then...

222
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,799
Since I've woken from my dream,
I should get going to school.

223
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,719
Even if I was a pest to you
today, forgive me for once.

224
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,970
It was probably because I was so excited.

225
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,839
What time is it now? The time, now!

226
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm sorry.

227
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:24,759
You're a senior. How can a senior
come to school at the 3rd hour?

228
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,239
Did you come for school lunch? Or is it
that you don't want to attend school?

229
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,329
You've turned in your application and you're done with
your senior year? Like you already got into a college.

230
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,319
You said you didn't have tuition money.

231
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,150
I'm sorry.

232
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:43,059
I asked why you were late. I know you're living a hard life under supervision
by your aunt, but you're not the only one who's having a hard time.

233
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,129
Everyone lives hard.

234
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,699
Just because the SAT is almost over and you can't
go to college, you can't bother other kids.

235
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,719
I'm going to university.

236
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,559
What's with the look.

237
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,149
Go! Did someone stop you from going?

238
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,259
You are always this way
even when I'm being nice.

239
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,440
Wait a minute.

240
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,430
How have you been, Ji Soo's mother.
Oh, yes, yes.

241
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,250
You're too kind.

242
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,540
<i>The evening you come home to after getting rained on,
what is the thing that is like an umbrella to you?</i>

243
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,480
<i>A voice that answers when you call.</i>

244
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,440
<i>A memory of seeing the same
thing at the same time.</i>

245
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:06,820
<i>Those moments when you first
matched your walking pace.</i>

246
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,780
<i>Is someone coming to mind?</i>

247
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,230
<i>Yes, that's the person.</i>

248
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,450
<i>Here's the first song for you.</i>

249
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,979
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

250
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,789
- Are you busy?
- Yeah, I'm busy.

251
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,240
Then follow me outside.

252
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,409
Follow closely, but not too close.

253
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:56,199
- It needs to be something so important that I should follow you closely or else you're dead.
- I'm verifying that, too.

254
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,450
My survival.

255
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,710
What are you talking about?

256
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,349
How come you came out from there?

257
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,440
It's surprising, right?

258
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,710
That girl was able to do something
that even the reaper finds surprising.

259
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,339
What, who? Who did what?

260
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,560
Do it again. I'm going
to stick even closer.

261
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,799
- What are you doing?
- What, why? I'm being competitive. Where am I going to?

262
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,739
I'm just a monster. Get lost. Go.

263
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,600
Get lost!

264
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,419
What am I if you just leave like that?

265
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,539
What is it? What can I not do?

266
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,259
- Mr. Tenant?
- Oh, you scared me.

267
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,199
Why is our Mr. Tenant out?
It's cold outside.

268
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,379
What about Uncle?

269
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,130
Inside.

270
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:26,860
No, no. Actually I came to see you.

271
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,669
- Stay there.
- Oh, yes.

272
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,339
You must really hate physical contact.

273
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,919
Well, it's nothing serious, but I was just wondering if there was
any problems that you're finding uncomfortable in living here?

274
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,599
Like it gets damp suddenly or
really bright outside the room?

275
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,949
I just wish your uncle
would suddenly leave home.

276
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,439
I know, right? To be honest, I really wish my
uncle left to go abroad as soon as possible.

277
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,769
If you get to know him, he's actually quite a big person,
but I don't know why he's staying in Korea like that.

278
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,769
You feel that too, right?

279
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,129
- No.
- Oh, you don't.

280
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,539
But I think I'm going to come here quite frequently
in the future, so what should we call each other?

281
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,799
It might sound really distant
to keep calling you a tenant.

282
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,540
Uncle... is probably too close.

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,239
I'll get straight to the point.

284
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,549
Uncle down the hall, save me once.

285
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,729
If some grandfather comes and asks who you
are, can you just say you're visiting?

286
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,779
He would really kill me if he knew I
gave out the room for rent to you.

287
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,229
Who's that grandfather?

288
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,410
My grandfather.

289
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,799
From the first to the very
last, I'll stand by your side.

290
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,850
Really.

291
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,980
I mean it.

292
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,110
If I open this door, it will be Canada.

293
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,250
It will be Canada.

294
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,619
Are you going to use it, student?

295
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,499
No, it's okay.

296
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,250
Senior in high school?

297
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,489
How did you know?

298
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,159
When you're wearing a uniform and have dead
fish eyes, then you tend to be seniors.

299
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,040
Oh... fish eyes.

300
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,179
Where do you live?

301
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,069
I live nearby.

302
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,530
That's good. Take this to eat.

303
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,799
- It's spinach.
- It's nothing great.

304
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,799
I got it from a guy.

305
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,440
Spinach?

306
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,720
Take it home and make sure you
share it with your family, okay?

307
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,249
I'm home.

308
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,219
Where the hell have you been all evening?

309
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,429
It's this time when I finish school
and then come home straight away.

310
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,389
Stop talking back.

311
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,869
- Mom, I'm hungry.
- Me, too, you rascal.

312
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,499
Oh, geez. Other families'
kids are good at staying out.

313
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,259
Hurry up and cook! How many people
are waiting because of you?

314
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,919
Yes, yes.

315
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,580
Reply only once.

316
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:33,020
<i>Take it home and make sure you
share it with your family, okay?</i>

317
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,579
Mom, mom, look at this. She's
probably planning to go abroad.

318
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,179
I researched this place, and it's Canada.

319
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,309
What? Give me that. Oh, yeah, I
knew you would be like this.

320
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,219
You were going to run away abroad with the insurance
money? And you say you don't have the bank book? Huh?

321
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,559
Give it back, please. I was just
going to keep it as a souvenir.

322
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,519
Why is this a souvenir? When have you
been here for this to be a souvenir?

323
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,359
Oh good. I'm glad I got you today. This
is how you repay me for raising you?

324
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,220
Like this? Like this?

325
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,009
Give it. It's mine so give it please.

326
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,459
She's all excited about running away, I
guess. Looking at how she made kimbap.

327
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,660
- It looks good.
- Where is it, b♪ tch?

328
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,439
Blood, blood.

329
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,820
What looks tasty? Your finger?

330
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,299
Blood.

331
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,559
Why the hell are both of them like that?

332
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,930
Mom, blood! Here! Blood!

333
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,940
Blood.

334
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,749
Blood.

335
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,269

you call me again in the middle of the night?

important. What are you going to do now?

- You did.
- I didn't! I'm being serious this time.

353
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,030
Did you just think about me now or not?

354
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,230
Ah, that is...

355
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,599
See! I was right? You
thought about me, right?

356
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,430
Because you keep thinking about me like that, I
was brought out here when I'm busy. How tiring.

357

I just think about you?

358

It's not exact, but I'm sensitive.
So let's be aware of that, the two of us.

Those kind of thoughts
obviously reminded me of you.

watch looks even more expensive,

like you've got everything that's good,

369

370
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,970

Well, that's that.

372
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,779

family to fall asleep.

Once they are passed out they won't
even know if someone took them away.

I was going to sleep quickly and
come out early in the morning.

suspicious here until midnight?

issued for Seoul and Gyeonggi.</i>

502
00:50:19,035 --> 00:50:23,854
<i>There's concern about after work traffic congestion from
slippery road conditions. Next is Reporter Lee Min Soo.</i>

503
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,494
<i>Seongbukdong is getting an even
heavier downpour than earlier.</i>

504
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,864
<i>People's feet are being halted
as they try to leave work.</i>

505
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:32,004
<i>The police are trying to
reduce traffic congestion</i>

506
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:35,805
<i>and advise that people use public
transportation if at all possible.</i>

507
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:41,325
It's raining. It's nice.

508
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,684
What's nice about it? We won't
have customers when it rains.

509
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:48,344
We don't have customers
even when it doesn't rain.

510
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:52,405
They're not coming anyway so it's
nice to have the rain at least.

511
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,884
I don't have an umbrella, though.

512
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:58,974
I have lots. Take one.

513
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:02,104
I always left it because
it's a pest to take it.

514
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:04,594
Don't be a pest and bring it back again.

515
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,305
Really?

516
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:10,744
I have an umbrella now.

517
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:12,774
Is it the first time
you've seen an umbrella?

518
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:14,634
Thank you.

519
00:51:14,635 --> 00:51:18,475
I need an umbrella to
appear in my life, too.

520
00:51:19,925 --> 00:51:21,754
It's stale.

521
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:23,164
Should I give you new ones?

522
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:26,154
Never mind. I already know what
it tastes like. It's a pest.

523
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:27,264
You're going somewhere?

524
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:30,164
Part-timer, that's something
only the boss says.

525
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:33,234
You just need to play hookie
and play when I'm not here.

526
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:37,024
No, a worker can't play hookie
just because the boss is not here.

527
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,914
I need to work harder
when I'm not being seen.

528
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:41,634
If you work harder when you're not seen,

529
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:45,465
the boss won't know, Part-Timer.
You should play.

530
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,795
She's so cool.

531
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:51,445
Have a good trip.

532
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:57,674
Oh, triplets. I'm the youngest one.

533
00:51:57,675 --> 00:52:01,294
Let's have a look. What are
you curious about to be here?

534
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:04,854
Isn't that something you need to guess?

535
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,494
Something's not going well, I guess?

536
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:10,445
I wouldn't be here if things were going well.
I'd be sitting at my shop counting money.

537
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:18,124
Aigoo! You have no luck as far as having children and a husband.
You'll have trouble with the opposite sex and will always wander...

538
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:22,684
So, I have all kinds of bad
luck including old age, huh?

539
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,314
I should lose weight, huh?

540
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,574
What a cold fate.

541
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:29,925
You're a lonely orphan
without any relatives.

542
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:33,234
How did you know that?

543
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:37,054
Life is like a boat that is
floating on an open sea.

544
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:41,124
I wish I could be on that
boat with a handsome man.

545
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:45,014
I see a man. Be careful
of a man who wears a hat.

546
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:46,924
A very black hat.

547
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:51,225
I wish that hat-wearing man is handsome.

548
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,375
Where are you going?

549
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:03,464
Cleaners. It's "dry clean only."

550
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:06,164
I feel this each time, that
that hat's such a great plan.

551
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:09,525
So that the deceased can have a
laugh on their final way out.

552
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:16,064
Don't seek death. Death will seek you.

553
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:17,654
It's a proven fact.

554
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:21,214
- I have to wear this so the deceased can identify me and not be seen by humans.
- I see.

555
00:53:21,215 --> 00:53:26,475
I'm glad humans can't see it or you'd
be so embarrassed. Have a good trip.

556
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:08,724
Are you sure you don't need to iron it?

557
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:12,724
What era did you come from? These
days they stick well like this.

558
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:16,234
How about you? Who laminates
maple leaves these days?

559
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:19,214
The one who's getting this is
from the old days so it's okay.

560
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,674
Who? You've got a boyfriend now?

561
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,035
Hey! What boyfriend!

562
00:54:26,015 --> 00:54:29,904
He helped me find a job so I'm grateful.

563
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:33,634
What if he misunderstands you after
he gets this, that you like him?

564
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:38,375
He denies my very existence so he won't.

565
00:54:54,515 --> 00:54:57,655
Mister, I have a present for you...

566
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,804
My scarf. I left my scarf.

567
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:10,334
Indeed... you see me.

568
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,504
Ten years ago and now, too. Same line, too.

569
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:17,885
What if the boss locked the door. Dummy.

570
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:24,295
It's useless. I know you see me. No
one's here to protect you this time.

571
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,625
I know I'm caught.

572
00:55:30,665 --> 00:55:35,654
You moved. Thanks to that I looked for
you for 10 years. Now we meet today.

573
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:37,364
Then don't look for me.

574
00:55:37,365 --> 00:55:41,834
In this life, we'd call you a stalker.
Do you know that?

575
00:55:41,835 --> 00:55:44,684
I'm going to sue you. My name's
not even on the list of the dead.

576
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:46,834
It's on the miscellaneous
omitted person list.

577
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:50,775
Though it'll be a headache due to
19 years of evidence documentation.

578
00:55:53,005 --> 00:55:57,665
Then... now what becomes of me?

579
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:04,664
I'm going to die? But I'm only barely 19.

580
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:09,385
People die at 9 and people die at 10, too.

581
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:12,734
That's death.

582
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:18,355
But who are you with again this time?

583
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,934
Close your eyes. You can't meet his eyes.

584
00:56:23,935 --> 00:56:26,465
He's the grim reaper.

585
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,235
No. Don't look at his eyes.

586
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:51,235
It's okay. I know him.

587
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:57,544
I guess you're working.

588
00:56:57,545 --> 00:57:00,744
I am working, but I don't
know what you're doing.

589
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:02,724
I'm in the middle of meddling
with human life and death.

590
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:05,864
That's what I mean. It
seems like a huge mistake.

591
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:09,605
This kid, 19 years ago, should have been...

592
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:19,315
This kid, 19 years ago, should have been...

593
00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:32,295
Do I look like I want an explanation?

594
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:37,094
<i>Didn't you learn to pay attention to
the goblin when he's being serious?</i>

595
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:40,965
<i>Watch it. I might want to meddle
with your life and death.</i>

596
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:45,824
Let's run for now. There
will be a way if we run.

597
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:47,155
This way.

598
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:52,854
It's okay. Just stay. He can't take you.

599
00:57:52,855 --> 00:57:56,704
- He just said he's been looking for me for the last ten years...
- Still...

600
00:57:56,705 --> 00:57:59,964
Even if he's been looking for you
for a hundred years. Even still...

601
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:03,945
No Grim Reaper can take away a girl
who's willing to marry a goblin.

602
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:07,754
Especially in front of the goblin.

603
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:11,324
Oh, then by chance, is she...

604
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,024
Yes, that's right. I'm the one.

605
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:16,094
That goblin bride you've
heard so much about.

606
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:20,045
What will you do now? Are you
still going to take me away?

607
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:28,174
Looks like I'm the bad guy here.

608
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:32,314
That's the one I'm here for.
Let's talk details later.

609
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:37,955
We'll see each other again. It can be a coincidental
meeting like today or an appointed time.

610
00:58:47,545 --> 00:58:51,485
Say it. You look like
you've got a lot to say.

611
00:58:57,355 --> 00:59:01,974
See? You're a goblin.

612
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:03,745
I knew it.

613
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,984
Why did you lie and say
you're not a goblin?

614
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:10,264
I didn't think I'd see you
again in the beginning.

615
00:59:10,265 --> 00:59:14,624
Who knew you'd follow me through the door?
No one has ever followed me through my door.

616
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,714
How about after that?

617
00:59:16,715 --> 00:59:18,494
I asked you many times after that.

618
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:21,204
I didn't need to correct myself after that.

619
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:26,915
From the beginning to now... and even in
the future, you won't be the goblin bride.

620
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:36,365
Then who am I?

621
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:44,594
Ghosts always talk to me about the goblin.

622
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:48,925
They bug me if I don't see them.
If I do, they get clingy.

623
00:59:49,925 --> 00:59:52,304
I'm alive like this...

624
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:55,105
yet the Grim Reaper says
I shouldn't be alive.

625
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:57,655
Who am I then?

626
00:59:58,655 --> 01:00:01,684
I told you it's something
you'll have to bear.

627
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:04,304
I don't think it's something
you can quibble with me about.

628
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:05,895
So petty...

629
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,585
This is so unfair...

630
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:15,264
Do you think I really planned on
marrying the goblin when I met one?

631
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:17,915
Tell me honestly. It's
another reason, right?

632
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:24,624
By chance, did you say you're not
the goblin because I'm not pretty?

633
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,365
Because I'm so far from your ideal type?

634
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:30,054
- It's true!
- That's not it.

635
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:33,214
You always say that's not it. You said
you weren't a goblin, but you are.

636
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:34,875
You're pretty.

637
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:42,714
I've lived longer than 900 years. I'm
not looking for a pretty person.

638
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:46,324
I'm looking for someone who'd
discover something in me.

639
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:49,934
That's why you, who hasn't discovered
anything in me, you're not a goblin's bride.

640
01:00:49,935 --> 01:00:52,164
That's all there's to it.

641
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:55,015
That's what I mean by you don't
have an effective value.

642
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:57,864
It hurts because you
make it sound so simple.

643
01:00:57,865 --> 01:01:02,535
You don't need to be hurt.
Rather be relieved.

644
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:10,325
If you did indeed discover something
in me, you'd be resenting me.

645
01:01:13,105 --> 01:01:17,294
Then why didn't you insist that you're not the
goblin to the end? Why are you revealing it now?

646
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:19,425
For the same reason I said I wasn't.

647
01:01:20,425 --> 01:01:26,205
I don't want you to call me out hoping for
something. I'm about to leave this place soon.

648
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,885
To where?

649
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:37,135
Never mind. Don't answer me.

650
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:42,714
I'm not curious at all. Who
said I'd be your bride?

651
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:45,384
At my pretty age of 19,
you think I'm crazy?

652
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:50,795
I won't call you out again. Relax and go on
with your life. I don't need you, either.

653
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:56,835
I just think, "Oh, this is
what a goblin looks like."

654
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:40,924
So, you're finally going to die?

655
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:44,074
The rumor has it that you'll
die when the bride appears.

656
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:46,874
Unfortunately, I can't die.
She can't see the sword.

657
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,024
Well, she may not be
able to see it just yet.

658
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:52,534
Or maybe you have to be completely naked
for her to see that. She's still young.

659
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,624
She's still young, so don't go near her.

660
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,674
Why are you protecting her? You
said she can't even see the sword.

661
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,544
Just congratulate me. I get to live longer.

662
01:03:00,545 --> 01:03:03,984
Go somewhere else and live a long life. I can't
live together with a goblin who meddles...

663
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:07,224
- with my life and death.
- There is an easy way of you moving out.

664
01:03:07,225 --> 01:03:08,935

01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,775
Why do you look at books like these?

674
01:04:16,095 --> 01:04:18,074
Should I say it's like doing a
background check on my boyfriend?

675
01:04:18,075 --> 01:04:20,084
It's kind of like looking
through his Facebook.

676
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:22,694
You have to do all these
things when you grow up, okay?

677
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:27,824
Does your boyfriend come out in
fairy tales? Is he a prince?

678
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:31,164
I know. If he was going
to be in fairy tales,

679
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:33,545
wouldn't it be nice if he was
a knight in shining armor?

680
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:35,794
What's this, huh?

681
01:04:35,795 --> 01:04:38,955
This is more fun. Read this one.

683
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,475

Gosh... he was just a broomstick.

688
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:14,095
I'm not going to do this either.
I'll throw it away.

689
01:05:58,175 --> 01:06:00,105
Deok Hwa, you...

690
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,365
Uncle, you were here?

691
01:06:04,365 --> 01:06:06,754
You said you used to smoke and quit.

692
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:10,264
That was so long ago. It was
350 years ago, 350 years!

693
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:11,335
Geez...

694
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,625
Sorry.

695
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:30,035
What's wrong with him?

696
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:36,415
He's been like that for three hours.
It's so damp in here.

697
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:41,415
What's with you, Uncle down the hall?

698
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:59,435
Is this a cumulus cloud? I came
here wanting to ask you that.

699
01:07:03,635 --> 01:07:08,334
Uncle, no rain, okay?
Who'd clean up all that?

700
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:10,864
Looks like he's thinking about a woman.

701
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:14,084
He spoke more than three words
to a woman in 300 years.

702
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:17,324
- He looks like he hurt her.
- What? What did I do? What?

703
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,074
I guess the fight between the husband
and wife didn't end too well.

704
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:22,534
"We'll see you in four weeks." Is it
something like that? (divorce court)

705
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:25,244
Wow, do you have a girlfriend, Uncle?
Is she pretty?

706
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:27,634
- She's 19 years old.
- Geez! Wow! Is she pretty?

707
01:07:27,635 --> 01:07:32,444
I'm not thinking about her. I'm thinking about stock shares.
What are you saying in front of a kid? Hey, you Grim Reaper!

708
01:07:32,445 --> 01:07:35,524
I hope you don't dismiss the Grim
Reaper's ability to foresee.

709
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:38,275
You Goblin, who's thinking about
a woman in front of this kid...

710
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:43,654
What?

711
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:45,584
What?

712
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:48,094
If you couldn't get her, forget it. But...

713
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:52,804
if you hurt her, you should apologize like
a man. Why are you sitting here like this?

714
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:55,474
Deok Hwa, you don't know anything
since you're still young.

715
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:58,724
- Be quiet.
- I spoke quietly.

716
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:00,644
A pathetic conversation.

717
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:04,964
Uncle down the hall, please be understanding. I'm
embarrassed of him wherever he may be. I apologize.

718
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:07,664
Just be a man and apologize. Be a man!

719
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:11,325
Ta-da, ring. Ta-da, purse.
Ta-da, credit card.

720
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:24,124
- Where are you going?
- To the supermarket. How about you?

721
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:27,884
To the dry cleaners.
This is dry clean only.

722
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:30,135
- I'll get going first.
- Work hard.

723
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:51,254
You said you were going to the supermarket.
Is this the supermarket?

724
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:53,154
You said you were going to the dry
cleaners. Is this the dry cleaners?

725
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:55,434
So, did you follow me?
She's not here, either.

726
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,835
She's not there? Did you kill her?

727
01:08:59,565 --> 01:09:02,164
That's a very rude remark,
you careless goblin.

728
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:07,384
Going into someone's home wearing shoes
is more rude, you mindless Grim Reaper.

729
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:09,935
- Where is she?
- You didn't kill her?

730
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:14,264
Did you tell her to move?

731
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:16,164
I came here to tell her to move,
but she moved on her own.

732
01:09:16,165 --> 01:09:18,124
You think I can't find her
just because she moved?

733
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:21,604
Yeah, you couldn't find her for ten years.

734
01:09:21,605 --> 01:09:24,655
The way I see it, you won't find
her even if she didn't move.

735
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:30,074
So, where did she move to?

736
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:32,265
You know, right? Where is she?

737
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:52,855
It's okay.

738
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:59,345
I only slept there. It's not
like it was my real home.

739
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:18,775
Excuse me.

740
01:10:24,235 --> 01:10:26,175
Not here.

741
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,755
Not here.

742
01:10:35,495 --> 01:10:37,235
Hey.

743
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:40,234
You see me, right?

744
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,794
Yes, I see you. I see you really well.

745
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:45,015
Let's talk.

746
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:50,145
- Where did she go?
- Hey.

747
01:10:52,195 --> 01:10:54,864
You're scaring me.

748
01:10:54,865 --> 01:10:59,364
- Why are you like this suddenly?
- You said I was the goblin bride last time.

749
01:10:59,365 --> 01:11:00,884
Why did you do that?

750
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:05,435
Oh, that. I heard it from
the grandma with dialect.

751
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:08,654
The way I see it,

752
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:14,124
he saved her after seeing her face.
Your mom was good-looking.

753
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:16,124
So...

754
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:22,915
like this, she was dying then
her breath suddenly came back.

755
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,414
<i>In the middle of winter, cherry blossoms!</i>

756
01:11:27,415 --> 01:11:32,834
<i>Cherry blossoms were falling
and it was so amazing.</i>

757
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:34,934
You're saying the goblin
saved my mom and me?

758
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:40,504
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you and your
mom were supposed to die that day.

759
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:46,234
Later on the Grim Reaper came.
He got nothing.

760
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:49,814
So in the end, he saved his own bride.

761
01:11:49,815 --> 01:11:52,194
So romantic.

762
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:55,655
What that mister said was all true.

763
01:11:58,405 --> 01:12:01,814
I had no right to hate him from the start.

764
01:12:01,815 --> 01:12:04,964
If it wasn't for the goblin,
I wouldn't be born.

765
01:12:04,965 --> 01:12:09,074
And I wouldn't have memories of
living with my mom till I was 9.

766
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,864
Did you get mad...?

767
01:12:10,865 --> 01:12:14,385
At the goblin? Really bad?

768
01:12:16,785 --> 01:12:18,704
What do I do now?

769
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:20,795
How about

770
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:24,364
you just come with me?

771
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:27,905
What do you mean, what do I do?
You have to marry the goblin.

772
01:12:34,045 --> 01:12:37,265

- Quickly. I'm in a hurry.
- Then talk in a hurry.

784
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:46,024
She didn't look precious.

785
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:48,734
- What?
- Do you know "Sa Go Mu Tak?" (no one to depend on)

786
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:50,264
She's that.

787

What are you saying? Some Tak?

788
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,464
She's Ji Eun Tak. Did she say she was that?

789
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:58,754
It's okay. I didn't know either so
I looked it up on the Internet.

790
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:02,254
This lady... Why are you talking
to me informally (ban mal)?

791
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:05,744
Right? I hate people ordering
only half a chicken (ban ma ri).

Why did you come here?

796
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:17,334
I tried at school several times,

So cooperate.

798

Hey! Are you going to take
responsibility if she goes astray?

800

01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:46,464
is really bothering me.

805
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:49,394
- That b♪ tch.
- Oppa, do you still beat people up?

806
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:53,174
You don't feel guilty beating a woman?
Gender equality?

807
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:54,994

Look. See?

821
01:15:49,865 --> 01:15:53,014
I told you I'll pay back as
soon as I find the bank book.

822
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:57,384
This girl ran away from home. That
puts me in a difficult situation.

823
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:02,824
You don't answer my calls. That

827
01:16:22,535 --> 01:16:26,294
Only her mouth trap is alive.

828
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:29,414
How long have you been talking
about that insurance money?

829
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:31,864
Is there any insurance money at all?

830
01:16:31,865 --> 01:16:33,294
There is.

831
01:16:33,295 --> 01:16:37,174
Her mom had the infant insurance and

832
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:41,654
a life insurance that she paid for 8 years
like she knew she was going to die.

833
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:43,814
It's about $150,000!

834
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:49,894
But the bank book keeps on disappearing. I get it
reissued and it still disappears. It's driving me crazy!

835
01:16:49,895 --> 01:16:53,644
It's true. That girl has it.

836
01:16:53,645 --> 01:16:55,545
I'm certain.

837
01:16:57,325 --> 01:17:01,465
What school did you say she goes to?

838
01:17:06,995 --> 01:17:12,655
<i>[Hey. I need $30. I'll pay you
back next week. Get back to me]</i>

839
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:28,034
Student, where are you going?

840
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:29,424
Who are you?

841
01:17:29,425 --> 01:17:32,534
Why did you run away from home?
It's dangerous.

842
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:34,604
Why are you doing this to me?

843
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:38,925
- Why are you...
- Your aunt is very worried. Get in!

844
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:57,135
I'm curious. To rent this house for 20 years, it must have
cost quite a bit. Where did you get that big sum of money?

845
01:17:58,045 --> 01:18:02,284
People in charge of the funeral put
money on the bier for the dead,

846
01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:07,694
so the dead could pay for the ride across the river to
the afterlife. I've been saving that for 300 years.

847
01:18:07,695 --> 01:18:10,124
So do you think I could
give this house up or not?

848
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,614
Wow. It's been awhile that I
heard the term "saving money."

849
01:18:13,615 --> 01:18:17,184
I have plenty of gold and money.

850
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:19,685
Do you need pepper?

851
01:18:21,885 --> 01:18:24,415
You don't learn, do you?

852
01:18:38,765 --> 01:18:42,405
That was a plate from Louis the 14th!

853
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:20,754
Put down the fork.

854
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:22,955
Put your knife down first.

855
01:19:30,095 --> 01:19:33,404
I really don't know. I really
don't have the bank book.

856
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:34,974
My aunt has it.

857
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:38,694
Your aunt says that you have it and
you say that your aunt has it.

858
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:41,934
Then one of you is lying.

859
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:44,094
Right?

860
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:47,575
This girl!

861
01:19:54,425 --> 01:19:59,275
What? You want to really go at it?

862
01:20:04,255 --> 01:20:07,714
Student, we're very impatient.

863
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:10,414
Do you know where this car is headed to?

864
01:20:10,415 --> 01:20:15,454
A female student goes to such a remote
place and what happens to her...

865
01:20:15,455 --> 01:20:19,234
you would've seen it a lot on TV, too.

866
01:20:19,235 --> 01:20:22,664
Bank book. Where did you
hide the bank book?

867
01:20:22,665 --> 01:20:27,994
I really don't know. Why are you doing this
to me when my aunt is the one with the debt?

868
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:31,424
Let me out! If you don't I'll report you!

869
01:20:31,425 --> 01:20:36,855
Report? I'm the one who should report you!

870
01:20:37,725 --> 01:20:40,134
Hey, jerk, drive straight!

871
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,915
- Hyung.
- What?
- There.

01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:42,814

She's not calling for me.</i>

877
01:22:42,815 --> 01:22:44,594
<i>She doesn't call so I can't find her.</i>

878
01:22:44,595 --> 01:22:47,284

879
01:22:47,285 --> 01:22:48,694

880
01:22:48,695 --> 01:22:50,094
<i>What promise?</i>

881
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:53,205
<i>That you won't take her after I leave.</i>

882
01:22:54,455 --> 01:22:57,335
