1
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:13,467
Sunny's face in her previous life...

2
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:17,537
matches the face of that woman...

3
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:23,867
on the scroll you have.

4
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:28,207
Are you sure?

5
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,307
What did you see?

6
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,437
The woman I saw...

7
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,167
was standing in the middle of a palace.

8
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:42,107
She was dressed in white and looked noble.

9
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,967
She took an arrow to her heart...

10
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:50,507
and collapsed as she bled.

11
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,737
I told you those things.

12
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,067
Maybe not about her clothes...

13
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:04,137
or about the arrow...

14
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:07,337
What else? Did you see anything else?

15
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:12,166
She was on a palanquin and
she smiled at someone...

16
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,707
through a small window.

17
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:15,967
Smiling, she asked,

18
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:19,437
- "Do I..."
- Do I look pretty today?

19
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:27,467
A voice answered to her.

20
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,567
- "You look..."
- You look ugly.

21
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,767
Is she...

22
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,007
really your sister?

23
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:50,837
Yes.

24
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:59,067
Then what happens now?

25
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,167
(Episode 11)

26
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,367
Welcome.

27
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,737
The part-timer went out...

28
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:19,267
on a delivery.

29
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,207
Sun.

30
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:24,936
What are you calling my name for?

31
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:25,937
Sun.

32
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,167
Oh my. Have you gone crazy?

33
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:31,237
Are you just going to
stand there and watch?

34
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:35,977
We don't know for sure yet.
Keep your hands to yourself.

35
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,536
Are you really Sun?

36
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:39,636
What if I am?

37
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,536
- What's wrong with him?
- It's a long story.

38
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,806
Why would there be a long story
between this man and me?

39
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,807
That's right. It's me.

40
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,567
I'm your brother.

41
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,636
I missed you, Sun.

42
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,867
It's Sunny.

43
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,737
And I thought I said we
shouldn't see each other.

44
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:59,137
Why would you still hang out with him
after he called you a fried egg?

45
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,367
The thing is,

46
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:06,307
this person was your
brother in your past life.

47
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,737
What did you say? What life?

48
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,243
This is ridiculous.

49
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:13,637
Did you make up some ridiculous
story so you could see me?

50
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,837
You must've missed me.

51
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,637
Whom am I talking to, Sun?

52
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,166
Do you really not remember anything?

53
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,637
Aren't you too well-dressed and
good-looking to be like this?

54
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,636
Fine. I'll hear you out.

55
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:32,337
What was I in my previous life?

56
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,167
You were the queen of Goryeo.

57
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,267
I was a warrior.

58
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,766
Oh, Goryeo?

59
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,137
Do you remember now?

60
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,837
I remember perfectly.

61
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:47,966
Five dollars for the sweet potatoes.
Pay up right now.

62
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:49,937
Past life? Queen?

63
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,636
Are you kidding me?

64
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:53,266
- Get out. Get out now.
- Sun.

65
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,167
- You get out too.
- Sun.

66
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,767
When did you two get here?

67
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,867
What's wrong?

68
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,736
Is there something wrong?

69
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,036
Part-timer. Throw salt on them.

70
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,866
- There should be some in the back.
- Sun...

71
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,836
I don't know how to explain this well.

72
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,036
- Don't try if you don't know.
- Okay.

73
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,067
Sun.

74
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,367
What's going on?

75
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,037
Let's exchange information.

76
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,637
Kim Shin and my boss. What's
going on between them?

77
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,867
I don't think she's...

78
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,066
his ex-girlfriend.

79
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,206
If she was, you wouldn't be like this.

80
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,066
You'd be all gloomy.

81
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,537
Right. She's not anything like that.

82
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,367
- My question is...
- It's a secret.

83
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:47,836
I didn't even ask yet.

84
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:50,776
"Are there any other men who
come looking for your boss?"

85
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,276
It was something like that, right?

86
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:53,277
But why is it a secret?

87
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,166
I told you everything. Why
are you being secretive?

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,167
For loyalty.

89
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,776
This is persimmon you liked to eat.

90
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:05,776
These are the flowery shoes
you've always wanted.

91
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,737
These were your favorite colors.

92
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,206
I don't like these colors.

93
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:11,636
I don't wear flowery shoes.

94
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:13,036
And I don't eat persimmon.

95
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:16,206
As you can see, this is
the only table available.

96
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,436
Business is going well.

97
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,237
That's because I was here.

98
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,007
I bring wealth to people.

99
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,066
You practically live here.

100
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,507
I was on my way out.

101
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:34,267
Don't come home late.

102
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,307
Part-timer.

103
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,636
Is he the one for you?

104
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,037
Must you see him?

105
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,636
- Sorry?
- If you must, go tell him this.

106
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,466
"Persimmon, flowery shoes, fabrics."

107
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,936
"I'd rather you come empty-handed..."

108
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,806
"and buy my chicken instead
of buying me those things."

109
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:56,407
That'll be for your own good.

110
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,437
Right. I don't know what's gotten into him.

111
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,537
Gosh.

112
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:10,206
It really makes me feel guilty...

113
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,237
that I'm having these
thoughts about my boss,

114
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:16,206
but your uncle is practically
living at my workplace.

115
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:19,167
I feel bad for the Grim Reaper.

116
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,767
That's because your boss was his
sister in their past lives.

117
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:29,807
What?

118
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,807
In her past life? No way.

119
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,937
Just how would you know that?

120
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,337
Do you want to know a secret?

121
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:39,937
Yes.

122
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:43,006
Grim reapers can see one's previous life...

123
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,566
when they touch their hands.

124
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,766
- Are you serious?
- They must've held hands.

125
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,647
And the Grim Reaper let
my uncle know about it.

126
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,207
You're right. I saw them holding hands.

127
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,407
My gosh.

128
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,467
Are you sure that woman is my sister?

129
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:13,883
Did you see anything else?

130
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,037
No.

131
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,466
I gave it another try,

132
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,067
but she said, "Let's say you dumped me."

133
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:20,907
So I failed.

134
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,536
Don't let it get to you.

135
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:26,413
She doesn't have any
memory of her past life.

136
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:27,636
Exactly.

137
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,806
Even if she was Sun in her previous life,

138
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,567
I'm nothing to her in this life.

139
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,937
She's got her own life now.

140
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:39,437
I wonder if I should let
the past be of the past.

141
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,037
I wish I did everything for her then...

142
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,767
when we were living in the same time.

143
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,867
She was such a graceful and elegant girl.

144
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,807
How did her personality change so much?

145
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,237
What's wrong with Sunny's personality?

146
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,636
Weren't you all nice to her before?

147
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:59,906
Are you saying she's not
whom you want her to be?

148
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,936
I thought you two broke up.
Why are you getting upset?

149
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:05,166
If you're thinking about getting
back together, you can forget it.

150
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:08,413
How dare a mere grim reaper try
to make a move on my sister?

151
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,137
I agree with what you said before.

152
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,437
"Let the past be of the past."

153
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,536
You can see her over my dead body.

154
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,066
Stay away from my sister.

155
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,837
I'd splash water on you if I had some.

156
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,767
I know of this drama.

157
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,767
I've seen it in the morning.

158
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,067
Part-timer.

159
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:37,037
Do you, by any chance,

160
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,007
believe in a past life?

161
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,467
- Yes.
- You do?

162
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:50,006
They say humans are given four lives.

163
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:53,006
Life of planting, life of watering,

164
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,836
life of harvesting,

165
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,466
and life of using the harvest.

166
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,907
That must mean...

167
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:02,007
there are previous lives
and reincarnations.

168
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:08,007
I'm not sure which life it
is for you and me both.

169
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:11,566
That sounds convincing.

170
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,936
Where did you hear that from?

171
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:15,006
I've heard this and that.

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,037
What else have you heard?

173
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,167
I knew I would never get to him.

174
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,377
I knew it all,

175
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,237
but all I could do was keep going.

176
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,937
That was my last war.

177
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:32,183
I had to die there.

178
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:33,637
Why?

179
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:36,737
I came back after going
against the royal command.

180
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:40,237
I overlooked the jealousy
and fear of the young king.

181
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:44,377
I couldn't forget about the promise
to the late king to protect Yeo.

182
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,066
I had to save the lives of the innocent.

183
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,067
Above all,

184
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:52,837
my sister was protecting
that fool with her life.

185
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,707
That person named Kim Sun...

186
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,137
was very brave...

187
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:03,437
in the face of love.

188
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,166
Lead the way...

189
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,107
to the house of the man who
calls himself my brother.

190
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:14,567
What?

191
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,767
I'm home.

192
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,636
There's a guest.

193
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,737
Do you two live together?

194
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:35,736
It's the three of us.

195
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,167
What brings you here?

196
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,337
"Take a seat" should be first.

197
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:45,036
Take a seat. Would you
like something to drink?

198
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:47,037
Do you have alcohol? I'll have soju.

199
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,636
- What?
- We have beer.

200
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:50,166
That's all we drink here.

201
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,743
I didn't say you could talk to me.

202
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,867
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,467
How did your personality change like that?

204
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,136
You said I'm your sister.

205
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,707
- You said it sounded like a joke.
- Show me proof.

206
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,766
I'm pathetic myself to be swayed by this,

207
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:08,637
but I thought two grown-ups
wouldn't team up just to tease me.

208
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,137
Is this the proof?

209
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,807
Where did you buy this from?

210
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,037
Insa-dong?

211
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,367
Is this person...

212
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:34,967
the queen?

213
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,867
Your sister?

214
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,207
What a coincidence.

215
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,237
My boss has always been
waiting for a king to appear.

216
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,437
Does it remind you of anything?

217
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:49,707
She just looks...

218
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:52,367
young...

219
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,637
and pretty.

220
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:59,467
When I was her age, I was ugly.

221
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,307
So what happened to this queen?

222
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,167
Did she live a long and happy life?

223
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,436
You two should talk.

224
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,167
Let's leave them alone.

225
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,007
Was she miserable?

226
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:31,637
This queen.

227
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:34,067
I talked to her through letters...

228
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,507
more often than I saw her.

229
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:41,107
Reading the letters she sent...

230
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,836
was the only thing that kept me sane...

231
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,767
in my days when I was
struggling to survive.

232
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,067
The target is hit.

233
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:16,506
General Kim Shin sent the news
of victory from the frontier.

234
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:20,006
General Kim Shin sent the news
of victory from the border.

235
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,337
General Kim Shin sent the news
of victory from Liaodong.

236
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,206
Kim Shin's news of victory...

237
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,906
is intentionally spread
through the streets.

238
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:38,936
Foolish people get tricked every time,

239
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,437
and civil officials are
extremely resentful about it.

240
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:44,336
Don't praise him but...

241
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,766
tell him you are worried
about his sister's safety...

242
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,706
as the Royal Family's reputation...

243
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,937
has fallen to the ground.

244
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:22,167
He doesn't have a talent for archery.

245
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,707
He's been reading the same
page for half an hour.

246
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,207
He must have no talent for studies either.

247
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,737
That's not true. He must be
bothered about something.

248
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,707
By the way, why doesn't he
visit me for a long time?

249
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,507
He makes a woman get ill.

250
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,237
His Majesty is here.

251
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:33,907
You are quite heavy.

252
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,507
Someone is on my mind, that's why.

253
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,867
Where are you rushing to?

254
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,237
To see you, Your Majesty.

255
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,637
I would have come to you.

256
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,237
I thought it would be nicer
for us to meet in the middle.

257
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,636
One must not put too much strength...

258
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:08,466
in the hand that is
holding something lowly.

259
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,636
If you clench on it because it is precious,

260
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,166
that lowly and precious thing...

261
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:15,707
is bound to die.

262
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,837
Because of that hand.

263
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,136
No. Never.

264
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:27,506
Do not serve her any medicine.

265
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:28,707
This is the king's order.

266
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,206
The queen shall never drink any medicine.

267
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,866
No matter who sends it,

268
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,637
never drink it.

269
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,367
Why is he doing this?

270
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,337
It makes Your Highness sad.

271
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,907
Open the gate.

272
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,307
General Kim Shin returned in triumph.

273
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,407
Your brother has returned in triumph again.

274
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,607
Between the two of us,

275
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,737
who do you wish to be alive?

276
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,907
- Your Majesty.
- Answer me.

277
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:16,137
Or have you already made your decision?

278
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:20,437
Of course, whether I live
or your brother lives,

279
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,267
you have nothing to lose.

280
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,507
You're a fool, Your Majesty.

281
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,167
Do you want to die?

282
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:33,437
Why are you dressed like that?

283
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,307
You are already mourning...

284
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,407
in your mind.

285
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,037
I can't tell anymore.

286
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,166
I don't know if my enemies are
the barbarians or your brother.

287
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,107
Park Joong Won is your enemy.

288
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,307
You have to make a choice.

289
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,767
Will you live as my woman...

290
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,077
or will you die...

291
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,807
as the traitor's sister?

292
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,967
She didn't live long,

293
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,577
but I think she had her happy moments.

294
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,867
Even at the moment of her death,

295
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:53,307
she was looking at that fool.

296
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,507
Then...

297
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:14,607
how about the king?

298
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,637
Did he get reincarnated too?

299
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,437
I don't know that.

300
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,576
I want to know...

301
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,577
how he looks like.

302
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,237
Was he handsome?

303
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,907
If you are my sister,

304
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,737
you are very consistent in one thing.

305
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:36,267
By the way,

306
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:41,136
why do you sound so heartrending and sad...

307
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,707
as if you remember everything?

308
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,266
It's as if your life has been...

309
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,837
continued since then.

310
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,467
I know you won't believe it,

311
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:55,607
but I've been living my life
with all of those memories.

312
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,837
I'm saying this since you
know that I don't believe it.

313
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,077
I didn't come because I
believe in reincarnation.

314
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,737
I came because of ripe persimmon,
flower shoes, and silk.

315
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:16,207
Perhaps you deeply resent not
giving her those things.

316
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,036
It's certain that you're mad,

317
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:22,107
but you became mad in a nice way.

318
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,967
I got a little touched.

319
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,537
It's times like this...

320
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,436
when you are just like Sun.

321
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,336
Don't talk to me so casually...

322
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,077
just because you were my
brother in my past life.

323
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,906
Even siblings who live apart
get awkward when they meet.

324
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:39,867
How can I suddenly welcome
someone who claims...

325
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,407
to be my brother from my past life?

326
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,367
So...

327
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,807
don't be too disheartened either.

328
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:52,307
Excuse me. I will get going now.

329
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:02,077
He won't even come out to say bye to me.

330
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,307
Why are you looking at me when
you're not going to stop me?

331
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:42,906
Can I stop you?

332
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,237
What if you stop me?

333
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:47,637
What will happen to us next?

334
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,567
You're a fool.

335
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:15,507
Is it you...

336
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:18,407
or is it not?

337
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:28,207
Did she leave well?

338
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:34,007
She always seems to leave...

339
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:35,707
without a problem.

340
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,437
Are you okay?

341
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:41,267
How do you mean?

342
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,007
I have a question.

343
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:51,307
The painting of your sister... Who drew it?

344
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,137
Yeo did.

345
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:00,137
It's my sister...

346
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:03,307
but it's how he saw her.

347
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,467
The painting contains his grudges,

348
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:09,507
guilt, and yearnings.

349
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:11,607
I believe...

350
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:17,007
it is the last thing he drew.

351
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:19,907
After killing all those people?

352
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,107
After killing all those people.

353
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,367
Part-timer?

354
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:08,137
Yes, it's me.

355
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:10,607
I thought you'd be like this.

356
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:16,937
I didn't care much about previous lives.

357
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,207
I don't even believe in them.

358
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:23,937
I started feeling achy as
soon as I left that house.

359
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:28,007
Tell me if you feel too unwell
and I'll take you to a hospital.

360
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:30,337
No, take me home.

361
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,907
There's nothing here...

362
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,407
but my chest keeps hurting.

363
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:42,937
No. It hurts far deeper in.

364
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:46,267
It feels like someone...

365
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,337
is walking over my heart.

366
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:54,107
It feels like my heart
is falling to pieces.

367
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:14,499
Part-timer?

368
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:16,299
Yes, it's me.

369
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,729
I thought you'd be like this.

370
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,069
I didn't care much about previous lives.

371
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,329
I don't even believe in them.

372
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:32,099
I started feeling achy as
soon as I left that house.

373
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,069
Tell me if you feel too unwell
and I'll take you to a hospital.

374
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:38,469
No, take me home.

375
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,169
There's nothing here...

376
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:46,499
but my chest keeps hurting.

377
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:51,069
No. It hurts far deeper in.

378
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,169
It feels like someone...

379
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,129
is walking over my heart.

380
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,769
It feels like my heart
is falling to pieces.

381
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,299
Let's go home. It's cold outside.

382
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,699
What?

383
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,268
He rents the rooftop room.

384
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,069
I see.

385
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:35,729
Watch the steps.

386
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,429
The woman who lives beneath
me knows the goblin's bride?

387
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,029
The world is just way too small.

388
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,729
I saw something on his phone.

389
00:26:58,329 --> 00:26:59,569
What did you see?

390
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,699
"The goblin couple".

391
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,269
Is it you and the man who
claims he's my brother?

392
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,169
Are you two the goblin couple?

393
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,799
You won't tell me...

394
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,499
who they are, will you?

395
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,999
I'm sorry.

396
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,169
He won't tell me...

397
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:31,569
who or what he is,

398
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,169
will he?

399
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,899
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,499
We should break up, shouldn't we?

401
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:53,529
Are you a normal person?

402
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:56,069
Yes.

403
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,569
Okay.

404
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:28,899
What are you doing?

405
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,529
Waiting for you.

406
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,369
Since when?

407
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:35,899
I walked in all the footsteps you took.

408
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:40,999
What a sweet thing to say.

409
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,099
I feel sorry for my boss.

410
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:48,599
I lived my whole life like
"Eun Tak in Wonderland".

411
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,469
Seeing ghosts, meeting a goblin,

412
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,169
and crossing paths with a grim
reaper wasn't that much of a shock.

413
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:02,229
My boss' life suddenly crossed
over into a weird genre.

414
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,799
Her brother from her
previous life is a goblin,

415
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,569
the man she likes is a grim reaper,

416
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,229
and her part-timer sees ghosts.

417
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:17,269
There are times when we have
more ghosts than customers.

418
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,429
What is this thing called a past life?

419
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,499
It's just that. A past life.

420
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:29,899
At a certain time in a life
that I don't remember,

421
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,499
do you think I was ever...

422
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,369
a part of your life?

423
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,499
I don't know.

424
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:47,069
I really hope my boss is your sister.

425
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,098
She's really nice.

426
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:50,269
She isn't.

427
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:54,168
Are siblings meant to squabble
whether they're in...

428
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,769
the past or the present?

429
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:59,899
I wish I had a brother like you.

430
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,669
I do have a brother figure. Tae Hee.

431
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,398
You two might actually...

432
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:10,468
end up going to that restaurant in Canada.

433
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:11,698
My regular hangout?

434
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:14,228
Going there twice doesn't
make you a regular.

435
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,128
I've been going there for 50 years.

436
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,899
I won't go there with anyone else.

437
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,399
- I'll only go with you.
- As if.

438
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:21,829
You did go there.

439
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:24,329
I did?

440
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:26,399
Really? When?

441
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:28,269
How do you know that?

442
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,269
- I shouldn't have waited for you.
- How do you know?

443
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,428
- Move in closer.
- Don't take a step back.

444
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,499
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Wait.

445
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:40,668
I'm too close to the camera.

446
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:42,698
Take another one.

447
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:44,229
- One more.
- One more.

448
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:47,699
Let's take a photo.

449
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,999
Pose like a model.

450
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,669
- Hello?
- It's my number.

451
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,099
How do you know my number?

452
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,399
When a new semester starts, the
class president gets a list...

453
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:08,768
of emergency contacts.

454
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,645
You've never gotten it...

455
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,969
since I was the class president
for all three years.

456
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,029
Congratulations on graduating.

457
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:19,829
Let's keep in touch.

458
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:23,469
Sure.

459
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:25,729
Congratulations.

460
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,299
Okay, everyone to your seats!

461
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:39,129
You seem mature out of uniform.

462
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,298
Good work for the past three years.

463
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,498
Your uniforms that you handed down
will be given to the new students.

464
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:47,769
I won't bore you by talking too long.

465
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:50,269
That's all. Congratulations.

466
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:56,768
The parents waiting outside may come in...

467
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,829
and give your child a hug.

468
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:00,329
Okay.

469
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,068
Hello.

470
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,598
Hi.

471
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,499
My sweetie.

472
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,698
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

473
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:10,399
- Hello.
- Thank you.

474
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:12,228
Hello.

475
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,228
- How have you been?
- Hello.

476
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:16,645
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

477
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,969
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

478
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:21,829
Hello.

479
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:48,068
Good job.

480
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,469
I'm sure your mom would be very proud.

481
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,829
Take this and eat with your family.

482
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:07,769
Why...

483
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,329
did you hug me?

484
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,529
Because you're lovely.

485
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:19,019
When I was blessing your mom with you,

486
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,405
I was happy.

487
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:23,899
I was happy.

488
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,629
Congratulations.

489
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:53,869
Child.

490
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,239
Couldn't you have been a better teacher?

491
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,299
Couldn't you have been a kinder teacher?

492
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,369
What's wrong with me?

493
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:45,599
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

494
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:33,769
Okay.

495
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:35,529
Here.

496
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,429
Here.

497
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:43,238
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,769
One or two out of 100...

499
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,069
are born with the same face
as in their previous life.

500
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,868
(Late Joseon, 12th year
of King Chuljong's reign)

501
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,029
What is it, Sir?

502
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,799
Do you not feel well?

503
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:19,629
No.

504
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,599
Now, I can see...

505
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:23,968
into their future life, too.

506
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:25,239
Future life?

507
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:27,668
How far into the future?

508
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,328
They speak Joseon's language,

509
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,238
but there is much foreign
language mixed in.

510
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,529
Has the world become one?

511
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,599
It is difficult to comprehend.

512
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,069
That is not all.

513
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,268
They stroke a tiny scrap of metal...

514
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,739
as if it were a newborn baby...

515
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,369
and hold it dearly to them
as if it were a loved one.

516
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,238
I do not understand...
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

517
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,745
This black and blue item...

518
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,969
shall be used widely.

519
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:56,869
Remember.

520
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,329
It looks like this.

521
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,429
Click.

522
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,239
Click.

523
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:22,669
If you wish to invest,

524
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:24,169
invest in that.

525
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,069
Yes, Sir.

526
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:44,069
You look pretty.

527
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,699
Mom, you take these.

528
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,269
You had stopped by...

529
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,799
without even knowing.

530
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,829
What are you doing?

531
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,399
It's incredible.

532
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,199
How did I see you back then?

533
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,768
When? In the classroom?

534
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:05,769
No.

535
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:07,599
From much farther away.

536
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,299
It was...

537
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,269
a strange and beautiful occurrence.

538
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,969
Exactly...

539
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:17,569
what?

540
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,069
In late Joseon, 12th year
of King Chuljong's reign,

541
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:21,899
I met her.

542
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:24,239
Who?

543
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,505
My first love.

544
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,529
Why this man.

545
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,299
I didn't ask and I don't want to know.

546
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:33,869
Where did you get such an attitude?

547
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,968
It is very rude.

548
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:37,868
I was born this way, okay?

549
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:40,528
I didn't ask and I don't want to know.

550
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,629
I do want to know.

551
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,568
Where did you get these flowers?

552
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:47,698
Was it that punk Tae Hee?

553
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:48,968
Tae Hee didn't come.

554
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,468
If he did, I'd be with him now.

555
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,899
I have someone who gives me
things like blades of grass.

556
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,569
Don't bum around.

557
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,629
Take pictures for me.

558
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,328
Here. If you press this,

559
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:05,599
- I know.
- It'll...

560
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:08,429
I'm surprised.

561
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,668
I don't have any pictures from graduation.

562
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:15,499
I'll cherish this for life.

563
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,268
Why must you be so
melodramatic about one photo?

564
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:19,899
How can I take your picture then?

565
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,429
Don't move.

566
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,568
You should count first.

567
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:41,668
You can't just take the picture.

568
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,099
You look pretty regardless.

569
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,529
Isn't our school nice?

570
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,399
It is.

571
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,598
There were some things...

572
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,599
- I really didn't like about it.
- How could you be late?

573
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:14,599
Can you smile for me?

574
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,238
There were also things I
really liked about it.

575
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,239
All right.

576
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:26,739
Good things must come late.

577
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:28,399
Like you.

578
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,329
I came early but I didn't
know which class you were in.

579
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:34,798
I'm not talking about that.

580
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:37,405
Don't be disappointed that I came alone.

581
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,999
Deok Hwa's at work...

582
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:43,329
and the Grim Reaper is in a
very bad mood right now.

583
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,129
They did send their regards.

584
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:52,899
Then who are those two?

585
00:41:57,629 --> 00:41:59,368
Those two aren't here for you.

586
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:02,129
They're here to see someone who
they thought would be here.

587
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:04,199
My gosh.

588
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,329
That means...

589
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,469
Mister. The door. Open it.

590
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:17,198
You must be here to
celebrate her graduation.

591
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,798
That's my excuse.

592
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,329
I'm here to see someone else.

593
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,819
Luckily, that person is
standing in front of me.

594
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:28,739
I thought I could make up
my mind if I saw your face.

595
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,329
Now that I'm looking at your face,

596
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:33,799
I'm just happy.

597
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:46,968
How is that research going? Is it finished?

598
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,798
Why won't you tell me what it's about?

599
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,869
That's supposedly what I'm here for.

600
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,628
It's not finished yet.

601
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:54,998
When you do finish your research,

602
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:57,699
we'll run into each other and
you'll give my ring back.

603
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:04,568
This is for the part-timer.

604
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:06,229
That's why I bought these.

605
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:15,668
Why are you giving these to me?

606
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:17,499
That's why I bought these.

607
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,728
Regardless of who I am,

608
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,799
I wanted to give you flowers at least once.

609
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,369
Who are you, Woo Bin?

610
00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:35,529
You won't believe me,

611
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:40,029
but I don't really know either.

612
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:44,569
I don't know who I am.

613
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:48,568
You, people, must have the tendency
to say unbelievable stories...

614
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:51,369
and must be unreliable people.

615
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,498
This thing between us is
really not going to work.

616
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,399
I hoped it wouldn't come to this,

617
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:58,769
but it keeps looking like a tragic ending.

618
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:36,899
It's a gift.

619
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,628
Now that you've graduated
and became an adult,

620
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:40,768
you should use this as you wish.

621
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:42,628
I can't use this yet.

622
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:45,568
Legally, I need my aunt's consent.

623
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:47,598
It got handed over to you legally.

624
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,829
It's yours now.

625
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,199
Really?

626
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:53,699
But how?

627
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,168
Thank you.

628
00:44:58,169 --> 00:45:00,299
It's from your mother, not me.

629
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,099
I'm just a messenger.

630
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,699
Still, thank you.

631
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:10,469
Gosh, I don't think I'll be able
to spend even a penny from this.

632
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:12,899
It's such a precious gift from my mom.

633
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:15,498
I don't think I'll be
able to spend any of it.

634
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:16,999
Use it as you wish.

635
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,869
That's probably what she wants.

636
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,599
This is like her wish...

637
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:24,228
for a nine-year-old daughter...

638
00:45:24,229 --> 00:45:26,629
who has to live without her
mother for the rest of her life.

639
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:33,069
By the way, what about my relatives?

640
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:34,529
Are they doing well?

641
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,198
Gosh, it's so cold.

642
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,968
My face feels irritated...

643
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:41,468
from the cheap lotion.

644
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,899
How could I forget about
Eun Tak at that moment?

645
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:45,428
Where should I look for her?

646
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:48,098
You won't be able to find her now.
She probably graduated by now.

647
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,568
She must've gotten
admitted to a university.

648
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:51,098
We'll find her in one of
the universities in Seoul.

649
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:52,499
She was a good student.

650
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,868
That's right. You've gotten brighter...

651
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:58,798
after some time in prison.

652
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,468
Maybe the food here did her well.

653
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:02,899
You should eat more of it. Let's go.

654
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:05,598
You don't think she used
that money already, do you?

655
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,698
She doesn't know how to spend money.

656
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:10,245
She'll never spend that money
thinking about her mom.

657
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,868
We just have to find her now.

658
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,869
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

659
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:27,598
Do you want a beer?

660
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,769
I should go to bed.

661
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:32,968
Judging by the look on your face,
I guess it didn't go well.

662
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:34,428
So much for giving you two room.

663
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,099
I'm in trouble myself, but so are you.

664
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,899
What are you talking about?

665
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,369
The name card came.

666
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:41,999
Chairman Yu's?

667
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:44,369
No.

668
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:51,969
The Missing Soul's.

669
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:00,068
Death from a fall two weeks after.

670
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:01,629
You wouldn't be able to foresee it.

671
00:47:04,229 --> 00:47:05,868
Thanks for letting me know.

672
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:08,169
Is that all? Aren't you going to be mad?

673
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:10,268
Aren't you going to swear at the deity?

674
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,998
There will be dozens more of these.

675
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,119
I can't get surprised every
single time that happens.

676
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,699
That's true.

677
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:22,629
So pull out the sword and
return to ashes in peace.

678
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:25,869
Or death will keep coming to her.

679
00:47:26,899 --> 00:47:30,129
Do you think you can stop
it every single time?

680
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:32,898
Will I be able to stop it?

681
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:35,828
A time will come when you won't be able to.

682
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:37,628
Then Eun Tak will die...

683
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:39,999
and you will lose the
chance to return to ashes.

684
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,568
You will have to live another
1,000 years or an eternity.

685
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,228
Living in a fiery pit will be your life.

686
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,999
It'll be a foolish choice.

687
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,868
So pull out the sword...

688
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:51,499
and return to ashes.

689
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,969
It's sad but it's for the best.

690
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:57,729
I'm not going to try my best.

691
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,699
It is a bit sad, though.

692
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:08,499
Is there something wrong?

693
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:10,799
What is this?

694
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:13,869
It's a name card.

695
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,475
Whose? Yours?

696
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:20,499
No.

697
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:22,699
Yours.

698
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:31,569
Mine?

699
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,629
Am I...

700
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:36,699
going to die?

701
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:39,029
Listen to me carefully.

702
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:43,029
I've been keeping this from you.

703
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,698
You told me not to keep anything from you,

704
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:48,129
but this, I still did.

705
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:54,099
I don't think I should keep it
from you anymore so here it is.

706
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:55,969
You will die...

707
00:48:57,029 --> 00:48:59,329
if you don't pull out my sword.

708
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:01,829
That was your destiny...

709
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,569
since the moment you were
born as the goblin's bride.

710
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:08,169
If you don't pull out the sword,

711
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:12,899
death will keep coming to you.

712
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,299
Like this.

713
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:25,629
So if I don't pull out your sword,

714
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:28,799
death will keep coming to me...

715
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,369
until I die? Continuously?

716
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:36,099
Does that mean...

717
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:39,429
Those accidents...

718
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,169
Yes.

719
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:45,268
When you got abducted...

720
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:47,499
Gosh, you startled me.

721
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:49,999
At the ski resort...

722
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:54,699
An accident that would've taken
place on your day of interview...

723
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:57,499
And...

724
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:01,499
When I almost killed you...

725
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:11,599
The deity...

726
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:16,769
is so cruel...

727
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,899
to you and me both.

728
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:39,029
What kind of destiny is this?

729
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:55,629
Mister. I'll just die.

730
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:59,899
You'll keep on living,

731
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:02,969
so I'll come and see you
when I'm reincarnated.

732
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:07,329
Stay right here.

733
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,099
I'll come looking for you.

734
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:14,129
I promise.

735
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,269
- Shall we do that?
- Why don't I...

736
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,969
just pull out your sword?

737
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,128
If I die, you have to live all alone.

738
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,199
You might not find another bride.

739
00:51:33,029 --> 00:51:34,969
I'll just pull out your sword.

740
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:37,469
Wouldn't that be best?

741
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,599
- Shall we do that?
- Mister.

742
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:50,228
We should both die together.
That would be best.

743
00:51:50,229 --> 00:51:51,475
At the same time.

744
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:55,029
So no one has to suffer
alone with a broken heart.

745
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:07,629
Look at me, Eun Tak.

746
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:10,569
You won't die.

747
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:13,799
I won't let you die. I'll stop it.

748
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,329
I'll always stop it.

749
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:25,869
I'm sorry...

750
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:28,729
for putting you in this predicament.

751
00:52:29,169 --> 00:52:31,469
But we have to get through this.

752
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:35,899
I don't know what door will open,

753
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,029
but I won't let go of you. I promise that.

754
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,329
So trust me.

755
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:49,899
I might be a greater person
than you take me for.

756
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,328
Where are you going? It's dangerous.

757
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:06,128
I'm going to work, of course.

758
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:09,299
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- I heard and understood everything.

759
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,275
But I can't spend my life...

760
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:14,568
locked up at home like this.

761
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,969
Spending the rest of my days
trembling here in fear...

762
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:20,329
wouldn't be living at all.

763
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,605
Even if I were to die
tomorrow, I must live today.

764
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:28,405
I will go to work and
prepare to go to college.

765
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:32,229
I will walk the pavements I
did and come home as usual.

766
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:37,099
That is what life is.

767
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:42,029
Protect me with your life.

768
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:45,505
I will do my best to stay alive.

769
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:46,969
I trust you.

770
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:52,128
My mom had me and raised me.
Now, I got into college.

771
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,099
I have so many reasons to live.

772
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:58,129
An exceptionally big one happens to be you.

773
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,269
I get it, so if you think
you're in danger, summon me.

774
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,869
Don't climb any high places, okay?

775
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:08,899
You said I'd fall from a height.

776
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:12,699
Okay, don't worry. See you later.

777
00:54:55,969 --> 00:55:00,469
The streetlamp was flickering
and it seemed so dangerous.

778
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:08,169
That man looked so handsome.

779
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:11,169
Handsome men are very dangerous.

780
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:17,899
That outfit looks so pretty.

781
00:55:18,129 --> 00:55:20,729
Pretty clothes threaten my bank balance.

782
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:23,629
I just...

783
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:27,269
missed you so much that I couldn't breathe.

784
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:29,399
My life was in danger.

785
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:34,529
Mine, too.

786
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,129
I'm seeing all sorts of things now.

787
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:23,629
Am I actually seeing flowers
bloom in the middle of winter?

788
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:26,829
Are you about to die or something?

789
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,829
He's about 184cm tall.

790
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:00,099
His heels are about 2cm thick,

791
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:02,469
so he should be this tall.

792
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,746
He's about 184cm tall.

793
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:46,121
His heels are about 2cm thick,

794
00:59:46,145 --> 00:59:49,115
so he should be this tall.

795
01:00:35,246 --> 01:00:36,246
So this is...

796
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:38,076
who you were.

797
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:44,676
But...

798
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,276
I still don't get it.

799
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:53,306
What...

800
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:55,776
are you?

801
01:01:00,646 --> 01:01:01,906
I'm going to lose my mind.

802
01:01:03,476 --> 01:01:05,676
How could something so
utterly impossible...

803
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,376
How could someone who can't possibly...

804
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,606
But everything makes sense.

805
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:17,946
How you knew my name...

806
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:23,676
Why you didn't have a name...

807
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:28,776
Why all of your answers were so awkward...

808
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:38,576
You did something to me before, didn't you?

809
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,645
Don't do it this time, whatever it was.

810
01:01:41,646 --> 01:01:42,876
I won't.

811
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:48,446
I'll just...

812
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:50,606
let you catch on.

813
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:57,006
Just what are you? What are you?

814
01:02:00,646 --> 01:02:01,646
I am...

815
01:02:05,646 --> 01:02:07,146
a grim reaper.

816
01:02:11,146 --> 01:02:12,376
What?

817
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,206
I knew it was impossible,

818
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:21,746
but I dreamed of a happy ending.

819
01:02:28,646 --> 01:02:30,576
However, as expected,

820
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:37,006
it is a tragedy.

821
01:02:41,206 --> 01:02:42,246
Should we...

822
01:02:46,406 --> 01:02:47,746
break up?

823
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:25,005
Orientation ended earlier.

824
01:03:25,006 --> 01:03:27,045
I just finished adding my electives.

825
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:29,646
Now, I'm touring the campus.

826
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,245
Say, "I miss you." Add some hearts.

827
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:35,106
"I love you." Heart. Heart. Go on.

828
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,246
How romantic.

829
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,845
There were warm spring
days in my life, too.

830
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:43,005
It's just that every day that I
roam now, it is dark and deep,

831
01:03:43,006 --> 01:03:45,806
so every day is a dark,
winter night, that's all.

832
01:03:46,946 --> 01:03:49,275
I wish you'd meet that jerk just once.

833
01:03:49,276 --> 01:03:51,505
I wish you'd ask him just
one question for me.

834
01:03:51,506 --> 01:03:53,352
A question? What?

835
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:56,205
"Did you even love me?"

836
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:57,376
Something like that?

837
01:03:58,206 --> 01:03:59,406
How romantic.

838
01:04:00,776 --> 01:04:04,045
Fine. Let's put an end
to your winter nights.

839
01:04:04,046 --> 01:04:06,306
Let's get revenge. What
should I do to that jerk?

840
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:15,482
Will you start a fire?

841
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:17,206
Better safe than sorry.

842
01:04:34,006 --> 01:04:35,246
May I help you?

843
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:38,275
I need to tell you something...

844
01:04:38,276 --> 01:04:40,446
about your late wife.

845
01:04:40,846 --> 01:04:42,546
Lee Jung Hwa.

846
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:45,106
You're free, right?

847
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:58,645
How do you know my wife?

848
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:00,776
I'll get right to it.

849
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:04,876
She wanted me to relay a message.

850
01:05:05,646 --> 01:05:07,676
I see. Go ahead.

851
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:12,545
How have you been?

852
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:13,575
"How have you been?"

853
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,405
You look happy with Hee Jin.

854
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:17,306
"You look happy with Hee Jin."

855
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,446
That's what she says.

856
01:05:22,046 --> 01:05:24,076
- Who?
- Your wife.

857
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:30,205
How do you know Hee Jin?

858
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,745
You brought her home.

859
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:33,645
"You brought her home."

860
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:36,145
- On your 200th day anniversary, -
"On your 200th day anniversary,"

861
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:39,246
- you bought her a pretty bag...
- "you bought her a pretty bag..."

862
01:05:41,906 --> 01:05:45,645
- using my life insurance.
- "using my life insurance."

863
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:49,475
Are you serious? I'm
getting really angry now.

864
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,476
That day on the rooftop, is that why...

865
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:53,976
"That day on the rooftop, is that why..."

866
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:57,046
- You pushed me?
- "you pushed..."

867
01:06:13,946 --> 01:06:15,316
What did you...

868
01:06:15,946 --> 01:06:17,676
just make me do?

869
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:20,346
This is too big of a twist.

870
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:22,922
What are you?

871
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:25,505
I recorded your planning
the crime with Hee Jin...

872
01:06:25,506 --> 01:06:28,446
and hid it in the shoe closet.

873
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:29,846
Wait.

874
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:34,145
If you hid the recording of
their planning the crime...

875
01:06:34,146 --> 01:06:37,545
in the shoe closet, you should've
brought it to the police.

876
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:38,745
This isn't how you do it.

877
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:39,746
You.

878
01:06:39,946 --> 01:06:41,606
How did you know?

879
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:44,675
Whom are you talking to?

880
01:06:44,676 --> 01:06:45,976
That's right.

881
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:47,645
This should've been a sitcom.

882
01:06:47,646 --> 01:06:49,746
Why did you turn it into a thriller?

883
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:54,775
Your husband is so scary.

884
01:06:54,776 --> 01:06:57,475
You can't be this reckless,
or you'll kill us all.

885
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:59,005
I'm already dead.

886
01:06:59,006 --> 01:07:00,676
What? Hey.

887
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:02,245
You're so selfish.

888
01:07:02,246 --> 01:07:04,245
What about me? What about me?

889
01:07:04,246 --> 01:07:05,246
Are you...

890
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,206
a lunatic?

891
01:07:07,946 --> 01:07:10,575
Whom are you talking to?

892
01:07:10,576 --> 01:07:13,846
Your wife. Your wife whom you killed.

893
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:22,276
So you want to die, too.

894
01:07:33,206 --> 01:07:37,106
Young girls are so not careful.

895
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:40,876
Climbing onto the edge of a building...

896
01:07:46,106 --> 01:07:47,146
Don't you agree?

897
01:07:55,046 --> 01:07:56,376
Falling to my death.

898
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:04,316
I really didn't want to use
my boyfriend lifeline.

899
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,076
I'm worried how badly my boyfriend...

900
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:11,676
will punish you.

901
01:08:45,906 --> 01:08:47,446
I'm sorry.

902
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,746
Turn yourself in and
receive their punishment.

903
01:09:00,046 --> 01:09:02,206
If you receive mine, you shall die.

904
01:09:05,146 --> 01:09:06,906
I killed someone.

905
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:09,676
I killed my wife.

906
01:09:20,446 --> 01:09:21,646
I'm sorry.

907
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:24,846
I just wanted to tell him...

908
01:09:25,106 --> 01:09:26,476
that I was angry,

909
01:09:27,006 --> 01:09:28,206
that it hurt,

910
01:09:29,146 --> 01:09:31,076
and ask for help.

911
01:09:31,246 --> 01:09:33,106
Things I couldn't say back then...

912
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:35,676
I wanted to say them all.

913
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,045
She says she's sorry.

914
01:09:39,046 --> 01:09:41,946
Are you kidding me? You
almost died just now.

915
01:09:42,906 --> 01:09:44,146
I know.

916
01:09:44,906 --> 01:09:46,346
I'm sorry.

917
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:54,006
You should cross over
now to a better place.

918
01:09:54,276 --> 01:09:56,476
I think I need to get a scolding.

919
01:09:56,676 --> 01:09:58,316
Thanks for your help.

920
01:10:00,006 --> 01:10:01,476
Thanks for hearing me out.

921
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,046
Goodbye, Eun Tak.

922
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,746
Are you still mad?

923
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:25,676
You must be. You're going to be.

924
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:35,946
I'm not mad. I was just worried.

925
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:39,676
Then why do I feel like
I'm getting scolded at?

926
01:10:40,346 --> 01:10:42,605
My heart stings.

927
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,276
Not as much as mine does.

928
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:48,246
You have no idea what I went through
in the short period of an hour.

929
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:49,846
Gosh.

930
01:10:50,816 --> 01:10:52,846
We're so pathetic.

931
01:10:54,076 --> 01:10:55,076
No.

932
01:10:55,206 --> 01:10:57,076
Gosh.

933
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,076
Are we unfortunate then?

934
01:11:00,346 --> 01:11:01,446
No.

935
01:11:03,146 --> 01:11:04,276
Then...

936
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:07,476
do you think you're done...

937
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:09,676
scolding me?

938
01:11:11,076 --> 01:11:12,176
No.

939
01:11:13,176 --> 01:11:14,876
When I go to college,

940
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:16,675
I'll go on lots of blind dates...

941
01:11:16,676 --> 01:11:18,645
and only wear short skirts.

942
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,076
No.

943
01:11:28,816 --> 01:11:31,005
You seem worn out lately.

944
01:11:31,006 --> 01:11:33,176
Have you been working out?

945
01:11:34,676 --> 01:11:35,676
Is that funny to you?

946
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:39,775
I wanted to tell a joke
since you looked so down.

947
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:41,006
It wasn't funny.

948
01:11:41,816 --> 01:11:43,006
Why did you want to see me?

949
01:11:43,506 --> 01:11:47,675
Oh, right. You were supposed to
report two cases of missing souls.

950
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:49,275
But they only got one.

951
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,346
They told me to tell you to
hand in a statement of reasons.

952
01:11:51,446 --> 01:11:54,176
And that you should check
your office mail more often.

953
01:11:55,276 --> 01:11:56,675
I don't know the first
thing to report about.

954
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,506
What do you mean by that, Sir?

955
01:12:00,076 --> 01:12:01,815
I think it's been about 20 years.

956
01:12:01,816 --> 01:12:03,946
I came across a deceased soul...

957
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:06,045
and I had no information on it.

958
01:12:06,046 --> 01:12:07,506
Which deceased soul was it?

959
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:12,246
It seemed like it had been
roaming about for a long time.

960
01:12:13,176 --> 01:12:14,845
It seemed fearless.

961
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:17,975
I never saw a deceased soul who
didn't fear a grim reaper.

962
01:12:17,976 --> 01:12:19,176
I thought it was strange.

963
01:12:19,946 --> 01:12:21,346
I missed it, of course.

964
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:24,906
I reported it in like I
was asking for trouble.

965
01:12:25,406 --> 01:12:27,846
The report I didn't hand in is
the one on that deceased soul.

966
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,175
He's a new face.

967
01:12:31,176 --> 01:12:34,745
He's the one who has been
roaming about for a long time.

968
01:12:34,746 --> 01:12:36,275
Oh, that one.

969
01:12:36,276 --> 01:12:37,676
20 years ago,

970
01:12:38,106 --> 01:12:40,776
he even escaped from a grim
reaper after confronting one.

971
01:12:41,006 --> 01:12:44,006
Really? I had a similar
experience when I was nine...

972
01:13:49,606 --> 01:13:50,816
Nice to meet you.

973
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:55,876
So you are the goblin's bride.

974
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:47,106
(Goblin)

975
01:14:47,846 --> 01:14:50,905
Aren't you curious about who you are?

976
01:14:50,906 --> 01:14:52,816
Was what he gave me an answer?

977
01:14:53,776 --> 01:14:55,846
Or a question?

978
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:00,606
Forget me.

979
01:15:23,746 --> 01:15:25,776
You must have been very lonely.

980
01:15:28,006 --> 01:15:29,776
Please forgive me.

981
01:15:34,506 --> 01:15:36,746
I asked you if he really is Yeo.

982
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:39,206
He's finally here.

983
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:46,346
I'm going to do those things now.
