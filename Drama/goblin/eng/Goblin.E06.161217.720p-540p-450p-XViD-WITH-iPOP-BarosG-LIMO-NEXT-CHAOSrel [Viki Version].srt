♬ <i> Loneliness, loneliness <i> ♬</i></i>

5
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,380
I saw this sword since we first met.

♬ <i> Which made everyone pass by me <i> ♬</i></i>

7
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,370
Then what am I now? Am I still not

8
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,780
the Goblin's bride?

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,580
Am I not?

10
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,970
I think you are.

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,050
Really? Then... do I get the effective value now?

12
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,470
So you are not leaving anymore?

13
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,070
For now.

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,720
How did you live until now? Doing what?

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,380
I was living waiting for you.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,940
Be quiet.

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,920
I said it quietly.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,430
Then, if you're depressed, it rains. What happens when you feel good?

19
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,610
Pass.

20
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,080
Don't tell me flowers are going to bloom or something?

21
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,800
No. Next question.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,920
- Can you fly?<br>- That's a piece of cake.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,760
- Show me next time.<br>- I will.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,940
About me... What place bride am I?

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,430
You're the first and last.

26
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,680
Let's say I am the first,

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,300
but how do you know I'll be the last?

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,750
Because I've decided it to be.

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,480
What if...

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,660
I decide not to be your bride, what happens?

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,180
Ah... Then this sword won't get pulled out.

32
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,930
Only you can do it. You need to take this sword out for me...

33
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,730
for me...

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,230
to be pretty.

35
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm not pretty now.

36
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,760
Ahhh. Is it that?

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,060
In fairy tales, the cursed prince meets his true love

38
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,950
and turns back to himself. That?

39
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,370
In The Frog Prince, from frog to prince.

40
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,480
In The Beauty and the Beast, from beast to prince.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,520
And a Goblin goes from being a Goblin to a broo---

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,390
Let's pull it out some other time. At the moment when we need a broom.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,250
You have no idea.

44
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,830
I'm the crazy one for laughing at this situation.

45
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,450
Fine. Some other time, then.

46
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,910
Not today. Tonight, just let me laugh with you.

47
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,450
When the first snow comes?

48
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,700
First snow?

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,690
You need a broom then.

50
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,560
When the first snow comes.

51
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,590
Mister!

52
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,030
<i>Mass is not proportional to volume.</i>

53
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,580
<i>A girl as small as a violet.</i>

54
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>A girl who moves like a flower petal</i>

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,610
<i>is pulling me toward her with more force than Earth's mass.</i>

56
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,080
<i>Just then, </i>

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,690
<i>like Newton's apple, I rolled toward her without stopping until I fell on her...</i>

58
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,060
<i>with a loud thud.</i>

59
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,870
<i>With a thump.</i>

60
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,470
The red carpet is awesome! You were the one who did it, right?

61
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,570
It's so fascinating!

62
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,260
Mister...

63
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,660
<i>My heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.</i>

64
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,660
Mister, are you mad?

65
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,850
<i>It was first love.</i>

66
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,560
This is my second time here. I might be a regular at this rate.

67
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,860
We sat there back then.

68
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,660
Welcome to Quebec! Please have a seat.

69
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,860
<i>That's what I mean. It's not as though I've been abroad before...</i>

70
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,630
<i>Why would you go abroad when you're in your nines? (thought to be dangerous) </i>

71
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,290
<i>When I was 29, I didn't even go to the supermarket in front of my house. </i>

72
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,860
- Really?<br><i>- I didn't have any appointment?</i>

73
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,800
But I'm getting around so well for someone who's never been abroad before.

74
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,530
I only get lost a little and I don't skip meals and I can eat a cow.

75
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.

76
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,070
<i>It's the man that has to be nice, not the restaurant.</i>

77
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>I have to go. I'm sleepy.</i>

78
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,630
Okay. Have a good night.

79
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,870
CEO, over here.

80
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,320

82
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,690

83
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,360
<i>by your side.</i>

84
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,310
<i>My life of eternity</i>

85
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,580

<i>The time after my death</i>

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
<i>you are still here.</i>

88
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,820
<i>You've forgotten me</i>

89
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,750
<i>and your life is perfectly complete with me gone.</i>

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,990
<i>I have to disappear</i>

91
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,150
<i>to make you smile.</i>

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,130
<i>This is the decision I have to make.</i>

93
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,300
<i>I have to end my life.</i>

94
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,060

♬ <i> Even when you're not there </i> ♬

100
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,600
In the end,

101
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,560
that's the decision I made.

102
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,530
♬ <i> I will leave </i> ♬

103
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,320
I must seem human, so let's walk.

104
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,500
Get in!

105
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,620
No human can walk all the way to Incheon.

106
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,540
Are you sure I'm allowed to join you?

107
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,360
I told him to bring a friend, too.

108
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,390
You need to see a guy when he's with a friend.

109
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,730
Their stories don't add up and they make a mistake. And that mistake is that man's real self.

110
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,580
Even if they make a mistake, how I'd love to meet men like them.

111
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,820
What kind of women do you think they date?

112
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,030
Look at the car, clothes, watch and looks.

113
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,780
Some wench must be so happy.

114
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,960
Yeah, I'm happy.

115
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,360
Pull the sword out. Right now.

116
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,760
Please!

117
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,090
You come out suddenly and what?

118
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,160
- Earlier I knocked but you didn't answer. <br>- So I'm out here to answer you.

119
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,800
I want to end it now.

120
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,490
What?

121
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,970
The thought that I could choose.

122
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,000
Earlier, the choice you made at last. That?

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,110
What is that? Exactly what choice...

124
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,020
did you make?

125
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,070
Only answers, no questions.

126
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm sorry, but for that,

127
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,480
my research isn't done.

128
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
What research?

129
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,370
I found your name on the Internet.

130
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,210
There's nothing about your life, or anything.

131
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,350
Like someone erased it all.

132
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,770
You said this to me before.

133
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,770
That when I discover something about you,

134
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,210
I'd resent you a lot.

135
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,110
That "what" is the sword.

136
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,310
And I discovered it.

137
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,770
But I don't resent you and you said I'd resent you.

138
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,790
Which means there's something else still remaining. That's why.

139
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,110
That sword...

140
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,080
You said it was by someone you thought would never do it.

141
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,510
Are you by chance, someone who did something bad,

142
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,030
that your records in history were erased?

143
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,630
If you're getting punished for doing something bad,

144
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,770
it's not quite right to pull out the sword.

145
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,740
Are you by chance...

146
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,470
Treasonous...

147
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,340
Did you commit something like that?

148
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah. What was said is true.

149
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,530
It was a busy life just to survive.

150
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,040
They were times not recorded in history.

151
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,770
I put all my efforts into it,

152
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,150
but even my death was not honorable.

153
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,430
<i>I marched toward the King. </i>

154
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,980
<i>Nothing was improved. </i>

155
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,450
<i>But I went. </i>

156
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,320
<i>And my each and every step... </i>

157
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,880
<i>Innocent lives were lost by it. </i>

158
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,090
<i>My crime was not forgiven. </i>

159
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,320
And now I'm amidst my punishment.

160
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,280
This sword

161
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,720
is that punishment.

162
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,350
But...

163
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,640
even if that's a punishment,
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

164
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,980
isn't 900 years of it plenty?

165
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,200
No.

166
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,190
It couldn't be a punishment. A god doesn't

167
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,540
give you that power as a punishment.

168
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,800
If you were truly a bad person,

169
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,510
if you were truly a bad person,

170
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,680
he'd only create a goblin.

171
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,840
He wouldn't have him meet the goblin bride,

172
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,010
and have her pull out that sword.

173
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,030
I don't know what kind of an existence you had,

174
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,890
you are being loved. For real.

175
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,010
What I meant by something bad,

176
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,760
was something like falling in love with the king's woman,

177
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,410
and you were imprisoned for it. That was my version.

178
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,050
I'm sorry I mentioned treason.

179
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,810
Then now,

180
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,920
could you make me pretty?

181
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,210
Yes. I can't.

182
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,630
So mean.

183
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,160
You lived with that thought daily for 900 years?

184
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,890
Then, you were in despair every day for 900 years.

185
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,140
You're so pitiful.

186
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,920
Um... could we come to a consensus?

187
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,290
I'm so sad so I'm crying.

188
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,500
But how can you keep asking with words only?

189
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,280
Doesn't it occur to you that

190
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,180
you really don't work hard at trying to get pretty?

191
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,180
- What did you say? <br>- You heard me.

192
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,710
I know this because I have been pitiful, too. But for your information, when you're pitiful,

193
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,190
something more concrete is better than just pity.

194
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,630
It's time for me to go to my part-time work.

195
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,980
While I am away for my work, think about it hard.

196
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,960
What I might want? You're more pitiful than me.

197
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,290
I'm going to scold them all for you.

198
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,130
Wait, what do you want?

199
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,000
Money, house, jewels, that?

200
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,720
Would it really be that?

201
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,560
Then, by chance, that thing that if you need it

202
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,320
I could do it for you. That?

203
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,200
What, love?

204
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,720
Buy a house filled with jewels with money.

205
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,370
And fill it with love. You couldn't think of that?

206
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,480
- You go. Hurry and go to your work. <br>- I already told you.

207
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,530
I guess maybe because you used to be a military officer that you are not good at memorizing.

208
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,290
Hey! There's no distinction in one's career.

209
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,130
Hey, that's belittling a job!

210
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,010
She consoles me and she cries along with me but she won't pull the sword out for me.

211
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,550
How did she get to that conclusion in the midst of that sadness?

212
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,900
CEO, over here.

213
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
She met the CEO amidst that.

214
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,840
While the one who is to die, dies.

215
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,110
- CEO? <br>- Over here. <br> - Over here?

216
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,660
She is a makeup artist and I'm self-employed.

217
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,560
Your friend, pardon me, but what kind of an occupation do you have?

218
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm not a friend but a much younger brother and my occupation is third-generation heir.

219
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,890
Maybe that's why I'm getting punished.

220
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,830
A punishment like you.

221
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm Yoo Deok Hwa.

222
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,560
Oh, right.

223
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,620
And you?

224
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,130
What line of work are you in?

225
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,270
You don't have an occupation?

226
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,440
A type of service rank.

227
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,210
The details are work-confidential.

228
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,850
I hope you understand.

229
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,650
Then, today, do you have a name?

230
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,010
Kim Woo Bin.

231
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,810
Service rank? I guess a waiter?

232
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,540
They can hear you, girl.

233
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,820
Do you have a business card? Give me one and I'll come by.

234
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,080
Business card?

235
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,090
So I should have something each time.

236
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,910
If you tell me in advance, next time, I'll prepare...

237
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,820
You really were an heir?

238
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,380
Yes. I was born and that's how it was.

239
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,810
I guess that's when he's getting successor training.

240
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,500
Look how he's eating ox bone soup.

241
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,970
I didn't recognize you.

242
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,710
Since tall, rich, young and handsome only exists in fantasies.

243
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm Sunny.

244
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,410
Your name is so cool.

245
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,890
Yoo Deok Hwa.

246
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,820
You, too, Sunny. Your name's cool, too.

247
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,810
Wow, so sensible. You understand so quickly.

248
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:46,460
But did it just get darker in here?

249
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,150
I'll go first.

250
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,150
- Go ahead. <br>- Say that.

251
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,590
I'll go first.

252
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,550
You, too.

253
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,850
I'll go first.

254
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,020
Forget what I just did.

255
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,810
Where did everyone go?

256
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,720
They left because they are busy.

257
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,470
How did they both go?

258
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,320
She isn't someone who does that.

259
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,890
This, let me give you.

260
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,670
It's alright.

261
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,980
You grabbed it first.

262
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,920
But you paid for it, Woo Bin.

263
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,580
Since it suits you better.

264
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,660
Alright. I'll take it then.

265
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,780
Since I got a ring from you, can you give me the phone number?

266
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,390
My number is the one I called you from yesterday.

267
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,210
Not yours. The third-generation heir.

268
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,370
My friend took the business card so I don't have his contact.

269
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,420
I don't feel right asking her about it.

270
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,660
If he's really the Yoo Deok Hwa of Cheonwoo Group,

271
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,370
he's my owner.

272
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,040
Owner?

273
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,490
Building owner.

274
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,640
So give me his number, please.

275
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,150
I have a lot to tell him.

276
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,220
Just a minute.

277
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,780
Let me see. It'll be faster...

278
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,460
Did you throw it at me? To someone who's helping you?

279
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,830
I was just caught off guard. Thank. Thank you.

280
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,500
Alright. What's the pattern. Or passcode?

281
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,760
I don't have any.

282
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,180
Every time, you really have so many don't have's.

283
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,500
I guess you know the goblin and his wife?

284
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,890
Well, somehow.

285
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,870
What enterprise is this goblin in? Catering?

286
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
The goblin I know runs a rice cake shop.

287
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,040
The goblin I know is just in the enterprise.

288
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,910
You are really a strange person.

289
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,700
Does human medicine work on you?

290
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,850
I chose between alcohol and medicine.

291
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,590
Did the meeting go well for you?

292
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,570
I'm drinking alcohol.

293
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,740
She says I'm a strange person.

294
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,300
Since I have a lot of not have's. Especially, a business card.

295
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,420
You fooled her well when you're not a person.

296
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,770
Is it bipolar or depression?

297
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,410
It's ache.

298
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,520
<i>You are just a side effect that came from defying the principle of not getting involved in human life and death. </i>

299
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,410
<i>There's the method of you just dying as the original principle had you do. </i>

300
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,520
<i>If that's needed, then I'll do that too. </i>

301
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,240
<i>I love you. </i>

302
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,200
The words I spit out are all coming back to me.

303
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,230
The side effect of messing with human life and death is too big.

304
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,450
This is the worst.

305
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,510
You only got tall (and still immature).

306
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,820
Since I have lived this much already,

307
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,100
I should be able to live without spitting out words that I shouldn't.

308
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,920
Maybe I deserve to die.

309
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,160
There's no death deserving death.

310
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Really?

311
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,750
Though the issue is there are exceptions.

312
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,530
I thought you'd laugh.

313
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,980
Why did you take the medicine? Did something happen with the miscellaneous omitted?

314
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,850
No, we were just talking this and that she cried, saying I was pitiful.

315
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,850
So I had my hopes up. She said she cried because she was sad but she won't pull the sword out for me.

316
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,370
Not like only she cried.

317
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,830
You cried? In front of the miscellaneous omitted?

318
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,820
Like very briefly. It was barely.

319
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,440
Pathetic. You're done now.

320
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,150
Women like the uncaring and indifferent ones that won't look them in the eyes.

321
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,220
Those kind of men. How you show your tears . . .

322
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,190
So you cried the first time right away?

323
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,140
Drink up!

324
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,600
You better make your decision quick one side or the other. Good or bad.

325
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,170
You're not Hamlet.

326
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,380
That buddy Shakespeare.

327
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,300
We only talked about living or dying and he ended up writing that grand masterpiece.

328
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,970
Are you feeling unwell? Should we go to the hospital?

329
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,250
Can it be treated?

330
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,070
Are you not familiar with placebo effect?

331
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,310
- Maybe some consulting. <br>- The sword started to ache.

332
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:23,660
If god truly only gives you only what you can handle,

333
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,340
then I wonder if he's overestimated me too much.

334
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,580
Since you are feeling down, do you want a hug?

335
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,340
Well, if you hate the thought that much...

336
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,460
Gosh, you are annoying. Stop it!

337
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,220
As expected, it's so beautiful. It does belong to me.

338
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,850
Did you buy a ring?

339
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,600
No, a man gave it to me. That man..

340
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,970
Wow, the man from the pedestrian crossing? Did you meet?

341
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,890
When? How is he?

342
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,110
He is still handsome and still very strange.

343
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,060
He is very strange, however as soon as I see his face I forget about everything.

344
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,410
By the way, that looks like a very old ring.

345
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,900
Once, I also got a ring.

346
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,090
I will get my revenge on that jerk. A bloody revenge,

347
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,760
There's order even in the afterlife. Let me leave first!

348
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,930
Goodness, my poor child!

349
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:14,910
For my child's sake, can you please ask the Goblin for the winning lottery number?

350
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,210
I've heard you helped that girl last time.

351
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,190
Can you go and find out the lottery numbers for me while we're at it and let me know,

352
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,980
and you go buy a ticket too. That'd be so nice.

353
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,010
I'm home!

354
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,920
Do you know something?

355
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,550
Do you know that your very existence is a paragon?

356
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,730
The way you always keep books near you is so dashing. I want to model after that.

357
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,120
Wow. How is it that you can fill the universe with just one watch?

358
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,020
Art is sitting on your wrist.

359
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,250
So this is why I'm saying this, but do you by chance know this week's winning lottery numbers?

360
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,890
Why do you need to know the winning number?

361
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,590
If I know the winning numbers, I might find time to remove the sword.

362
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,820
4, 10, 14, 15, 18, 22.

363
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,720
Thank you.

364
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,650
Goodness me!

365
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,390
Are you following me?

366
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,090
I'm tracking you.

367
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,830
That grandmother is fine. She was very nice when she was alive so she deserves this much.

368
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,670
What's the use of a ghost knowing the winning numbers?

369
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,260
She will show up in her children's dreams and let them know the winning numbers

370
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,630
If that's all, I'm going to the library then. The exams are approaching.

371
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,570
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

372
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,360
I want 10 tickets.

373
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,720
Minors cannot buy lottery tickets.

374
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,860
What? That's nonsense!

375
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,780
There is a law like that, student.

376
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,830
I will take 10 tickets.

377
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,710
Show me your identity card.

378
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,650
Mister, this is a secret.What I'm about to tell you is a huge.

379
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,110
There are guardians in this world.

380
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,230
So right now, you are meeting your guardian.

381
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,580
Please believe me!

382
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Mister,

383
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,400
these are today's winning numbers.

384
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,980
I will give you money to buy the ticket and then we split it in half.

385
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,490
Deal?

386
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,160
Get out!

387
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,020
It's true!!! I'm serious! I don't have time.

388
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,800
Is this the library?

389
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,690
This is the last store on the way to the library. I stopped by to buy milk.

390
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,260
You didn't buy milk, but lottery tickets.

391
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,940
How come you know everything all the time?

392
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,940
That's right. I was trying so hard to get them, but I couldn't. Happy now? I don't even know if grandmother's son bought it or not.

393
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,290
He didn't buy it. He works all the time, he didn't had time to sleep.

394
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,790
What am I going to do now? You should have made him go to sleep.

395
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,930
It was a hard year for his farm. It only rained in Seoul. Only in Seoul!

396
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm not the one who is in charge of rain.

397
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,490
What are you talking about?

398
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,700
There will be no winner this week, so the winning will be carried over.

399
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,320
So what does that mean?

400
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,700
They are a nice and hardworking couple. They will have a very strange dream.

401
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,670
The guardian will replay them.

402
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,560
Really?

403
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,590
Then... will you help them win next week?

404
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,800
You are so cool!!

405
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,300
You still won't be able to buy the ticket next week. Why are you happy?

406
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,990
It's not like I will never be able to buy it.

407
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,550
I will turn 20 in 2 months. Saturday comes every week, and Saturday nights are nice.

408
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,910
Lottery ticket - Goblin! Bang!

409
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,080
Don't talk to me!

410
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,390
Wow, they are all correct.

411
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,600
You got them all correct!

412
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,790
Are you ok, Mister?

413
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:48,540
Really? Oh, thank you! I'm so thankful.

414
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,500
I will let Mister know.

415
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,360
How come these days I don't see the girl who lived at the hostel?

416
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,040
Thanks to you, she went up there.

417
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,420
She sorted out all her deep sorrows.

418
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,960
Then, grandmother too...

419
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,710
Darling, you too... together with goblin

420
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,950
you should live happily. Okay?

421
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,780
Cheers!

422
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,110
Mister, when I die can I meet god?

423
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,640
Why do you ask?

424
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,960
I want to demand an explanation

425
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,720
The goblin is such a lonely guardian.

426
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,630
People are not aware of it.

427
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,600
When people are about to leave this world, someone holds them back.

428
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,700
But I know.

429
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,200
That's why I plan to remove the sword.

430
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,860
What did you say?

431
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,890
If I do that he will become pretty and become a guardian that shines.

432
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,650
Hey, Eun Tak. No, missing soul. You are in no position to worry about someone else.

433
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,790
Once you lose your value, you could get kicked out. Are you fine with that?

434
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,110
It's not like any of these are mine.

435
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:46,870
Life is just a brief borrowing and a brief stay anyway.

436
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,860
Hell doesn't only exist in hell.

437
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,000
Where is your mom's insurance money?

438
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,990
Stop talking and just bring it here if you don't want to burst.

439
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,010
This is how you pay me back for raising you?

440
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,860
This way? This way?

441
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:12,450
Since I've moved here I've been happy every day. It's as if I'm seeing a little bit of heaven.

442
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,970
That;s why I want to pay back.

443
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm not sure what he means when he says he will become pretty, but thanks to your encouragements I will pull the sword out.

444
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,140
That means that something good will happen to him.

445
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,780
Hello grandmother!

446
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,630
Don't suffer anymore.

447
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,220
You hurt too much. Your mom is worried.

448
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,770
Good boy.

449
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,800
When I'm reborn,

450
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,680
get reborn, can I be Kim TaeHee?

451
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,570
Am I crazy? Why would I want meet you again my next life?

452
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,260
To be honest, I'm sick of you.

453
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,060
You bastard!

454
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,030
Where do I have to go now?

455
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,870
Just walk through that the door that you came in through.

456
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,130
Afterlife is on the other side.

457
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,450
Happy?

458
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,430
Is that you, Happy?

459
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,660
He felt bad for leaving you behind, so he's been waiting there all this time.

460
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,560
Happy knows the way.

461
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,790
Kim MiYoung...

462
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,010
... is a team leader.

463
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,240
These footsteps..

464
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,300
What do I do?

465
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,760
What to do? Kim Miyoung

466
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,210
Why in the world he won't answer his phone?

467
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,870
I can't meet him or talk to him over the phone. What's all these?

468
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm a Grim Reaper.

469
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,350
Us, grim reapers can only follow orders.

470
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,020
The person I believe that is called Sun Hee...

471
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,280
to others she is Sunny,

472
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,530
Should I kill this jerk?

473
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,290
So annoying. He hurt my pride.

474
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:14,230
Is this his way to make me fall hard for him? He makes me get ill because of anger.

475
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,270
Just you wait until I get a hold of you!

476
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,590
What was that? It scared me!

477
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,900
Your order his here. Please enjoy!

478
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,090
Thank you.

479
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,790
Did anything happened?

480
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,720
Do you believe in ghost?

481
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,120
Pardon?

482
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:55,300
No way! Oh my! There no such things as ghosts.

483
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,560
Right? There are no such things like ghost, right?

484
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,300
Of course not. When people said they saw ghosts, they made that up.

485
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,580
But... what's the matter?

486
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,690
It's nothing. Something strange happened to me.

487
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,210
Anyway, don't come to work for a while?

488
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,740
- Why not? - I saw the news. The entrance exams is coming up.

489
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,650
Focus on that and get perfect score.

490
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,350
If I get a perfect score, I can't go to college.

491
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,150
Really?

492
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,800
Then get a few wrong. The most difficult to answer.

493
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,200
Okay.

494
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,760
Think about it until I return from work.

495
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,200
Think about what I want the most.

496
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,650
If that is what you want, it is hard for me.

497
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,630
Life is walking towards me.

498
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,810
Death,

499
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,400
is walking towards me.

500
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,230
from life to death

501
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,170
You are

502
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,780
without tired walks towards me

503
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,260
then I,

504
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,430
I am muttering things like

505
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,530
I am not sad.

506
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,580
this words are enough

507
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,990
it should

508
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,100
be

509
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,560
What are you doing here?

510
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,250
Don't you see me?

511
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,100
I saw.

512
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,290
What? <br> You, walking.

513
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:22,560
ooo, that long. I am impressed.

514
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,460
But, when you looked that long, is there anything different?

515
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,550
Or always same.

516
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,580
what is?

517
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,990
before you said, You did not see me.

518
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,890
My 20 years old, my 30 years old,

519
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,600
Still, it is like that.

520
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,260
Yes,

521
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,920
I can not see your future properly.

522
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,700
Usually, I can say if their future is bad or good.

523
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,260
ohh I see.

524
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,280
It is because, I am a lost soul.

525
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,250
I thought it makes me special.

526
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,990
My desicions will make my future.

527
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,380
Don't worry. it is not like I am always sick.

528
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,580
Now, I am goblins bride who lives bravely accepts her fate.

529
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,740
But, i am curious to know

530
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,570
What is?

531
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,060
my 20 years old, my 30 years old.

532
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,380
You will be same.

533
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,420
What?

534
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,870
like now, you will be beautiful.

535
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,760
How do you know? I can be ugly one or two days.

536
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,550
It can be one or two months.

537
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,900
But, when you decide being guardian of someone

538
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,530
Do you have any criterias?

539
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,760
I don't have.

540
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,780
It depends on my mood on that day

541
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,670
If I have to choose between adults or children to help, I choose children.

542
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:14,400
it was a childs hand which holds me

543
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,120
When I was falling apart from world,

544
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,550
Grandfather.

545
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,520
Please accept me.

546
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,470
<i>From now on, I will attend to you.</i>

547
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,810
Ohhh.

548
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,460
then why did you help my mother?

549
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,700
my mother is an adult.

550
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,800
At that time, I was drunk and my heart was weak.

551
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,130
Your mother did not want to save herself, but

553
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,960
Ahjusshi who answered my mother who asked help

554
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,070
this is like a miracle

555
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,490
because I am happy.

I guess it is today,

00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,020
one or two days that you are being ugly

569
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,560
Ahh,

570
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,920
Please stop there.

571
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,870
I am teaching you something.

572
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,610
woah, What is this?

573
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,320
Tree.

574
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,050
I am not asking that. Ahjussi did that.

575
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:54,110
I did prune off, decorated.

576
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,020
whith that delicate hand, you did yourself.

577
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,700
Oh!

578
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,960
Those two hands need to have rest.

579
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,320
Ahjushi

580
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,500
whole time, I am sorry that I only thought myself.

581
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,830
I was worried that you would kick out me

582
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,760
it was funny that you were asking me pull out the sword.

583
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,570
After become pretty, I was worried If you go and meet other women.

584
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,600
You are not going to say, I was wrong.

585
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,980
Do I have to? <br> Petty.

586
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,860
I did not expect either. anyhow I decided

587
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,890
I am going to make you pretty.

588
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,460
good person like ahjussi's request's outcome won't be bad.

589
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,910
Where do I make you pretty? In front of pretty tree?

590
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,260
Now? <br>Yes, Why?

591
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,290
Today, right away.<br> Yes, early is good.

592
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:00,000
Phone call, someone calls me.<br> Hello, yes, I am coming now.

593
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,860
Aahh, you are holding phone wrong.

What? Did you die?

595
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,490
I am rehearsing. Is there any drink?

596
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,600
What happened?

597
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,330
She said she could pull out the sword.

598
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,170
she completely does not know what it means

599
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,430
I could not say it.

600
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,120
She likes me so much, it bothers me.

601
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,540
are you trying to make me angry or are you trying to make laugh?

602
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,560
You are like that cause you don't know. She likes me soo much.

603
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,560
As soon as she sees me, she says I love you, lets get married.

604
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,790
It troubles me alot. You don't know anything.

605
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,530
There is no reason for not like me

606
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,360
Why is not? How old are you?

607
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,060
When she goes to university, there will me many handsome and young men

608
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,400
I am 900 years old so what?

609
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,630
why do you always lessen your age? while you are 939 years old.

610
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:06,770
Because I born at the end of year, My age is one year less.

611
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,070
Ahh, I should not have laugh.

612
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,530
It was good than drink.

613
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:52,800
Should I move her away again. She is the only one who can end my life. But she makes me stay alive. Is nnot it funny<br> do not decept yourself, you lived very well without her.

614
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:05,940
Ahjussi are a goblin? Ahjussi are you really a guardian? Ahjussi you are a ghost, are not you?

615
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,320
I am happy that I met ahjussi

616
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,870
From now on Ahjussi, you won't leave, right?

617
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,500
I will get married with ahjussi.

618
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,280
Now, I will be upset when it rains cause I will think ahjussi is sad.

619
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,310
Ahjussi, who are you to decide I am valued or not

620
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,960
I do not need Ahjusshi, either.

621
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,320
Ahjussi

622
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,270
Red carpet, wauw. Ahjussi did that, right? It was totally fascinating.

623
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,990
Ahjussi.

624
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,830
Stop calling me.

625
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,590

626
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,760

Let's take this all the way to court!

646
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,260
- This thing, I will just...! <br> - What? You don't even know the law!

647
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,220
Do you know those loan sharks?

648
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,930
Oh, you starled me!

649
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,190
Hello,

650
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:03,850
Anybody sometimes knows a few loan...

651
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,630
What I am talking about? Because I'm surprised.

652
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,960
Do you know who I am?

653
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,090
It is not that I know you, I saw you. You were tailing Deok Hwa Oppa.

654
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,740
Ahh.

655
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,360
But how do you know those were loan sharks?

656
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,290
In past, I borrowed money from loan shark.

657
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,180
What?

658
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,380
I guess, Deok Hwa will be late? Lets go with my car.

659
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,310
What kind of grown-up loan sharks fight in front of an all-girls high school?

660
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:35,120
Hello, you're working hard. I'm in front of the girls high school.

661
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,010
He's a fascinating person...

662
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,840
What's the matter with you?!

663
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,080
- Ah, this thing. <br> - Stop! Cut it out!

664
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,720
Where do you think you are? Sit up straight.

665
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,360
So you fought? In front of the girls high school for no special reason?

666
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,160
Yes.

667
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,320
Everytime he drives, he goes there. It's all your fault, punk.

668
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,660
Then you should have stopped me before I got there. Why are you b******ing me now?!

669
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,290
See this? He makes me angry.

670
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:10,040
I, too, am about to get angry so answer me, huh? Why did you fight? Why?

671
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,430
Aren't you on the same side?

672
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,850
Yes.

673
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:23,060
Last time we fought, too, and ended up at the hospital for two weeks.

674
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:27,000
But... we fought again as soon as we got discharged.

675
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,720
We don't bother anyone else since we only fight each other.

676
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,010
These punks, are you joking around right now?

677
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,820
That's what I mean! It's no joke how we fight!

678
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,930
<i> You fought each other. For your information, you will never be able to get along.</i>

679
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,490
What is this?

680
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,520
We're not joking...

681
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,120
Deok Hwa Oppa is really nice.

682
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:03,830
He's kind and friendly and keeps his promises well.

683
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:13,470
He's very dependable and unlike a 3rd generation Chaebol, he's down-to-earth and simple.

684
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,320
I see.

685
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,420
Yes.

686
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,070
And he also tells me things that give me strength day to day.

687
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,280
For example?

688
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,750
I'm sorry.

689
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,570
I see.

690
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:40,290
♬ (humming) pick me, pick me, pick me up.

691
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,320
I'm home.

692
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,090
That, I taught him that. How to watch his eyes in front of a woman.

693
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,310
Something's going on with Mr. Gobling these days, right?

694
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:06,210
I don't know. He said he can't remember anything about his past.

695
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:09,090
What kind of things about his past?

696
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,970
Did you leave your memories with me? How would I know his thoughts?

697
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,130
I feel like you know...

698
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:24,050
I don't know. Just peel the garlic. Before I call out your name three times.

699
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:28,540
I'm sorry.

700
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:34,930
Even a hundred years ago, I had to call out the name three times. Now it's convenient. Just calling it out once does it.

701
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,600
That line of work must be hard, too.

702
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,820
Because of whom do you guess that my job has been difficult? Miscellaneously omitted?

703
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,400
Should I peel all the garlic myself?

704
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:58,000
Goblin, he was early-born (born Jan. to Feb. gets grouped with those born the year before ) so he's actually a year younger than his age.

705
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Pardon?

706
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,880
The only thing I can tell you is this. Good luck.

707
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
But...

708
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,850
when you and I first met I was 9 years old.

709
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:20,160
And then when we met again it was 19 years of age.

710
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:27,260
Let's say that we met when I was 9 because of my mom. But how did you find me when I was 19?

711
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:35,370
9, 19, 29...

712
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:39,320
The moment right before completion is when it's the most dangerous.

713
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,300
What are you talking about...?

714
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,760
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

715
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,540
Yes.

716
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:54,470
<i>You will meet a grim reaper when you are 29, too. Even if it's not me.</i>

717
01:02:54,470 --> 01:03:00,550
<i>That's the fate of the miscellaneously omitted. The world needs order.</i>

718
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:08,080
<i>And nine is the closest to god's perfect number 10 that's right before completion.</i>

719
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:12,220
<i>This, too, good luck with it.</i>

720
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,980
Why are you looking at me like that? What secret are you talking about?

721
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:22,290
I dreamed well that day. Ah, I could have gotten a special promotion...

722
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:26,880
What are you saying? Oh, laundry.

723
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,980
You finish the rest yourself.

724
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,360
Ahjussi.

725
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,100
What?

726
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:59,370
I can't tell exactly who is in a hurry. Do you see me now?

727
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,160
Yeah.

728
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,290
By chance, are you mad at me about something?

729
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,090
Why do you ask?

730
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:08,630
If you're not mad then why are you acting mad? How far back are you going to get mad about?

731
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,560
Why do I feel like you're mad at me for all of your accumulated anger?

732
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,560
When did I do that?

733
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,440
Right now too, you're angry at me.

734
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,080
Who do you think you are?

735
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,100
Exactly who are you that you keep calling me and causing a disturbance?

736
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:27,530
Why do you keep flustering me and confusing me? Who are you to?

737
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,700
It would have been nice if you pulled out the sword when I asked. Since that's your worth.

738
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,120
But I...

739
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:42,230
So, I told you I would pull the sword out for you.

740
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:46,580
The one who didn't talk to me or answer was you.

741
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:51,860
I thought maybe you were waiting for the first snow. Since that was what we first agreed on.

742
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:59,080
Never mind. Since you live forever, maybe you have plenty of time to waste, but because I'm an ordinary human being

743
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:06,100
time is gold and money. Until when do I have to be on standby? I'm busy too with school and work.

744
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:06,800
Tomorrow.

745
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,890
Why not today? I have time today.

746
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:14,730
Tomorrow. I don't want it to be today. The weather's too nice today.

747
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,370
I'm going to go for a walk with you.

748
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,510
Tomorrow.

749
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:26,820
What is it now? Let's just do it before I leave for school.

750
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,960
The weather is bad today. I have to come pick you up later.

751
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,170
Tomorrow. Just one more day.

752
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,190
Why not today again?

753
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,290
Just one more day...

754
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,390
Does he think I'd do it for free?

755
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,950
Master...

756
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,630
Be well...

757
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:27,160
I will follow you soon.

758
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:07,060
The fact that I'm going without finding those who I owe so much to, you could say it's my deep regret.

759
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:12,330
This picture, please burn it for me.

760
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,320
Master...

761
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,210
My young bride, even when I'm gone,

762
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:30,090
so that she'll eat well, learn well, and live well,

763
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:39,790
that is your last duty.

764
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:46,060
I will do as you ask, Master.

765
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,000
Master...

766
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,580
Please...

767
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,920
Card...!

768
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,970
Are you really giving t-this to me, Uncle?

769
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:18,970
Don't be upset anymore that you don't have a card and live freely, Deok Hwa.

770
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,100
- It's a reward from me.<br> - A reward?

771
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,430
Why am I getting a reward? I didn't do anything to be rewarded for.

772
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:35,470
You worked hard at growing up well.

773
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,370
I love you.

774
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,640
This kid.

775
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,910
I put the deed to the house in your room.

776
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,520
This is really your house now.

777
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,420
Please live long and well.

778
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:06,490
And I have a request.

779
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:13,350
When I disappear, that child's mark will disappear too.

780
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,310
Then at that time

781
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,690
please erase her memory.

782
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,520
So that she won't blame herself.

783
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,630
<i>What did you say? Speak up!</i>

784
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,110
<i>It's so noisy, I couldn't hear you!</i>

785
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,920
Put your headphone in!

786
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,920
I'm holding it away from my ear! I can at least see your face!

787
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,390
Ah... hey...

788
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,750
Let's hang up. I'm hanging up for your benefit.

789
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,850
If you need to call me, text me first.

790
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:59,570
I can't see your face! Are you holding it against your ear? Hello?

791
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,120
It's nice to go for a walk with you.

792
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,360
♬ <i> Beautiful Life, I will be by your side </i> ♬

793
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,940

01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,690
When did you come home?

797
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,090
It's nice to look at you.

798
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:51,420
Why are you being so nice to me these day? I'm getting suspicious..

799
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,260
Give me your hand for second.

800
01:10:54,060 --> 01:11:02,070

♬ <i> Beautiful, your heart </i> ♬

807
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,840
What does that word mean?

808
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,470
'Cheong', as in 'to hear'.

809
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:39,720
Ah, 'cheong' as in 'to hear'?

810
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,030
Thank you.

811
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,240
Ahjussi, good night.

817
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,910
Nice. Now all I have to do is translate it.

818
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:28,710
♬ <i> It's beautiful life </i> ♬

819
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,730
Why can't I translate it?!

820
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:14,170
I'm sure there's a clue in here somewhere!

821
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:18,140
I'm coming in for a second.

822
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,970
Oh, okay.

823
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,820
Awesome! What are all these?

824
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,550
I thought you might need them when you become an adult.

825
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,940
The $5,000 you'll know it better

826
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,920
and this is for when you get into college and have a boyfriend--

827
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,900
For when you go on dates. Prettily.

828
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,930
Why are you giving me these to me all of a sudden?

829
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,830
Oh, it smells nice.

830
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,660
- Today. <br> - Today what?

831
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,150
Sword.

832
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,870
Right now?

833
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,710
In the middle of the night?

834
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,910
Yeah. Now.

835
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:18,560
Okay. Just five minutes.

836
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,220
But...

837
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,840
could love be among these things, too?

838
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,890
No.

839
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:44,990
I was just asking. I'll be right out.

840
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:54,910
Wow!

841
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,220
There's always a cool place behind your door!

842
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,560
It's my first time seeing a buckwheat field. It's pretty.

843
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,880
By chance, were the flowers you gave me from here?

844
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,090
I still remember the meaning of those flowers.

845
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,790
Lovers.

846
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:25,220
But this must be a very special place. Seeing how you have to get the sword pulled out here.

847
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,720
My beginning and end.

848
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,190
I will ask of you.

849
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:37,740
Right now? Right away?

850
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,190
W-wait a minute. I'm all for you becoming pretty,

851
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:45,560
but after you become pretty, there's no more use for me

852
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,730
was what I was thinking, so I wrote down a few things.

853
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,480
<i> A and B's effective value . . .</i>

854
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,040
Instead of studying like I expected, this is what you've been doing?

855
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,410
You have the read the last condition, too.

856
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,440
<i>B will grant A's wish every year on the first day of snow. </i>

857
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,020
<i>Since A will be waiting.</i>

858
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,940
<i>You're really going to die?</i>

859
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,650
<i>Before the first snow falls. </i>

860
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:25,880
<i>- If the first snow falls... <br> - Why?</i>

861
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,740
<i>I don't want to ruin her first snow.</i>

862
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,030
This is why you asked my name?

863
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:38,970
No. I was actually curious about that.

864
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,990
It suits you. Your name and you.

865
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,920
You know what I mean, right?

866
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,440
It means this.

867
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,910
How did you know? It's really hard to understand.

868
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,500
Awesome.

869
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,840
It's snowing.

870
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:25,230
It's the first snow, Ahjussi. But how is it snowing already?

871
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:28,200
It's amazing.

872
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,270
I love it since it's pretty, but the flowers must be cold.

873
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:37,290
Right? We're enjoying the earliest snow fall in the world.

874
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:43,430
But this is your doing right? You said the sword will be pulled out on the first day of snow. It's that, right?

875
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,820
I'm sorry for being selfish,

876
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,910
but I wanted to have at least one of these kinds of memories.

877
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:59,840
But how long are you going to take to keep this memory? You have to hurry up and become pretty.

878
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,640
Yes. Now.

879
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,460
Now, then let's become pretty.

880
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,880
And your last words?

881
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:19,480
The time I shared with you was wonderful.

882
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,180
Because the weather was nice...

883
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,860
Because the weather was bad...

884
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,310
Because the weather was good enough...

885
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,020
I loved each day.

886
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,750
Also,

887
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,910
no matter what happens,

888
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:50,850
it's not your fault.

889
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,320
Ahjussi, by chance...

890
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:59,830
are you really turning into a broom?

891
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,220
Nothing of the kind will happen.

892
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:08,770
That's a relief. Then now I'm going to pull it out.

893
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,830
But.. why can't I grab it?

894
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:46,810
I see it but I can't pull it out.

895
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,880
Did you put enough strength into your hands?

896
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:55,290
Wait a minute, let me try again.

897
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,040
What you said earlier about how it's not my fault no matter what happens,

898
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,770
- you can't take it back. <br> - Hey, so you're...

899
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:21,910
- so you're not a Goblin's bride--<br> - You can't take it back!

900
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,040
Stay still! I'm the one who's more flustered.

901
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,500
I am still! How can I be more still? Give me that note so I can burn it.

902
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,430
Hold on!

903
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,960
I got it. I think it's that thing. I know that.

904
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,350
- What is it? <br> - The prince in a fairytale. The cursed prince. That.

905
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,610
What about that?!

906
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,910
The kiss.

907
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:09,250

912
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:34,610
So I held the sword,

913
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:37,950
but this thing, I can see it but I couldn't pull it out.

914
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,630
He came back alive somehow.

915
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,580
I don't think she's the Goblin's bride, so I think she should leave!

916
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,420
- Why the business card?<br> - I want to have one.

917
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,540
Isn't this Kim Woo Bin's phone?

918
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,150
- I can't answer because I don't have a business card.<br> - What do you want me to do about it?

919
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,500
- What do you like? <br> - Sunny.

920
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,950
Of course, it was my first kiss, but...

921
01:21:56,770 --> 01:22:00,880
- Are you okay? <br> - Tae Hee Oppa?

922
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,350
Who's Tae Hee? Come out.

923
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,920
Who are you?
