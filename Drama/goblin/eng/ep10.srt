2
-00:06:20,670 --> -00:06:17,700
What's the matter? Are you hurting?

3
-00:06:17,700 --> -00:06:15,230
Is it because of the sword?

4
-00:05:46,440 --> -00:05:44,530
Mister.

5
-00:05:42,430 --> -00:05:40,170
I can grab the sword.

6
-00:05:36,990 --> -00:05:34,820
Just wait a moment.

7
-00:05:34,100 --> -00:05:31,040
Wait just a minute, I'll
take it out for you.

8
-00:05:25,660 --> -00:05:23,780
It's moving!

9
-00:04:40,690 --> -00:04:37,920
The oracle was correct.

10
-00:04:35,160 --> -00:04:32,030
The future I saw was correct.

11
-00:04:30,490 --> -00:04:27,740
Through this child,

12
-00:04:26,620 --> -00:04:23,560
I will end this immortality

13
-00:04:22,120 --> -00:04:19,080
and be able to return to nothingness.

14
-00:04:12,160 --> -00:04:05,140
A human's lifespan is a hundred years at
most. That I wish to look back once more,

15
-00:04:04,480 --> -00:04:01,560
is that an immortal's life?

16
-00:04:00,770 --> -00:03:58,540
Or is it your face?

17
-00:03:54,520 --> -00:03:51,940
I think it's your face.

18
-00:03:51,910 --> -00:03:50,250
Go.

19
-00:03:36,250 --> -00:03:34,970
Pickpocket!

20
-00:03:34,970 --> -00:03:32,520
It's a pickpocket!

21
-00:01:42,000 --> -00:01:38,180
Because your greatest wish will come true.

22
-00:01:38,180 --> -00:01:37,010
What do I want?

23
-00:01:37,010 --> -00:01:35,350
You want that child to live.

24
-00:01:35,350 --> -00:01:30,790
If you don't return to
nothingness, Eun Tak will die.

25
-00:01:28,610 --> -00:01:26,500
So,

26
-00:01:24,600 --> -00:01:18,240
Mister asked me to become his bride

27
-00:01:18,240 --> -00:01:14,880
so I could pull out the
sword and he would die?

28
-00:01:09,210 --> -00:01:03,060
So you're saying that if
I pull out that sword,

29
-00:01:01,810 --> -00:00:58,540
Mister will die?

30
-00:00:54,960 --> -00:00:52,950
So,

31
-00:00:49,540 --> -00:00:42,400
if I remove that sword,
Mister will disappear

32
-00:00:42,400 --> -00:00:39,280
from this world? Completely?

33
-00:00:27,500 --> -00:00:25,090
She was born with a fate
to pull out the sword.

34
-00:00:25,090 --> -00:00:21,360
No, you caused her to
be born with that fate.

35
-00:00:17,320 --> -00:00:14,080
If she fails to fulfill her role as
a tool, she will cease to exist.

36
-00:00:14,080 --> -00:00:10,610
Because there's no reason for her existence.

37
-00:00:10,610 --> -00:00:08,643
If the sword continues
to remain inside you,

38
-00:00:08,631 --> -00:00:06,520
death will keep appearing
in front of that girl.

39
-00:00:06,520 --> -00:00:04,180
It has already happened several times.

40
-00:00:02,910 --> -00:00:01,410
You wench!

41
-00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:00,700
Goodbye!

42
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,290
You're right. Those accidents.
There will be more in the future.

43
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,760
More frequently and more
severe than the ones before.

44
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,510
You almost killed her as well once.

45
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,550
With your own hands.

46
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,490
It's moving!

47
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,210
Just like that, after living a hundred
years, on a day that was just right,

48
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,960
it was first love.

49
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,980
I plead to the heavens

50
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,110
that I may be able to confess.

51
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,940
I asked how did you know?

52
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,710
I asked why you know!

53
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,150
I said... Kim Sunny.

54
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,310
Ah, it's very cold, isn't it?
I'll get your coat...

55
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,230
I wasn't finished talking!

56
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,440
What's the matter?

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,770
Just why...

58
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,130
What? Are you alright?

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,380
Your pale face just got paler.

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,010
Who's this woman that you saw?

61
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,170
The woman I know is my sister.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,690
You'll bore a hole through the window.

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,360
Ji Eun Tak.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,890
Even if you look at me gently
like that, it's still too late.

65
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,330
What kind of person is your boss?

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,630
I've heard this question before from Mr.
Grim Reaper.

67
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,180
The question that follows is, "What do I
have to do in order for her to like me?"

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,480
Can't you see by looking at her?
She's pretty. Absolutely beautiful.

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm... not looking for someone pretty.

70
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,900
I've heard that before as well.

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,960
What's the matter?

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,420
Why? What is it?

73
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,490
Well, it shouldn't be your first
time holding a woman's hand...

74
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,800
I see right through you! You said you don't
have a phone number, then you get one.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,400
You don't even tell me your real name.
You're serious because I grabbed your hand.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,260
Are you married by any chance?

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,860
No.

78
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,890
Then, there's only one other explanation.
Always wearing black,

79
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,220
and your face is way too pale.

80
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,580
- Are you part of the NIS? (NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE) - No.

81
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,260
Then, are you a Grim Reaper?

82
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,540
You're not laughing. It was a joke.

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,560
If you're not married or part of the
NIS, then fine. Let's go in, it's cold.

84
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,270
Then, Ms. Sunny, who are you?

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
You're going to drink?

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah. I really want to get drunk right now.
You should have one too.

87
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,230
Look here, Orabeoni (OLDER BROTHER). Why
do you keep looking at me since earlier?

88
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,830
I'm fascinated because you have
the same name as someone I know.

89
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,180
Your real name is Kim Sun? How do you
write your name in Korean characters?

90
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,230
I don't use Korean characters.
I use English. S-U-N-N-Y.

91
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,840
Have you seen me somewhere before?

92
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,440
We saw each other a few days ago.
In front of the old store.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,260
Even then, and now. Why do you keep
calling me Orabeoni (OLDER BROTHER)?

94
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,090
Then should I have said
this, that, hey, you?

95
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,878
What's your relationship
with this person? Do you

96
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,410
even know what he is
that you're meeting him?

97
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,160
A relationship where we exchanged rings.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,660
That ring had that kind of meaning?

99
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,180
Part-time worker, nice question.

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,950
This ring... what was the meaning?

101
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,800
About the ring... can
you give it back to me?

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,590
At the cafe we met at before,
tomorrow afternoon, at one o'clock.

103
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,810
Now what does this mean?

104
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,810
Truth number one.

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,080
The girl in the painting
and Sunny's past life

106
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,270
had the same face. Truth number two.

107
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,410
The girl in the painting...

108
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,130
The girl that I know is my sister.

109
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,450
Is Kim Shin's sister. Then a question.

110
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,810
Is Sunny a reincarnation
of Kim Shin's sister?

111
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,180
I don't know as of yet. Again. Truth one.

112
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,290
The moment I saw the girl in the
painting, I cried. Truth number two.

113
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,030
The moment I first saw Sunny, I cried.

114
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,020
Then a question.

115
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,710
Why did I cry? What is the
truth behind my feelings?

116
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,610
Does their history have something
to do with my erased memories?

117
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Ah, this is also a maybe.

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,397
"How much is a chicken? I could
buy the entire chicken store."

119
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:03,520
After making such a huge boast, the
Grim Reaper paid for the meal.

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,612
- About that, I was a bit distracted, so...
- How

121
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:07,640
could you have been
distracted the whole time?

122
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,976
I mean, if you weren't even going
to pay, why are you so curious

123
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,120
about the relationship between
my boss and the Grim Reaper?

124
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,010
Why didn't you just ask her what she can see
in you? Seriously, men are all the same.

125
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,830
Whether they're human, a
goblin or a grim reaper.

126
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,600
It wasn't the kind of a picture
you are thinking about.

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,800
It was that kind of a picture. I told you
not to keep secrets from me anymore.

128
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,817
Ah, were you waiting for this day?
Is that why you brought

129
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,550
me to that chicken store?
Because my boss was pretty?

130
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm telling you now, but how could I
have picked that part-time job for you?

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,090
What are you talking about now?

132
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,662
All I did was narrow the choices.
I narrowed it

133
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,150
down to chicken stores,
so it would be easier.

134
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,128
And if I told you that you were
going to be hired, then you

135
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,030
would gain confidence. And
another person would hire you.

136
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,640
Such crappy lies.

137
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,360
What lies?

138
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,950
Then I have two wishes that haven't
come true yet. Part-time and boyfriend.

139
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,470
Why do you keep hanging
on the boyfriend part?

140
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,510
Should I break Tae Hee's legs and confirm
whether or not I'm your boyfriend or not?

141
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,578
If I break something, maybe
then you will go, "That's

142
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,270
right, my boyfriend is a
foul-tempered Goblin!"

143
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,740
Why is he the one getting angry?

144
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,920
What? I didn't say anything.

145
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,589
Seeing you work there, it
made me feel bad. It's

146
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,990
the first time I've seen
you there properly.

147
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,750
Good night.

148
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,140
Are you doing well?

149
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,120
I finally... seem to be doing well.

150
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,440
What about the ring? I'll take the ring
for a little and then I'll give it back...

151
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,740
If you tell me the reason.

152
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,640
I have something to investigate. The details
of the investigation are a bit classified.

153
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,860
But, Sunny, why did you grab this
particular ring on that day?

154
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,170
It seemed like it was mine.

155
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,850
When you wore the ring,
did you feel something?

156
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,190
I did. "I grabbed this
ring to meet this man."

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,710
A man who cries the moment he sees me.
A man who doesn't concede.

158
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,810
A man where our meetings are
short and waiting is long.

159
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,660
But I didn't know that man
would give and take the ring.

160
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,900
Here you go.

161
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,410
Thank you. I will return it soon.

162
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,543
I don't know how you are when
it comes to investigating, but

163
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm not that easy going either,
so share with me the results.

164
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,680
Since I have a right to that ring, too.

165
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,730
I'll go. I have to open the store.

166
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,187
I'm saying this because I'm
not sure if you know, but I

167
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,910
don't think that's the right
dressing for that dish.

168
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,220
Oh.

169
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,980
Come to your senses and prepare lunch.
(WORDS SOUND VERY SIMILAR)

170
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,330
Did you fail to take away the ring?

171
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,460
I just borrowed it for a little bit.

172
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,690
That's what you call taking. Why
would you borrow something you gave?

173
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,283
I saw that you even held
her hand last night. Did

174
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:28,900
you see something of an
enemy from your past life?

175
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,006
Don't ask me. It's their own
privacy, and even if I did see

176
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,980
it, I can't say anything about it.
It's one of the rules.

177
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,228
Wow, you have some conscience.
So why would someone like that

178
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,290
date a human being while hiding
that you're a Grim Reaper?

179
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,100
Must you say things that way when
you're in the same position as I am?

180
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,139
What do you mean we're in
the same position? Mine is

181
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:51,490
fateful love, and you should
quit putting ketchup on tofu.

182
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,780
Oh.

183
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,110
My sister's name was also Kim Sun.

184
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,680
So I was a little bit uneasy all night.

185
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,730
You said you don't know if
she reincarnated or not.

186
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,876
If she reincarnated with a different
face, there's no way for me to

187
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,000
recognize her. Since all I can see
of humans are their paths ahead.

188
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Say that your sister
reincarnated and you met her.

189
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,150
Then what would happen? Your sister wouldn't
remember anything about her past life.

190
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:35,120
Just... whether she's peaceful in this
lifetime, whether she's doing well.

191
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,830
If she's receiving love. I'm
just curious about those things.

192
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,240
She was pretty. My little rascal.

193
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,470
Continue talking.

194
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,180
About what?

195
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,290
Your story. How you lived, how you died.

196
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,190
I told you already. I was a general.
I was in the Goryeo militia.

197
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,650
Did you die on the battlefield?

198
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,170
No. I was killed by the blade
of the master I was protecting.

199
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,820
I don't know where or how to start.
It's a story I never told.

200
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,690
The salt.

201
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh yeah.

202
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,360
A baby was born. And when he was born, his
father who was king had already passed.

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,800
His mother was lowly born, and
she died from an illness.

204
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,500
And his older brother who was old
enough to be his father was the king.

205
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,903
There was no one who was on his
side in the palace. Just Park

206
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:46,610
Jong Won who was his teacher and
a professor at Seonggyungwan.

207
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,950
After he met Park Jong Won, strange
things happened around the child.

208
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,493
His nephew who was next in
line to the throne died, and

209
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,060
the officials who were questioning
the matter died, too.

210
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,540
And his older brother
who was king also died.

211
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,450
They all passed away due to hereditary
illness, but he finds out later

212
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,940
that they were all poisoned.

213
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,870
The king and the army met violent
deaths, and all that's left is regret.

214
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,590
If Yeo ascends to the royal throne,

215
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:05,060
please marry Yeo to your
sister and protect him.

216
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,630
Only let him walk on the
righteous path and prevent him

217
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:14,820
from making the wrong choices,
and more than anything,

218
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,150
please prevent him from dying.

219
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,570
And tell him that by not being
there for him, I protected him.

220
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,500
And also, your master who
is giving this order,

221
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,830
please forgive me.

222
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,940
I will follow your order.

223
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,051
Are you saying that he poisoned
everyone over such long

224
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,690
period of time and made the
child become the king?

225
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,030
That man, Park Jong Won did? But why...

226
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,060
With barely enough time to put on his
Royal attire, he became the king.

227
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,130
They say that I cannot become the king
because there is a separate royal lineage,

228
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,750
so I will raise and make a king myself,

229
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,720
and put this world at this king's feet,

230
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,400
and put that king at my feet.

231
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,890
Therefore, I will put the
whole country at my feet.

232
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,960
May you be well for a thousand years.

233
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,216
According to the wishes
of the late king, your

234
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:58,000
marriage date has been
set, Your Majesty.

235
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,750
I hear it's General Kim Shin's sister.

236
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,280
With Kim Shin's character
and the family's integrity,

237
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,730
she's not lacking in any way
against any other young lady.

238
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,998
A marriage to a petty military
official's sister? It would

239
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,290
have been nice if the late king
had withheld his last wish.

240
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,501
The late king said that Kim
Shin is a loyal subject and

241
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:21,620
a reassuring comrade who
fought many battles with him,

242
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,520
and said that he was a
great trusted... friend.

243
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,783
The late king's last wish
became a variable in Park Jong

244
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,030
Won's solid plans to have
complete control over the king.

245
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,710
I couldn't see you since this morning,

246
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,570
so I thought I was going to get
married without seeing you.

247
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,270
I should have. I have no idea what I find
pretty in such an ugly face to come here.

248
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,540
Seeing how you treasure me, my path
into the palace is just so pretty.

249
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,950
But then, Orabeoni. What
does the king look like?

250
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,850
Why is it that you are not curious about
his character but more about his looks?

251
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,820
Don't worry. His royal
appearance is very bright.

252
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,000
Is that true?

253
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,860
What about me? Am I pretty today?

254
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,830
You look ugly.

255
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,580
Then I must be not pretty in the king's
eyes? I should probably return home then?

256
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,490
The king has already seen you.

257
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,000
Me?

258
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,460
Perhaps... is it the one
whose face was radiating?

259
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,020
So he came to see me.
What did he say about me?

260
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,280
He said you were ugly.

261
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,630
You have to come see your ugly sister often.

262
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,100
Your brother lives on the battlefield.

263
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,720
Here, no news is good news.

264
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,220
As if I didn't know.

265
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,480
Don't worry about me. I
will be happy, Orabeoni.

266
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,840
♫ When I look at you ♫

267
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,690
♫ my tears keep on falling ♫

268
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,910
His Majesty's coming.

269
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,920
♫ round and round, are you coming to me? ♫

270
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,940
♫ That person that I
can't seem to avoid. ♫

271
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,510
♫ I love you. Love you, love you. ♫

272
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:13,150
♫ I felt it was destined. ♫

273
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,750
♫ And I miss you, miss you ♫

274
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:26,900
♫ My fated person ♫

275
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,730
You're heavy.

276
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,810
Ah!

277
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,690
I was thinking of someone
who is cold-hearted.

278
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,770
Where are you going in such a rush?

279
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,150
To see the king.

280
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,010
I would have come to you.

281
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,030
I thought it would be
better if we both came out.

282
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,740
You ought to control how much power you
put in your grasp of the lowly thing.

283
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,440
If you grasp is tight as though you
treasure it, that lowly and precious thing

284
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,020
will die without fail.

285
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,860
In that hand,

286
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,820
a foolish child, a lowly maternal family,

287
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,160
a wife's family that is even
lower than the mother's family.

288
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,080
That is a few grand ministers and

289
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,750
Chancellor Shin Cheol Jool's
conversation, as I'm told.

290
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,110
Is there nothing wrong in what you said?

291
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,010
The more there isn't anything
wrong, the more you say it's wrong!

292
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,780
Cut off the head of Shin Cheol Jool
who put the royal family to contempt.

293
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,190
And insist he's wrong.
Show them your toughness.

294
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,530
Don't confuse the king anymore.

295
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,040
Please do not cover his eyes any longer.

296
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,420
The chancellor's death was
not a proper treatment.

297
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,930
Everyone says I did wrong.
Only you say I wasn't.

298
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,500
- Must you really...
- Did I cover his eyes

299
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,950
or did His Majesty close his eyes?

300
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,660
- You insolent!
- You wench!

301
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,100
The late king gave him
life but I raised him.

302
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,920
There is no reason why
I am not Yeo's father.

303
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,142
The one who put Yeo on the
royal throne and the one

304
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:52,260
who put the world in Yeo's
grasp, that's all me.

305
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,090
Did I say anything wrong?

306
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,190
So, just some lowly sister of
some petty military officer,

307
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,750
shove your admonitions.

308
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,360
I'm not the one you should be lecturing to.
It's your brother.

309
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,750
To the borders where he
was sent to be buried.

310
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,480
He keeps getting victories.

311
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,920
Isn't that will of his quite vicious?

312
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,360
They are saying there's
two kings to one nation.

313
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,510
Two suns in one sky.

314
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,270
If that is not treason then...

315
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,460
what is?

316
00:28:49,880 --> 00:29:01,940


317
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,790
I cast you the sword with fury and empathy.

318
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,590
Go as far as you can and do
not come back if possible.

319
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,700
Your Highness... how could those words...
Your Highness, how?

320
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,780
It is your Goryeo.

321
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,390
I protected the borders when you
told me to protect the borders.

322
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,250
I killed the enemies when
you told me to kill them.

323
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,220
- My sister and people are here...
- The worries of the king...

324
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,720
It seems like you're the one who has it.

325
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,220
Send message that you died a heroic death
and I will send message that I lament it.

326
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,020
It's an order.

327
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,260
May you not only be biased
against the military officer.

328
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,520
May you not treat him lowly
for being a military officer.

329
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,540
May you

330
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,860
summon High General Kim Shin who's by the
borders to your side to protect you.

331
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
And more than anything,

332
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,790
I hope you keep Park Jong Won far.

333
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,540
In the end this is what it comes to.

334
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,000
Your lacking, in the end,
has only become greed.

335
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,130
Did your brother say you are the only
hope for your family of low status?

336
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,010
- Your Highness...
- The king protects his people.

337
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,880
How could the people protect its king?

338
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,193
Do you even know what
you are requesting now?

339
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,560
The person that you are
calling your brother...

340
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,330
He keeps coming back from battles
that are not supposed to be won.

341
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,550
He has become a god in the streets.

342
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,562
I told him not to come
back but he comes back

343
00:30:55,574 --> 00:30:58,190
time after time to
show my incompetence.

344
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,890
Your brother, how would I know if he would
protect me or stab me with that sword?

345
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,400
Your Highness...

346
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,520
More than anyone, no one can
be a god for my people.

347
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,790
That is what treason is.

348
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,230
Your Highness.

349
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,000
A petty military officer is gaining power.

350
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,130
As the military officer's power grows,
the royal family is put to dire crisis.

351
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,810
Strike the head of High General Kim Shin.

352
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:38,150
Insist he's wrong and show your toughness.

353
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,120
From Park Jong Won's mouth

354
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,010
Kim Shin's name came out in the end.

355
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,230
That is... the last image of my sister.

356
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,290
She was the sister of a military
officer and a queen with depth.

357
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,400
The road to the king was far.

358
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,460
In the end I could not reach it.

359
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,960
Even though I knew I could not reach it...
even after knowing that... I...

360
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,830
I could only go on forward.

361
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:57,270
That place was my last war
and I were to die there.

362
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,760
Why on earth?

363
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,497
I disregarded the command
not to return. I

364
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:06,880
disregarded the young
king's jealousy and fears.

365
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,250
I couldn't forget the late
king's words to protect Yeo.

366
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,250
I needed to save the lives of the innocent.

367
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,730
And above all else, my sister was
protecting that dummy's life with her life.

368
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,064
I've blabbered too much
in front of someone who

369
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,720
doesn't have any memories
of his past life.

370
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,200
The food is all cold.

371
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,030
I have one more thing I am curious about.

372
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,400
Perhaps, have you seen a ring like this?

373
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,825
You didn't take that back to
give to me, right? I don't

374
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,330
want to be in that kind
of relationship with you.

375
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,860
Concentrate please. Look at it properly.
Have you seen this?

376
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,560
You, perhaps do you wish you were my sister?

377
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,530
Is that why you asked about my past? Put
on the ring. Let's see what happens.

378
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,760
Don't come close. Don't come close, I said!

379
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,530
Sun, are you receiving love now?

380
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,330
Ahhhh!

381
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,580
I'm sorry for disrupting your cozy time.

382
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,110
- It's not cozy!
- I will go out somewhere first.

383
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,830
Where are you going? Let's go together.
We have to be a set now.

384
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,030
That's right. You two go out as a set.

385
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,400
- I want to be alone now.
- My Sun also liked to be alone.

386
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,260
Leave. I said, leave!

387
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,170
Jung Yeon told me that I must
come see her with flowers.

388
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,590
She said she's in Paju.

389
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,190
It's nice since it's closer than Canada.

390
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,410
Ahjussi, you really match well with flowers.

391
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,600
Any flower.

392
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,670
Ahjussi, you are really my style.
In every way.

393
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,840
Ahjussi, you have a really good personality.

394
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,830
Did I do something wrong?

395
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,810
- No.
- Then did you do something wrong?

396
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,580
No.

397
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,810
Then what is this confession
suddenly out of the blue?

398
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,120
Comfort? Encouragement? There
is something like that.

399
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,650
How am I your style specifically?

400
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:27,010
Strange and beautiful.

401
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,990
It's here. Go Jung Yeon.

402
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,210
I'm here.

403
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,420
Mom?

404
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,400
Mom... I think it's her.

405
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,160
It is Mom.

406
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,970
Ahjussi. Door, door. To the library. Hurry!

407
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,000
Be careful! You might fall!

408
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,800
Were you my Mom's friend?

409
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,000
Maam. Do you know my Mom?

410
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,080
Ji Yeon Hee. Do you know her?

411
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,780
Why would I be by your side then?

412
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,460
I was there because you are her daughter.

413
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,880
In our time, we really
used iron to laminate.

414
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,170
Yeon Hee helped me a lot with mine.

415
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,230
We promised when we were in high school that

416
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,030
when we would have babies,
we would buy pretty clothes.

417
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,890
I wasn't able to give a dress but
I protected Yeon Hee's money.

418
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,670
Open it. The code is 486.

419
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,150
These bankbooks... could it be?

420
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,890
Yeah. You're right.

421
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,110
The bankbook you always told
your aunt you did not have.

422
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,660
That is Yeon Hee's insurance money.

423
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,970
The one on top is the most recent one.

424
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,520
So add it in for your college tuition.

425
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,870
Congratulations on passing.

426
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,080
Because of this... you
wandered and could not go?

427
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,540
Because of me?

428
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,900
While I was wandering around

429
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,130
I did feel the fun in watching you grow up.

430
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,640
Now, I should go and chat with Yeon Hee.

431
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,970
You're going? Now?

432
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,480
I should go and tell everything without
missing a single thing to your Mom.

433
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,820
Your daughter is so kind.

434
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,230
She's good in her studies too.

435
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,060
She went to a good college.

436
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,040
♫ All my fears ♫

437
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,060
Now, goodbye.

438
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,390
Already?

439
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,870
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

440
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,840
With my Mom...

441
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,180
I hope the both of you

442
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,650
stay friends over there.

443
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,580
Goodbye.

444
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,940
♫ When you feel ♫

445
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,110
Bye.

446
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,450
Take care, Go Jeong Yeon.

447
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,930
♫ I'll be here ♫

448
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,590
♫ to shelter you ♫

449
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:05,700
♫ When you feel so lonely ♫

450
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,200
♫ I'll be here ♫

451
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:15,520
Mom. You really had a good friend.

452
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,130
No, honestly she was my friend.

453
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,860
I liked everything you did.

454
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,540
The rice cakes and the feast.

455
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,950
The scarf too, and Jeong Yeon.

456
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,630
Everything.

457
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,030
♫ To let you feel my cries ♫

458
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:49,980
♫ Still here, all alone ♫

459
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,020
You too. Thank you for opening the door.

460
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,240
I am that big of a person.

461
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,720
Did you just sneer at me?

462
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,730
Oh! Rain. It's not raining these days.

463
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,820
I'm restraining myself.
NASA might come and get me.

464
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,730
It's been a long time.

465
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,590
You haven't changed a bit.
You still talk informally.

466
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,990
Mr. Yoo Jae Shin!

467
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm sorry.

468
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,060
As you can see, I am a
very complicated person.

469
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,450
- I have something I want to ask of you.
- Yes.

470
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,140
There is insurance money.

471
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,250
One that was left before
one child's mother died.

472
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,810
The child isn't turning 20
until September of next year.

473
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,560
So as of now, this money is

474
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,860
hard to touch without the Aunt's approval.

475
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,600
So the insurance money should
go to the rightful owner.

476
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,460
Rightfully.

477
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,870
You don't have to worry. I will
take care of it immediately.

478
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,930
Then.

479
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,080
- One more thing.
- Yes.

480
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,470
Thank you for growing up properly.

481
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,490
I am thankful for everything.

482
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,560
Unni is dead. The child is young
and the insurance money is out.

483
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,900
But you can't be the
guardian if you have debt.

484
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,030
So what can you do?
Humaneness is a disease, too.

485
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,770
I paid back all that debt in
order to become the guardian.

486
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,910
So I got the insurance money.

487
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,570
But I can't deposit it into my account.

488
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,690
- Since you paid the debt by getting a private loan.
- That's right!

489
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,280
So, I put it first in that girl,
Eun Tak's savings account.

490
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,980
But this damn bankbook kept disappearing!
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

491
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,160
So how happy would I be
to see that bankbook?

492
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,180
I'm not sure if you understood what I said.

493
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,360
The law will understand.

494
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,120
And you acknowledged that you tried
to deviate the insurance money.

495
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,670
What?

496
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,020
What crap are you trying to pull here?
Dev, what?

497
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:23,660
Because I was so worried
about our delicate Eun Tak,

498
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,460
I raised her preciously
like some gold or jade!

499
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,070
Stop saying such nonsense.

500
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,660
I will offer you two choices. One,

501
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,720
a simple and an efficient way, return
the full amount back to Ms. Ji Eun Tak.

502
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,780
Two, dirtily insist on getting
back child rearing expenses

503
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,680
by filing a lawsuit.

504
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,690
Please select between one and two.

505
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,370
You... you had me all wrong.

506
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,100
You see, I know a lot of
people on the dark side.

507
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,680
I think... you are the one
who has me all wrong.

508
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,720
The dark side...

509
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,200
I know better.

510
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,380
What about the Lord's situation?

511
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,110
It has been settled well. And Deok Hwa
has been instructed as you instructed.

512
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,499
Starting with one desk,
one chair, he's to learn

513
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,600
how to be a new recruit
at the store first.

514
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,520
Right.

515
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,550
- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa?
- Yes.

516
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,790
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

517
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,480
It's nice that this store is clean.

518
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,400
Go and work.

519
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,730
This is the details about the products.

520
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,990
You should memorize this by tomorrow.

521
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,050
Ohh! It goes up! It goes down!

522
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,070
Woah! It slants.

523
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,080
- Woah! You're still standing.
- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa!

524
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,970
That... Manager Jang Il Ryeong.

525
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,200
If you were to know the truth,
you would be really surprised.

526
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,960
Someone surprising that's from way
up there who starts from the bottom.

527
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,750
I know that you are the Chairman's grandson.

528
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,900
He instructed that we follow the field
manual. (ARMY-LIKE DISCIPLINING)

529
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,800
Exactly. If I memorize this all in one day

530
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,430
you will probably be surprised.

531
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,360
Yes, customer. What brings you here?

532
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,530
To get the hat that I left for dry cleaning.

533
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,090
Ahhh! That hat!

534
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,830
That hat's material was so good.

535
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,410
Is it from Italy?

536
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,720
It's made in Heaven.

537
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,860
Ahhh... no wonder.

538
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,380
The materials there is good.

539
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,240
Oh! Why did it suddenly get so cold?

540
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,760
- Hello?
- Are you still investigating?

541
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,060
I haven't been lax about it.

542
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,450
Yes, not yet.

543
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,500
It must be a complicated investigation.

544
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,130
What were you doing just now?

545
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,470
I was thinking about

546
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,460
if I should hold your hand once more or not.

547
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,700
I'm going crazy.

548
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,610
Then, can't you come and hold me
today when I'm still a year younger?

549
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,440
Today?

550
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,750
I'm going out.

551
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,640
Don't call me from now on.

552
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,480
Is it today?

553
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,760
- What is?
- Can you not wear that coat today?

554
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,980
Why? Is it strange?

555
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,400
Never mind.

556
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,100
I was hoping that my advice could
be a variable to your day but...

557
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:12,620
Wear more comfortable shoes.
The way back will be long.

558
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,840
Your clothes are strange.

559
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,130
When the laundry is done,
just hang those up!

560
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,800
He disgustingly doesn't do any housework.

561
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,130
Lucky wench.

562
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,840
Someone is just eating chicken feet at home.

563
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,250
Having a man to date.

564
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,410
December 31st date, you say.

565
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,820
I'm so proud of you, friend.

566
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,900
Today's date concept is...

567
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,200
Sweet and warm.

568
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,840
- Is it pretty?
- Disgustingly pretty.

569
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,120
I can't make it obvious that I
am one year older on a date.

570
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:22,890


571
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:29,220
I am sorry for being late. It is hard
to walk if there are a lot of people.

572
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,790
But you came before I'm a year older. Should
we walk towards Bosingak? (A BELL PAVILLION)

573
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:37,390
Before that, I will hold your hand.

574
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,220
Right away? This suddenly?

575
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,890
Because I am too curious to wait.

576
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,190
A human nature is quite strange, don't you
think? It makes me want to play hard to get.

577
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,530
- Do you want to hold my hand?
- Yes.

578
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,200
Me too.

579
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,400
I want to hold your hand and hug you.

580
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,000
But then, at the least,
whose hand I am holding

581
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,730
or whose embrace I am in, I need to know.

582
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,190
You still haven't answered
my question properly.

583
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,710
What is your identity, Mr. Kim Woo Bin?

584
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,640
You still have not answered as
to how you knew my real name.

585
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,870
Just letting things pass because you're
handsome is only up to this year.

586
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,070
And after two hours, it will be next year.

587
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,970
Am I asking for too much?

588
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,870
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,610
Okay.

590
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,800
Then should we stop?

591
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,980
Making me walk in the inner
part of the pavement is cute.

592
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,620
You were cute too when you were
answering those math questions.

593
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,700
Everything is good, but...

594
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,460
I don't think I can do it any more.

595
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,600
I'll just get dumped.

596
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,240
Don't contact me from now on.

597
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,720
Don't greet me even if we see
each other coincidentally too.

598
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,320
Happy New Year!

599
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,480
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

600
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,550
Come in.

601
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,860
What is it? I was sleeping.

602
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,650
- Like that?
- Yeah, this is how I always sleep. Why?

603
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,340
I got it. Listen carefully, Ahjussi.

604
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,270
What?

605
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:03,450
Ahjussi, 12 o'clock strikes! January 1st,
the New Year! I just became an adult!

606
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,990
So what about it? What do you want?
Why are you all dressed?

607
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,400
I've got a prior appointment. I'm
going out. Since I'm an adult now.

608
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,920
You?

609
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,030
What prior appointment in this late night?
Are you out of your...

610
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,840
It's a prior appointment with you.

611
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,810
So I already got dressed since earlier...

612
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,710
Dummy. Must I say it in words?

613
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,900
Yea. Say it from now on instead of
drying up my blood.

614
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,570
Go out? What do you want to do?

615
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,280
You'll do it for me?

616
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,440
Whatever it is, if you say
to do it, I'll do that too.

617
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,630
Ahjussi. Alcohol. Alcohol. Buy me alcohol.

618
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:44,220
At the street bar. Soju and
chicken gizzard. And romance too.

619
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,310
What?

620
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,860
Then, let's go, into romance!

621
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,160
Here, toast between adults.

622
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,170
Are you going to be okay...

623
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,450
It's romantic.

624
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,650
Oh, bitter. Is soju supposed to be bitter?

625
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,816
Alcohol is all supposed to be bitter.
When that

626
00:53:09,828 --> 00:53:11,870
becomes sweet is when
you're really an adult.

627
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:17,260
Then, one more cup. Pour it. Fill it.

628
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,290
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

629
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:28,500
♫ Love, under the moonlight ♫

630
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,380
Oh sweet... bitter.

631
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,660
Bitter.

632
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,250
Nice picture.

633
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,120
♫ same feeling as me ♫

634
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,410
What's this trite development?

635
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:43,830
Ahjussi, you hired them?

636
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,640
I didn't but I have met him before.

637
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,770
I just knew you lived in this neighborhood.

638
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,150
I was looking very hard for you.

639
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,170
It's him. The punk that did this to me.

640
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,840
He wrecked my hand like this and what a good
life he has to be playing with a chick.

641
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,880
You'll die today.

642
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,180
Today? Really? Tell me everything you see.

643
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,810
What is he saying?

644
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,570
For your amusement.

645
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:18,030
Eat the food and wait. Wait for me
with the drinks. I'll be short.

646
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:21,990
Our battlefield is outside. Come out.

647
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,600
What? Where did he go?

648
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,060
I told you he's weird.

649
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,200
Let's go outside.

650
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,720
Are you sure it's okay for your
boyfriend to go out like that?

651
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,760
Those guys are infamously
wicked in this neighborhood.

652
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,450
Oh, it's okay. He's not a mister
who goes around getting beat up.

653
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,390
Auntie. One more bottle of soju.

654
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,196
Shall I deal with you in
a classic way after some

655
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,660
absence of it? I used to
be a military officer.

656
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,320
And I'm currently unemployed, bastard.
Thanks to you.

657
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,990
How can that be the life of a great man?
You guys too.

658
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:13,690
That's the reason I won't be easy on you
today. It'll hurt. Endure if you want.

659
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,890
What is he saying?

660
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,450
Hey, break him into pieces.

661
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,180
Nice.

662
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,290
Hurry.

663
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,760
Let's start from the beginning
again, the romance.

664
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,520
It's still romantic?

665
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,820
More than earlier.

666
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:36,060
Fading light, simple food, bitter soju ..

667
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,670
Cold-hearted sentiment,
romance brimming everywhere.

668
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:45,500
It'd be perfect with just one more thing.

669
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,860
What?

670
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,190
My first kiss.

671
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:49,980
What?

672
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:55,990
Last time, it was a peck. Don't move.

673
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,100
Hey.

674
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,080
You...

675
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:23,240
You forgot I'm the goblin bride?
It doesn't work on me.

676
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:29,330
It means you can't ever
evade me no matter what.

677
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,860
I wasn't evading.

678
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,050
It was hard to evade you even once.

679
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,610
♫ Beautiful life ♫

680
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:43,550
♫ to be with you under the skies ♫

681
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:51,260
♫ even breathing alone is good ♫

682
00:57:51,260 --> 00:58:00,140
♫ It's a beautiful life, beautiful
day, I will live in your memory. ♫

683
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:08,970
♫ Beautiful life, beautiful
day, stay by me ♫

684
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:13,220
♫ Beautiful my love, ♫

685
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:17,340
♫ Beautiful your heart. ♫

686
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,180
♫ it's beautiful life ♫

687
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,890
It's perfect.

688
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:32,030
♫ It's a beautiful life ♫

689
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:40,060
Did she get dumped or did I get dumped?

690
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,230
What are you doing,
Miscellaneously Omitted Person?

691
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,020
So what are you doing?

692
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,400
Good morning.

693
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,800
It's New Year's and I'm thankful to you
too, so I was making rice cake soup.

694
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,290
I made buckwheat jelly too.

695
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,750
You're precious starting
from New Year's already.

696
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:17,510
My pay from the ski resort came
in so I bought good beef too.

697
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,490
No beef in my rice cake.

698
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,020
Yes.

699
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,678
It seems like yesterday
when you guys walked

700
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,870
towards me like models
through the night fog.

701
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:37,200
It's already New Year's. Back
then, you guys were so dashing.

702
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,590
Amidst being scared, you guys
looked so totally dashing.

703
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,560
Wait a bit.

704
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,080
Oh, green onion! I didn't buy green onions.

705
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,130
Rice cake soup without green
onions will be quite hopeless.

706
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,090
Green onions are important indeed.
Shall we go?

707
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,730
Shall we then?

708
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,190
Move over! Do you guys own this?

709
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:37,940
It seems he just gave us a word of blessing
for the new year, to use the sidewalk.

710
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,808
I'm grateful for your
blessing so I shall not

711
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,450
do you harm. May you
have a good new year.

712
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:47,530
Since we are dashing. Happy New Year!

713
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,870
- A righteous buddy he is.
- Rare in today's world.

714
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,560
It's beautiful.

715
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,480
Enjoy.

716
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,990
I will be able to enjoy
it if it tastes good...

717
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:12,570
I'm a good cook. Have lots of good
fortune in the new year, Ahjussi's.

718
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:15,520
You get lots of blessings too.

719
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,070
I broke up with Sunny.

720
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,220
What did she say when you broke up?

721
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,900
She said, "I'll just get dumped."

722
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,800
That is, since I got
dumped, you call me first.

723
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,960
That's what that means.

724
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,160
She asked about my identity.

725
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,170
That's a tough one.

726
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:39,700
But grim reaper is a little bit negative,
so how about you say you're an angel?

727
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,760
It's the same genre.

728
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,530
Be strong. Fighting.

729
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:51,370
That's how everyone grows up. At
age 300, it's the toughest time.

730
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,330
It's ok.

731
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,500
- What?
- One truth, again.

732
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,240
In order to earn the answer, go near
the one who is close to the answer.

733
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,630
What are you talking about?

734
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,520
What is this? Let go.

735
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,290
Indeed, I see nothing from you. Just warmth.

736
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,260
My fingers. It hurts.

737
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,890
Hey, what are you going to do about my hand?

738
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,060
Thanks for the rice cake soup.

739
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,120
My hand. What about my hand?

740
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,170
My hand. Filthy.

741
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,300
Filthy. I need to cut it off.

742
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,160
Disinfection. That should do, right?

743
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:38,160
It's good.

744
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:43,190
It's all disinfected. I'm fine now.
Don't worry.

745
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:47,600
So pay me back for the rice cake soup, okay?

746
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,410
Why are we coming here? You
said to go to the supermarket.

747
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,000
That's roasted sweet potatoes!

748
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,731
This is seriously the first
time I'm eating roasted sweet

749
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:59,250
potatoes. Seriously, really,
for real the first time.

750
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,853
It's not that you're eating roasted
sweet potatoes for the first time, but

751
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,410
the first time you're acting as if
you're eating them for the first time.

752
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:12,280
Oh my world. Indeed it's such a
small world we live in nowadays.

753
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,620
How could a coincidence
like this happen, right?

754
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,630
What are you doing? Before
such a coincidence?

755
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,930
You two aren't going to say hi?

756
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,470
We agreed not to say hi even
if we meet by coincidence.

757
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,710
You agreed not to say hi?

758
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,430
You two, the overall look
is like yolk and white.

759
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:41,350
Fried egg.

760
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,880
Sorry.

761
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,790
Bean sprouts. The string and the head.

762
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,980
You like bean sprouts.

763
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,710
You ruined everything. Everything.

764
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,240
No, their outfits...

765
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,080
Sorry. I shouldn't have included
this ahjussi in our strategy.

766
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:22,750
It's okay. At least I got to see Sunny.

767
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:34,550
Also, you don't even have $5, so why
insist on eating roasted sweet potatoes?

768
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,469
I mean, what are we supposed
to do when the two of

769
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:39,420
you who look normal don't
even have $5 together?

770
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,700
Just when you think you know.

771
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,790
My boss paid for this. What
are you going to do about it?

772
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,150
$5 was a variable I didn't think of.

773
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:48,450
- Next time, I will for sure have cash in advance.
- Never mind.

774
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:53,420
Today, our plan failed without
any gains thanks to you.

775
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,510
Uh-uh, the plan failed but
we did gain something.

776
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,030
Look at this man.

777
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,950
I'm going to work.

778
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,910
My concept today was Angel.

779
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,170
It's all your fault then.

780
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,360
Daebak!

781
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,070
CEO, over here.

782
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:48,530
I'm totally natural, right? I don't
look like an illegal resident, right?

783
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:51,050
I don't look like someone who came
abroad for the first time, right?

784
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,830
So in the end, she bought that?

785
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:26,120
To meet with that CEO or whatever.

786
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,510
So I was supposed to buy that for her.

787
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,680
She said she was the one who got dumped.

788
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,650
But why I keep feeling like I got dumped.
I don't know.

789
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,910
Each person has different
time frame for healing from

790
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:32,380
wounded feelings from a breakup.

791
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:39,110
Instead of focusing on recovering
quickly, focus on where you can recover.

792
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,330
Focus.

793
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,780
Thank you for the consultation, Doctor.

794
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,530
Have some tea. It will erase
your memory of this life.

795
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,730
Such a waste on my studies.

796
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,740
Why did I bother getting a medical
degree and throw away my youth?

797
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,790
You were my last patient.

798
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:11,960
Thank you for making the time for me.

799
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:24,490
I'm here, My Lord. Are you on
your way back from somewhere?

800
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:26,220
I just had something to buy briefly.

801
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,388
I can't sleep and I was
feeling lonesome so I

802
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,650
thought I could come and
play a round of baduk.

803
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:39,010
The candlesticks and the tableware,
I'll set a day to get them cleaned.

804
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:42,780
I'll do it when the weather's
good, so don't worry.

805
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:47,220
Then, shall we play a round of baduk
we haven't played for so long?

806
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,820
When you were young, I
was the one who taught

807
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:56,180
you baduk but lately,
I keep losing to you.

808
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,940
Because I play it like it's life or death.

809
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,890
And I don't?

810
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:11,290
It's a horse surrounded, My Lord. I'm not
giving it back to you no matter what.

811
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,360
Let's see...

812
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:43,320
Live alone in immortality and watch
the deaths of your beloved ones.

813
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,000
You shall not forget any death.

814
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,890
Are you going somewhere nice, Mr. Chairman?

815
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:57,180
Yes, I think I might be.

816
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:18,870
Day drinking is always nice.

817
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,720
Day drinking is cold now.

818
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,620
Did something happen?

819
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,890
A roster will come.

820
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,990
Ji Eun Tak's roster?

821
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,500
No. Chairman Yoo.

822
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,630
Did you tell Chairman Yoo?

823
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,350
Is there anything to gain from a
human knowing their own death?

824
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:48,190
Then what about Deok Hwa? It'd be
better if he knew no matter what.

825
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:51,210
So he can have no regret.
Isn't it better to tell him?

826
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:54,620
Before death, everything is a regret.

827
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:05,910
Chairman Yoo asked about your well-being.
Asking if the visiting friend is doing well.

828
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,040
I guess he is just asking
when he knows it all already.

829
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,750
About what? That you got dumped?

830
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,630
Did you try to call her?

831
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:21,470
No. If I do, I think I really
need to make a coming out.

832
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:26,860
You look so obviously like a grim reaper.
Maybe she's slow.

833
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:33,220
Is that it?

834
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,480
- What?
- What you sense from Sunny.

835
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,130
There's more, of course.

836
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,690
- There is?
- I sensed that that woman has a name that is too great for her.

837
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,530
To have the same name as my sister?

838
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,314
It's a relief that you guys broke up.
I disliked

839
01:11:46,326 --> 01:11:48,950
so many things about her
every time I met her.

840
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:52,830
And she has no sense of logic at all.

841
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,860
I think you should stop criticizing Sunny.

842
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,270
You're taking her side?

843
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:05,590
There's something I didn't tell you.
That I saw Sunny's past life.

844
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,420
You said it was a secret.

845
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,130
Sunny seems to be a reincarnation
of your younger sister.

846
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,740
Sunny is? Not you?

847
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:19,810
Sunny's face in a previous life is the same
as the face of the woman in the portrait

848
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,130
you have.

849
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,350
You're sure of it?

850
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,930
What did you see?

851
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:39,330
The woman I saw was standing
in a spot in a palace.

852
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,160
She was wearing white and
her ranking seemed high.

853
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:52,470
She was shot in the chest by an arrow
and she collapsed while bleeding.

854
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,500
I told you that.

855
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:06,110
Maybe not the white clothes, but the
arrow... I don't think I said that.

856
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:09,840
What else? Did you see anything else?

857
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,910
She was riding in a palanquin and saw
someone and smiled, through a small window.

858
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:18,770
She smiles as she asks,

859
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,620
- am I...
- Am I pretty today?

860
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:29,190
A voice answered her.

861
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,600
- You're ugly.
- You're ugly.

862
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,260
Your younger sister...

863
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,440
Is it her?

864
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,200
It's her.

blinding to my eye.

874
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:21,460
Because the day was nice.
Because the day wasn't nice.

875
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:26,780
Because the day was just right.
Every day was good.
