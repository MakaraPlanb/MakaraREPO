(VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.)

3
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:14,174
Yes. That's why I'm saying this.

4
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,714
(EPISODE 16)

5
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:19,044
I'm saying this because today is just about right.

6
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:25,214
I'm saying this because you are still shining.

7
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:32,144
I'm saying this because you were that first love.

8
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,584
On another day that is just about right,

9
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:38,744
will you be my bride?

10
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:16,914
I will.

11
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:21,214
I will be the bride of this lonely man.

12
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,844
I will be...

13
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:29,174
the first and the last bride of this beautiful man.

14
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:31,344
I most definitely will be.

15
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,114
Mom.

16
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:13,344
I'm getting married.

17
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,414
I'll be happy.

18
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:24,774
I see you met the goblin.

19
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,514
And you're getting married.

20
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,774
Good for you.

21
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,914
Why am I tearing up?

22
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:34,774
Hey!

23
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,244
- Do you see us?
- Yes.

24
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,974
How long has it been? How have you been?

25
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:46,114
You finally see us again.

26
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,514
You startled me.

27
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,244
Have you been doing okay?

28
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,274
We were lonely, that's all.

29
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,274
Come with me.

30
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:57,874
I'll treat you better than the goblin does.

31
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:02,744
Wait here. I have a sack of salt somewhere to...

32
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:06,044
You still have the same fiery temper.

33
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,814
Congratulations.

34
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:11,774
- You're getting married.
- Congratulations.

35
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:19,944
Drink it.

36
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,914
It'll remove your memories from your life.

37
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,474
Thank you.

38
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,944
What kind of nonsense is this?

39
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:29,114
I won't share a table with my driver.

40
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:30,514
Or drink the same tea.

41
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,674
Here, everyone gets the same cup of tea.

42
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:36,244
What logic is that? I'm upset as it is to be dead.

43
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:38,744
Why should I be treated the same as...

44
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:42,014
the likes of a man whose whole life isn't worth the watch on my wrist?

45
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,874
I will tell you again.

46
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,614
Here, everyone gets the same cup of tea.

47
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:50,044
Your watch has already stopped ticking.

48
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:52,544
Nothing you have with you...

49
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:55,744
can pass that threshold.

50
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:00,274
Were you a powerful man in this life?

51
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,144
As soon as you go through that door, you'll realize that...

52
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:06,974
the crimes you committed with your eyes, your mouth,

53
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,944
your hands and feet...

54
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:12,874
and heart are much more powerful than anything you knew.

55
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:18,114
See how deep in Hades they drag you down.

56
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,174
Don't you want to go on a blind date?

57
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:40,644
I don't like chefs.

58
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,314
He isn't a chef.

59
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:44,414
He's a client of mine.

60
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,614
He's rich, owns a company,

61
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:49,544
is handsome and the crucial part is that...

62
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,214
he's young.

63
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,074
He likes older women.

64
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:57,114
I consult him about inheritance issues,

65
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,484
not anything shady. What do you think?

66
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,703
A blind date?

67
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,774
Oh no. These are new.

68
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:19,444
What just happened?

69
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,976
I shouldn't be waiting here.

70
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,076
Ji Eun Tak!

71
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,406
What should we listen to? A new singer's song?

72
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:30,576
Sure.

73
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,106
How can I help you?

74
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:38,276
I'm Producer Ji's boyfriend.

75
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:41,476
- What?
- Her fiance, to be exact.

76
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,176
Shall we get hitched this weekend?

77
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,106
- What?
- What?

78
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:48,276
Shall we get some lunch first? Let's get out of here.

79
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:52,306
Is someone joining us?

80
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,576
Deok Hwa. You should say hi.

81
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:57,976
I guess.

82
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:01,136
What if he doesn't recognize me because I look so old?

83
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:02,736
That will never happen.

84
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,876
Can I have some soup, please?

85
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,036
- Sure.
- He's here.

86
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:18,006
An official-looking feast in front of...

87
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,636
a couple sitting side-by-side.

88
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,976
- I got what's going on.
- Yes.

89
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,006
We're engaged.

90
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,136
- What?
- What?

91
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,206
Saturday or Sunday?

92
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,206
What got into you today?

93
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,036
Lunchtime or dinnertime?

94
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,606
I prefer Sunday evening. Saturday's my night out.

95
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,176
What's this about?

96
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,076
Can't you tell? It's to stop you from going on blind dates.

97
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,736
With a handsome rich guy...

98
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,576
who is younger than you.

99
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,306
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,036
I'm the only one in Korea who fits that description.

101
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,206
Don't worry. You aren't my type.

102
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,276
Nice to meet you. I am Yu Deok Hwa.

103
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,436
Hello, I heard a lot about you.

104
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,276
I am Ji Eun Tak.

105
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:02,836
He got promoted to manager.

106
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,306
Ji Eun Tak?

107
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:06,206
The Ji Eun Tak of that old letter?

108
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,136
The Ji Eun Tak who knows my tenant?

109
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,736
There's still a lot you don't know.

110
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:14,106
- Enjoy your soup.
- Thanks, I will.

111
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,436
So,

112
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,906
do you know what my uncle is?

113
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:25,206
He's a goblin. Doesn't everyone know one of those?

114
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,106
- Correct.
- No way.

115
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,276
You know about my building and my uncle.

116
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:33,306
What's going on? Why am I the only one in the dark?

117
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:34,406
Let's eat.

118
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:37,106
Eat up and grow up.

119
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,836
You'll find out in due time.

120
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:42,406
Me, too.

121
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,636
Don't you dare go on a blind date.

122
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,776
Why would I? I'll be a married woman soon.

123
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:58,076
She said "married woman".

124
00:07:58,376 --> 00:07:59,736
Where do you live?

125
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,776
I said you aren't my type.

126
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,076
Do you like your job?

127
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,736
My uncle's getting married.

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,806
That's great news.

129
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,776
It is. I want to get married before he does.

130
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,476
That's even greater news.

131
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,606
Isn't it? I'll have lots of kids...

132
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,036
so that no one's lonely.

133
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,536
I could wish for nothing more.

134
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,036
But Deok Hwa.

135
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:23,706
You need a partner to get married.

136
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:25,536
I have lots of women.

137
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,936
Yes, and that's the problem. You can't have many women.

138
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:35,806
Was there anyone who made your heart pound?

139
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:39,046
Anyone you missed to the point of wanting to cry?

140
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:42,676
Was there anyone who made you think you'd be willing to...

141
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,806
die for that person?

142
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:47,576
Not yet.

143
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,806
Don't you want to get married?

144
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,636
- I don't.
- Why not?

145
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:56,406
I'm already married with three kids.

146
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,076
I married such a person.

147
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:00,276
No way. Did you really?

148
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,506
- Why didn't I know that?
- I never told you.

149
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,106
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You never asked.

150
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,376
You don't care much about...

151
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,576
the people around you or how the world works.

152
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:15,406
That's why I'm waiting for you to ask questions.

153
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,806
Questions that an adult would ask.

154
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,706
About the world...

155
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:24,836
and about the joy and sorrows of those around you.

156
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:31,276
Thank you.

157
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:34,676
Give me a little more time.

158
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:38,046
I'll try my best to grow up.

159
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,176
You do that.

160
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,276
How could you just come out and tell everyone...

161
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,046
without my permission?

162
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,136
Eyes on the road. A car's coming.

163
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,406
Watch out.

164
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,306
Are you afraid?

165
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,836
No. Watching you drive makes me think...

166
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,876
you're all grown up. Stay in your lane.

167
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,306
- Keep your hands on the wheel.
- I am.

168
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:07,436
I know you are, I just find it fascinating, that's all.

169
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:09,106
I've never been a passenger before.

170
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,776
- Turn left here.
- Left?

171
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,476
Not right, left, left!

172
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:19,906
Stop yelling. Where are we going anyway?

173
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,576
Turn on the blinkers before you make a turn!

174
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,706
You look so pretty.

175
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:57,276
You look pretty nice yourself.

176
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,376
I always do.

177
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,976
Let's get married with a bowl of water.

178
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,576
Keep it mysterious.

179
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,436
Okay.

180
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,806
Is it a gift?

181
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,776
A wedding gift.

182
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:27,136
He has pretty wrists.

183
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:28,906
I'll take this one.

184
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,876
I love all the roads we will walk together.

185
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,306
I love all the sceneries we will see together.

186
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,676
I love all the questions we will shyly ask each other...

187
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,576
and all the answers to those questions.

188
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,736
I love you...

189
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,276
in all those moments. From your bride.

190
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:31,106
After we listen to a song, we will come back with a listener's story.

191
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,136
Cue.

192
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,036
What is this letter?

193
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,976
It's so poorly written.

194
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:39,306
Was this written at night?

195
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,676
What is it? I love love letters.

196
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,306
I'm sure you do.

197
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,206
"To the one who thought..."

198
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:48,576
"that oblivion would bring me peace of mind."

199
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,136
"The moment our eyes met, I knew..."

200
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:54,076
"that you too retained your memories."

201
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,106
Pick this story. It's my right as the producer.

202
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:57,306
I'll be back soon.

203
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:59,276
Eun Tak! Hey!

204
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:01,176
This is a live show!

205
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,836
"I pray that in our next life..."

206
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:08,606
"The wait will be short and the meeting shall be long."

207
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:12,806
"That we won't need an excuse to see each other."

208
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:17,736
"Entitled with our own dearest names."

209
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,306
"So we could greet each other..."

210
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:24,736
"when we accidentally run into each other."

211
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:28,376
With our love always being the solution.

212
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,776
I pray that we can meet like that.

213
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,576
I'm just happy that I saw your face.

214
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:38,476
Sometimes, you're Kim Woo Bin.

215
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,376
And sometimes, you're Wang Yeo.

216
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,206
Please live a long...

217
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:47,236
and happy life.

218
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,436
Goodbye.

219
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:56,106
Did she really sell the building? Didn't she just move?

220
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:59,376
No. She sold the building last week. You live on the rooftop, right?

221
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,976
You're my tenant now.

222
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,906
I heard you work for a radio station.

223
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:05,836
Yes.

224
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:08,936
I'm in a little bit of a hurry right now. I'll see you later.

225
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:13,406
(THE ROOFTOP UNIT)

226
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:24,306
Eun Tak.

227
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:25,976
I'm leaving.

228
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:28,536
Take care. Don't cry.

229
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,076
Get something to eat.

230
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:34,806
You were all alone without a family.

231
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,506
I hope I provided you a little bit of comfort.

232
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,576
Please take good care of my stubborn brother.

233
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,836
Stay happy together.

234
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,436
Goodbye.

235
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:50,836
She remembered everything.

236
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:56,936
Sunny...

237
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,636
left.

238
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,406
She remembered everything.

239
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,036
She kept the memory alone.

240
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,436
She took care of me when I didn't remember anything.

241
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,006
She missed her brother who disappeared.

242
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,306
She must've been so lonely.

243
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:20,136
Why did she leave now?

244
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,406
It's because she can't forgive him.

245
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,406
She made the choice...

246
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,106
not to see him again in this life.

247
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,476
There's no bigger punishment...

248
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:35,506
for the Grim Reaper.

249
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:54,236
I should count to 50 and leave.

250
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,036
One.

251
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,576
Two.

252
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,176
47.

253
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,776
48.

254
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,806
49.

255
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,360
One.

256
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:34,765
Two.

257
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,445
Three.

258
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,536
You will...

259
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,706
not hear from me.

260
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:55,676
In this life,

261
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:01,236
we will never meet again.

262
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,606
Can I...

263
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:10,806
hug you just once?

264
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,776
Take care.

265
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,176
Take care.

266
00:17:58,476 --> 00:17:59,976
Like that,

267
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:03,746
we parted in this life.

268
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:08,406
It was...

269
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,076
much later...

270
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,176
when I heard from her.

271
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:45,006
I touched this vulgar thing for you.

272
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,936
Why don't you try it?

273
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:52,006
The apples look like bunnies.

274
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,406
Sunny...

275
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,306
left.

276
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,476
She is...

277
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,776
always...

278
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,706
so good...

279
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,576
at leaving.

280
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:17,576
After what happened to you,

281
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,976
I didn't know what to do, so I kept it.

282
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,746
I meant to return it to you much sooner.

283
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,476
I'm sorry it's late.

284
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:32,076
It wasn't mine from the start.

285
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:35,836
It was your resentment, sin, and longing.

286
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:38,036
I think you should keep it.

287
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,746
Can I keep it?

288
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,306
Yes.

289
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,176
If you eat this.

290
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:50,976
And thank you.

291
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,006
I heard you lit the candles...

292
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:59,306
at the temple while I was gone for the past nine years.

293
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,976
I don't know if I had the rights to pay respects to them.

294
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,876
But I wanted to face my sins.

295
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:12,136
I wish someone could tell us.

296
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,636
"You've done enough."

297
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,836
"It's time to end it all."

298
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,806
I'd like that.

299
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:38,136
I heard you wanted to see me.

300
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,376
Yes.

301
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:42,776
I want...

302
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,036
to tell you a secret.

303
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,936
A secret?

304
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:54,776
You become a grim reaper if you commit a sin in your past life.

305
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:57,836
I wanted to tell you what your sin was.

306
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,706
The big sin we committed...

307
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:06,676
was taking our own lives.

308
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,876
Those who took their own lives...

309
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,506
are born again as grim reapers,

310
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:16,036
made to guide many deaths,

311
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:20,606
and live as a being that's in between the living and the dead.

312
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,906
What do you think is the reason for this?

313
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,976
Why do you think someone without a name...

314
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,036
or any memories...

315
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:31,706
needs a house...

316
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:34,906
and food?

317
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,006
What do you think is the reason?

318
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,176
While looking for the answer to those questions,

319
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,036
I realized one day...

320
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,136
that maybe it makes us...

321
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:47,106
yearn for a name...

322
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,476
and the life...

323
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,206
we had once abandoned.

324
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:57,436
Maybe this punishment ends...

325
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:59,876
when we become desperate for life.

326
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:06,706
I know why you avoided me.

327
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:08,936
I assume...

328
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:12,476
you met Park Joong Heon nine years ago.

329
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:15,436
That means you know...

330
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:19,036
who you are and who I am.

331
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,206
That's why...

332
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,376
I wanted to apologize.

333
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,976
I should not have chosen death...

334
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,706
by borrowing your hands as I did.

335
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,306
I regret it.

336
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:33,806
Also,

337
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:36,776
I beg for your forgiveness.

338
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:50,976
So forget everything.

339
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:52,976
Forget from now on.

340
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,106
Send off the deceased souls during their final moments.

341
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,806
Make penance like that.

342
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,006
I hope you will...

343
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,036
come to forgive yourself as well.

344
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,706
What the deity wants of us...

345
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:13,576
is probably to forgive ourselves and realize the earnestness of life.

346
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,676
Come eat.

347
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,276
Where are you going so late at night?

348
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:38,236
The soup will get cold. Eat.

349
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:40,536
Do you have a boyfriend?

350
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:44,836
I hope you don't end up being a single mom like your mom.

351
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,476
Why must you always...

352
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,576
How long are you staying?

353
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:55,376
I gave you enough memorial foods.

354
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,606
You're a ghost. It isn't good to roam for too long.

355
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,776
How dare you talk to me like that?

356
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,236
Hey.

357
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:06,376
I can't just go like this. It's not fair.

358
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:11,206
If only I had those bank books. If only you hadn't stolen them,

359
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:14,176
I wouldn't have died on the streets!

360
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,406
What's wrong with you?

361
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,506
Must you do this even after you die?

362
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,976
You're talking back because you haven't been hit in a while.

363
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,076
Why I...

364
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,206
Hey, lady. Whom do you think you're trying to touch?

365
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:39,576
She's someone I cherish dearly. Shall I break your wrist?

366
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:42,606
What's your problem? Who is this psycho?

367
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:45,206
I'm your senior by years, and what? A psycho?

368
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:50,036
You know what? You need to come with me.

369
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:53,206
Go with me. It's because I'm lonely.

370
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:58,276
I tend to get along well with evil witches.

371
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:01,606
Let go. Let go of me!

372
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,476
- Do you know her?
- Hey!

373
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:06,076
I think I've finally found my companion.

374
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:09,606
She'll be a good sparring partner for the lonely afterlife.

375
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:12,376
You're leaving?

376
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:16,006
It's time.

377
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,206
Thanks for everything.

378
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:22,706
Live happily ever after with the goblin.

379
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,876
Come on. Let's go.

380
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,376
Hold on.

381
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,706
Auntie. Thank you for raising me.

382
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:39,076
In our next lifetime, let's meet on good terms.

383
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:42,276
Don't make me laugh! Why would I meet you again?

384
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:44,906
Let go! Let go!

385
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,306
Let go.

386
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:49,436
Let go! Let go!

387
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:06,876
Hi.

388
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:12,006
You're still doing that alone. Where's the goblin?

389
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:14,506
I don't know. He said something about drawing fresh water.

390
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:17,776
I'm the one who wanted to see you.

391
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,136
I have something for you.

392
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,576
Did you get...

393
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,906
my name card?

394
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,676
No, it's not like that.

395
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,676
I see. You scared me.

396
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:38,276
Are you worried that your name will come up?

397
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,906
Not really worried. I'm curious...

398
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:44,306
about how my fate has changed.

399
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,976
Your fate has so many variables.

400
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:50,876
Exactly.

401
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:55,276
The birthmark is gone and I pulled out the sword.

402
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:59,206
So I've been living without problems for the past nine years.

403
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:05,276
But it doesn't change the fact that I'm a missing soul.

404
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,506
I was almost never born.

405
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,276
I drove the person I love to death.

406
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:14,306
And...

407
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:18,706
the person before me is a grim reaper.

408
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:24,176
Above all else, every human dies at some point.

409
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,506
That's why life is even more beautiful.

410
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:31,906
That's why...

411
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:35,006
the first thought I had once I got my memory back...

412
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:39,236
was to live each day as if it were my last.

413
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:44,106
If today is my last day, this will be...

414
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:47,076
my final memory of the person I love.

415
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,036
So I'd better...

416
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:53,876
live hard and love.

417
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:55,436
That's what I told myself.

418
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,676
Your life is already beautiful. Just know that.

419
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:05,076
What did you want to give me?

420
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:09,176
Here.

421
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,676
Congratulations on your wedding, Goblin's bride.

422
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:27,076
Thank you.

423
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,706
Until death parts us,

424
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:53,136
every word that you say,

425
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,636
whatever it may be,

426
00:28:58,306 --> 00:28:59,506
me too.

427
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:02,206
Until death parts us,

428
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:06,476
every word that you say, whatever it may be,

429
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:08,306
me too.

430
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,306
- That looks good.
- This?

431
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:21,176
Should we make more?

432
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:29,036
Champagne is best between 7 and 8ºC.

433
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:34,706
Uncle Tenant.

434
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,506
I feel drunk already, and I haven't even drunk yet.

435
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,576
You can't get drunk already.

436
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:57,606
- Bottoms up.
- Not you, too.

437
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:02,006
Are you okay?

438
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,706
- You don't look well.
- I'm fine.

439
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:08,236
Okay. I made it 7ºC.

440
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,576
Would you like a glass?

441
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,736
Yes, thank you...

442
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:16,636
- Oh no.
- Mr. Kim.

443
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:17,706
Seriously.

444
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:19,676
Can't you guys be more careful?

445
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,376
Both of you are too careless and relaxed.

446
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:28,306
What was that? How did that come out so naturally?

447
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:33,436
Sing. Sing.

448
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,506
Sing.

449
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,876
No, no. I can't sing.

450
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,106
I can't sing.

451
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:42,036
Meeting you.

452
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,706
Among all these people.

453
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:48,006
Was.

454
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,576
Really lucky.

455
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,506
Meeting you.

456
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:58,406
In this big world.

457
00:30:58,406 --> 00:30:59,676
All together, now.

458
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:05,106
Meeting you was happiness for me.

459
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:12,836
Meeting you among all these people

460
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm sleepy.

461
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:28,539
Goodnight.

462
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,839
I love you.

463
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:55,558
This is our last song. I wish you happiness.

464
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,758
Okay, good job.

465
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,541
Good work.

466
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,328
Today's show was so great.

467
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:07,928
You were right on time and the set list was perfect.

468
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,928
Our bulletin board is receiving a lot of good feedback.

469
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:11,458
It's rare to have such a perfect show.

470
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,628
Stop flattering me.

471
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:18,228
Then I'm going to go meet with a guest,

472
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,258
then go straight home from there.

473
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:20,658
All right.

474
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:22,588
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

475
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:46,358
It seems like a day care bus is going to get in an accident.

476
00:32:51,658 --> 00:32:53,888
This looks like the driver.

477
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,188
Now,

478
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,988
I really feel like this is a punishment.

479
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:06,258
I'll be back after this call.

480
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,098
Mister.

481
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:28,388
Sir. I just got a call from the head office.

482
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:31,258
They told us to discard the list we received today.

483
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,128
The children's fates have changed.

484
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,598
Really?

485
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,458
Why would it change, though?

486
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,928
Because of a death...

487
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,788
where a list cannot be made.

488
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:12,988
Can there be a death without a name list?

489
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:14,688
What do you mean?

490
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:21,128
A death that cannot be predicted.

491
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:24,558
(GOBLIN)

492
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:30,488
A sacrifice.

493
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:33,788
Where are you? It's a scary world out there.

494
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,458
Do you know what time it is?

495
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:38,958
It's 4pm. I'm on my way to a meeting.

496
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:42,728
Hold on. Let me turn right first.

497
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:44,788
You have to turn your handle right, okay?

498
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:46,488
Come on.

499
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:17,558
Hello? Eun Tak.

500
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,759
Ji Eun Tak.

501
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,528
The day care bus...

502
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,358
If I dodge, those kids...

503
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:34,158
What? I can't hear you. What did you say?

504
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:37,228
I must be crazy. What am I doing?

505
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,158
What's going on?

507
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,258
Now that I think about it,

508
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,958
it was such a perfect day.

509
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:07,928
When I woke up, I was in his arms.

510
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:12,158
Then I made perfect eggs.

511
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:15,128
The show today was perfect, too.

512
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,928
Everything went perfectly...

513
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:22,228
to bring me to this moment.

514
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:27,128
So that I won't be late.

515
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:32,328
Hello? Where are you?

516
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,858
Eun Tak, where are you?

517
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,658
I couldn't be late,

518
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:38,688
not even for a second.

519
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:41,428
This was my fate.

520
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:45,258
Goodnight.

521
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:51,888
I love you.

522
00:36:58,028 --> 00:36:59,258
Me too.

523
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:24,488
A human's sacrifice...

524
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:28,258
is something the almighty cannot predict.

525
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,858
It wasn't a part of his plan.

526
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:35,688
That's because it's a momentary instinct...

527
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,188
and a choice...

528
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,258
solely made by that human.

529
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:43,628
It's a choice...

530
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,528
only humans can make.

531
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,728
(JI EUN TAK, 29 YEARS OLD, CAR ACCIDENT)

532
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:57,158
We received...

533
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:00,528
a late...

534
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:02,928
name list.

535
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:09,358
She gave a sad answer...

536
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:12,758
to his wicked question.

537
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:17,258
Missing soul...

538
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,988
Move back, please.

539
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:22,988
Move back.

540
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,788
You were born on 1998,

541
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,228
July 23.

542
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,598
You are 29 years old.

543
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,828
Ji Eun Tak.

544
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:51,098
Can you...

545
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:54,628
confirm?

546
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:04,488
I questioned myself,

547
00:39:05,528 --> 00:39:07,158
but I was already...

548
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,988
doing it.

549
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:13,858
I was...

550
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:18,428
really scared.

551
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,788
This afternoon, a truck that was parked on the curve...

552
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:25,098
had its brake come loose and rolled down,

553
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:27,598
taking the life of a woman in her 20s.

554
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,258
That car must have taken all the shock.

555
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:32,228
My goodness.

556
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,758
She must've been an angel.

557
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:37,788
I believe that she's not an ordinary person.

558
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,628
Had it not been for her,

559
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,258
a lot more people would have died.

560
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,958
Is this the place...

561
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,728
you work at?

562
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:51,928
It's really nice.

563
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:56,828
Mister, there is something I'm curious about.

564
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:58,788
I heard...

565
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:01,758
humans have four lives.

566
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:04,888
How many lives have I had?

567
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,358
Can't you tell...

568
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:09,828
a dead person?

569
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:11,888
This was...

570
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,628
your first.

571
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:18,458
Thank goodness.

572
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:21,988
I still have three more.

573
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:42,828
I'll go get the tea.

574
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:44,558
You two can talk.

575
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:13,928
Do you...

576
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,788
remember what I said before?

577
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,728
The person left behind...

578
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:24,428
has to live to the full.

579
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,958
You'll cry sometimes,

580
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:30,228
but you'll also laugh a lot...

581
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,598
and live bravely.

582
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:37,458
That's the proper response to the love you were given.

583
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,928
How can it be like this?

584
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,358
How can you do this?

585
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:55,228
I'm sorry.

586
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,328
I'm so sorry.

587
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:10,388
Look at me. Let me...

588
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,158
see your face. Please?

589
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:21,758
Mister.

590
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:24,058
You forgot to grant...

591
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:26,328
one of my three wishes.

592
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,098
Can you grant me that wish now?

593
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:35,028
Don't be heartbroken for too long.

594
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,488
I'll come see you again.

595
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:39,528
Wait for me...

596
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:42,258
and don't make it rain too much.

597
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:45,358
It'll cause trouble.

598
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:48,458
That's three wishes, not one.

599
00:42:49,728 --> 00:42:51,388
How am I supposed to live without you?

600
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:53,388
I'll be gone for just a while.

601
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:56,958
I promise.

602
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,388
This time,

603
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:01,728
I'll come to you.

604
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:05,828
I will...

605
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,688
come looking for you.

606
00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:13,488
In our next life, I will make sure to be born with a long life...

607
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:16,228
and stay by your side for a long while.

608
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,488
I will beg the divinity...

609
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:23,258
to let me do just that.

610
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:35,988
When everyone else leaves...

611
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:38,428
Please...

612
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,728
take care of this man.

613
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:48,258
This is the tea of oblivion.

614
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,728
It'll remove...

615
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:53,228
your memories from your life.

616
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,528
I won't...

617
00:43:58,358 --> 00:43:59,988
drink the tea.

618
00:44:05,988 --> 00:44:07,258
I think...

619
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:10,228
I have to go now.

620
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:17,758
I'll be back soon.

621
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,758
I'll go running...

622
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,488
and come back running.

623
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,188
You have to come.

624
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:35,588
Even if it takes 100 years or 200 years.

625
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:37,528
I'll wait for you.

626
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:39,888
So...

627
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,128
See you...

628
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,258
again.

629
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:34,258
(GOBLIN)

630
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,228
(BRIDE)

631
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:48,588
In loving memory of...

632
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:51,358
beloved goblin's bride.

633
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:55,728
May she rest in peace.

634
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:08,188
(IN LOVING MEMORY OF BELOVED GOBLIN'S BRIDE.)

635
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:09,358
(MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.)

636
00:47:20,428 --> 00:47:22,488
(BELOVED, BRIDE, REST IN PEACE)

637
00:47:56,258 --> 00:47:58,088
That day,

638
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:00,958
Missing Soul walked through...

639
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:02,828
the tears of someone.

640
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:08,358
Tides of time got carried away...

641
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:11,028
by the rainfall.

642
00:48:12,488 --> 00:48:13,858
It was...

643
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,828
a very long rain.

644
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:19,888
Missing Soul...

645
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,758
left this world without a guardian...

646
00:48:23,388 --> 00:48:26,428
after leaving one behind.

647
00:48:28,428 --> 00:48:32,258
A very lonely and beautiful guardian.

648
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:42,928
She must have...

649
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:44,858
met her mom by now.

650
00:48:53,488 --> 00:48:55,028
What is that hairpin?

651
00:48:55,588 --> 00:48:57,588
You didn't pay for that, did you?

652
00:48:57,588 --> 00:48:59,558
No, this is of my dad's taste.

653
00:48:59,558 --> 00:49:02,188
Then wear it when he's around. Why do you have it on now?

654
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:05,688
I love my dad whether he's around or not.

655
00:49:05,688 --> 00:49:07,658
So mind your own business and shut your mouth.

656
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,688
I don't even have a dad who can buy me one of those.

657
00:49:11,788 --> 00:49:13,128
I don't get it.

658
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,358
Gosh, why do you have to get all serious?

659
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:21,158
What are you looking at, Lady?

660
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:25,958
Kids these days are scary.

661
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:27,828
Whatever.

662
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,158
Sweetheart.

663
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:35,758
I know you can be like that at your age,

664
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:39,588
but you don't have to be.

665
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:41,728
I was only looking at you...

666
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,988
because I couldn't believe how precious you are.

667
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:48,058
I'm sorry.

668
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,588
I'm sorry.

669
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:54,958
Do you want more fish cake?

670
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,058
- Yes.
- Yes.

671
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,458
First loves never work out.

672
00:50:09,728 --> 00:50:11,458
You must've loved her a lot.

673
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:13,158
I guess I did,

674
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:15,588
considering I can't hold back.

675
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:24,588
I mean...

676
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,328
I missed you so much that I couldn't breathe.

677
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:30,128
It was too dangerous.

678
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:49,058
The woman forgot about you,

679
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:51,688
but you didn't forget her.

680
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:54,058
No.

681
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,188
Never for a second or a day.

682
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:03,328
By the way,

683
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:10,488
you're not supposed to press my head like that.

684
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:19,888
You're supposed to pat it like this.

685
00:51:47,328 --> 00:51:51,428
(30 YEARS LATER)

686
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:27,458
It's your final name card.

687
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:32,488
Your long punishment has come to an end.

688
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,028
Is it just one?

689
00:52:42,888 --> 00:52:44,128
Yes.

690
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:51,958
Finally, it's the end of my long punishment.

691
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:54,258
Congratulations.

692
00:52:54,788 --> 00:52:56,058
Please...

693
00:52:57,788 --> 00:52:59,158
go in peace.

694
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:08,928
You've helped me a lot.

695
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:12,388
Thank you.

696
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:47,458
I won't need to dry clean this anymore.

697
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:09,858
You said...

698
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,088
I wouldn't hear from you.

699
00:54:20,328 --> 00:54:22,258
Your news came anyway.

700
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:49,688
It's my last job.

701
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,658
Take care.

702
00:54:52,558 --> 00:54:53,928
You too.

703
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,628
Regardless of the time or the appearance you wear,

704
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:01,188
be happy.

705
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:05,488
I've had a good life until now.

706
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:09,928
- Don't make it rain.
- Don't worry.

707
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:12,988
This has been my job for a long while.

708
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:20,358
Once the washing is done, make sure to hang the laundry.

709
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:27,388
When you're done with that, come to the tea house.

710
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:30,828
I plan to break the rules just one more time.

711
00:55:31,588 --> 00:55:33,428
I'm leaving anyway.

712
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:03,088
You haven't aged at all.

713
00:56:03,188 --> 00:56:05,258
You're still just as handsome.

714
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:07,958
Have you been well?

715
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,528
You said I wouldn't hear from you.

716
00:56:11,228 --> 00:56:12,888
I had forgotten...

717
00:56:13,928 --> 00:56:17,158
that the man I was seeing was a grim reaper.

718
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,728
I forgot that you would find out.

719
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,058
I've missed you.

720
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:26,828
I knew you would.

721
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:49,188
I've always wanted to put it on you properly, at least once.

722
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:53,888
I'm sorry I forced it on you so meanly that time.

723
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:58,258
I've missed you a lot.

724
00:56:59,788 --> 00:57:01,588
I knew you would.

725
00:57:03,228 --> 00:57:06,928
You are the last deceased soul...

726
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,358
that I am leading.

727
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:11,628
I see.

728
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:15,958
Then what's next?

729
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:18,058
What happens to us?

730
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:21,458
Is this our happy ending?

731
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:27,188
This was your third life.

732
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:30,058
What about you?

733
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:31,928
I don't know.

734
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,488
I guess...

735
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:38,888
this may be the last time.

736
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:44,128
Your brother is here.

737
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:46,328
Outside.

738
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:55,528
You still don't care about your brother.

739
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:59,258
I am happy I get to see you at least like this...

740
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:01,458
before I go.

741
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,588
It is because I made a good friend.

742
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:11,258
I'm sorry for going first and leaving you behind.

743
00:58:11,728 --> 00:58:13,788
Please take care of yourself.

744
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:18,028
Let's meet again someday.

745
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:19,858
Be happy,

746
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:22,028
my ugly sister.

747
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:21,928
My sister,

748
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:25,958
my friend,

749
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,728
and my bride...

750
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:35,688
have all left.

751
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:40,988
And as always,

752
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:45,172
I am left all alone.

753
01:00:14,371 --> 01:00:15,501
Cheer up.

754
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,163
Do you know why sandwiches come in pairs?

755
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:23,003
To share with someone else.

756
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:24,733
Take it.

757
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:29,333
There are lots of jobs in this world. We'll find one.

758
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,640
Eat up.

759
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:36,403
You're young.

760
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,163
I know you're frustrated.

761
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,703
Try to cheer up, though.

762
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,733
Some people shine...

763
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:45,833
later on in life.

764
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,033
Every life is touched...

765
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,563
by a deity at least once.

766
01:00:57,463 --> 01:01:00,033
Just when you're drifting away from the world,

767
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:04,033
if someone nudged you back in the right direction,

768
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:06,103
that would be...

769
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,403
when the deity chose to visit you.

770
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,963
I have to go.

771
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:15,663
Mr. Kim.

772
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:19,403
Go this way instead.

773
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:22,763
You will meet someone who needs your help.

774
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:26,163
Thanks for the sandwich.

775
01:01:35,263 --> 01:01:37,963
Do you know anything about cars?

776
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:39,163
Yes.

777
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,963
I can tell that this one's not running.

778
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:45,763
Can I help you?

779
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:49,363
Do you know about cars?

780
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:51,903
I've been fixing them for about 20 years.

781
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:55,033
Let's have a look.

782
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:57,133
Why didn't you call your insurance company?

783
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,733
They'd sort things out for you.

784
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:01,833
Did you call the insurance company?

785
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:05,803
I got distracted when you opened the hood.

786
01:02:05,903 --> 01:02:07,533
I'll call right away.

787
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:09,033
I believe...

788
01:02:11,203 --> 01:02:14,103
I was meant to meet you.

789
01:02:14,103 --> 01:02:15,263
Were we?

790
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:19,533
That's a romantic thought, Sir.

791
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:23,533
Yes. I'm a bit of a romantic.

792
01:02:23,663 --> 01:02:24,903
There we go.

793
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,203
As I sent the lantern flying that night,

794
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:37,163
I prayed that my sister, in her future...

795
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:40,263
and my master, in his future...

796
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:44,033
would meet again one day.

797
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:48,463
And when they meet again,

798
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,433
that they be happy.

799
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,103
That had been my wish.

800
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,103
What's this?

801
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,403
I arrest people right away,

802
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:03,733
handcuff them without hesitation...

803
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,363
and read them their rights.

804
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:07,003
You have the right to remain silent,

805
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:08,403
the right to refuse to testify...

806
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:11,303
I asked what this is about. Is that a hard question to ask?

807
01:04:11,303 --> 01:04:14,103
You asked me to show you how I act out an arrest.

808
01:04:14,163 --> 01:04:17,233
I just... I asked you to show me,

809
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,733
not actually handcuff me.

810
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:20,903
Your criminal's over there.

811
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,433
Oh, is she the criminal?

812
01:04:25,663 --> 01:04:28,533
You looked more like one. Sorry.

813
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:33,563
Don't I look like a detective?

814
01:04:33,563 --> 01:04:36,233
At 1st glance, 2nd glance and 3rd glance,

815
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:37,763
you look like a criminal.

816
01:04:37,763 --> 01:04:41,363
How dare you. What makes you think I'm a criminal?

817
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:44,033
Did I steal your heart or something?

818
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,403
You look like the hostess of a gambling den.

819
01:04:47,403 --> 01:04:49,263
From head to toe.

820
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:51,233
I just look like one.

821
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:54,403
I'm working undercover. Undercover.

822
01:04:54,403 --> 01:04:57,703
We're pretending this is 2016.

823
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:00,403
Forget it.

824
01:05:00,403 --> 01:05:02,933
Director, who is this guy?

825
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:04,463
Why is he so rude?

826
01:05:04,463 --> 01:05:06,963
Didn't I introduce you two?

827
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:09,803
He's our consultant, a detective from a violent crimes unit.

828
01:05:09,803 --> 01:05:12,333
I'm Lee Hyuk from Gangnam Police Station.

829
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:20,303
Lee Hyuk? No way.

830
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:22,303
I heard that.

831
01:05:26,903 --> 01:05:29,663
Don't get any ideas.

832
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:31,333
I'm an actress...

833
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,303
and we're filming nearby.

834
01:05:34,133 --> 01:05:36,333
The crew didn't book a hotel...

835
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,663
so I'm here because I don't have a choice.

836
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:47,203
I'm her stylist.

837
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,033
I have only one free room.

838
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,033
I can't believe...

839
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,133
why there's always only one free room.

840
01:05:57,133 --> 01:06:00,103
That's too bad. We'll take it.

841
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:03,203
Quickly, please.

842
01:06:03,503 --> 01:06:05,763
We could try looking for another hotel...

843
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:07,603
but we'd only get sore legs.

844
01:06:07,603 --> 01:06:10,033
Sore legs become swollen.

845
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:13,403
The more sleep I get the nicer my skin will be tomorrow.

846
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:16,533
Why didn't they book a room for the actress?

847
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:18,173
I never wanted to know.

848
01:06:18,363 --> 01:06:19,803
Here's the key.

849
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:23,603
Lead the way, stylist.

850
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,103
Do you have a room?

851
01:06:28,703 --> 01:06:31,463
Sorry, I only have one left.

852
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:35,203
Pretend you didn't hear that.

853
01:06:37,803 --> 01:06:39,133
I didn't hear anything.

854
01:06:41,403 --> 01:06:43,963
So what will we do now?

855
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:48,933
- What do you mean?
- Like...

856
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:52,033
"Should we date? Meet up regularly?"

857
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:55,263
"I like you." When will you say things like that?

858
01:06:55,263 --> 01:06:57,003
Aren't you going to?

859
01:06:58,173 --> 01:06:59,633
Should I say that first?

860
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:02,833
Should I, then? I'm an actress.

861
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,803
I'm already annoyed that I liked you first.

862
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:07,133
Who said you liked me first?

863
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:09,803
Everyone does. Are they all wrong?

864
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:11,033
- Yes.
- How?

865
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:12,603
I liked you first.

866
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,263
That's my state...

867
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:17,433
No, that's my confession.

868
01:07:20,463 --> 01:07:21,933
My goodness.

869
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:23,763
Just a step too late...

870
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:25,733
and I might have liked you first.

871
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:28,603
Give me your hand.

872
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:47,933
- What's this?
- Consider it like a handcuff.

873
01:07:48,173 --> 01:07:50,433
You just stole my heart.

874
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:53,263
Do you see this?

875
01:07:53,263 --> 01:07:55,703
They call you the Grim Reaper.

876
01:07:55,703 --> 01:07:58,033
Isn't this a bribe?

877
01:08:00,963 --> 01:08:02,863
Arrest me, then.

878
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:17,233
Is this our first day together?

879
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,173
Are you going somewhere, Sir?

880
01:08:34,803 --> 01:08:36,703
I'd like to go for a walk.

881
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:39,603
Avoid the main street if you can.

882
01:08:39,763 --> 01:08:43,173
Some Korean students are visiting and they're noisy.

883
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:46,833
- I shouldn't be long.
- Of course, Sir.

884
01:09:27,803 --> 01:09:28,963
I found him.

885
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:32,303
There is no sadness that lasts for eternity.

886
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:34,673
There is no love that lasts for eternity either.

887
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,033
I'm going to vote that there is.

888
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:39,033
Which one are you voting for? Love or sadness?

889
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,633
Sad love.

890
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:15,887
Mister.

891
01:10:17,203 --> 01:10:18,833
You know who I am, right?

892
01:10:22,203 --> 01:10:24,033
The first and the last...

893
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:28,403
goblin's bride.
