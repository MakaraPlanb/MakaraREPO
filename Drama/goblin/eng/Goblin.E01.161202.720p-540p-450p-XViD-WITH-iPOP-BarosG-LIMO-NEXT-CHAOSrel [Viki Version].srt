00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,320
<i>it becomes a goblin. </i>

4
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,890
<i> Understandably, a sword with the blood of thousands from many battlefields</i>

5
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,020
<i> was buried in the blood of it's master.</i>

6
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,000
<i> Only the goblin bride would be able to take the sword out.</i>

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>Once you pull this sword, it will return to nothing and be at peace.</i>

8
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,390
<i>It had to be an evil oracle.</i>

9
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,070
A goblin that was reawakened from extinction,

10
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,560
is somewhere in this world or he may be nowhere...

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,970
Even now, he might be somewhere...

12
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,470
Why are you laughing, you rotten girl!

13
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,540
So, he's searching for his bride somewhere even now and...

14
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,800
you want to say, "That bride is me." Isn't that it?

15
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,990
Even though I look like this now, I broke a few hearts in my day.

16
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,600
Don't come around next time and wonder where I've gone.

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,780
I'm so envious.

18
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,560
I must have lost my mind. I shouldn't be boasting in front of a single mom.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
You're bad.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,020
I gave you a discount on spinach, cabbages. What do you mean I'm bad?

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,230
That jerk who ran off without you is the bad one.

22
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,080
That's true.

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,650
But that story is so sad.

24
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,360
That's not that sad...

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,220
It's a very romantic curse.

26
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,090
Having to find a bride in order to die.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,050
God is bad.

28
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,770
God is always bad, selfish and jealous.

29
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,860
He only wants things for himself.

30
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,710
Just like some jerk.

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,360
I'll get going. Sell a lot.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
Be sure to stay here next time I come by.

33
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,140
When you face a moment at the brink of life or death...

34
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,130
be sure to pray earnestly.

35
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,420
<i> Perhaps... </i>

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,580
<i> a god with a tender heart may be listening to you. <br> [1968, Paris]</i>

37
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,900
I wouldn't recommend that.

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,360
If you leave home now, your life will get worse. You'll never see your mom again.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,730
Who are you?

40
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,200
- Are you Korean? <br> - I'm complex.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,580
It's your turn now. Speak clearly now.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,650
Tell him he's your dad since he adopted you. So tell him to raise you well.

43
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,090
Tell your mom, too. Ask her to help you. Say you're hurting.

44
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,230
What are you talking about? Move.

45
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,890
If you slash your arm like that, you won't die. You just won't be able to use your arm. Keep that in mind.

46
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,500
- Who are you? <br> - Don't avoid eye contact. Speak clearly.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,650
- Can you do it? <br> - And if I get beaten to death?

48
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,110
Will you take responsibility?

49
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,910
That's why I broke his ribs.

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,380
You little b*stard.

51
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,940
This is your lunch. Go to school after we talk.

52
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,510
The answer to your math problem #17 is 4, not 2. You missed that one.

53
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,150
You, who are you?

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,780
<i> He was water, fire, and wind... </i>

55
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,830
<i> He was also light and darkness. </i>

56
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,740
<i> And at one point... </i>

57
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,620
<i>He was human. </i>

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,920
<i> The people called him "god." <br> (Shin which means god in Korean)</i>

59
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,590
<i> Covered in red blood, he'd slash his enemies...</i>

60
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,240
<i> He was literally a god of war. </i>

61
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,890
<i> Hooray, General Kim Shin! </i>

62
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,740
<i> Hooray, Generals! </i>

63
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,900
<i> Hooray, Generals! </i>

64
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,900
Open the gate!

65
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,770
Here comes General Kim Shin, the champion of war!

66
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,760
Kim Shin, loosen your armor and receive the King's order.

67
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,500
You! Say that again.

68
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,750
A seventh-ranked auxiliary soldier dares to speak to the high general?

69
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,150
Traitor Kim Shin.

70
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,730
- Loosen your armor and... <br> - Seriously...

71
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,390
Okay, I will wait.

72
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,320
Are you satisfied?

73
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,800
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel.

74
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,740
- And hear the King's order. <br> - I'll pull your tongue out!

75
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,630
What? Traitor? Are you crazy?

76
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,530
Did you lose your mind?

77
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,500
General...

78
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,600
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel...

79
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll meet the King. Step aside.

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,530
- Criminal Kim Shin... <br> - If you stop me, you'll surely die.

81
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,410
Get out of my way.

82
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,120
You b*stards!

83
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,720
We fought three days and nights in the name of the King!

84
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,980
We just came back from that hell hole!

85
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,290
And you... how dare you!

86
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,400
<i> Open the gate! </i>

87
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,260
Stay here.

88
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll be right back.

89
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,630
King above the people. God above the King...

90
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,080
They say that "god" (shin in Korean) refers to Kim Shin.

91
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,770
<i> That man's continual victory is mesmerizing the people and... </i>

92
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,220
<i> his power continues to mock the royal court. </i>

93
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,690
Please rule over him strictly with the law of the land.

94
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,270
<i> He clearly saw the enemy's sword. </i>

95
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,470
<i> But he didn't see the young King's jealousy and fear directed toward him.</i>

96
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,460
<i> That was... </i>

97
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,010
<i> the sharpest knife point pointed at him.</i>

98
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,760
<i> He did not know that. </i>

99
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,010
Must you go to this extent?

100
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,140
So, don't come closer. Stop right there.

101
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,170
Whatever that may be, stop it.

102
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,770
Stop right there and die a traitor. Then, everyone else will survive except you.

103
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,940
But if you move one step closer...

104
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,030
I'll kill everyone at every move you make and lay them in front of you.

105
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,380
Please go, General.

106
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,770
I,

107
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,750
I'm okay.

108
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,130
I...

109
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,420
- Your Highness... <br> - I know.

110
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,870
I truly know everything.

111
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,330
If this is our last moment, this is my fate.

112
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:02,220
So, please go. Don't stop and go to the King, General.

113
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,750
Traitors! Don't let anyone in that household live!

114
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,430
This is the King's order!

115
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,960
Wait!

116
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,210
What are you doing? Make him kneel!

117
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,970
General!

118
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,470
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

119
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,020
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

120
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,920
When did the heavens side with you guys?

121
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,670
The criminal's gaze is causing the royal mind to be in disarray.

122
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,650
Be sure to kill him!

123
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,220
This is not yours to do.

124
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,510
General. General.

125
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,590
For the last time,

126
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,210
I'd like to make a request to you.

127
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,240
I will attend your order.

128
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,010
Please forgive me.

129
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,070
I will soon follow suit.

130

<i>No one is to tend to a traitor's corpse.</i>

131
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,670
<i>Throw it in the field as food for the birds and the beasts.</i>

132
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,490
<i>Pacifying the hunger of the birds and the beasts </i>

133
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,950
is the limit to that man's worth.

134
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,390
It's the royal command!

Aish, what is this jerk doing?

149
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,780
Are your eyes just decorations?

150
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,970
You want to die?

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,960
Wild boar.

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,340
What?

154
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
You hit a boar.

155
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,560
Are you alright? Should I call to report for you?

156
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,930
I hit a boar.

157
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,280

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,400

I'm not sure. She's not moving.

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,000
May you only regret in this life.

177
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,180
- Goblin? <br> - Grim Reaper?

178
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,310
What a vulgar hat you wear.

179
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,550
<i>My Lord.</i>

180
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,500
It's been twenty years.

181
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,020
Have you been well all these years?

182
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,660
Have you been well, too?

183
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,630
I've aged a lot.

184
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,770
<i>My Lord, you are just as dashing.</i>

185
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,130
He doesn't look all that dashing.

186
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,320
You rascal!

187
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,050
<i>It's my grandson that I mentioned in my letter.</i>

188
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,280
Pay your respect.

189
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,510
Who is this ahjusshi?

190
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,500
So you are Deok Hwa.

191
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,210
I am your uncle, then I will be your brother.

192
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,370
Then I will be your son and your grandson.

193
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,010
Please look at me fondly.

194
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,100
- What is that? It's getting really weird. <br> - You rascal!

195
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,850
Aigoo, I'm so sorry.

196
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,200
He's the only son in four generations, so very spoiled.

197
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,760
- But you are... <br> - Me? What?

198
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,800
Once there was a person born in Goryeo but died on foreign land.

199
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,280
Your distant ancestor.

200
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,020
You look just like that child.

201
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,520
Is that ancestor handsome?

202
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,940
Rascal. I don't know how this kid was born from us.

203
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm ashamed, my Lord.

204
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,790
Don't worry about it.

205
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,810
- No one from your lineage ever disappointed. <br> - But, Uncle...

206
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,750
Why do you keep using informal speech to my grandpa?

207
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,430
- Do you want to die? <br> - You rascal!

208
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,250
<i>My Lord.</i>

209
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,620
I came too late.

210
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,750
I'm sorry your servant has

211
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,690
been sick...

212
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,180
I, right now...

213
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,770
my time is done.

214
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,600
From now on...

215
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
this child,

216
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,560
<i>will serve you.</i>

217
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,140
<i>My grandson.</i>

218
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,200
This knife is the Lord, Grandpa?

219
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,080
<i>The soul of your citizen desires you. </i>

220
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,660
<i>However, the blood of thousands is on your sword. </i>

221
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,700
<i>They were enemies to you but they were also God's creation.</i>

222
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,150
<i>Stay immortal alone and watch your loved ones die. </i>

223
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,910
<i>You will never forget any deaths. </i>

224
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,880
<i>This is my prize to you and the punishment upon you. </i>

225
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,390
<i>Only the bride of the Goblin can pull that sword. </i>

226
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,210
<i>Once you pull this sword, it will return to nothing and be at peace. </i>

227
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,310
My Lord.

228
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
I have a place I need to go.

229
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,370
Sir.

230
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:33,240
How dare you commit such a blasphemous act!

231
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Why this bastard...

232
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,340
You are...

233
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,730
I

234
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,620
am late.

235
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,990
You are

236
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,520
my first punishment, it seems.

237
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,560
Please accept my bow.

238
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,640
From this moment forward, I will serve you.

239
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,210
It was my grandpa's will.

240
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,860
I am blinded by revenge.

241
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,460
I never even asked how you've been.

242
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,840
But,

243
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,920
you will still do this?

244
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,340
It's nice to see such a scene at peace.

245
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,750
I'm happy that you get to see this scene at peace.

246
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,980
Here.

247
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,790
I am still full, so you eat it, my Lord.

248
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,990
You haven't eaten anything so how are you full?

249
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,980
I am small so even if I eat just a little, I get full.

250
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,980
You are big, my Lord, so you eat it, my Lord.

251
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,590
Then let's do this.

252
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,160
We are still far from the land.

253
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,460
If we share it, neither will get full.

254
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,130
So you will starve?

255
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,790
If I get really hungry, I can beg the shipmen for food.

256
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,160
Did you think I brought you here so you can beg for food? Trust me.

257
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,690
I might be an even bigger person than you thought.

258
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,740
Hurry.

259
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,180
Wow.

260
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,040
My Lord! My L--

261
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Can I take a look at your sack? To balance the ship's weight.

262
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,840
My Lord! My Lord!

263
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,770
Put the child down at once and I will spare your life.

264
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,030
The waves are suspicious like a foul one is on board.

265
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:49,760
We'll sell the guy as a slave so keep his limbs untouched and throw the kid overboard.

266
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,220
Do you know what happens when a human is worse than a beast?

267
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,970
You meet the angry god.

268
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,130
It's a Goblin.

269
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,670
Save us.

270
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,080
It's too late.

271
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,720
At peace... it's nice to be back.

272
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,290
Save me.

273
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,510
<i>If there's a god, please. </i>

274
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,840
<i>Save me.</i>

275
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:30,430
<i>Save me, I'm begging you. Someone, please.</i>

276
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,750
Who are you?

277
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm someone.

278
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,430
Please. Please help me.

279
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,610
I'm not sure.

280
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:22,200
My principle is to not to get involved in human life and death.

281
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,060
I can't die like this.

282
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,760
So you're not the one you're begging to save.

283
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,700
Just the baby then.

284
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:20,550
You were lucky. You met a soft-hearted god. I don't want to see anyone die tonight.

285
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,020
<i>[Ji Yeon Hwa, Age: 25]</i>

286
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,600
<i>[No name, Age: 0]</i>

287
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,990
Snow and blood

288
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,380
and flower.

289
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,180
<i>Goblin's bride.</i>

290
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,760
<i>Goblin's bride is born.</i>

291
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,480
[8 years later]

292
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,380
What should I make for our Eun Tak's birthday?

293
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,740
Rice cake? Rainbow rice cake?

294
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,400
Mom, can I have a party instead of a feast now?

295
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,720
What's the difference?

296
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,530
Rice cake vs. regular cake. I want to blow a candle, too.

297
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,310
I don't think they listen when I make my wish on a rice cake.

298
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,230
I didn't think about that. I made rice cake because you like rice cake.

299
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,740
Alright, starting from this year, we'll do parties with regular cake.

300
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,470
Wow, Mom is the best!

301
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,710
It's a puppy.

302
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,620
A puppy?

303
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,470
Look at this. Spring is here again. Isn't it amazing?

304
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,110
My, I'm so tired. Mom, I got 100% in English today.

305
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:06,060
I used my brain too much and I'm so tired.

306
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,540
Is that so?

307
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,450
- Wow, it's a cake! Mom, are we doing the party now? <br> - Yes.

308
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,260
Hurry and come sit. Light the candles.

309
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,100
I can light them?

310
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,570
Our Eun Tak is all grown up now so she can.

311
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,030
That's right. I'm 9 now.

312
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,210
I got 100% in English too so this is a piece of cake.

313
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,230
- Where did you learn that slang? <br>- You don't need to know, Mom.

314
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:40,080
I learn easily from this and that person. I might be a genius.

315
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,640
What? You should make a wish.

316
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,810
Happy birthday, my puppy.

317
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,970
It's not?

318
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,910
You're really not mom, but you're a soul.

319
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,270
You

320
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,260
really can see it all.

321
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,370
I wished for you not to...

322
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,820
Mom, are you really dead?

323
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,060
Really?

324
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:35,200
Where is my Mom? I really want to see her right now.

325
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,770
The hospital near the crossroad.

326
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,090
There will be a call from the hospital soon, and your aunt will soon arrive when you get there.

327
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,450
It's cold at night, so make sure you wear your scarf.

328
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:02,520
And ask the supermarket grandma to go with you. You can find her, right?

329
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,670
Down the alley where the dry cleaner is and to the right.

330
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:10,770
How clever, my little puppy.

331
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:18,270
In the future, don't ever look at the souls.

332
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,430
I'm sorry, Mom, for looking at those kind of things.

333
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,210
But, because I can see those things,

334
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,600
I can see you.

335
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,560
I'm really alright.

336
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,180
Okay.

337
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,490
Thank you

338
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,640
for seeing Mom like this.

339
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,150
Eun Tak...

340
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,540
I think I have to go now.

341
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,690
I love you, my little puppy.

342
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,160
Me, too. I really love you, Mom.

343
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,220
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

344
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,370
Mom, please go to heaven, okay?

345
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,660
Please. Please.

346
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,450
Mom!

347
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,820
Mom!

348
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,290
<i> Hello? Is this Ji Yeon Hee's home? This is Jaeil Hospital at the intersection. </i>

349
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,740
I know. I'm coming.

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,810
A wish... I'm not going to make a wish.

353
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:39,940
I'm not going to wish for anything. No one's going to listen so who would I wish to.

354
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,950
♬ <i> With me </i> ♬

355
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,390
How come, Grandma, you really don't age?

356
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,580
Is there more to age from here?

357
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,930
I guess that's kind of true.

358
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:21,160
Would it be okay if you look over Eun Tak here and there sometimes?

359
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,130
What the hell? Why would I look after your daughter?

360
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,440
Just here and there.

361
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,370
Give her some cabbage or spinach if there's any leftovers.

362
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,390
So why didn't you die together then, instead of living?

363
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,430
You're cruel.

364
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:45,620
You're the one who told me to sincerely wish for something.

365
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,230
There's a stupid girl who believes all that.

366
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,840
Thanks to believing that. I guess I could live on a bit more.

367
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,250
Thank you, Grandma.

368
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,120
I came to say goodbye.

369
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,340
I'm going.

370
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,160
Ahjusshi, who are you?

371
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,830
You... can you see me?

372
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,590
Oh yeah, scarf, I didn't wear my scarf. My mom will scold me.

373
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,360
You did wear your scarf.

374
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,870
This is Ji Yeon Hee's home, right? She wasn't at the hospital. That's why I'm here.

375
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,030
But... How did a kid like you who was never supposed to be born..

376
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,440
[no name, age zero]

377
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,650
By chance, did you turn 9 this year?

378
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,190
I don't hear your voice at all, Ahjussi.

379
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:34,030
But what are you doing here?

380
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,990
Go.

381
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,830
- Leave that child alone. <br> - Grandma!

382
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,580
- You're interfering with my duty. <br> - Never mind that.

383
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,560
Why are you doing what you should've done years ago?

384
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,230
I'm glad I get to do it even now. I'm running out of time.

385
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,790
That's your problem. Is this child's name in the book?

386
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:01,790
<i>That child back then didn't have a name, but this child has a name.</i>

387
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,880
If you have a record with this child's name in it, bring it to me. Then, I'll let you take her.

388
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,250
I need to document 9 years worth of evidence to get cooperation from the Directory Department.

389
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,190
You know this...

390
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,830
I will see you later, Child.

391
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,330
Grandmother, Mother...

392
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,540
I know. That can't be helped. You need to live.

393
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,400
You have to move within three days, so that he can't find you.

394
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,500
Since you've been spotted by the Grim Reaper, you can't live here anymore.

395
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,160
If I move, he can't find me?

396
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,930
He can't. That's why the land you choose is important.

397
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:04,450
After midnight tonight, a man and two women will come looking for you.

398
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,860
Follow them.

399
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:14,640
You'll suffer a little bit, but you don't have a choice.

400
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,830
But why are you telling me these things?

401
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,760
You're pretty.

402
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,350
When I gave you to her...

403
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,380
I was happy.

404
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,250
Here, your birthday gift.

405
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,140
[Ten years later]

406
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,670
Excuse me.

407
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:52,260
Shall we grab a drink?

408
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,140
Sounds good.

409
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,370
<i> The card that was working fine up until yesterday won't work anymore all of a sudden. </i>

410
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:07,860
<i> So, Uncle... you know those rude men in suits at the bar? </i>

411
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:13,790
<i> Right now, I'm with... I'm with those people. So, please answer the phone.</i>

412
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:19,830
<i> They asked for your cell phone and I told them you don't have one and they were extremely rude to me. </i>

413
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:23,090
<i>Uncle, are you listening?</i>

414
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,760
<i>Uncle! Uncle!</i>

415
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,300
<i>Uncle!</i>

416
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,850
Her senior year is almost over and she's still eating alone.

417
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,560
If you feel sorry for her, why don't you eat with her?

418
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,920
You crazy? Why should I? She sees ghosts.

419
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,710
More than ghosts, I'm more scared of her. You can't see ghosts.

420
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:51,240
Look at her. She can hear everything, but pretends not to.

421
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,530
<i>Hey.</i>

422
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,000

424
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:15,890
Come with me.<i></i>

425
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,930
<i> I'm so lonely. </i>

426
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,820
<i>Hey, why are you ignoring me?</i>

427
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,400
You bitch!

428
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,530
You really scared me!

429
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,340
Huh? So you can see everything.

430
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:41,560
You... It's true then? I... I'm... sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

431
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,840

432
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,120

00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,070

Duk Hwa is already 25 years old.

455
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,250
I told him to fix it up here and there, so leave around the end of the month.

If you want to leave now...

457

I probably won't get to see you again in my lifetime.

00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:41,590
I thank you for every moment.

459

Uncle, you're here. I begged you so hard to come get me, yet you're still here.

01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,000
Don't jump in the middle of adult conversation!

My secretary canceled it, punk.

Geez, I got so embarrassed! Do you know what it took me to seduce her?

468
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:27,550
If you were going to do this, why did you make me into an heir?

469
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,050
Uncle, are you going somewhere?

470
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,150
Where are you going?

471
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,880

01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,430
Grandpa, please be quiet.

473
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,490
Is that it? You looking for your bride?

474
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,770
Look, why can't you tell me you're leaving to get married, huh?

475
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,070
Why couldn't you tell me?

476

What's with seaweed soup? Is today someone's birthday?

483
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,620
Daebak, did she just make seaweed soup because it's her birthday?

484
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,720
It is. Aigoo.

485
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,110
Why is she proud of coming into this world on the day her mom passed away?

486
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,320
Since she's not educated, she's got nothing to be ashamed of.

487
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,850
She learned it from you. Is it her fault you raised her for the past 10 years?

488
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,640
Just eat up.

489
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,060
Thank you for celebrating my birthday, Aunt.

490
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,950
This is why they say not to raise an animal with black hair. I'm too nice.

491
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,880
Your mom's the poor one. She gave birth to you and raised you as an unwed mother.

492
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,640
That's too harsh.

493
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,290
What do you mean, harsh? She may have been your mom, but she's my older sister.

494
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,450
That's what I mean. With heart and bloodline, I'm closer to her.

495
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,320
<i>Mom, do you even know what you're saying?</i>

496
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,310
Just eat.

497
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,420
Where are you running off to?

498
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,530
I'm not running off. I'm going to school.

499
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,130
You're dead if you take the umbrella.

500
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:05,640
Bring your bank book to the bank after school. If you don't come again today, you know what's coming, right?

501
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,840
I said I don't have a bank book. How many times must I...

502
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:18,450
Then, where is that bank account? Where is your mom's insurance money?

503
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,630
How should I know that?

504
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:30,060
You took everything, Aunt. You even took the house deposit!

505
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,720
Geez, why does she talk so much from early in the morning... Gosh...

506
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,680
Shut up and bring it if you don't want to get beat up.

507
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,050
By the time I got to the bank, my bank book that was in the bag was gone. Who else took it besides you?

508
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,880
I'm telling you, she's possessed.

509
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,080
That's right. There's a ghost behind your back.

01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:58,080
♬ <i>Fading into shadow of tears</i> ♬

519
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:04,700
But, my Lord, are you leaving alone this time as well?

520
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,430
That's what's happened.

521
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,030
None of the women I met could pull the sword.

522
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,630
I think that's a relief.

523
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:21,800
When you're in pain because of the sword, I wish the bride would appear quickly.

524
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:26,600
But when I meet you like this, I wish no one knows about it.

525
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,460
Just human greed.

526
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:38,060
I feel relieved, too, that I still have you.

527
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,770
And the wine is plentiful.

528
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,470
Tonight, I'd like to live.

529
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,420
Should we toast?

530
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:24,950
When I was 9, I made up my mind to never do this.

531
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:28,390
But it's because I am very desperate, so I beg your understanding.

532
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,750
Please let me find a part-time job and do something about my aunt and the family.

533
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:37,250
Please let me have a boyfriend, too.

534
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:45,010
<i>Please let me find a part-time job and do something about my aunt and the family.</i>

535
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,590
<i>Please help me get out of this measly circumstance </i>

536
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,510
somehow, please.

537
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,180
What the heck am I doing?

538
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,530
Who am I begging? There's no god.

539
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,350
It can't be raining, too, on top of all this.

540
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:21,520
Is this a small shower or a long rain?

541
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,610
Is the rain actually going to stop?

542
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:29,910
There's only two umbrellas but the rain keeps coming!

543
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,970
<i>Is it you?</i>

544
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,950
You scared me.

545
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,510
Me?

546
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:48,610
Me?

547
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,150
Are you talking to me?

548
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,330
Yes, you. Is it you?

549
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,500
- What is? <br> - Are you the one that called me to come?

550
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,470
Me? Not that I know.

551
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,780
You called me to come. How in the world did you do that?

552
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,950
How could I? I really didn't call you to come.

553
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:09,600
You did call. Clearly. Think about how you did it.

554
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,580
Earnestly?

555
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,420
I didn't call you.

556
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,820
I just see you.

557
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,660
Like last time when our eyes accidentally met on the street.

558
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,050
You're that ahjussi, right?

559
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,240
What do you mean you see me?

560
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,620
You're a ghost. I see ghosts.

561
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,900
- I'm not a ghost. <br> - That's what they all say at first.

562
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,740
What are you?

563
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,250
What are you that I can't see what I normally see?

564
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,790
What should you be seeing?

565
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,080
Your 20s and 30s, your future.

566
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,200
I guess there isn't a future.

567
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,850
But were you a shaman before you died? Or a conman?

568
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,560
How you talk about the future.

569
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,450
What? What did you say?

570
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:03,160
Go to a nice place. It's not good for you to roam around for long.

571
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,460
But what's that flower?

572
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,890
You said to go. So why did you say that?

573
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:11,250
I understand, go.

574
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,030
Buckwheat flowers.

575
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:15,390
But that's not what I was asking.

576
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,460
I mean, why do you have it?

577
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,090
Let me see it. It doesn't suit you.

578
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:25,590
That was the first time I heard that. First time, for real.

579
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:31,470
You can give it to me. It's my birthday today.

580
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,530
A very glum birthday.

581
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,510
I seem to get plants on my birthdays. When I was 9, I got cabbage.

582
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:59,140
But what does buckwheat flower mean in flower language?

583
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,440
Lover.

584
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:09,000

586
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,320
Why were you crying?

587
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,580
The part-time job, the aunt's family, and the boyfriend. Because of which one of these three?

588
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,950
How do you know that?

589
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,220
I heard you.

590
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,360
What do you mean you heard me?

591
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,680
I sometimes make someone's wish come true, too.

592
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,790
Someone's wish come true?

593
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:49,460
Like that genie? Like a guardian god?

594
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,210
Really? No wonder!

595
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:56,670
When I first saw you, I did sense you had a different vibe than other ghosts.

596
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,170
You're really my guardian god?

597
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,430
I never said I was your guardian god.

598
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,500
My mom said this.

599
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,680
Everyone is born with their own dictionary.

600
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:09,910
In my dictionary, no matter how you flip through it,

601
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:13,130
there's no sign of the words 'happiness' or 'luck' at all.

602
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:18,220
- You know what I mean, right? <br> - I don't.

603
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,100
Some five thousand bucks, I mean.

604
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,970
If cash is difficult, you can let me know this week's lottery numbers.

605
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:30,550
Go say good bye to your aunt's family. You won't see them for a while.

606
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:34,120
And work hard at your job at the chicken eatery. You'll get the job.

607
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:43,050
Hello? What about my boyfriend?

608
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,340
Hello? Look here!

609
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,990
How petty!

610
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,290
We've met before.

611
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:08,340
- Yes, we did. <br> - I am very familiar with your rumors.

612
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,300
There's a lot of truth to my rumors.

613
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,650
What brings you to my house?

614
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:14,650
You live here?

615
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:20,060
All the furniture is optional so if you just move yourself in...

616
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,500
Uncle, when did you come in?

617
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:27,430
- Explain. <br> - Uncle, it's just that this place would be vacant for 20 years anyway.

618
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:33,310
So for that 20 years, how much rent would we collect? I started with that very innocent curiosity.

619
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,850
Do you know what that is to bring it in?

620
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:41,010
How can you call the new renter "that thing?" He runs a tea shop.

621
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,590
Sorry, my uncle's not used to social exchanges.

622
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,780
- Please have some coffee. <br> - Thanks.

623
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,600
I haven't gotten the money yet.

624
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,830
There's a new car in the courtyard.

625
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,090
It's the new renter's car.

626
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,150
It's not my car. And the money...

627
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,090
I already gave him all.

628
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,830
Then I'll return the money to you, so you can leave now.

629
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:05,930
I know your situation, but

630
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:09,720
I've signed the contract already.

631
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,620
I hope that wasn't an important document.

632
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,650
That was a copy. The original copy is at the real estate office.

633
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:21,450
My stuff will come tomorrow.

634
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,160
If you're done drinking, go. Coffee is where my kindness stops.

635
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,570
Go pack your stuff instead.

636
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,600
You can start packing for 20 years.

637
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,340
You're going to fight with the Goblin?

638
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,650
I'm sure you're aware of what a contract with the Grim Reaper means.

639
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:39,160
In lieu of this house, I can take that buddy just now?

640
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,550
I guess there's no other choice. We've got many extra rooms<br> so you can stay here like it's your own.

641
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,640
- It is my house. <br> - It's my house.

642
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,570
If you can kick out the goblin on goblin land, then I'll give you a cheer.

643
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,050
What a barbarian.

644
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:15,550
What a lowly meal table I've only heard of through the grapevine...

645
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,980
Wait. My mistake.

646
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,510
I meant to put it on my food.

647
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,300
My mistake,too.

648
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,150
- I meant to sprinkle it on you.<br> - You?

649
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:42,330
Didn't we settle on how we address each other earlier?

650
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:46,190
This, that, you and me.

651
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,750

01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,460
I should've gotten his number at least.

667
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,820
Hey.

668
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,930
- See? It's you. <br> - You scared me.

669
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,000
Why do you keep following me?

670
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,920
I'm not following you. You called for me again.

671
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,760
I didn't. If I had that talent, I wouldn't be in this hardship.

672
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,410
How would I? Do I shake some bells?

673
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,630
How can you ask me that?

674
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,890
You keeping saying I did when I didn't call you.

675
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,810

Is the chicken place you talked about a poultry farm by chance?

679
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:35,510
A part-time job at a poultry farm?

680
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,770
- It's not. <br> - Then where?

681
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,990
You made me look forward to it like it was going to happen.

01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,800
Tell me everything you see about me.

691
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,860
- You are wearing a school uniform. <br> - And?

692
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,280
It's pretty.

693
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,190
The uniform is.

694
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,670
Is that all?

695
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,620
You don't see some wings or something?

696
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:30,860
I think I'm a fairy. Tinkerbell.

697
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:39,910
It's just a joke.

698
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,740
Wait. His phone number.

699
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,880
In the name of the Holy Father, the Holy Son and the Holy Mother. Amen.

700
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,370
Let us pray. We thank Our Lord who has given us blessings.

701
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,650
We want to get closer to you. May you bless us with a way.

702
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,570
Always.

703
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,620
I know it. I know how I called you.

704
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,930
But this isn't the best place to call me, right?

705
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,950
You're scared? They are very good people.

706
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,720
Don't flatter me. You said there's no god.

707
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,280
I just came to see where he might be.

708
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,290
How come you don't go in a flame and walk instead?

709
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,980
You can't do that here. It's like a type of demilitarized zone.

710
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,610
Don't follow me.

711
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:59,380
What are you going to do about my wish? None of the three was granted.

712
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,550
Your aunt issue will be resolved soon. Your job, too.

713
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:03,020
Not that. My boyfriend.

714
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,520
You need to work hard on that, too.

715
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:13,280
I don't think you should let me be like this.

716
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,880
I know the method now. It's like I got his number.

717
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,640
I didn't think this would work.

718
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,700
Why did you do it if you thought it wasn't going to work?

719
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,750
Oh, wait a minute.

720
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,290
Did you just grab me?

721
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,340
I can't do it anymore. So hot!

722
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,040
It was blue flame so I thought it was going to be cold.

723
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:58,790
Blue flame is the hottest. You need to study harder.

724
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,570
Right.

725
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,630
I never lost being first place in my class<br> even after losing my parents at a young age and living with...

726
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,020
Never mind.

727
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,910
Instead of being my guardian god or something, <br>can you just end this with giving me five thousand bucks?

728
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,800
I've got work to do so I need to go, okay?

729
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,780
What work?

730
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,760
Your attire is pretty formal.

731
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,770
Tomorrow's the memorial date of someone I know.

732
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,920
But why are you going today? Is it in the countryside?

733
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,360
Over there, today is tomorrow.

734
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,950
When are you coming back? Tomorrow? The day after?

735
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,080
- I have something I really want to ask you. <br> - Do it quickly.

736
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:36,160
I know this question will sound weird<br> but please listen to it without any misunderstanding.

737
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,490
I got it so go ahead. What?

738
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:40,390
I thought you might be the grim reaper at first.

739
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:44,500
But if you were the grim reaper, you would've taken me away as soon as you saw me.

740
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,160
Then the next time, I thought you were a ghost.

741
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,070
But you have a shadow.

742
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:57,940
So I thought about it. What in the world is that mister?

743
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,820
- So what am I? <br> - Goblin.

744
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,310
Are you by chance a goblin?

745
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,020
What are you?

746
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,270
- What the heck are you?<br> - This is kind of weird to say myself,

747
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,220
but I'm the Goblin bride.

748
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:22,340
You know I can see ghosts, right? When I was born,

749
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,070
I was born with something like this.

750
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,800
I think it's because of this that the ghosts do that and call me the Goblin's bride.

751
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,690
You see it? This.

752
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,220
See it?

753
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,920
Prove it.

754
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,090
- You want me to prove that I'm the Goblin's bride? <br> - Yes.

755
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,950
How?

756
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,700
Should I fly?

757
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,860
Or change to a broom?

758
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,620
- Try it. <br> - I'm very serious right now.

759
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,180
Me, too.

760
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,880
Tell me what you see.

761
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,420
- Is this your revenge? <br> - Tell me everything you see.

762
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:24,680
- You're tall. <br> - And?

763
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:28,730
- Your clothes look expensive. <br> - And?

764
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,760
- Maybe mid-30's? <br> - And?

765
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:39,080
You don't actually hope to hear me say you're handsome, right?

766
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,320
You should've had the answer I wanted.

767
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:48,140
If that's all you see from me, then you're not a Goblin's bride.

768
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:51,100
You have no effective value to a goblin.

769
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:56,090
I'm sorry you see ghosts, but just be grateful you're alive.

770
01:23:56,090 --> 01:24:01,240
You're just a side effect from a violation of the principle <br>against messing with human life and death.

771
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,290
If I don't want to put up with it?

772
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:10,240
There's a way to die too like you were supposed to originally.

773
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,270
The way you talk.

774
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,940
I got that and I'll repeat my question earlier.

775
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,570
Are you by chance

776
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:23,260
- a goblin? <br> - I'm not.

777
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,160
- You're not? <br> - No. <br> - Then what are you?

778
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,420
What are you that you decide whether I have value or not?

779
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:33,170
You said you want to be in a little better situation.

780
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,990
Someone who is a little concerned about your sucky situation.

781
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:45,020
Live in the reality. Not in rumor.

782
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,400
You're not a goblin's bride.

783
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,070
Wait.

784
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:03,260
I'm not done talking.

785
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,630
You just came through that door? Following me?

786
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,900
You! How did you get here?

787
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:23,330
Grab the handle and push.

788
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:25,620
Follow you.

789
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,870
But what's with this place?

790
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:30,790
So I'm asking you how in the world you passed through that door.

791
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:35,190
Maybe this is Paju? The English village?

792
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:40,090
But this is still strange. What is this? Where is this?

793
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,950
- Canada. <br> - Canada?

794
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,130
Canada...

795
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,660
That... maple country?

796
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:53,240
Aurora? That place? Is this really abroad?

797
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:04,700
Daebak! You had this kind of power?

798
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,990
You do, too. What are you really?

799
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,890
This is really Canada and if you can do this with your power, then I've decided.

800
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:17,160
- On what? <br> - I'm determined.

801
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,760
- About what? <br> - I'll marry you.

802
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,210
I really think you are a goblin no matter what.

803
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,670
I love you.
