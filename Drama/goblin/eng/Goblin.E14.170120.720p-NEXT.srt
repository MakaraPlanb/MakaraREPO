00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,670
Forgive me.

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,500
I can finally notify you...

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,900
of my brave death.

4
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,370
No!

5
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,030

No. No.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,700
No.

9
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,200
Meeting you...

10
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,400
was the reward of my life.

11
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,870
No.

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,930
Please.

13
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,500
You said you wouldn't let go of my hands.

14
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,500
You promised me.

15
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,170
I will come as the rain.

16
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,530
I will come as the first snowfall.

17
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,930
I will beg the divinity...

18
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,230
to let me do just that.

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Don't do this.

20
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,300
Don't go like this.

21
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,930
I love you.

22
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,530
I love you. I love you.

23
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,930
So do I.

24
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,170
I love you.

25
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,500
I already did that...

26
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,230
back there.

27
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400

31
00:06:45,200 --> 00:07:00,630
(IT WAS FIRST LOVE.)

32
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,730
Remember.

33
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,700
You must remember.

34
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,630
His name is...

35
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,070
Kim Shin.

36
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,230
He's tall...

37
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,070
and has a sad smile.

38
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,100
He'll come as rain.

39
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,370
As the first snowfall.

40
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,300
He'll keep his promise.

41
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
(HE'LL KEEP HIS PROMISE.)

42
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,930
Remember.

43
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,600
You must remember.

44
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,130
You are...

45
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,770
his bride.

46
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,300
(YOU ARE HIS BRIDE.)

47
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,800
The almighty said...

48
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,900
You have been erased from the memories...

49
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,370
of all who knew you.

50
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
That is for the sake of their peace...

51
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,930
and it is my grace.

52
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,000
He also said...

53
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,370
your punishment is over.

54
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,640
That you can forget everything and sleep...

55
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,140
Be at peace.

56
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,600
But...

57
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,230
the goblin's eyes...

58
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,900
filled with tears.

59
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,700
Now, I see...

60
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,830
what choice I make.

61
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,530
So this is...

62
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
the choice I made.

63
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,870
I wish...

64
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
to remain here.

65
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,400
I will remain...

66
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,230
and become rain.

67
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,170
I will become the wind.

68
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I will become the first snowfall.

69
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,670
Just that one thing...

70
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,270
Just for that one thing.

71
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,100
I ask for your permission just for that one thing.

72
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,140
It was indeed a foolish choice he made.

73
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,370
I was always in your life.

74
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,200
However, in this place,

75
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,000
even I am...

76
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,000
not here.

77
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,170
The goblin survived alone like that,

78
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,870
and he got stuck in the place between this life and afterlife,

79
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,070
between light and death,

80
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,230
and where even divinity had abandoned.

81
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,030
He got stuck for eternity.

82
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,670
Poor goblin.

83
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,870
So?

84
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,930
What happened to the goblin?

85
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,170
I don't know.

86
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,970
Memories will soon get forgotten,

87
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,170
and only the glorious futility will remain.

88
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,570
He will...

89
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,470
keep walking...

90
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,830
in that futility.

91
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,070
What will happen to him...

92
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,570
after that endless walk?

93
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,400
Where will he arrive at?

94
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,670
That's one sad story.

95
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,630

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,870
Eun Tak, it's raining.

104
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,470
It's getting heavier.

105
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,930
Are we in Southeast Asia or what?

106
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,070
What's up with the weather forecast? They said it was going to be sunny.

107
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,330
I know. I didn't bring an umbrella.

108
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,830
That's not the problem. What do we do with the opening?

109
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,170
What do you mean what do we do?

110
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,930
We can't make the rain stop, so we have to rewrite the opening.

111
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,970
We can keep this opening for another sunny day.

112
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,470
The first song is all right.

113
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,970
It's nice to start a gloomy day with a bright song.

114
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,730
Just take out the phrases that don't fit the weather and today's issues.

115
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,070
I'm rewriting it.

116
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,030

Lend me 300 dollars. It's urgent. Reply as soon as possible.

120
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,900
- I'll go choose the songs. - Okay.

121
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,000
Who are you?

122
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,370
Was I just mistaken?

123
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,770
Well.

124
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,800
It was 20 years ago.

125
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,500
Is this Mom's keepsake?

126
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,670
Since when did I have...

127
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,630
this necklace?

"he was so lonely that..."

130
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,400
"he sometimes walked backwards."

131
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,770
"He wanted to see the footsteps in front of him."

132
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,400
(ON THAT DESSERT, HE WAS SO LONELY THAT...)

133
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,400
How did only this part...

134
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,630
get burnt?

135
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,970
Welcome.

136
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,900
You're always beautiful.

137
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,370
Give me soju.

138
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,500
Your show today was good. Did the chief yell at you again?

139
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,670
Being good is useless.

140
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,730
I'm close to getting fired because we don't have enough commercials.

141
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,800
And we made a big fuss because of the unexpected rain.

142
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,130
I'll take half original and half spicy fried chicken.

143
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,670
Half and half, please.

144
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,340
Go get the soju yourself.

145
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm your customer, you know?

146
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,770
Hey, Class President. Sit there.

147
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,170
Until when will you call her the class president?

148
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,500
Welcome, Eun Tak already ordered food.

149
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,730
Okay.

150
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,530
I want beer.

151
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,770
Did you win the trial?

152
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,100
I wouldn't have been able to leave the office if I didn't.

153
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,030
Do you want to go on a blind date?

154
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,370
I don't like lawyers.

155
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,370
It's a chef this time.

156
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,100
He's frequently on cooking shows,

157
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,870
and he looks like a puppy when he smiles.

158
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,870
He's cute.

159
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,970
Why would I date someone who's your type?

160
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,870
Why would I date someone who's a fan of your show?

161
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,070
He always puts on your show during lunch time.

162
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,530
Am I the only friend you can sell?

163
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,270
Get sold when someone tries to sell you.

164
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,570
Look at me.

165
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,770
It was the easiest thing for me to become someone's first love.

166
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,100
Now there's no man asking me out for a cup of coffee.

167
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,370
Yes. Don't be like her.

168
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,670
What do you mean by that?

169
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,630
I thought you were the perfect example to help her understanding.

170
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,270
Is she your only friend, Eun Tak?

171
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,770
Is this the only place you can come to drink?

172
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,370
It's raining,

173
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,230
and the drink is bitter.

174
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,470
And I have two friends who worry about me.

175
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,230
It's a nice day.

176
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,470
I heard she's the goblin's bride.

177
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,770
Why can't she see us?

178
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,840
She used to be the goblin's bride.

179
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,070
She's 29, and the goblin hasn't appeared yet.

180
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,530
So she's almost like a widow.

181
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,900
She used to be able to see me before.

182
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,030
What's wrong with me?

183
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,340
Why am I so sad?

184
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,170
Why do I keep feeling like this?

185
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,400
It's the first snowfall.

186
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,700
You're right. It's really early this year.

187
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,400
- It's still nice, isn't it? - Yes.

188
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,130
What have I forgotten?

189
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,200
Whom...

190
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,100
have I forgotten?

191
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,070
Whose face have I forgotten?

192
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,270
What promise have I forgotten...

193
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,470
to be in such profound sorrow?

194
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,830
Somebody...

195
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Anybody, please...

196
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,670
Please save me.

197
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Me?

198
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,330
Yes, you. Was it you?

199
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,970
Don't do this.

200
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,870
Don't do this. Don't go like this.

201
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,630
I love you. I love you.

202
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,330
I'm sorry.

203
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,400
My mood swings can get severe. I'm sorry.

204
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,270
What am I doing?

205
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,070
Why am I the one apologizing?

206
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,970
What are you doing right now?

207
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,000
Why did you hug me? Do you know me? Who are you?

208
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,400
I am the one in the contract.

209
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,230
Contract?

210
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,300
Are you an actor?

211
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,770
- The drama department is... - Did your dream come true?

212
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,770
What are you talking about?

213
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,930
I'm proud of you.

214
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,530
Sure, thanks.

215
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,900
So why did you hug me back there?

216
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,370
And why do you keep talking casually to me?

217
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,270
You have been erased from the memories...

218
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,600
of all who knew you.

219
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,930
That is for the sake of their peace...

220
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,170
and it is my grace.

221
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
As long as you're at peace, I'm fine.

222
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,600
That's all I need.

223
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,700
Are you acting right now?

224
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,030
The drama department isn't inside this building.

225
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,370
It's the annex in the back.

226
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,090
By the way, how did you get in here...

227
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,860
without an ID?

228
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,920
Because someone called for me.

229
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,290
- Deok Hwa. - Go ahead.

230
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,020
I am the president. You are just an assistant manager.

231
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,460
Go back to your position.

232
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,690
I thought I was pretty natural.

233
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,820
Deok Hwa.

234
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,460
You can't be in here.

235
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,060
- We're sorry. - That man...

236
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,120
just said my name, didn't he? He said, "Deok Hwa."

237
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,490
- Deok Hwa. - Please leave.

238
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,760
Leave him alone.

239
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,990
Let's hear him out.

240
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,820
I thought I would never see you again. I am glad to see you.

241
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,620
Please speak from there. Right there.

242
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,320
Who are you? Do you know me?

243
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,790
I was your uncle, your brother...

244
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,920
He must be a lunatic.

245
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,290
I am not a lunatic.

246
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,060
I'm hungry. Let's go. What should we eat?

247
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,760
I made a reservation at a place that you'd like.

248
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,820
Deok Hwa.

249
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,890
It's so strange.

250
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,720
He said he was my uncle.

251
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,890
Uncle's existence is Chunwoo Group's top secret.

252
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,060
Something only Grandpa and I know.

253
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,390
One more person found out about it just now.

254
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,460
Who?

255
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,060
Is your uncle's name Kim Shin?

256
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Come on, now.

257
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,320
He's my uncle. Why would his last name be Kim? It's Yu.

258
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,920
Who's Kim Shin?

259
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,060
Just eat.

260
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,720
A family secret.

261
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,920
Every corporate heir has a sad story like that.

262
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,760
Don't you worry.

263
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,620
How did I work my way up from the bottom?

264
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,320
I had seollongtang for lunch for years now.

265
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,690
I'll eat this and protect my company.

266
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,360
Like a corporate heir.

267
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Deok Hwa. It is not "my company",

268
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,620
but all the employees' company.

269
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,460
They are protecting it well,

270
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,120
so don't be too energetic.

271
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,690
Lunch time is over.

272
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,120
Thank you for lunch.

273
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,820
But I'm not... I'm still...

274
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,760
Here are the gift sets.

275
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,890
- Thank you. - Thank you.

276
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,460
Enjoy.

277
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,820
Excuse me.

278
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,290
Yes?

279
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,220
Just a minute.

280
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,490
I had you close to me,

281
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,120
but I did not recognize you. You were...

282
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,490
Wang Yeo.

283
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,060
You couldn't protect your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo,

284
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,060
or even yourself. You couldn't protect a single thing.

285
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,330
That was what this sword...

286
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,120
was meant to do.

287
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,860
To strike Park Joong Heon.

288
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,590
Forgive me.

289
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,360
I can finally notify you...

290
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,620
of my brave death.

291
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,490
What a vulgar hat you're wearing...

292
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,860
still.

293
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,890
Are you the goblin...

294
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,290
rumoured to have returned to nothingness?

295
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,890
Rumors about me are mostly fluff.

296
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,120
I guess you didn't return to ashes,

297
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,420
or get scattered in the wind or rain.

298
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,060
Obviously,

299
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,360
you didn't turn into something hideous.

300
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,790
What happened?

301
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,220
I thought you wouldn't remember.

302
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,060
Everything should have turned into nothingness.

303
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,990
It did for everyone else,

304
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,190
but I retained my memories.

305
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,690
I'm not sure,

306
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,260
but I have one hypothesis.

307
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,590
I'll stand on your side...

308
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,090
until the end, Uncle Tenant. I promise.

309
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,490
It was a moment of weakness for me. Seriously.

310
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,420
If you're going to take sides anyway,

311
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,760
leave Yeo's memories alone.

312
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,620
Why?

313
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,890
It's so sad for Shin and Eun Tak.

314
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,220
An entire world closed for them.

315
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,690
I feel like someone other than us...

316
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,360
should remember the history of their love.

317
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,690
But you know,

318
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,720
why do I feel like...

319
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,490
I found a door that will reopen that closed world?

320
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,120
Did I not close it all the day?

321
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,190
What happened to you?

322
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,120
How are you back?

323
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,990
Because of the contract.

324
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm glad you're back.

325
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm really...

326
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,020
glad you're back.

327
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,760
It's nice to have someone greet me.

328
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,660
I'm so shameless.

329
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,890
It's way too late,

330
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,220
very, very late.

331
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,290
I should've done it nine years ago.

332
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,690
I should've done it 900 years ago.

333
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,220
Please forgive me for saying it...

334
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,390
so late.

335
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,060
Please forgive me...

336
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,060
for not protecting my love...

337
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,160
or you, who protected my Goryeo.

338
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,920
I had received love,

339
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,220
but I did not love anyone.

340
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,330
Please forgive me.

341
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,460
You need a haircut.

342
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm finally home.

343
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,830
This is my home.

344
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,330
I have 10 years left on the lease.

345
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,590
How about my sister?

346
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,960
I don't see her, of course.

347
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,390
Longing for her...

348
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,960
has been my punishment for the past nine years.

349
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,060
I'm forever a sinner, anyway.

350
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,560
Did you see Eun Tak?

351
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,990
Yes.

352
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,460
She doesn't remember, does she?

353
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,720
No.

354
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,620
She became a producer at a radio station.

355
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,190
She looked good.

356
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,620
I listen at times.

357
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,720
Let me know so that I can listen, too.

358
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,060
It's Deok Hwa.

359
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Deok Hwa.

360
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,760
Hide. Here.

361
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,660
Uncle Tenant.

362
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,860
Hi. What's up?

363
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,890
I met someone strange at the office today,

364
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,560
so I felt kind of weird.

365
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,260
I wanted to see how you were doing.

366
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,390
- Uncle Tenant. - Yes?

367
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,390
If you're my uncle, you're my uncle.

368
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,890
Why are you "Uncle Tenant"?

369
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,760
Come to think of it, when did you start living here?

370
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,190
It's all in the lease.

371
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,460
True. Why are there two bottles of beer?

372
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,060
Is someone here?

373
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,020
I like to double fist, that's why.

374
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,460
Then what are those feet sticking out from behind the couch?

375
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,090
This couch is very nice.

376
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,020
The owner has good taste.

377
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,460
The finishing touch is excellent.

378
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,920
You're that guy from earlier...

379
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,390
That strange...

380
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,090
You got your hair done.

381
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,190
I like the new style. I am his friend. I'm here to...

382
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,560
He's leaving. He was just about to.

383
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,260
I had fun.

384
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,620
Go.

385
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,060
Yes.

386
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,420
I should.

387
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,490
Go.

388
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,260
It was good to meet you.

389
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,830
- Sure. - What a gaudy outfit.

390
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,420
What's going on?

391
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,220
Is Uncle Tenant part of...

392
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,620
the secret of my birth?

393
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,090
Gosh.

394
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,560
Didn't you hear a door slam upstairs?

395
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,720
- No. - Yes.

396
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,260
- No. - Yes. I'm sure.

397
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,060
You heard nothing. Deok Hwa.

398
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
Look into my eyes.

399
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:34,020
The temperature dropped to 22°C and it's getting cold.

400
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,460
Here's our last song for the day.

401
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,590
Don't catch a cold.

402
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,490
What should we do?

403
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,620
She said 22°C...

404
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,860
when she should've said 2°C.

405
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,060
I'd...

406
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,060
made a typo.

407
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,020
It's so obvious I'm not the writer.

408
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,720
Our chief producer's on the way.

409
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,190
Don't worry, I'll take the blame.

410
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,190
What? 22°C?

411
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,690
"The temperature dropped to 22°C..."

412
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,490
"and it's getting cold."

413
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,490
"Don't catch a cold."

414
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,360
Does that make any sense?

415
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,690
I'm sorry, Sir.

416
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,260
Are you dating?

417
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,160
Do you think it's spring?

418
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,960
What if flowers start blooming again?

419
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,190
Sorry, Sir.

420
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,460
No way. Is this true?

421
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,090
Ms. Ji, are you a magician?

422
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,090
It's all over social media.

423
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,720
Outside our office building.

424
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,460
The temperature's exactly 22°C...

425
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,590
and the flowers are in full bloom.

426
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,090
The temperature in Sangam-dong reached 22°C today.

427
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,590
The last time this happened was nine years ago...

428
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,260
and passers-by stopped to stare.

429
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,590
What could be going on?

430
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,330
Isn't it weird?

431
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,860
It makes no sense.

432
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,890
We lose most of our listeners around this time of year.

433
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,620
We need to come up with a way...

434
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,990
to keep our listeners hooked to our show.

435
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,690
Okay. I'll send you my report. Take a look.

436
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,420
Who is that guy?

437
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,120
What's wrong with me?

438
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,260
My medication only lasts so long.

439
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,060
What I meant was...

440
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,360
What's going on?

441
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,420
What do you mean?

442
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,120
Why are you sitting there?

443
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,960
Someone called me.

444
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,590
That's your problem.

445
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,120
I don't want you here.

446
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,120
Did that person...

447
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,660
not show up?

448
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,060
She's here.

449
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,490
But she doesn't recognize me.

450
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,320
I see.

451
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,820
I feel sorry for you,

452
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,490
but I'm supposed to meet someone here.

453
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,890
My boyfriend will be here.

454
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,860
I don't think you have one.

455
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,560
I hope the email went. It's important.

456
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,220
You cut your hair.

457
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,460
I almost didn't recognize you.

458
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,990
- You still don't recognize me. - I did.

459
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,290
Earlier today...

460
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,490
You were there, weren't you?

461
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,720
I tend to be everywhere and nowhere.

462
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,990
Outside the building...

463
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,620
when the temperature was 22°C...

464
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,020
I was there to see someone.

465
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,090
I missed her...

466
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,820
very much.

467
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,220
When I look at her, I think she'll run into my arms.

468
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,620
But because I know that will not happen,

469
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,390
my heart aches.

470
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,090
Why did you...

471
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,020
tell me that?

472
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,920
You asked.

473
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,960
Shouldn't you order something?

474
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,460
- Enjoy your drink. - Thanks.

475
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,390
- You... - How can you not have five dollars?

476
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,320
Why are you even here?

477
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,760
My wallet's in my coat pocket.

478
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,420
I had no time to get my coat.

479
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,720
Sorry and thanks.

480
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,190
I'll pay you back when...

481
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,890
I won't be seeing you again. Where are you headed?

482
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,920
I... I go that way. Wait...

483
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,420
She could've stayed a while longer.

484
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,960
Lend me five dollars to pay a debt.

485

486
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,160
Close the door!

487
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,060
How am I supposed to fix this?

488
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,620
I need 10 dollars...

489
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,060
to buy a book.

490
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,190
Where's the person I called to come and fix this?

491
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,290
Give me 100 dollars to buy some meat.

492
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,060
Please.

493
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,390
There must be a reason the almighty...

494
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,190
didn't wipe my memories of you.

495
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,490
It is a great pity that you put it that way.

496
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,690
I must resort to my final option.

497
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,960
You can't summon up gold bars like you used to.

498
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,390
They have serial numbers and they can't be traded.

499
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,890
This is so confusing.

500
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,560
Is that the only thing I can do?

501
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,890
What is it?

502
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,720
My house is very secure. We have a high-Tech security system.

503
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,690
How did you...

504
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,460
Who are you?

505
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,590
I am...

506
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,120
water and fire,

507
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,960
light and darkness.

508
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,420
To you, I am Yu Shin Jae.

509
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,390
To you, I am Kim Shin.

510
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,390
Are you the uncle my grandfather told me about?

511
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,490
He's the man mentioned...

512
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,490
in the late chairman's will.

513
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,220
Grandpa's will?

514
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,720
Not only was it his will,

515
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,890
but the will of every one of his direct ancestors.

516
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,620
If someone...

517
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,120
by the last name Kim and first name Shin comes to you...

518
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,590
and says that he is here to retrieve his belongings,

519
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,990
give it to him.

520
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,120
All I've left behind belongs to him.

521
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,720
He will come to you through rain...

522
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,290
and leave as a blue flame.

523
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,160
Then you will know it's him.

524
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,490
I miss him very much tonight.

525
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,420
I do not want the company.

526
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,990
The Yu family founded it,

527
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,160
so it is now yours, Deok Hwa.

528
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,960
All I require is my house, my identity,

529
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,060
a credit card, and a nephew.

530
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,820
I will honor the chairman's wishes.

531
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,290
I will furnish you with a house, identity, and a credit card.

532
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,290
You are my nephew.

533
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,690
The thing is...

534
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,790
It's fine if you don't know.

535
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,360
Do not know what?

536
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,460
Ji Eun Tak!

537
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,790
What exactly did you say on the phone?

538
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,860
Because of what you said,

539
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,560
our website's flooded with complaints.

540
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,460
I sent a set of kitchen knives...

541
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,820
and she kept calling to ask for the gift certificate.

542
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,990
The writers couldn't concentrate on their work.

543
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,860
We don't sell clothes.

544
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,460
What will you do about this?

545
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,460
Do you think we pay you with money we dig up from nowhere?

546
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,890
The knife company and the clothing company both want...

547
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,460
to retract their advertisements. What will you do about that?

548
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,490
Find whatever company you can...

549
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,960
to sponsor and advertise on your show.

550
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,220
If you can't, you're fired.

551
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,720
Sir.

552
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,820
- What? - I'll do my best.

553
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,620
It won't be easy, but I'll give it a try.

554
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,220
That nut case.

555
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,490
Sang Hoon asked me out yesterday.

556
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,690
- Really? - Yes, he did.

557
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,490
Are you serious?

558
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,960
They should cherish it until it lasts.

559
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,860
Why are you laughing?

560
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,490
Because it was cute.

561
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,890
They are.

562
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,760
Not them.

563
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,190
By the way,

564
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,990
are you not going to pay back my five dollars?

565
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,290
If I don't, will we meet again? Will you come see me for the money?

566
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,420
I will for what you've done.

567
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,560
You do know what I mean, right?

568
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,690
I don't.

569
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,120
I'm saying I'll call the police on you if this happens again.

570
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,490
I'm not sure why we keep running into each other.

571
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,620
Why did you laugh this time?

572
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,920
Because I'm very happy.

573
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,290
Because this is an unbelievable moment.

574
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,020
Because everything is perfect.

575
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,990
What? Would avoiding you be the wisest thing to do?

576
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,390
Which direction are you headed?

577
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,790
You're leaving again.

578
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,260
I'll tune in to your show. I'm a big fan.

579
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,660
How did you know that I do radio shows?

580
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,960
You're way too suspicious now.

581
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,220
I thought you were an actor back then. That's not true, is it?

582
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,420
I'm sorry, but what do you do for a living?

583
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,420
I...

584
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,420
There. I work there.

585
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,690
At that furniture company? What do you do there?

586
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,320
I...

587
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,690
I'm at the top of the hierarchy.

588
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,120
- Excuse me. - You were looking at their papers.

589
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,220
Hand them over. It's regarding sponsorship, right?

590
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,660
Give them to me. I'll prove that I'm the boss there.

591
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,690
An executive usually signs this, but the CEO has asked for a favor.

592
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,320
He's the CEO?

593
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,390
Does he work here at the headquarters?

594
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,220
He doesn't come to work.

595
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,590
Then how should I show my gratitude?

596
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,660
Frankly speaking, I don't even know his number.

597
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,160
And he said I should sign these documents?

598
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,760
Why is that?

599
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,260
Exactly. I wonder why.

600
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:30,890
Can you give me your contact information? I'll give it to him.

601
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,320
Thank you.

602
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,860
By the way, is his name...

603
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,860
This is strange, isn't it?

604
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,220
It turns out that way when you get involved with him.

605
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,760
His name is Yu Shin Jae.

606
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,490
I see. Thank you.

607
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,560
- Ms. Ji. Ms. Ji. - Ms. Ji. Ms. Ji.

608
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,120
- Ms. Ji. - Way to go.

609
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,560
What happened? How did you land the sponsorship?

610
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,260
I don't know.

611
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,790
I feel like I was put under a spell. It feels like a miracle.

612
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,320
There can't be any other explanation to it.

613
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,360
Who cares? What's important is that...

614
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,320
our show will survive through the reorganization.

615
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,490
- You're the best. - You're the best, Ms. Ji.

616
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,390
With that going for us, let's do our best on this project.

617
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,990
"We will find you who you're looking for."

618
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,660
"We will find you that person you've forgotten over the years."

619
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,220
"We will help you find lost memories and forgotten faces."

620
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,860
"If you send us your story, we'll introduce it on the show..."

621
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,160
"and connect you to the person you're looking for."

622
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,020
This is good.

623
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,860
Search the photo album on each of your phones...

624
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,560
and organize the stories until the next meeting.

625
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,890
Sincerity is what we're looking for.

626
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,690
I can tell if it's fake.

627
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,990
Yes, she really can. Do try your best.

628
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,420
Okay.

629
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,460
Whose call are you waiting for?

630
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,560
He's not calling.

631
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,020
This is a good project.

632
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,260
Maybe I should go on a search for my first love, too.

633
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,290
You should look for that person. Kim Shin.

634
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,720
Should I?

635
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,990
By the way, was that really your handwriting?

636
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,920
It was. That's why it's so strange.

637
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,660
It must've been a ghost.

638
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,460
You saw ghosts until you were in high school.

639
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,560
I hadn't been able to for 9 or 10 years.

640
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,360
I'm seeing them again nowadays.

641
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,660
- There's one behind you now! - Gosh!

642
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,720
Can you hand me the napkin?

643
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,890
Gosh, are you serious?

644
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,490
(YOU MUST REMEMBER. YOU ARE HIS BRIDE.)

645
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,720
What on earth are you?

646
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,620
Why am I your bride?

647
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,560
You are his bride.

648
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,220
Who are you?

649
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,020
Uncle Tenant.

650
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,620
This got mailed to a small building I own.

651
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,120
I don't understand.

652
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,560
It's where the chicken place used to be. I couldn't just throw it out.

653
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,660
I have somewhere to go. I don't know when I'll be back.

654
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,420
You can wait for me, right?

655
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,490
You could give it to this person.

656
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,660
Your name is Ji Eun Tak, Uncle?

657
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,660
Why do you have so many names?

658
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,820
You deliver it to her.

659
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,360
What am I supposed to say to her when we meet?

660
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,290
Then I'll go.

661
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,390
Then give it to Sunny and ask her to deliver it.

662
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,460
She's living on a rooftop of where Sunny lives for some reason.

663
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,390
They're neighbours now.

664
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,490
That won't change anything. It'll make me even more suspicious.

665
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,060
I'll do it. I will look the least suspicious. I own the building.

666
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,860
If it'll make things weird,

667
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:22,390
I think it'll be the best if you go since you haven't met them.

668
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,660
I'll do it. The business owner there is really pretty.

669
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,120
I'll go. Hello?

670
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,560
After nine years,

671
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,590
you can finally come up with an excuse.

672
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,490
Can't you hear me?

673
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,620
Who am I talking to right now?

674
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,720
Welcome.

675
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,120
Where's the owner?

676
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,760
She won't be here today.

677
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,020
Where's the owner?

678
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,590
She won't be here today, either. What's going on?

679
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,220
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

680
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,790
- Where's the owner? - She won't be here today.

681
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,920
What's your name if I may ask? Do you want me to call her?

682
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,190
No.

683
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,090
Just give her this.

684
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,590
Okay.

685
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,490
What is this?

686
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,660
I know. What is that?

687
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,020
It came to the old store, not even my current store.

688
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,690
Supposedly, that building owner gave it...

689
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,620
to some good-looking guy who brought it.

690
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,960
So I checked my surveillance video.

691
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,360
He's seriously good-looking.

692
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,260
The old store?

693
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,920
Where was that?

694
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,620
That's what's strange.

695
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,420
It's international mail, too.

696
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,090
It's not like you ever came to that location.

697
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,560
It's strange.

698
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,460
He's so good-looking that it's strange.

699
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,560
What could this be?

700
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,490
This is my handwriting.

701
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:23,190
Hi, Mom.

702
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,460
To my pretty mom,

703
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,190
who's probably always worrying about me.

704
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,360
How's the afterlife?

705
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,420
Is it like this world?

706
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,960
I am writing you a letter from Canada.

707
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,760
You'd be so shocked...

708
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,360
if you knew how I got here.

709
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,020
Just by opening one door,

710
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,560
I can enter a paradise like this.

711
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,690
As long as I'm with him.

712
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,060
I finally have someone who asks how I'm doing.

713
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,820
You may worry and feel bad about...

714
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,220
my seeing things that I shouldn't,

715
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,120
but don't.

716
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,220
Because that is what made me special to someone.

717
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,290
I'm doing well, Mom.

718
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,490
And I'll become even better.

719
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,260
I'll live a good life and become happier than anyone.

720
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,160
Let's meet again someday.

721
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,860
I love you, Mom.

722
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,820
From Canada, your daughter, Eun Tak.

723
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,690
From Canada?

724
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,190
I don't even have a passport.

725
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,120
What is this?

726
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,390
This is too scary.

727
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,490
(REMEMBER. HIS NAME IS KIM SHIN.)

728
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,660
Is that man...

729
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,090
Kim Shin?

730
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:05,160
Just what happened nine years ago?

731
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,590
Just what did I forget?

732
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,490
(HIS NAME IS KIM SHIN. HE'S TALL AND HAS A SAD SMILE.)

733
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,560
Hello?

734
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,960
This is Yu Shin Jae.

735
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:39,160
Hello. Just a minute.

736
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,660
Hello?

737
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,120
Hello?

738
01:02:54,064 --> 01:02:54,864
Hello?

739
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:00,888
Hello?

740
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:06,040
Were you waiting for my call?

741
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,040
I've been busy...

742
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:15,040
so I even forgot that I gave you my number.

743
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,140
I see.

744
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,040
I didn't get to thank you before. Thank you.

745
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,910
Then would you like to take a walk with me?

746
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,740
Where did you say you lived?

747
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,410
Me?

748
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:35,040
I didn't tell you where I lived.

749
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,670
So where do you live?

750
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,110
I live near Art Platform...

751
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,670
in Incheon.

752
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,710
Where near Art Platform?

753
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,340
My living situation is quite complicated.

754
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,040
Where are you?

755
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,170
I feel like...

756
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,940
I'll be near Art Platform in about half an hour.

757
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,770
Are you asking me out on a date?

758
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,870
Yes.

759
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,540
I've decided...

760
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,740
to date you.

761
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,410
Call me when you're nearby...

762
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,240
about half an hour from now.

763
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,540
I like that scent, too.

764
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:02,610
I see. This is a scent that women like.

765
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,910
You must know a lot about women's perfume.

766
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,610
Do you not like the fact that I know a lot about women's perfume?

767
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,040
Who am I to judge?

768
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,140
You are the only woman who knows my number.

769
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,040
Really? Why?

770
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,440
That's strange.

771
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,040
There's nothing strange about it.

772
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,670
I just got my phone.

773
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,910
I didn't need a phone for a while.

774
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,470
I was somewhere where phones didn't work.

775
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,840
There was just a lot of snow.

776
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,510
Excuse me for a minute.

777
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,740
I keep forgetting.

778
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,740
I have to take it regularly.

779
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,610
What is that for?

780
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,870
It's medicine to heal the soul.

781
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,040
How long has it been?

782
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,340
May I ask why?

783
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,540
To be honest, I don't know...

784
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,410
how it started.

785
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,640
You may run away.

786
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,710
I was being honest so that I could give you a chance to.

787
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,440
I'm the one who's strange, right?

788
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,040
I'll just try to become stranger.

789
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,270
I'm going on vacation.

790
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,640
I'm telling you in advance in case you drop in...

791
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,640
at Art Platform randomly again.

792
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:42,840
Where are you going?

793
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,010
Abroad.

794
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,270
It's my first time going abroad...

795
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,940
so I'm very nervous.

796
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,740
I'm so lame, aren't I?

797
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,010
You won't be nervous even if it's your first.

798
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,170
It'll be natural...

799
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,140
as if it weren't your first time.

800
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:00,440
You'll act like you live there so don't worry.

801
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,270
But you don't know me very well.

802
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:07,570
Trust me.

803
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,640
Here I go.

804
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,940
One, two.

805
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,240
(VACATION REQUEST)

806
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,010
(REQUEST SUBMITTED)

807
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,340
I feel like there's something there...

808
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,710
so I want to go look.

809
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,170
What's there?

810
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,570
I'm going because I don't know.

811
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,840
Sure. If you don't know, you should go and ask.

812
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,340
Go and ask before you get any older.

813
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,240
You know,

814
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,010
it's an international crime to wear a hooded sweatshirt abroad, right?

815
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,740
Okay.

816
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,340
It's your first trip abroad. Let's try to be fashionable.

817
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:51,640
Okay.

818
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,840
By the way,

819
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:58,010
you made a lot of money because your business succeeded.

820
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,570
Why haven't you moved?

821
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,170
Didn't you know?

822
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,110
I own this building. I bought it.

823
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,910
How could I not know? You told me 100 times.

824
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:08,310
I asked why you don't move.

825
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,210
It's too much of a bother.

826
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,740
And I have a new house phobia.

827
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
There's no such thing.

828
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,510
There isn't?

829
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,170
The Clementine are good.

830
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,610
They're really sweet.

831
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,170
Excuse me.

832
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,340
I have received this letter.

833
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,210
It is from this hotel.

834
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,810
Yes, this is from us.

835
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,570
You're Korean. I'm so relieved.

836
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:48,270
This hotel was built by a Korean.

837
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,340
Oh, I see.

838
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,510
We repaired the letter boxes and drops on every floor...

839
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:58,340
and found a few letters that had gotten caught.

840
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,210
We'd never found one from 10 years ago, though.

841
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,710
How do you know it's that old?

842
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,480
The design of the envelope is from 10 years ago.

843
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,440
It must've been a fond memory.

844
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,040
I apologize it took so long.

845
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,740
That's fine.

846
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,610
There must be a reason it took so long.

847
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:21,040
I was told that every step the almighty takes has a reason.

848
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,870
I don't remember where I heard that, though.

849
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,870
This is lovely.

850
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,770
This is just so weird.

851
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,640
Why are we meeting here?

852
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,270
I'm on a business trip.

853
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,070
I'm here to research...

854
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:46,540
designs to put on the corners of our furniture.

855
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:48,480
What are you on about?

856
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,040
How have you been?

857
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,110
Are you...

858
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,770
following me?

859
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,340
Is that a crime?

860
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,570
- What should I do? - I'm not a bad man.

861
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:04,770
How would I know that?

862
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,040
By spending time with me.

863
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,340
I have no reason to do that.

864
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,570
My company sponsored your radio show.

865
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,710
You offered to buy me a meal.

866
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,870
Is this your first time in Canada?

867
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,940
Let's go this way.

(GOBLIN)

870
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,270
To the one who thought that...

871
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,710
oblivion would bring me peace of mind.

872
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,980
I missed you.

873
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,840
I pray that in our next life...

874
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,710
the wait will be short...

875
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,070
and the meeting shall be long.

876
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,740
Very long.

877
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,340
Goodbye.

878
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:21,410
Have we...

879
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,910
met before?

880
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,570
About 10 years ago?

881
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,240
Over here.

882
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,740
Are you a ghost?

883
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,040
No sadness lasts forever.

884
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,010
I vote yes.

885
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:37,980
On which?

886
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,480
Sadness or love?

887
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,010
A sad love.
