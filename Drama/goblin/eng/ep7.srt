2
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,080
Well, then I'm pulling it out.

3
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,340
But... why can I not grab it?

4
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,020
I can see it, so why can't I pull it out?

5
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,950
That... Did you put enough
strength in your hands?

6
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,390
Wait a minute, I will try it one more time.

7
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,290
You definitely said earlier
that no matter what happens,

8
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,540
it's not my fault. You can't take it back.

9
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,150
Hey, so you are...

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,420
- So... you are not the Goblin bride...
- I said you can't take it back.

11
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,500
So stand still, I said! I'm the
one who is more frustrated.

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,215
Hey! I'm standing still!
How can I be more still?

13
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,920
Hey! You give me back that
note so I can burn it.

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,610
Hold on!

15
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,370
I got it. I think this is that thing.
I know it.

16
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,850
- What?
- The prince in a fairytale. The cursed prince. That.

17
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,290
What about it?

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,360
The kiss.

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,010
I was desperate, so please understand it.

20
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,050
Open your eyes.

21
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,140
This is me with my eyes open...

22
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,540
Hey, you! Just now... Are you crazy?

23
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,640
What do you mean, am I crazy?

24
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,630
To the person who tried everything
to make Mister beautiful,

25
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,670
do you think I did it because I wanted to?
It's a loss for me, too!

26
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,730
I'm sure you've done it many times all
these years, but for me, it was...

27
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,420
- You're what?
- It was my first kiss!

28
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,040
It's not something that should
have been used like that...

29
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
- Come here. Let me try it agai...
- Hey, hey,

30
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,550
hey... Say it from there.
From over there.

31
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,430
Right now, there's no stopping me.

32
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,343
In this situation, if I can't
make it happen, you'll

33
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,990
ask for everything back
that you've given me.

34
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,340
In this crisis, what is
there that I couldn't do?

35
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,938
What's with you and
this secular attitude?

36
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,620
What are you going to
do if it doesn't work?

37
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,510
If it doesn't work this time,
then there's only one thing left.

38
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,730
- What is it?
- True love.

39
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,887
If necessary, I will
have to do that, too!

40
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:16,760
Instead of having this
bag taken away from me,

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
I would rather love you, Mister!

42
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,500
I am sorry.

43
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,180
You even made the effort to make it snow...

44
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,150
- Woah.
- Woah?

45
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,610
What should I do now?

46
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,570
Do what?

47
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,440
- You're going to kick me out...
- I won't kick you out!

48
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,250
Really? You can't forget what
you signed off on, either!

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,660
They say that real men keep their word!

50
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,590
You can't be petty or go back on it!

51
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,930
So, you're saying that our
Uncle won't be coming back?

52
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,490
So what you're saying is
that our Uncle has...

53
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,200
left this world?

54
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,400
[CERTIFICATE OF TITLE]

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
While living as an immortal,
at last, he reached mortality.

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,430
Do not miss him for too long. Death is just

57
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,670
another world outside the door. One
day you, too, will open that door...

58
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,500
Aigoo, Uncle!

59
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,350
Don't go, Uncle! I don't need a card.

60
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,970
I don't need this kind of card.
Please come back, Uncle.

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,270
What is this?

62
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,210
Why is he coming through that door?

63
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,730
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

64
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,930
Deok Hwa...

65
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,460
Uncle! Did you come back?
Are you back again?

66
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,460
I love you, Uncle.

67
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,230
There, there. So that's why I'm saying
this, but can you give me that card back?

68
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,930
You heard it. Why behave as
though you didn't hear it?

69
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,660
Uncle,

70
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,380
it's just a new world behind the door.
Since you already set out for that path,

71
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,700
just go straight on your way, Uncle.

72
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,930
Deok Hwa seems to be very
worried about his uncle.

73
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,800
That's right, don't worry about us.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,300
Can you give me back the deed?

75
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,800
Exactly, how did you handle your task?

76
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,560
Ji Eun Tak.

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,190
- Yes?
- Perfume, $5,000, purse... Can you give them back before you go up?

78
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,160
Uncle, did you give that girl that much?

79
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,740
I don't want to. I can't. You
said you wouldn't kick me out.

80
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,020
I asked you to return the
perfume, $5,000, and the purse.

81
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,350
I didn't say that I was kicking you out.

82
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,660
Mister...

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
I love you...

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,140
I said I love you...

85
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,270
I love you, too.

86
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,760
- Mister.
- Shut up!

87
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,890
- I love...
- You knave!

88
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,000
By chance, did you burn that scroll?

89
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,480
Of course, I burned it.

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,900
Ah, this fellow, you go
too far with your joke!

91
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,160
Didn't that scare you? That's punishment
for saying your good-byes so diligently.

92
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,460
I will accept my punishment.

93
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,160
The scroll I will return to you
safe and sound in the morning,

94
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,100
so please do not worry too much.

95
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,190
Thank you and I am sorry.

96
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,900
Then, My Lord, I ask of you.

97
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,930
How about trying to live
instead of trying to die?

98
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,250
Wouldn't it be nice if because
of you, someone in this world

99
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,230
who lived a righteous life of good

100
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,100
gets to experience mysteriously
beautiful luck and a miracle

101
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,420
for once in their life?

102
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,300
The man who does not get old...

103
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,610
You, at 29 years of age,

104
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,730
are still as bright as ever.

105
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,970
But at your side... I am not there.

106
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,060
But... why can I not grab it?

107
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,660
How come I can see it
but can't pull it out?

108
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,970
Has the future changed or
has Ji Eun Tak changed?

109
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,560
In any case...

110
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,090
it's nice to be back.

111
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,630
Shamelessly...

112
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,050
Miscellaneously omitted.

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,370
Tell me in detail, what happened?

114
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,000
Ah...

115
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,900
At the start it was fairly good.

116
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,284
In the moonlight, the
expanse of the buckwheat

117
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,540
flower field and the
early first snowfall...

118
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,410
Anyway, so I grabbed the
sword, but the thing is...

119
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,470
I could only see it but
couldn't get a hold of it.

120
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,990
He came back alive somehow. I thought
one of the two wouldn't be back.

121
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,580
I know. I thought he would leave
me behind in that buckwheat field,

122
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,720
but he let me come back.

123
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,120
Miscellaneously omitted
doesn't know right now

124
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,960
what will happen when
the sword is pulled out.

125
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,630
Should I tell her? Then the
Goblin might die out of anger.

126
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,530
Then... this house would be mine.

127
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,830
What are you thinking about?

128
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,640
When you look at me like that,

129
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,730
- it scares me a little.
- You can see the sword,

130
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,510
so why is it that you
can't get a hold of it?

131
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,090
Those kinds of affable thoughts.

132
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,980
Right? Me, too. Why do you think that is?

133
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,200
Like what the Goblin said, am I
really not the Goblin's bride?

134
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,970
Will the real bride who can
grab the sword show up?

135
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,860
Do you think she is... beautiful?

136
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,200
There's no order to pulling it out.

137
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,740
That's what I mean.

138
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,008
You don't think he will
mistreat me, right? Since

139
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,300
there's some affection from
having lived together?

140
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,681
Because we have one additional
person in our household,

141
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,330
it's difficult to keep up
with the cost of living.

142
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,160
We're out of all the meat. Do I
have to start keeping a ledger?

143
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,570
Feeling so down like this... I wonder how
I'm going to get the dishwashing done, too.

144
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,160
I-I will do it!

145
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,030
I really want to do the dishes!

146
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,450
You will?

147
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,630
But then again, you're at that age where
you really want to do the dishes.

148
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,620
There is so much laundry to do!

149
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,180
I can't go to the dry cleaner's all
the time with my limited budget.

150
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,200
Should I just throw away
all the clothes then...?

151
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,280
Me! As soon as I'm done with the dishes,

152
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,920
- I can also do the laundry!
- Would you?

153
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,430
If that's really what you'd like to
do, please wash the clothes manually.

154
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,500
Being able to study well
requires the house to be clean.

155
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,000
Anyway, when should I clean the rooms?

156
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,530
Having a high school senior at home
makes me worry about so many things.

157
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,870
I think you did that on purpose just now?

158
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,860
No, I didn't.

159
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,790
You can obviously see that I've been
splattered with water all over.

160
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,030
It'll take until evening for these to dry.

161
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,380
I'm pretty sure you're
doing that intentionally.

162
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,100
Why? Do you not want to do laundry? Just
tell me if you have any complaints.

163
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,840
Oh, complaints? Thanks
for bringing that up.

164
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,150
You're probably thinking right
now that I'm not your bride,

165
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,400
but let's not rush to conclusions.

166
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,260
You'll regret a lot later if you
keep being mean to me like this.

167
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,032
Did you say, "I'm indeed
your bride, but why

168
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:36,670
can I see without being
able to grab it?"

169
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,420
You said all the time spent
with me was dazzling.

170
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,460
Because the day was good and
because the day was bad...

171
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,420
- And also because the day was just right.
- Yeah.

172
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,860
- Today as well.
- See?

173
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,500
What?

174
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,290
Even now, everything is dazzling.

175
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,420
But then why...

176
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,790
- are you being so mean to me?
- Because that's a different matter...

177
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,420
How is that a different matter if
I'm bringing dazzle into your life?

178
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,290
So, let's not be like this

179
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,050
and find a different value.

180
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,900
If you're not happy with
calling me your bride,

181
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,100
- I can be your girlfriend since you're my boyfriend.
- I don't want to.

182
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,460
- Then let's just be acquaintances?
- I don't like that, either.

183
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,310
Then I'll just be a tenant?

184
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,985
Then pay me your rent from today.
It's $500 per month, and

185
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,410
you need to pay separately
for water and electricity.

186
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,390
He asked you for money?

187
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,660
Yes! We're enemies from today.

188
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,840
We'll eventually have
to confront each other.

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,970
All this conflict is rising from my
not being able to grab the sword...

190
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,790
Maybe you need something stronger
than the sign on your back?

191
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,420
For example, real love?

192
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,650
I already tried that.

193
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,060
Tried what?

194
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,380
A kiss.

195
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,910
You surprised me!

196
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,370
Do you talk about those kinds
of things like that...?

197
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,800
How can you talk about that kiss to anyone?

198
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,270
Were you that kind of person?

199
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,750
I didn't say it. It was
you who said it just now.

200
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,670
- You weren't going to say it?
- No, I wasn't!

201
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,080
You guys... kissed?

202
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,189
Even if I mention it, I'd
be talking about myself.

203
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,190
So why do you make such
a big deal out of it?

204
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,730
Technically, this is my kiss.

205
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,324
Hey, how can a kiss be
either yours or mine? Even

206
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:27,910
if we could own a kiss,
half of it would be mine!

207
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,270
Fine, you can take your half, then.

208
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,700
- No, I don't want to, I don't need it.
- Okay, sure, I'll own everything then.

209
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,730
Okay, then! You're so greedy!

210
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,000
I...

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,890
can't even call her because I
don't have a business card.

212
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,600
They are being so explicit
about their relationship.

213
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,260
What's the matter?

214
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,940
Okay! You came back alive.

215
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,330
But don't we have to make her leave?

216
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,980
- What?
- Why? You don't want to?

217
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,778
I'm saying that we should kick
her out so that the two of us

218
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,570
can live happily together just
as we have been doing so far.

219
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,420
Who did you live with until now then?

220
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,590
She doesn't seem to be the bride,
so I think we should kick her out!

221
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,560
She already knows about our identity.
Don't you think

222
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:21,370
she'll spread some word
about it if she goes out?

223
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,780
She doesn't seem to be someone who'd
do that if you gave her $5,000.

224
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,406
What did you learn from watching TV shows?
Once you start

225
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,000
giving money, you're basically
starting a vicious cycle.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,090
- Do you want to keep being blackmailed?
- It's not that you want her to stay?

227
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,980
Hey, I want to kick her out
so desperately right now!

228
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,030
- What?
- You're happy that she couldn't grab the sword, aren't you?

229
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,631
Be honest. You're happy
because you didn't have to

230
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,130
die and because you can
keep seeing her, right?

231
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,670
Why? Why would I be happy? Am I crazy?
I waited 900 years for this!

232
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,840
Okay, then! I'll do the job of taking her
away for the sake of our friendship.

233
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,103
You would also be finding
her annoying, right? She

234
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,380
kissed you without even
asking for your permission.

235
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,920
Why are you bringing up friendship? There
doesn't exist any friendship between us!

236
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,550
You wanting me dead! Is that friendship?

237
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,890
Hey! You're happy right now.
Because you didn't die.

238
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,460
No! It's just that I
have a promise to keep.

239
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,450
I already signed the contract,
so I can't go back on my word.

240
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,540
As a man, I'm just trying
to keep my promise!

241
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,520
I guess you weren't a man when
you gave me the house deed.

242
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,740
Hey, when a goblin is being angry...
Hey, listen!

243
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,600
Reaper! Reaper? Reaper.

244
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,420
You will answer my summons on the
day of the first snow every year.

245
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,100
It's because I'm going to be waiting.

246
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,780
Why are you studying out here when you
have your own room? Are you protesting?

247
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,570
I'm just being close to
where the snacks are.

248
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,680
Ever since you don't have
to be nice to me anymore,

249
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,640
you haven't been giving snacks to me.
That's so mean of you.

250
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,170
The budget has been getting
tighter these days,

251
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,650
so it's lavish to spend money on
snacks for a high school senior.

252
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,679
Please don't provoke me.
I'm at a stage of

253
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,760
life where I'm feeling
annoyed all the time,

254
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,818
- because the national
exam date is approaching!

255
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,470
- Are you being angry
at me right now!

256
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,512
What kind of guardian
angel are you, treating

257
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,470
me like this right before
the national exam?

258
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,330
- Ah!
- Why? What?

259
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,810
Do you know the answers to the
national exam, by any chance?

260
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,170
Yeah, but when's the exam?

261
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,890
You know the answers when you
don't even know the date?

262
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,750
- Yes, do you want me to tell you the answers?
- Yes!

263
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,110
- First, solve all those.
- Okay!

264
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,940
FYI, the national exam is next Thursday.

265
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,400
Hey,

266
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,720
- last time, that first— - Oh, right!

267
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,550
I was going to bring that up first.

268
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,970
Well, don't feel sorry for me.

269
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,320
It was, of course, my first kiss, but...

270
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,510
Hey, I-I was just going to...

271
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,540
I was just going to talk
about the first snow.

272
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,950
Ahh, the first snow?

273
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,590
Don't mention it!

274
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,615
Don't talk about anything that
involves the letters "ch". (the

275
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,680
(first letters of the Korean words
"first kiss" and "first snow")

276
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,851
- Hey, you got that first question wrong.
- Don't

277
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,000
do that. ("FIRST QUESTION"
ALSO STARTS WITH "CH")

278
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,970
- Aren't you hungry?
- Don't do that! ("HUNGRY" ALSO CONTAINS "CH")

279
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,448
Why do we hear so much
traffic noise when you are

280
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,980
trying to study? ("TRAFFIC
NOISE" ALSO STARTS "CH")

281
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,370
Is the bed comfortable enough?
("BED" STARTS WITH "CH")

282
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,270
I put a lot of meat in it so that
you would feel satisfied and full.

283
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,906
- Do you think it is food
that I really want right

284
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:51,610
now? - Will you be able
to memorize it, though?

285
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,750
I'll call out the answers
in order, so listen well.

286
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,530
- First, I'll start with the language section.
- I hate you!

287
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,170
Just go back home! I'm fighting the
urge to listen to your answers.

288
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,110
There is a car coming.

289
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,990
Absolute power requires politeness.

290
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,710
If you still want the answers...

291
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,150
- I'm fine, I'll be able to answer all the questions anyway.
- Wow...

292
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:34,470


293
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,760
It would only seem natural if I
pat your shoulder as well, right?

294
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,740
I will look at your watch very naturally.

295
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,560
Did you stop the time by any chance?

296
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,020
No.

297
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,530
Oh no, oh no! I'm screwed.

298
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,500
It's already been thirty minutes!

299
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,840
Don't worry. Did you forget that
your boyfriend was a goblin?

300
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,920
You said you didn't like
being called my boyfriend.

301
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,080
It was a lie. Follow me.

I'm back!

312
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm feeling tired.

313
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,840
I used my brain too much
today, so I'm so ti...

314
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,190
How was your exam?

315
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,110
I came up with the idea, this guy
paid, and this other guy bought it.

316
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,600
Wow... it's a cake!

317
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,180
Why are you crying? Did
you flunk your exam?

318
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,550
It's not that. It's because I'm so happy.

319
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,330
I'm totally happy today,
so I should make a wish.

320
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,830
If you're with me today, you
can do anything for free,

321
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,856
so please let me watch
a movie with Mr.

00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:02,160
Goblin later. With some popcorn, too.
Please.

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,000
Hey, little girl. What about me?

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
Oppa, thanks for the cake.

325
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,580
Up to 50% discount.

326
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,090
There's something like that.
Don't try to know.

327
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Why are you standing there like that?

328
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,928
- Pardon?
- You said you wanted to watch a movie and have

329
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,010
some popcorn, too. Let's go.
Your wish has been granted.

330
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,897
Really? Wait a minute.
I'm going to put my

331
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:39,940
book bag in my room. Just
give me ten seconds.

332
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,120
You two go, too. To your
room, to your house.

333
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,870
- Why? I want to watch a movie with some popcorn...
- You can't.

334
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,160
Why did he call me over if it
was going to be like this?

335
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,610
Was the test just an excuse or something?

336
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,518
If he made the national
exam just so they could

337
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,490
watch a movie together,
then let's give him that.

338
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,460
- You. Let's have a talk.
- Pardon?

339
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,720
Me... Why...?

340
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,980
I have something I'm curious about.

341
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,780
- I'm surely not as curious as you are.
- You.

342
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,840
- Where did you get your business card?
- Pardon?

343
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,510
Business card. Rectangular
in form and usually white

344
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,880
and has four sharp corners...

345
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,801
The company gave me
mine because I'm a 3rd

346
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,060
generation chaebol, of course.
But why do you ask?

347
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,790
- I want one.
- Pardon?

348
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,190
Also, there's another
thing I'm curious about.

349
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,330
While t-t-this close?

350
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,010
If that person really is Yoo Deok Hwa
of Cheon Oh Group, then he's my lord.

351
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,520
My landlord.

352
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,790
She said you're some kind of a lord.
A landlord.

353
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,250
Ah... I just own a building.
But why do you ask?

354
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,510
Ah, I feel good.

355
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,840
Hey. Huh?

356
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,910
Where are you going? Did
you close up the shop?

357
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,990
Ah... I was just on my way there.

358
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,840
Yes, we're closed. My boyfriend
is waiting, so come next time.

359
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,110
Come on... You have to open.

360
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,950
How about just one more drink, huh?

361
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,740
What? Wait...

362
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,580
Did you... fly just now?

363
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,550
Swiftly... Up and over...
What are you, a bird?

364
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,190
What's the matter with me? Why am I here?

365
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,390
That's what I want to know!
This is driving me nuts!

366
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,470
Why do I keep seeing things like
this these days? Get home safe.

367
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,400
♫ I've got peace like a river,
I've got peace like a river

368
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,460
You know how to do things like this, too?

369
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,670
Do you think there's anything I can't do?

370
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,460
What? What would you like?
Rabbit or raccoon, just tell me.

371
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,310
The lighter. Mister, I want that lighter.

372
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,600
What? I didn't hear you.

373
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,120
I didn't say anything.

374
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,010
It was so close this time, right?

375
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,031
Let's just go. Who cares
if you can make gold

376
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,060
appear when you can't make
the lighter come out!

377
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,020
Grab it! Grab it!

378
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,600
It's not grabbing. And it's
almost time for the movies.

379
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Hey, hold on. I'm about to get it!

380
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,390
Don't scream and put me in an awkward
situation. Just tell me if you're scared.

381
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,740
You know, I've lived for 19
years in a horror movie.

382
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,980
Don't you think I should be able
to deal with at least this much?

383
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,620
Oh, it's starting.

384
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,560
I want to get out of here! I want to leave!

385
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,780
Why are you like this?

386
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

387
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Look! First snowfall came in the cinema.

388
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
I-I'm sorry.

389
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,120
I didn't get to see
anything because of you!

390
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,820
I don't even remember
what the movie was about!

391
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,618
Weren't the zombies scary?
Ah, the future of

392
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,280
the Korean film industry
looks promising.

393
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,820
Place your order. You're probably
starving from crying and screaming.

394
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm not hungry since I ate the
popcorn, so don't mind me.

395
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,620
Okay, then. I won't. I'll just
take one of those. Make it large.

396
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,440
Okay.

397
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,186
For question number 7
in the math section, I

398
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:00,400
used substitution to solve
the equation, and...

399
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,120
I put cabbages on top of the x-axis...

400
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,380
not... but right there

401
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,850
I nearly fell into the trap but...
Is it good?

402
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,420
Yeah.

403
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,870
Their large sandwiches
are really large here.

404
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,980
If you overeat, it's not
good for your health.

405
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,730
Didn't you drink a large juice last time?

406
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,130
How many cows did you eat before that?
How is your health?

407
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,460
It's really tasty. You
should have some, too.

408
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,230
Do you know how much this is? How
can we get two? You know that.

409
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,900
Exactly how long are you
going to be mean to me?

410
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,010
You took everything away that you gave me.
That bag was really pretty.

411
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,012
I've never seen $5,000 before.
You shouldn't

412
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,770
have given it to me
in the first place.

413
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,270
I'll do that next time.

414
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,660
It was really strange for me, too.

415
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,180
As if you weren't planning
to be around anymore.

416
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,270
You told me to use them when I got older...

417
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,980
You gave Deok Hwa Oppa a card and
gave the house to the Grim Reaper.

418
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,840
You gave them only what they wanted...
Like parting gifts...

419
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,260
It's true, right? Parting gifts?

420
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:11,890
You were planning to leave once
I pulled the sword out, right?

421
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
It's true...

422
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,770
But why?

423
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,470
I thought I told you once.
When the bride appears,

424
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,830
I have to prepare to
go even farther away.

425
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,290
To where? Europe? Canada?

426
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,560
Even now? Do you still want to leave?

427
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,720
No, I don't want to leave.

428
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,830
But if the bride really does appear,

429
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,420
that choice probably won't be mine to make.

430
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,730
Ah... that's true...

431
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,960
You're going to go with her?
With the real bride?

432
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,060
Will you let me go?

433
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,820
No. I'm not going to let you go,
so just go and leave me behind.

434
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,150
When the real bride appears... No,

435
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,440
I will leave before then.

436
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,630
So just leave when I'm not
around; without me knowing.

437
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,200
- Did Uncle buy you something good to eat?
- No.

438
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,480
Why? Are you still Kongji (CINDERELLA-LIKE
CHARACTER) in that household?

439
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,680
Yes, the Goblin is the wicked stepmother.

440
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,770
How many wicked stepmothers
are there in my life?

441
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,443
Isn't it strange? My Uncle
is the type of person whose

442
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:55,530
1,000-year-old fury dissipates
by just looking at a girl group.

443
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,900
And?

444
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,950
Ever since he met you, he's
just been continuously furious.

445
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,640
You're so not his type, that's what.

446
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,770
Girl group?

447
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,380
Elders said that when you go to college,
you naturally become slimmer and prettier.

448
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,840
That old man, just wait
till I get into college!

449
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,100
Wow! College oppas!

450
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:32,420


451
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,440
Are you alright?

452
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,750
Are you Tae Hee Oppa?

453
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,640
Are you Ji Eun Tak?

454
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,270
Wow, it's been such a long time!
I almost didn't recognize you.

455
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,860
I know. I changed a lot, right?
I've been through a lot since then.

456
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,880
It's because you became prettier.

457
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,510
You grew taller as well.

458
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,810
Do you also go to this school? I
took my writing exam here today.

459
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,430
CEO, over here.

460
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,900
Is it that guy...? Is it him
she was referred to as CEO?

461
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,740
Get up and eat something.

462
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,580
He messed with her hair...

463
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,620
I almost broke his wrist.

464
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,400
Who?

465
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,050
She moved her body in a shy way.

466
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,470
So I thought she was a twisted bread stick.

467
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,480
So who are you talking about?

468
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,040
I should just have let
him play the piano...

469
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,830
Then they wouldn't have ended
up meeting each other...

470
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,740
Who met whom?

471
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,090
I'm back!

472
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,500
No!

473
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,240
My spring! Who's that stupid man?
He's so annoying...

474
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,860
Yay, I did it!

475
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,790
Tae Hee really became a real
baseball player. How cool.

476
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,950
Are you going to have some ice cream?

477
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,280
No, I'm going to eat it all of it myself.
I paid for it.

478
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,820
I didn't say anything, though.

479
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,100
Because it rained, I craved ice cream.
Because of the rain.

480
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,670
I told you I didn't say anything.

481
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,994
That's what I mean. Why are you
holding that ice cream without having

482
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:20,960
said anything? Put that back down
while I'm being nice to you.

483
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,820
About this Bluetooth speaker...

484
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,630
Get your hands off of it!

485
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,390
Do you even know how to use this? You
can even take a picture using it.

486
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,218
I'm going to take a
picture of myself eating

487
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,460
this ice cream with that,
so don't touch it.

488
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,620
What? Why?

489
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,945
You're being so stingy with food.
Why did it rain?

490
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:53,770
What about your feelings?
Why? Are you sad?

491
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,930
Are you asking that because
you really don't know why?

492
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,170
What? Because I can't grab that sword?
Is that my fault?

493
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,080
I tried my best. Can that sword even
be pulled out in the first place?

494
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,265
The kiss didn't work. We
both said "I love you"

495
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:06,200
and it didn't work.
What else can be done?

496
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,360
You weren't being sincere. It was
a very secular "I love you!"

497
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,890
Then were you sincere? Your "I love
you" had a very clear interest.

498
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,220
You have a very peculiar personality.

499
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,410
Do you think you have a nice personality?

500
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,590
I'm young!

501
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,030
So what? You'll get older, but I won't.
I will stay young and be beautiful.

502
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,890
You are not young, though.

503
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,970
Moreover, I met my first love, so I can't
waste my time perceiving your beauty.

504
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,220
What? What love?

505
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,460
Are you good at baseball? My
Tae Hee is really good at it.

506
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,460
Did you see me playing baseball? You'd be
surprised if you did, you little thing.

507
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,741
Oh... So now I'm degraded
from a tenant to a thing?

508
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:40,870
Okay, this thing will make
itself disappear now.

509
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,000
Have fun taking pictures
of your life with this.

510
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,300
You... You, don't ask me for pictures!

511
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,070
This little thing...!

512
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,560
Who's Tae Hee? Come out here!

513
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,180
Hey, Choi Tae Hee!
Someone's looking for you!

514
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,320
I'm Choi Tae Hee. Who are you?

515
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,590
You... You were going to look like this?

516
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,640
- Pardon me?
- You're the most good-looking here!

517
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,130
That's right.

518
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,000
You've seen me before, right?

519
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm seeing you right now, right now!

520
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,550
No, look at me. You've really never
seen me before? When I was this little?

521
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,410
You can't even hit that?

522
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,640
Turn your waist like this.

523
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,980
I'm fine, just mind your own business.

524
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,530
I'm saying this because I'm better than
you! First of all, your grip is wrong.

525
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,650
Hey, Mr. Little Man who's 155 cm tall!
I've been living as an upright general...

526
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,020
Forget it. You'd be surprised if you knew
who I was, so just mind your own business.

527
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,830
Then, do you want to make a bet?

528
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:21,830
This is insane. Who do you think I am?
You'll regret it.

529
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,282
You're the one who should be worried
about regretting. Let's hit

530
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:26,530
ten balls and the loser has to
listen to the winner's wish!

531
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,340
Deal!

532
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,070
This is going well!

533
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,910
There's a thief!

534
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,790
I don't know when the thief came
in but he only took the piano.

535
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:43,790
He really got rid of it.

536
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,730
He took away that big thing, but not a
single neighbor witnessed it happening.

537
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,490
This is so weird, so weird.

538
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,110
I won the bet, so I asked
you to get rid of my piano.

539
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,008
My mom insisted on my playing
the piano despite my lack of

540
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,880
aptitude for it, and I wanted
to become a baseball player.

541
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,150
But the piano really disappeared.

542
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,540
So what?

543
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,490
That man who was there at
that time, wasn't that you?

544
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,130
No!

545
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,200
I think so, too. But
if you're indeed that

546
00:44:21,212 --> 00:44:24,510
person, you haven't gotten
any older at all...

547
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,370
So that kid recognized me.

548
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,770
So what?

549
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,337
Is that the only thing you can say?
Do you think I'm helping you

550
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,690
with these vulgar things just
to get such a terse response?

551
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,909
If you don't erase his memory, there will be
weird rumors about a man who doesn't get old.

552
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:50,080
So I'll eventually have to leave this place!
You said you wanted to live happily with me!

553
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,150
You said we never lived
happily together, though.

554
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,639
You are not supposed to live like this.
You should

555
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,320
help other people out
at times of difficulty.

556
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,590
Why should I help a goblin who doesn't
even have the power to erase memories?

557
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,030
Okay, cool. Let's see what'll happen.

558
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,040
Sure, sure.

559
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,100
- Hey!
- What?

560
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,290
Weren't you going to cook it
before eating it, anyway?

561
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,060
Good. This is perfect!

562
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,540
Why are you in this room?

563
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,070
I-I was going to clean the room.

564
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,330
I saw the vacuum outside the room.

565
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,850
Give me the thing you're sitting on.

566
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,790
There's one more.

567
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,680
I remember signing only once...

568
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,590
Really? Then why are there
two pieces of paper? Oh, my!

569
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,080
Are you aware that this is forgery,
trespassing, theft, and...

570
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,973
You're so petty! I heard
your 1000-year-old-fury

571
00:46:21,985 --> 00:46:24,060
dissipates when you
see girl idols.

572
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm sorry that I didn't know
you were that kind of person.

573
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,810
This is mine, so give this back to me.

574
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,450
I came here to get this back.
You have no idea.

575
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,150
I told you you could read
it, not to keep it forever.

576
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,930
Wow, look at her.

577
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,347
See, see. I can't
tell which one's the

578
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,150
original copy and which
one's the forged one.

579
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,446
I shouldn't compliment her on
her skills at forgery in this

580
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:56,490
situation. I wonder what
she'll become in the future...

581
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,939
He probably used this book
very roughly since it's not

582
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,940
his. He frustrates me so much.
If I find something...

583
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,730
Look at this here! He wrote in my book!

584
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,880
[IT WAS FIRST LOVE]

585
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,850
Wow... first love?

586
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:28,075
Right, right. He would have
had a first love. He's done

587
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:31,460
a lot of things despite
merely being a broomstick.

588
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,130
It was a first kiss for me, though.

589
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,970
His handwriting is sooo ugly.

590
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,880
[TAE HEE]

591
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,320
Hi, Tae Hee!

592
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,670
It's okay...

593
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:33,300


594
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,400
What am I supposed to do?

595
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,430
I got a call.

596
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,450
[NOT SUN HEE BUT SUNNY]

597
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,100
So what?

598
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,670
Answer the call for me. If I avoid
her anymore, she might kill me.

599
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,720
I still don't have a business
card so I can't take the call.

600
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,780
I've got nothing to say if I answer it.
Just once!

601
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,748
Why don't you have anything to say?
Don't you

602
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,740
know my voice? This isn't
a forgettable voice.

603
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,341
What? You said not to help each other.
You, grim

604
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,860
reaper, who can't see an
inch before your eyes!

605
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,920
Forget it. But where did
miscellaneously omitted go?

606
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,500
She can't help you, either.

607
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,817
She's at the ice cream
shop down below doing the

608
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:09,300
hee-hee-ha-ha sesame roasting.
(HAVING A SWEET TIME)

609
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,820
Roasting sesames? Why would she
do that outside and not at home?

610
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,480
Get lost. I don't even want to explain.

611
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,570
When I think about it, it's so amazing.

612
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,590
To meet you there then like that.

613
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,140
Me, too.

614
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,850
How's life been for you, Oppa?

615
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,910
Let's see. I guess thinking
about you every now and then?

616
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,290
You! Seriously...

617
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,300

00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,870
take a call for me.

619
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,690
Are you nuts? How can you follow me here?

620
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,760
Who is this?

621
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,760
Your father?

622
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:18,940
Your words are harsh. One who
speaks harsh, what's your name?

623
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,320
Oppa! Don't tell him your name.
Not the eyes either. Look down.

624
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,890
I can't take the call right now so
if you don't take the call for me,

625
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:35,150
I will ask him his name
and write it down nicely.

626
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,350
Resolve it.

627
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,510
I got it.

628
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,530
Just a moment.

629
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,510
One who speaks harshly, have a seat.

630
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,720
So, you used to play the piano
but you play baseball now?

631
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,690
How do you know that?

632
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,660
But she'll just misunderstand more
if a woman answers it. Whatever.

633
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,060
Hello?

634
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:13,610
Isn't this Mr. Kim Woo Bin's cellphone?

635
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,630
It is. Section Chief Kim Woo Bin
is currently absent from his seat.

636
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,480
He's a Section Chief?

637
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,280
He's a Director.

638
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,450
What kind of a company is it, that
he gets promoted within a second?

639
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,506
Whatever. I know he's next to you.
So the cafe we

640
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:36,420
had our meeting in before,
tomorrow, at 1 p.m.

641
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:42,010
Tell him to come as a section chief or a
director but if he's late, I'll kill him.

644

She wants to meet face-to-face. Tomorrow
at 1 p.m. at the cafe you met in before.

645
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,750
But the one who just called, her
voice sounded familiar. Is she...

646
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,780
Wait. My question first.

647
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,140
What's your question?

648
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,281
Phone number, name, then
your age, blood type,

649
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:15,400
unmarried or married,
an approximate asset...

650
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,722
dating experience yes-or-no,
your ideal type, etc. You

651
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,110
don't know what she might ask,
so prepare for all those.

Are you happy? After
avoiding my calls like that?

661
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,880
Because I... thought you wouldn't like
someone who didn't have a business card.

662
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,560
Then you could just answer my call and
tell me you didn't have a business card.

663
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,920
Or just text me.

664
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,930
I will in the future.

Ms. Sunny, by any chance,
your business card...

666
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,680
Why are you asking about my business card?

667
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,530
I was curious as to what
kind of person you are.

668
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:33,180
My face is my business card. It says
so right here. A Pretty Person.

669
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,130


670
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,110
I see... It's true.

671
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,910
I really wish... I could
take your business card.

672
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,925
See that? We have so much
fun when we see each other.

673
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:52,430
Get to know each other
more and become closer!

674
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,770
Woo Bin, what do you like?

675
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,770
Sunny.

676
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,800
You're driving me crazy...

677
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,300
Not that, what about
your hobbies and things?

678
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,100
Sunny.

679
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,770
I got it, but...

680
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,430
Your unpredictable actions

681
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,120
draw me in unconditionally
as much as a drama.

682
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:29,340
Your unpredictable actions require a lot
of imagination, and my awkward actions,

683
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,980
each and everyone, are wrong.

684
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,120
My new hobby, that is Sunny,
seems like God's plan

685
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,920
but then it also seems like
God's mistake as well.

686
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:51,950
How does he speak so well? Do you
have a religion, by any chance?

687
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,190
So there's something... else I need again.

688
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,950
I will contact you when it's ready...

689
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:04,520
No! It's okay if you don't have one.
Sit right there before I kill you!

690
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,840
This man, really... What is he...?

691
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,680
I'm 34, born November 5th...

692
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,990
No, no! You don't have to tell me.
Just keep staying seated.

693
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:23,320
I'll pretend I'm looking at a picture.

694
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,790
What do you like?

695
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,670
I like vegetables. Then I will...

696
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,220
Huh? What?

697
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,130
I have to go that way.

698
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,020
Then what about me? Weren't
we going somewhere to eat?

699
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,040
Without buying me dinner?

700
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,810
But you ate a whole hot dog.

701
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,030
Overeating is the start of all illnesses.

702
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,839
The person who's causing
me the most illness is

703
00:55:57,851 --> 00:56:00,680
right here. Never mind that.
Where are you going?

704
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,740
I'm going to a company dinner.
If I don't go, there's a fine.

705
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,330
What kind of man...

706
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,380
Really, each and every awkward
action of yours is wrong.

707
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,550
They're all wrong.

708
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:17,530
The problem is too difficult.

709
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,700
Let's all eat and die! Cheers!

710
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,240
Cheers!

711
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,060
Just have a little.

712
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,580
Watch where you're going! Watch it!

713
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,840
This thing! Does he want to die?

714
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,320
Do you think he knows what he just did?

715
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,399
Within a month, he will
definitely suffer the wrath

716
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:48,220
of the earth gods. What
should we do, Senior?

717
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,220
That's his fate. Never mind.
I have to use the bathroom.

718
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,970
Me, too.

719
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,250
Hey, cheers!

720
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,650
Manager is here. Let's wrap it up.

721
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,230
Pay the bill.

722
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,220
You ate so much.

723
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,910
Huh?

724
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,820
Huh?

725
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,780
What's the matter? Are
you missing something?

726
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,520
My money...

727
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,890
Watch where you're going! Watch it!

728
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,940
I think I've been had. The guy
who bumped into me just now.

729
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,220
I thought so... What do we do, Senior?

730
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,260
Really, that guy will suffer the wrath
of the earth gods for many reasons.

731
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,720
Hey, this won't do. Put your
hats on and leave in order.

732
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,390
Slowly one-by-one so we
don't look suspicious.

733
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:50,880
But, is this allowed?

734
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,560
If you use your skills for
personal reasons, I heard

735
00:57:53,572 --> 00:57:56,060
that you have to write a
explanatory statement...

736
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,120
I will make sure you don't
have to, so don't worry, huh?

737
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,140
23rd class leave first.

738
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,110
There's always a way.

739
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,370
What kind of a way? You have a plan?

740
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,670
You will soon find out.

741
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:29,190


742
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,420
Hey, you guys...!

743
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,210
I need your help.

744
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,780
Are you going to vouch for him?
He can't leave until you do.

745
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,118
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I did come here

746
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,570
because of a phone call, but
I don't know this person.

747
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,680
I've never received any help myself.

748
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,120
I'm not sure how to help.

749
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,700
Didn't you come here
because he contacted you?

750
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,045
Let's establish that we know each other.
I'll help,

751
00:59:26,057 --> 00:59:28,920
too, along the lines of
Tae Hee Oppa's memory.

752
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,700
I just got to know him well.
Dine and dash...

753
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,990
That is a vulgar charge, never heard of.
Where should I sign?

754
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,630
I'm this kind of person...

755
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,580
You have a business card?

756
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,260
What happened? Why do you
have a business card?

757
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,820
Uncle down the hall! Eat this tofu.

758
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,700
Did you know? He has a business card.

759
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,510
A business card? Of course, he has one.
He owns our company.

760
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,726
Hotel, commerce, vessels,
oil, construction,

761
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,470
furniture and all.
You didn't know?

762
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,680
That's enough. You don't have to tell him.
I'm that big of a person.

763
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,490
Uncle, tofu, tofu. Hurry.

764
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,210
I really wanted to try this kind of thing.

765
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,290
Like uncle, like nephew. Forget it.
Get out of the way.

766
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,960
Why does he always walk like that?

767
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,130
I know! That time when he said he sees
something when he touches someone...

768
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,530
A person's past life.

769
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:40,164
When he touches someone
he sees the past? Then

770
01:00:40,176 --> 01:00:42,450
how about you? Do you
have any specialties?

771
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,030
My specialty is being alive.

772
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:49,460
You don't have any other
than making it rain, right?

773
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,870
Uncle! Tofu, tofu.

774
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,000
I guess the miscellaneously
omitted isn't home yet.

775
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,500
Maybe she's meeting that buddy?

776
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,350
- Hello? - Where are you right now?

777
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,960
Do you know what time it is already to
be not back in this dangerous world?

778
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,160
It's 7 p.m. right now
and I'm busy right now.

779
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,030
H-Hello?

780
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,990
The phone is off and you will be
connected to the voice messaging system

781
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:39,100
after the beep. You will be
charged a connection fee.

782
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,450
If you've seen the goblin
bride, raise your hand.

783
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,850
- Where?
- Uncle!

784
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,790
Uncle.

785
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,300
- Your uncle's not here. He went out.
- Oh, he did?

786
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,480
Then, can you give this to Uncle for me?

787
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,330
I keep forgetting to give it to
him and leaving it in the car.

788
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,850
Why do you bother with the delivery
after he took away your card?

789
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,280
My grandpa said he'd give me
spending money after I delivered it.

790
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,760
- Human beings...
- This is how scary and

791
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,490
convenient capitalism is,
Uncle down the hall.

792
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,780
But this... He gave you the card.

793
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,930
And he gave me the house.

794
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:25,970
So to your grandfather, it must
be something much more expensive.

795
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,320
Is that right? I don't
know what it is either.

796
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,110
Since I don't know, should I look?
Since Uncle's not here, anyway?

797
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,230
Wow, pretty. Pretty.

798
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:55,700


799
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:01,450
Who is it? Maybe Uncle's old girlfriend?

800
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,540
But it kind of just looks
like an antique, too. Right?

801
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,690
Uncle down the hall, what's wrong?

802
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:59,020
It was destined to be a
gut-wrenching love from the start.

803
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:03,860
It's sad, that thing called fate.

804
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,110
Love is not a crime.

805
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:12,140
So perhaps they did not commit a crime.

806
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,180
What crime did I commit,

807
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,800
that you raise the rent so suddenly?

808
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:22,440
It's really hard on me for you to
raise the rent by $100 suddenly.

809
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,350
Ever since you moved in, Bachelor,

810
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,980
the grim reaper keeps
appearing in my dreams.

811
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,450
I see. Also, the water in
the bathroom keeps leaking.

812
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,960
- About when do you plan to...
- Really? Then don't wash.

813
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,020
You're still pretty even if you don't wash.

814
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:49,580
♫ I met you among the people who
were as numerous as the stars

815
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:56,690
♫ As if I was dreaming,
we recognized each other

816
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:04,530
♫ I used to be overwhelmed just by
giving love but I received love too

817
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:11,170
♫ Everything was a miracle

818
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:18,810
♫ Even if time passes, we might meet again

819
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:26,220
♫ If our love was destiny

820
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:35,020
♫ If I was your miracle

821
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,400
- You sing well.
- A bit.

822
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,700
How did you know I was there?

823
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,300
No matter how you run, you're in my palm.

824
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:03,020
- What about the chicken shop? Did you get fired?
- I added more part-time work.

825
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,280
The pay is good for wedding singing.

826
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,100
But when I watch the wedding ceremony,

827
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,780
it feels kind of strange.

828
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,180
What about it is strange?

829
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:21,050
Just that... "Oh, I guess I won't
have a mom to light the candle."

830
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,600
"Oh, I won't have a dad
who'll walk me in, either."

831
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,300
"No friend to take my picture."

832
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,596
"Since I don't have friends,
I guess I won't get

833
01:07:31,608 --> 01:07:34,570
wedding gift money,
either." Those thoughts.

834
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,110
Funny, right?

835
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,070
That's why

836
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,320
I was obsessing about being
your bride, I think.

837
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,250
Because it felt like I
was getting a family.

838
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,940
That family that I don't have. Like fate,

839
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,100
it came to me, I thought.

840
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,340
Why do you cry?

841
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:13,020
To make me feel sorry?

842
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,830
No. If we argue it out,

843
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,790
I should be the one to feel sorry.

844
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,620
You know what?

845
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,840
I'm really sorry, Mister,

846
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,620
that I couldn't pull the sword out.

847
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,940
I kept wanting to tell you this.

848
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,730
But lately we keep fighting when we meet.

849
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:41,020
The timing is a little off here,

850
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,640
but since we're talking
about it, I will say it.

851
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,980
I've gotten more work now,

852
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,450
and I'm making the preparations now.

853
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,820
So could you just wait a
little bit until I leave?

854
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,020
Without mistreating me?

855
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:02,250
Until I am ready to leave,

856
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,040
can you give me a discount
on the mistreatment?

857
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,030
As a test-taking student,
give me 50% off, please?

858
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,930
I can't give you a discount.

859
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,680
50% is a definite no.

860
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,910
45%?

861
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:05,470
What? Are you in pain? Is
it because of the sword?

862
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,990
Mister...

863
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,520
I can grab the sword!

864
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,400
Wait.

865
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,720
Just a moment. I'll pull it out.

866
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,930
It's moving.

867
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,950
The oracle was true.

868
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,640
The future I saw was true.

869
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:52,630
Through this child,

870
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,810
I can now end this curse of immortality

871
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:01,170
and return to zero.

872
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,730
Human life is 100 years at best.

873
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,990
To want to turn back and look once more,

874
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,540
is it my immortal life?

875
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,780
Or your face?

876
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,680
It seems it's your face.

877
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,810
♫ I will find you ♫

878
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,520
♫ I will recognize you ♫

879
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:58,430
♫ No matter what image you're in ♫

880
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,900
♫ I will recognize you ♫

881
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,340
♫ l will remember ♫

882
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:08,150
♫ l will recognize you ♫

883
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:12,250
♫ No matter where ♫

884
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:16,020
♫ l will not forget ♫

885
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,390
See? I really am the bride.

886
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,120
This was fated to be.

887
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:26,390
Fate. How cool.

888
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,550
Who are you,

889
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,740
that you pierce my heart like this?

890
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,430
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

891
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:45,410
How did he remember his past life?

892
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,670
On some day after having
lived a hundred years,

893
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:53,640
on that some day that
seemed like the right day.

894
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,450
One day after living a hundred years.

895
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:01,920
On some day that seemed
like the right day.

896
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,010
It was first love.

897
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,820
To be able to confess that.

898
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,440
For heaven's permission...

899
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:12,020
I shall make a plea for it.
