3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,914
(Episode 13)

4
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,044
As expected,

5
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:52,044
it looks like I'm the worst memory.

6
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,714
To you...

7
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,244
and to Kim Shin, both.

8
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,514
You can hear me, can't you?

9
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,614
I hear yours, too.

10
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,174
I hear it very clearly.

11
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,874
Warrior Kim Shin...

12
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,874
greets you, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,674
I see you again...

14
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,214
after 900 years, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,414
I do not know what veiled my eyes.

16
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:21,614
Whether it's the passing of 900 years...

17
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,374
or the hatred of the almighty.

18
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:28,114
I had you close to me, but I did not recognize you.

19
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,644
You were...

20
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,774
Wang Yeo.

21
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,614
Am I...

22
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,274
really he?

23
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,314
Am I...

24
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,174
Wang Yeo?

25
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:59,374
That young and foolish face.

26
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:05,344
Was that...

27
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,344
I?

28
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,444
Wars were always a place of torment.

29
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,414
We always returned from there.

30
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,444
Our enemies could not kill us.

31
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,744
However, my men,

32
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,814
my young sister,

33
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:39,344
and my innocent relatives and servants...

34
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,644
were slashed and shot with arrows before my eyes,

35
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,074
because of a royal decree.

36
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,344
Because of words the young and foolish king uttered.

37
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:55,644
You are saying...

38
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,614
I am he, right?

39
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,274
You're saying...

40
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,544
I am really Wang Yeo, right?

41
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,474
I remember every second of that torment every single day.

42
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,344
However, you must be comfortable...

43
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,644
since you do not remember.

44
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,784
Even after 900 years...

45
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,744
Did the deity say he would take your side?

46
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,014
The deity is still on your side.

47
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:49,644
What on earth...

48
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,514
did I do?

49
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,574
What memories did you take from me?

50
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,614
What choice did I make?

51
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:13,914
How much...

52
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:18,944
of a coward was I?

53
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,114
What happened?

54
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,644
Did you see Park Joong Won?

55
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:52,174
I met both him and Wang Yeo.

56
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,414
Pack a small bag. We're leaving.

57
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,744
- Where to? - To Chairman Yu's house.

58
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,314
Okay. Give me 10 minutes.

59
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:03,544
Eun Tak.

60
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,014
Why won't you ask anything?

61
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:09,974
Did you know?

62
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:12,114
That he was Wang Yeo?

63
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,544
It's something a ghost had told me.

64
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,244
I doubted his intention...

65
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:25,414
and thought it was wrong to tell you.

66
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:29,074
Whether I tell you or not, I thought that...

67
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,514
if you're meant to miss him, you will,

68
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:33,344
and if you're meant to meet,

69
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,614
you would one day.

70
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:38,544
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:41,774
Go and pack.

72
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,844
We'll stay for a while.

73
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,644
Give the staff some time off.

74
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,774
Okay. Why do you need to stay here?

75
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,774
We'll each take a room on the second floor.

76
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,074
Don't worry about us.

77
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:09,714
Okay. Why do you need to stay here?

78
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:12,714
I'll stay at my boss' place.

79
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:14,444
I'm worried about her.

80
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,544
She won't have a clue what's going on.

81
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:19,774
Okay, then.

82
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,814
You do that. If something happens...

83
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,774
I know. Get some rest.

84
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:27,144
Deok Hwa will give me a lift.

85
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,274
I will?

86
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,444
What's going on? Why did you move out?

87
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,174
Did the two guys fight?

88
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,614
Even if they did,

89
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,744
he could've kicked the Grim Reaper out.

90
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,444
Maybe he's being considerate.

91
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:46,144
The Grim Reaper has nowhere to go.

92
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:48,644
Now I feel sorry for him.

93
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:16,174
The phone is off. You're being switched to voicemail.

94
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:18,614
Please leave a message after the tone.

95
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,074
Even in this life,

96
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,974
you are...

97
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,114
protecting that fool.

98
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,614
Where is...

99
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,144
my brother?

100
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,714
He left home.

101
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,314
With me.

102
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,544
Then what about him?

103
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:27,574
He'll be at home, I think.

104
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,744
He's still alive, then.

105
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,944
I doubt he was ever alive to begin with.

106
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:41,914
Right.

107
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:46,914
By the way,

108
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:50,914
about your remembering your previous life...

109
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:53,174
How did it happen?

110
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:00,744
It was sexy.

111
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,274
What?

112
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,374
We should have a drink.

113
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:05,644
Soju or beer?

114
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:16,544
Eun Tak.

115
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:20,444
You said humans have four lives.

116
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:22,474
I thought about it.

117
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,914
I think this is my fourth.

118
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:26,444
Why?

119
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:29,414
I know of at least two lives.

120
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,774
I met my brother this time around...

121
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,174
and I even met my lover.

122
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,614
What about you?

123
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:46,374
I would like it if this were...

124
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,174
my first life.

125
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,274
Why?

126
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,474
So you could meet my brother...

127
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:55,644
in your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th life?

128
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:02,544
You should've seen how stubborn he was in Goryeo.

129
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:07,644
Why did he come back knowing that he'd die?

130
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:11,214
He should've run away and lived.

131
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:27,274
It's not fair for us...

132
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,314
to split the bill evenly.

133
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,444
I pay four dollars extra a month since she moved in below me.

134
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,914
She had to move out of her apartment.

135
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,574
I felt sorry for her.

136
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,174
What about me, then?

137
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,944
I scraped the money together...

138
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:42,214
to get a place of my own.

139
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,214
I guess...

140
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:46,974
whether it's their 1st or the 4th,

141
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,514
they're both equally precious, right?

142
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,414
What do you mean?

143
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,714
The pipes are frozen.

144
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,914
I don't have running water.

145
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,344
So why should I pay for the extra tenant?

146
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,574
I know.

147
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,914
Fate can be such a sad thing.

148
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,644
Will they end up...

149
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:10,344
paying a hefty price?

150
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,314
I really shouldn't do this.

151
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:17,644
What is your name?

152
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:20,574
Pay me in cash. I don't take credit cards.

153
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:38,914
Notify me of your death,

154
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,374
and I shall notify you of my sorrow.

155
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,414
I do not...

156
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,274
want you to die.

157
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,274
They didn't come to your graduation.

158
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,974
They came to see someone who would be here.

159
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,144
The grim reaper from Janghang-dong...

160
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,944
It's just a rumor,

161
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,274
but apparently a spirit deceived him...

162
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,514
and he grabbed hold of the hand of a dying person.

163
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:22,874
I was wondering if that person...

164
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,144
is the soul you missed last time.

165
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,974
Are you listening?

166
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,414
Sir.

167
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,244
Yes.

168
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,374
What?

169
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,274
Has something been bothering you?

170
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:42,544
What about the missing soul?

171
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,844
There you are.

172
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,974
The look of your face...

173
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:06,044
tells me you've done it.

174
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,444
You've held that hand.

175
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,544
So what did you see?

176
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,714
Which sins were in there?

177
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,444
I wasn't in there.

178
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,244
Only she was in there.

179
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,814
She was a queen...

180
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:24,844
sometime in the past.

181
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:27,314
Was I in there?

182
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:33,814
Did you see the hands that handed her the decoction?

183
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,614
The hands as thin and pale as yours perhaps.

184
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:48,444
Do you know what was in that decoction?

185
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:52,114
My sin is your sin.

186
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:53,274
No.

187
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:55,844
That's impossible.

188
00:15:55,844 --> 00:16:00,074
You are the one that handed her the decoction.

189
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:02,444
How pitiful are you?

190
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,344
Having lost all the memories,

191
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:07,014
you can't even recognize yourself.

192
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:08,914
No.

193
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:11,174
That can't be true.

194
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,914
Do not worry.

195
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:16,944
I will keep your secrets.

196
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,044
If they find out that you've used your ability for...

197
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:23,174
personal reasons, you will be in trouble.

198
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:26,114
Therefore, let's keep both...

199
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,944
your sins and my sins...

200
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,614
as secrets.

201
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:42,544
You were Kim Sun after all.

202
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:46,944
You will die in my hands in this life as well.

203
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:57,614
The missing soul.

204
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,274
You and I have met before.

205
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:07,374
I felt this 20 years ago, too.

206
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,914
You are a demon.

207
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,084
You thrive by taking away...

208
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,444
people's dark thoughts and dark energies.

209
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:16,844
I simply took sides with...

210
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:20,174
their dark desires.

211
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,874
Thief! Help me!

212
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:35,644
Did I cover their eyes?

213
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:43,084
Is that why you pushed me from the rooftop that day?

214
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:46,414
Or did they close their eyes?

215
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,644
Stop talking nonsense.

216
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,814
What is your name?

217
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:53,544
Stop wasting your energy.

218
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:58,544
Even if you know my name, you won't be able to do anything.

219
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,444
That's why I have been living for 900 years.

220
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,414
Don't be stupid.

221
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,744
Give me your name.

222
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:14,974
Do you even know your own name?

223
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,644
Do you want to know?

224
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:24,344
You are still holding something lowly.

225
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:30,344
You've clenched it in your hand because it's so precious,

226
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:38,114
but it's bound to die in this life, too.

227
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,344
Does he...

228
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:03,844
know me?

229
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,744
I thought you'd laugh.

230
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,174
I thought you'd laugh.

231
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,174
I shouldn't laugh.

232
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:40,614
I shouldn't laugh.

233
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,274
(Grim Reaper)

234
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,644
Hello?

235
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:13,414
Deok Hwa, it's me.

236
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:17,844
Hello?

237
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,826
It looks like this.

238
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,396
So the king bestowed...

239
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,696
this sword to him.

240
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:19,226
You're not asking any question.

241
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,766
And that means you're siding with the goblin.

242
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,496
I am sorry,

243
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:26,766
but can you...

244
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:29,026
side with me just once?

245
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:31,326
What is it?

246
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,066
Can you...

247
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,296
give this to Sunny?

248
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,166
I think I shouldn't even have...

249
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,966
this excuse.

250
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,426
I will do that.

251
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:56,866
She won't remember me.

252
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,526
Please make something up about the ring.

253
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:03,796
I'll get going.

254
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,166
I think...

255
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,826
she remembers you.

256
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:30,466
Are you still waiting for the king?

257
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,766
I can't wait for him anymore.

258
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,126
Why not?

259
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,726
Is it because you remember your past?

260
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,496
The woman who loved the king was...

261
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:45,326
the sister of a traitor.

262
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:51,126
That's why I died in his hands.

263
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,426
I keep getting confused.

264
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:57,026
Whether the person who felt the paint of heart...

265
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:59,066
getting torn apart was me...

266
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,996
or me in the past.

267
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:05,326
Do you think he was sad, too?

268
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:08,896
I only saw his back.

269
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:13,426
I was told to only keep the happy memories,

270
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:17,126
and I must've been happy even in that moment...

271
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,826
since I remember it all.

272
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,096
What about him?

273
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,366
Have you met him?

274
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,596
It's all in the past.

275
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:56,066
It's way in the past. It was a lifetime ago.

276
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,796
It's the previous life for you,

277
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:00,266
but it's still the present for me.

278
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:02,626
I'm still living that life.

279
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:05,266
I have nowhere to go back to...

280
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:09,326
so I can only move forward.

281
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:13,026
And that man killed you.

282
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:16,526
It wasn't me whom he killed. He killed Kim Sun.

283
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:19,796
I'm Sunny. My life...

284
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,226
is this current one.

285
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:32,066
But if you're going to move forward...

286
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,896
Even after a lifetime,

287
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,326
my answer will be the same as before.

288
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,366
You should go.

289
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:48,366
If I take my steps towards him this time,

290
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:50,966
what I will be giving him...

291
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:53,966
won't be forgiveness.

292
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:02,226
Don't worry about me.

293
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:06,566
In this life, I will really...

294
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:09,226
be happy, Brother.

295
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,766
With this sword stuck in his heart,

296
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,696
he lived...

297
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:23,896
for 900 years.

298
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,996
We're the internal audit team.

299
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,726
Take a seat.

300
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,396
In your time of working as a grim reaper,

301
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:08,296
it's been confirmed that you've used your powers for personal reasons.

302
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,626
Erasing the memory from a human,

303
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,396
disclosing of the List of Names,

304
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:16,126
not taking appropriate measures when your identity was revealed,

305
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:19,226
showing the previous life to a human, and so on...

306
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,126
You two had a fight. You didn't see anything.

307
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,326
Say that you have to leave early.

308
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,866
I have to leave early.

309
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,766
I have to leave early.

310
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,666
Would you please look into my eyes?

311
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:37,326
I'm sorry, but please look into my eyes.

312
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:42,096
I got the missing soul's name.

313
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:43,326
The name card is here.

314
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,326
Missing Soul.

315
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:50,126
There's something I didn't tell you. About her past...

316
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:52,096
- You said it's a secret. - I think she's...

317
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:53,396
the reincarnation of your sister.

318
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,866
I am a grim reaper.

319
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,396
Do you concede?

320
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,196
- I do. - The person in question concedes.

321
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:13,966
We will hence impose severe disciplinary action.

322
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,826
Acknowledge the gravity of this matter.

323
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,426
I will gladly accept my punishment.

324
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:22,196
You won't be glad at all.

325
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:26,666
Grim reapers are composed of souls who've sinned greatly.

326
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:28,826
After 200 years of torment,

327
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:31,826
they've decided to erase their own memory.

328
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,426
Therefore, you are to confront your sins once again.

329
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:39,896
That is the proper punishment for such violation of discipline.

330
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:07,496
By exterminating the roots of treason,

331
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:09,696
you have demonstrated your power, Your Majesty.

332
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:13,726
You have brought order out of the chaos.

333
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:17,896
The streets ring with praises of you.

334
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:21,666
Out of fear for your troubled mind,

335
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,096
I had them serve a decoction.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

336
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:27,796
Its fragrance is aromatic and its sweetness and acerbic taste...

337
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:29,426
will enhance your appetite.

338
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:44,396
The majesty's body and mind have fallen ill.

339
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:46,566
It's worrying the whole nation.

340
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:49,026
Starting today, reduce the quantity of the royal meal...

341
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,326
and serve him a decoction.

342
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,196
It may be bitter, but please drink.

343
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:16,226
Clarify your body and soul, and remain strong.

344
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:33,826
Is that strong enough for you?

345
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,196
I thought you might look for it one day.

346
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:28,666
To whom should I give...

347
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:32,696
this royal garment to?

348
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:36,626
To whose finger...

349
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,666
should I put this beautiful ring on?

350
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,996
To whom should I give...

351
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:48,396
this royal garment to?

352
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,296
To whose finger...

353
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,866
should I put this beautiful ring on?

354
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,796
That beautiful ring...

355
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,666
Give it to me.

356
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:16,366
That beautiful ring...

357
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,626
Give it to me.

358
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:23,796
It'll come to good use someday in the future.

359
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,796
Do you want it?

360
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,326
Fine.

361
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,866
Then I'll give it to you.

362
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,096
Take it.

363
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:05,266
This royal garment...

364
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,496
is without an owner.

365
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:14,426
Maybe this is...

366
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,326
what you're looking for.

367
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,666
If so,

368
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:32,696
take it.

369
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,566
Your Majesty. Your decoction...

370
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,266
My people,

371
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,426
my servants,

372
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,496
my love,

373
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,566
even I,

374
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,236
not a single person,

375
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:51,126
loved me.

376
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,426
Thus,

377
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,896
I did not receive love...

378
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,896
from anyone.

379
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,526
Bring me more decoction.

380
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:14,796
I know what is in it.

381
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:15,826
What?

382
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,096
Let me finish it tonight.

383
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:22,496
Bring me...

384
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,166
more decoction.

385
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,596
It is my royal decree.

386
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,626
You have received 600 years of torment...

387
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:48,796
for the sins committed during your life,

388
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:51,066
among which is the greatest sin,

389
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:55,266
taking your own life.

390
00:35:58,826 --> 00:35:59,896
Thus,

391
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:02,896
your assignment has been terminated.

392
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:06,166
Stand by until you receive further instructions.

393
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:15,826
I was...

394
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,736
Wang Yeo.

395
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:25,796
I...

396
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:31,596
killed all of those people.

397
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:42,066
I killed myself.

398
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:16,326
What do you all think?

399
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:24,366
What must I do?

400
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,266
What must I do with him?

401
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:52,066
Don't touch that again.

402
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:54,766
You have no right to cry while looking at this.

403
00:37:58,766 --> 00:37:59,826
I...

404
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:04,466
gave you...

405
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,196
the sword.

406
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:11,096
I killed you.

407
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,366
I killed everyone.

408
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:19,396
I... I remember.

409
00:38:23,526 --> 00:38:24,626
I...

410
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:32,566
was Wang Yeo.

411
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,896
That's right.

412
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:44,026
I told you it was you. You killed them all.

413
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:45,826
You killed and killed...

414
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,896
and even killed yourself.

415
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,126
You...

416
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:53,626
couldn't protect your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo,

417
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:57,066
or even yourself. You couldn't protect a single thing.

418
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,766
Sun...

419
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,826
My young sister...

420
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:04,066
protected you with her life.

421
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,566
You should've lived. You should've stayed alive...

422
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:07,866
and died by my sword.

423
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:10,596
You should have proven with your death...

424
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:14,496
that I was a traitor, as you claimed.

425
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,866
I'm sure my sister knew...

426
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,666
that once Park Joong Won said, "Kim Shin",

427
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,626
that "Kim Sun" would be next.

428
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,296
That she'd be used to pressure you.

429
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:28,966
That's why that idiot...

430
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:31,826
died there as the sister of a traitor,

431
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:34,966
rather than become your weakness.

432
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,526
To save you.

433
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:43,796
That ring.

434
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:48,296
I was a jerk...

435
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:53,236
and forced that ring...

436
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:57,096
onto her finger.

437
00:39:58,026 --> 00:39:59,366
That ring...

438
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,966
I gave it to her again in this life.

439
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:06,526
Please,

440
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:08,896
I want you...

441
00:40:12,466 --> 00:40:14,096
to kill me.

442
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,196
Is that what you want?

443
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,196
You'll abandon yourself again?

444
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,766
The sin of killing you...

445
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:43,426
was committed already by you. That's enough.

446
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:04,126
I thought about it over and over,

447
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:06,566
whether or not I should give this to you.

448
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:09,326
So I held onto it for a few days.

449
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,896
I'm sorry.

450
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:12,266
Why are you sorry?

451
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,626
I'm the one who's sorry.

452
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,736
You don't want to ask me anything?

453
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,736
Why bother? It's obvious.

454
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:24,096
Although...

455
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:27,096
I didn't know I'd get this back like this.

456
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:31,266
Someone's sorrow, sins,

457
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:33,626
and longing belonged to me.

458
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:36,896
That shaman was good.

459
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:39,396
But...

460
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:43,296
- what was your sin? - Sorry?

461
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:45,696
I heard you're the goblin's bride.

462
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:48,896
Sure, he and I knew each other in our past lives.

463
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:51,096
Why are you tied to him?

464
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:55,326
Because it was our destiny.

465
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:57,966
Do you do strange things, too?

466
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:00,566
Do you fly like a bird?

467
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,466
I don't do that.

468
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,296
Bringing extinction...

469
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:08,766
to the eternal life of the goblin...

470
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,696
That is the destiny of the goblin's bride.

471
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,326
If you pull out that sword,

472
00:42:14,426 --> 00:42:18,996
he'll return to ashes and scatter in the wind.

473
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:21,096
He'll vanish forever...

474
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:24,896
from this world to another.

475
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,266
Eun Tak?

476
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:34,266
Well, yes. I...

477
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:37,896
can make it rain less,

478
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:40,266
so it doesn't inconvenience people.

479
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:44,066
I can also make the first snowfall come sooner,

480
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,996
so that people can be excited.

481
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,326
You do the most important work.

482
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:51,896
But...

483
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:55,396
why did my brother become a goblin?

484
00:42:55,396 --> 00:42:59,266
Because the world needs miracles.

485
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:02,396
Strange and beautiful miracles.

486
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:03,596
Says who?

487
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,166
Says me.

488
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:10,296
Fine. What about the Grim Reaper?

489
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:13,126
Because everyone dies?

490
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,866
Because there is death,

491
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:19,266
life is brilliant.

492
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:23,526
You're so good with your words.

493
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:25,896
You speak like a student at a top university.

494
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:38,226
It has been a while,

495
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,096
sister of the lowly warrior,

496
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:44,726
a queen born from a warrior's family.

497
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:50,496
What is it? Do you see something?

498
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:52,526
Stay out of it.

499
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,526
It's not your turn yet.

500
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:56,826
I will come for you after I get her.

501
00:43:57,326 --> 00:43:58,526
Don't come closer.

502
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,966
Get the lighter from my coat pocket. Hurry.

503
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:03,166
Lighter?

504
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:04,596
What for?

505
00:44:04,596 --> 00:44:07,896
Yeo was like a son to me.

506
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:11,266
She ruined everything.

507
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:13,866
I will kill her.

508
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:14,896
Lighter! Now!

509
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:15,896
Okay.

510
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:17,696
You witch!

511
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:31,766
Eun Tak, what's wrong?

512
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:33,896
What just happened?

513
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:36,296
Wake up. Eun Tak.

514
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,266
Are you okay? Can you walk?

515
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,426
Yes, I'm okay.

516
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:48,866
Did I scare you?

517
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,696
Of course, you did.

518
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:53,496
Whom were you talking to earlier?

519
00:44:53,496 --> 00:44:57,466
What was that green light? You said you're human.

520
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:00,696
Are you something like a human...

521
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:02,296
that isn't exactly human?

522
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,426
It's a first for me, too.

523
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:08,766
Go on inside.

524
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:12,696
I'll join you after a short chat with your brother.

525
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:14,166
Did he say he'll come by?

526
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,096
If I call him, he has no choice but to.

527
00:45:25,696 --> 00:45:26,996
How are you?

528
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:43,866
I missed you.

529
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:47,396
Me, too.

530
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:53,366
Have you been well?

531
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:55,096
Yes.

532
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:59,226
I'm sorry. I'll come for you soon.

533
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:09,866
The mark on your neck...

534
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:11,896
What about it?

535
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:14,426
It's almost gone.

536
00:46:15,026 --> 00:46:16,166
Is it?

537
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,026
I wonder why.

538
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:20,866
If it's that faint,

539
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:22,966
it means you were in grave danger.

540
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:24,896
I might not be able to sense you.

541
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:26,296
Don't worry.

542
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:28,896
I'll be more cautious and careful.

543
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:32,466
Did you see Park Joong Won again?

544
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,396
I did but...

545
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,966
I wasn't his target.

546
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:42,566
Your sister was.

547
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,426
Don't worry about that.

548
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:45,996
Worry about yourself.

549
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:48,266
Someone else will protect her.

550
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,026
Just two more days.

551
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:55,196
Fate is the question I throw. You...

552
00:46:57,966 --> 00:46:59,496
can find the answer.

553
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:04,666
We were given a question.

554
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:08,326
The Grim Reaper and I have to find the answer.

555
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,696
(Missing Soul)

556
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,796
(Park Joong Won)

557
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:33,596
(He died in the year 1097.)

558
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:38,126
(He has since evaded the Grim Reaper.)

559
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:42,366
(I met him again by chance in 1997...)

560
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:48,496
(but he got away from me yet again.)

561
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:55,096
What is it?

562
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,166
The papers for the missing soul I told you about...

563
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,126
The one who got away 20 years ago?

564
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:03,896
Yes, but I got suspended and can't file it myself.

565
00:48:04,526 --> 00:48:05,766
I need your help...

566
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:08,066
so listen to me carefully.

567
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:11,126
- I'm listening. - He's been around for 900 years.

568
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,526
He managed to live off...

569
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,266
humans' dark emotions.

570
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:18,066
Even if one of us sees him, we can't take him down.

571
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,566
I think that if we get him on the list,

572
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:22,666
then at least we can control him.

573
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,596
It's urgent. File it as soon as possible.

574
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:27,896
- Tomorrow noon is... - I'll do it...

575
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,266
by midnight.

576
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:31,826
Thanks.

577
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:34,826
I have something to tell you.

578
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,696
I think you should know.

579
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,696
I took over your jurisdiction.

580
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:41,796
I got a card for Ji Eun Tak.

581
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,566
Isn't she the goblin's bride?

582
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,796
I saw the date and...

583
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:49,496
Don't speak of it.

584
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:51,626
Hands off.

585
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,896
I read it. You did not.

586
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,266
She has a week.

587
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:25,896
It's not your turn yet.

588
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,296
I will come for you after I get her.

589
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:30,596
That means...

590
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:33,826
he will come after me.

591
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:54,296
I got...

592
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:56,396
Eun Tak's card again.

593
00:49:57,366 --> 00:50:00,296
- I think... - Park Joong Won's involved.

594
00:50:03,326 --> 00:50:06,466
- On March 2017... - That date means nothing now.

595
00:50:07,696 --> 00:50:08,826
You must know that.

596
00:50:09,526 --> 00:50:10,566
But still.

597
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:12,826
I thought you should know.

598
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:21,696
Park Joong Won...

599
00:50:22,696 --> 00:50:24,326
is bothering my sister.

600
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:26,726
Protect her.

601
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,526
Even if it's just once, protect her...

602
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:32,666
like she had protected you.

603
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:39,526
That day.

604
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:43,896
The king was too far away.

605
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:46,396
I couldn't get to him.

606
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:49,496
I knew I'd never get close.

607
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:53,226
I knew it but all I knew to do was to keep going.

608
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,566
That day,

609
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,566
why did you keep going?

610
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:05,826
You knew...

611
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,826
you would die then and there.

612
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:15,196
I wanted to say what I hadn't been able to.

613
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:25,566
Since you gave me the sword,

614
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:29,396
I requested your audience numerous times.

615
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:31,696
But you, my king and brother-in-law,

616
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,996
only instructed me to fight at yet another border.

617
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:39,126
Only when you were sure I would die...

618
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:40,866
did you show your face.

619
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:42,126
What...

620
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:45,696
did you want...

621
00:51:45,696 --> 00:51:47,096
so badly to say?

622
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:48,566
The previous king said...

623
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,496
Tell him I looked out for him...

624
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,966
by ignoring him.

625
00:51:53,896 --> 00:51:56,566
He looked out for you by ignoring you.

626
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:00,396
The previous king, your half-brother...

627
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,996
Your wife, my younger sister...

628
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:05,726
I, your faithful general...

629
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:09,626
We all loved you.

630
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:18,666
I was going to request you give me an order.

631
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:22,166
"I give you this sword out of worry and caution."

632
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:26,696
"Behead Park Joong Won."

633
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:28,996
That was it.

634
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,796
I had no idea...

635
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:42,596
that sword would end up in my chest.

636
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,296
How could this be?

637
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:07,696
You, I, or the 900 years.

638
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,226
You will not be able to hurt me with that sword of yours.

639
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,296
I came this far...

640
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:22,026
and yet I must use this sword again.

641
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,066
What is it?

642
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:38,726
Is it...

643
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:40,726
hurting again?

644
00:53:50,596 --> 00:53:53,796
That was what this sword...

645
00:53:55,126 --> 00:53:56,626
was meant to do.

646
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,666
To strike Park Joong Won.

647
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:32,796
Are you good at memorizing numbers?

648
00:54:34,526 --> 00:54:37,226
One should always seal it with a kiss.

649
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,426
What's wrong with you?

650
00:54:54,296 --> 00:54:56,596
You need to look pretty. Stop crying.

651
00:55:53,596 --> 00:55:54,826
Feel free to look.

652
00:56:13,196 --> 00:56:15,196
Why do you keep following me?

653
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:20,366
It's been days already. Are you stalking me?

654
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:24,426
No, I'm not.

655
00:56:25,596 --> 00:56:27,466
Our paths happen to overlap.

656
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:30,626
Thanks to you, it felt like I was on a date...

657
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:35,826
with you, Kim Woo Bin.

658
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:42,026
But why...

659
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:45,826
How do you remember?

660
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:49,396
Because you made a mistake when you hypnotized me.

661
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:53,996
Forget...

662
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:57,996
all the sad and hard moments.

663
00:56:58,796 --> 00:57:02,226
Whether they were in your past life or present...

664
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:06,496
And...

665
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:09,096
forget about me.

666
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:14,896
I hope that you at least have a happy ending.

667
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,796
You said to remember only my happy moments,

668
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:33,396
but you said to forget you. That's a contradiction.

669
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:36,696
Every moment that you were in,

670
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:39,666
even all the sadness and hardship,

671
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:43,426
all of it made me happy.

672
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:45,426
So...

673
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:49,326
did my giving up my life to protect you...

674
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:52,166
give you a happy ending?

675
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:56,296
Seeing how young you look,

676
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,096
you didn't live very long, did you?

677
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:02,966
Every day,

678
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,466
my heart broke...

679
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,196
from missing you.

680
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:16,366
Then why did you...

681
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,226
Because I was a fool.

682
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:30,396
You should've realized that sooner.

683
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,666
But why did I...

684
00:58:35,396 --> 00:58:38,796
fall for you again even in this life?

685
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,596
Is it because you're so handsome?

686
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:50,096
Here.

687
00:58:54,766 --> 00:58:57,226
Let's really break up this time.

688
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:01,826
I don't want to fall for you in this life.

689
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:05,696
This is the only punishment...

690
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:08,496
I can give you.

691
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,466
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

692
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:43,966
- Give it back! - Where did you get these cookies?

693
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:45,426
- Did you steal them? - I did not!

694
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:47,326
My grandma bought them for me!

695
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:48,526
Did she beg for them?

696
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:51,666
Don't say that about my grandma! Wind bomb!

697
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:53,596
He's at it again.

698
00:59:53,596 --> 00:59:56,026
Hey. That's not how you do the wind bomb.

699
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:58,996
This is how you do it. Wind bomb!

700
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:03,496
Wind bomb!

701
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,796
Why you punks.

702
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:09,166
Wind bomb!

703
01:00:11,996 --> 01:00:14,226
- What the... - Did he really do it?

704
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:26,066
Are you okay?

705
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:30,226
How did you know?

706
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,896
You said before that I'd really do the wind bomb.

707
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,696
I really did the wind bomb.

708
01:00:37,396 --> 01:00:40,326
When I was around your age, I said...

709
01:00:40,326 --> 01:00:44,226
I'd become the goblin's bride when I grew up, and I did.

710
01:00:44,796 --> 01:00:46,296
But it's a secret.

711
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:50,426
Wind bombs are very dangerous, so don't go around using them anywhere.

712
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:51,466
Okay?

713
01:00:53,696 --> 01:00:55,826
I'll tell only my grandma.

714
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,696
You were kind of cool.

715
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:10,096
- Then let's take a trip. - Gosh.

716
01:01:10,496 --> 01:01:12,896
- Why? - My heart just skipped a beat.

717
01:01:12,896 --> 01:01:15,696
That's good. You said you like that.

718
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:19,426
You seem to be in a good mood.

719
01:01:22,226 --> 01:01:25,796
Let's do it. Let's take a trip and stuff.

720
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:44,326
Look here.

721
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:20,796
This is nice.

722
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,426
I have a gift for you.

723
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:52,626
I have plenty.

724
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:55,626
Everything is more than perfect already.

725
01:02:59,466 --> 01:03:00,526
I doubt that.

726
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,766
This?

727
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:08,426
You're an adult now, so remember.

728
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:10,666
We're supposed to each keep a copy.

729
01:03:11,796 --> 01:03:14,466
That's why I had made a copy.

730
01:03:14,496 --> 01:03:16,596
If only I hadn't gotten caught.

731
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:20,696
But which is the original?

732
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,226
That's it, isn't it?

733
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:27,566
- Give me that one. - I don't want to.

734
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,626
I want that one.

735
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:05,266
On the day of the first snowfall every year,

736
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:06,996
the goblin agrees to be summoned by me.

737
01:04:06,996 --> 01:04:09,826
I will be waiting for you.

738
01:04:12,566 --> 01:04:13,666
No way.

739
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:17,026
It's snowing.

740
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:21,426
It's the first snow.

741
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,966
I can't be sad for 1,000 years.

742
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:33,426
I'm not in pain all the time.

743
01:04:33,426 --> 01:04:35,126
I'm a strong goblin...

744
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:37,296
who accepted my fate and got on with my life.

745
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:39,996
I'm a goblin's bride who's strong...

746
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:42,996
and accepted my fate and got on with my life.

747
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:50,766
No sadness lasts forever.

748
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:52,796
No love lasts forever, either.

749
01:04:53,126 --> 01:04:54,666
I say there is.

750
01:04:54,996 --> 01:04:56,496
Which will you vote for?

751
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:58,066
Sadness or love?

752
01:04:58,826 --> 01:05:00,896
Such an excuse disguised as permission.

753
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:06,366
I wish I had one.

754
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:11,096
I wish that excuse...

755
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,696
would keep me alive.

756
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:19,066
With you.

757
01:05:23,296 --> 01:05:24,766
On sad love.

758
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:46,866
- Mr. Yu! - My card! My card!

759
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:48,426
Did you enjoy your nap?

760
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:50,896
You aren't at home. You are at work.

761
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:52,896
Can you please focus for at least one day?

762
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:54,126
I'm sorry.

763
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:56,466
Hello and welcome.

764
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:58,396
Do you need a bed?

765
01:05:58,396 --> 01:06:01,596
You have great taste.

766
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:04,896
Lie down on this bed and right away...

767
01:06:04,966 --> 01:06:07,766
Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu!

768
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:10,526
I'm sorry. The bed is that comfortable.

769
01:06:10,526 --> 01:06:12,496
I will miss you a lot.

770
01:06:12,496 --> 01:06:13,596
You'll fall right asleep.

771
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:19,826
Here's your chicken.

772
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:24,196
Hello. Sit over there.

773
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:27,966
You seem well.

774
01:06:29,496 --> 01:06:31,126
You seem healthy.

775
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,226
All is well.

776
01:06:36,966 --> 01:06:38,596
I wish that this life...

777
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:41,796
is good to you.

778
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:39,036
I just have to think of you and you're here.

779
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:41,696
I was just thinking about you.

780
01:07:42,996 --> 01:07:44,366
Why are you here?

781
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,266
I wanted to see you.

782
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:51,296
And I need a favor.

783
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:53,766
Ask away.

784
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:55,726
It's about Park Joong Won.

785
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:00,996
I was thinking about that...

786
01:08:00,996 --> 01:08:02,626
and I got curious.

787
01:08:02,626 --> 01:08:04,466
"Why now?"

788
01:08:04,466 --> 01:08:06,426
"He'd been wandering for 900 years."

789
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:10,566
"Why did he choose to show himself now?"

790
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:13,196
Yes. It's about that.

791
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:16,066
I need you to be brave for a while.

792
01:08:16,766 --> 01:08:18,066
Can you do that?

793
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,596
I'm the goblin's bride.

794
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,796
Listen carefully. I will call you shortly.

795
01:08:41,796 --> 01:08:43,626
You must summon me right away.

796
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:48,496
That's easy.

797
01:09:32,196 --> 01:09:33,396
I'll be back.

798
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:05,766
I told you already.

799
01:10:05,866 --> 01:10:08,096
You cannot harm me...

800
01:10:08,096 --> 01:10:09,966
with that sword.

801
01:10:10,426 --> 01:10:11,566
I know that.

802
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:15,896
Shall we begin our final fight?

803
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:22,166
How do you know where I will go?

804
01:10:29,036 --> 01:10:30,326
(The Multicolored Goblin)

805
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:53,696
What's the meaning of...

806
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:56,196
buckwheat flowers?

807
01:10:56,966 --> 01:10:58,036
Lovers.

808
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:32,796
I see that...

809
01:11:33,596 --> 01:11:36,866
you can no longer see me.

810
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,666
(Ji Eun Tak, aged 20, March 11, 2017, Heart attack)

811
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,596
It's because of me.

812
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:22,226
He waited for my mark to fade.

813
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:24,966
You're smart.

814
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:28,196
But it's too late.

815
01:12:28,196 --> 01:12:29,426
He'll use me...

816
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,496
to pull out...

817
01:12:34,126 --> 01:12:36,036
the goblin's sword.

818
01:12:41,426 --> 01:12:43,266
Now. Summon me.

819
01:12:54,366 --> 01:12:56,036
Do not blame me.

820
01:12:57,626 --> 01:12:59,466
This is your destiny.

821
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,360
Do not blame me.

822
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,790
This is your destiny.

823
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:42,078
Are you okay?

824
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:49,408
Eun Tak.

825
01:13:54,808 --> 01:13:55,878
I figured it out.

826
01:13:56,638 --> 01:13:58,578
I get why he presented himself.

827
01:13:58,808 --> 01:14:00,538
Stab me. Quickly.

828
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,878
It's all over if he takes my body.

829
01:14:02,878 --> 01:14:05,138
He's trying to pull the sword out using my body.

830
01:14:05,138 --> 01:14:06,508
I was destined...

831
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:09,708
to die anyway if it wasn't for you.

832
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,278
Stab me. Quickly.

833
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:18,508
She was right.

834
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:20,138
You should have stabbed her.

835
01:14:20,138 --> 01:14:23,308
Now, it's either you or me.

836
01:14:23,308 --> 01:14:25,838
You kept looking behind...

837
01:14:28,778 --> 01:14:31,278
and now you will die by my hands.

838
01:14:53,308 --> 01:14:54,538
Park Joong Won.

839
01:14:58,978 --> 01:15:00,138
Answer to my call,

840
01:15:00,578 --> 01:15:02,608
deceased soul.

841
01:15:02,948 --> 01:15:05,008
- How dare you... - Park Joong Won.

842
01:15:06,038 --> 01:15:07,838
Park Joong Won!

843
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:23,038
This is how it ends.

844
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:26,708
However, I won't perish in vain.

845
01:16:26,808 --> 01:16:30,178
I took your life once again.

846
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:37,078
Look.

847
01:16:39,138 --> 01:16:40,478
In the end,

848
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:43,878
it's demise.

849
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,448
Forgive me.

850
01:17:36,978 --> 01:17:39,178
I can finally notify you...

851
01:17:42,138 --> 01:17:45,538
of my brave death.

852
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,308
No!

853
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:06,948
No.

854
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:09,708
No.

855
01:18:17,138 --> 01:18:18,508
No.

856
01:18:26,778 --> 01:18:29,038
No. No.

857
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:31,708
No.

858
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:12,078
Meeting you...

859
01:19:14,778 --> 01:19:16,208
was the reward of my life.

860
01:19:18,538 --> 01:19:19,578
No.

861
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:22,778
Please.

862
01:19:28,978 --> 01:19:31,238
You said you wouldn't let go of my hands.

863
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:35,308
You promised me.

864
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:41,908
I will come as the rain.

865
01:19:46,538 --> 01:19:48,408
I will come as the first snowfall.

866
01:19:50,308 --> 01:19:52,838
I will beg the divinity...

867
01:19:55,038 --> 01:19:57,078
to let me do just that.

868
01:19:58,638 --> 01:19:59,808
Don't do this.

869
01:20:02,308 --> 01:20:04,078
Don't go like this.

870
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:10,008
I love you.

871
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:20,278
I love you. I love you.

872
01:20:23,578 --> 01:20:24,708
So do I.

873
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:35,008
I love you.

874
01:20:38,538 --> 01:20:39,908
I...

875
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,578
already did that...

876
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:49,948
back there.

877
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:32,278
No.

878
01:23:14,008 --> 01:23:17,178
(Goblin)

879
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:09,408
In the end,

880
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,578
that is the decision I made.

881
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:23,308
I understand now.
