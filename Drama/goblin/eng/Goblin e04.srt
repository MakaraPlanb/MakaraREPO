7
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:54,846
Then what am I now? Am I still
not the goblin's bride?

8
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,046
Am I not?

9
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,006
I think you are.

10
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,695
Really?

11
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,525
Then... do I get the effective value now?

12
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:17,845
Will you not leave now?

13
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:19,766
For now.

14
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:24,996
I might prepare to leave somewhere farther.

15
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,266
What does that mean?

16
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:32,086
It means you're Goblin's bride.

17
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:35,516
I don't think that's what you meant.

18
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:40,845
You've been seeing it from the beginning, so why
did you pretend not to see it all this time?

19
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:44,115
At first, as courtesy. Then,
because I was scared.

20
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:44,866
In detail.

21
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:49,305
I thought it was not courteous to ask
something painful to someone I just met.

22
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:55,445
And after that, if I say that I see it, I
was scared that something might happen.

23
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,445
"What if he asks me to
get married right away?"

24
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:01,965
"What about my college?"
"Would I become a goblin?"

25
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:06,155
Above that, I wondered if you had money.

26
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:11,256
Pretending not to see it came after those.
Because I got mad. It was for a short time.

27
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:17,336
What do I need to do now? As a bride.

28
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:31,776
The first thing you need to do
as a bride... wait here for now.

29
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,185
<i>Episode 4</i>

30
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:42,855
She sees the sword. She just
pointed to it. Like this.

31
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,425
Alright. So leave.

32
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:49,545
She sees the sword. She's my bride!
I'm going to die now!

33
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:51,315
So what? Isn't that good?

34
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:56,196
Weren't you looking for your bride to die?
The bride that would return you to nothing?

35
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:59,145
That's right. For most of my life.

36
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,795
Then what is the problem? Why?
She wants to kill you?

37
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,215
I'm not in the mood for jokes!

38
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,046
What exactly are you feeling? Are you happy
because she sees the sword or are you afraid?

39
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:13,325
I don't know. A part of me thinks that it's a
relief how I can end this tiring immortal life.

40
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,605
Then it wasn't always that tiring so
I feel like living a little more.

41
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:20,835
Just say it, I can take her anytime.

42
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,805
She's someone I had to take anyway.

43
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,665
Even though, I would have to stay up
for nights to get the documents ready.

44
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,876
- Did it sound like that?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:32,566
You're right on point. I'm glad
we finally have a friendship.

46
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,995
Death is calling me.

47
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:40,715
If it's ringing the doorbell
then it's a friendly death.

48
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:44,715
Calm down. You didn't say anything mean to
her that she would hold a grudge, right?

49
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,035
<i>One way is to die according
to your actual life</i>,

50
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,966
<i>since this is a bonus
life, like a side effect.</i>

51
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,006
I'll just die. That's simpler.

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,415
Right. Let's do that.

53
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:01,045
You can't even wait for that short while I
told you too? You really have no patience.

54
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:04,285
<i>Go harder. You only die once.</i>

55
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,465
I'm sorry but I can't wait any longer.

56
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:10,785
After I found out that I am a goblin's
bride, I have been waiting only for you.

57
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,115
For a long time.

58
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,745
My aunt left the house and she
also took the house deposit.

59
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:20,055
Therefore, I have no house to live in.

60
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:24,995
So, since you said that
you will not be leaving.

61
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:26,615
Did you really decide not to leave?

62
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,425
I will grow in this house.

63
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:31,625
Adoption is fine too. I
will grow like a cactus.

64
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,065
I will grow well by myself. Please.

65
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,866
I approve.

66
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:44,215
I wanted to be an ordinary senior high school student
in Korea taking the college entrance exam but,

67
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:48,555
I lost my mother when I was nine and
I didn't have anyone to rely on.

68
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:52,576
I know this story. I saw that drama.

69
00:04:54,686 --> 00:05:02,686
Without a mother... under the sky with no mother, being
abused by my aunt and her children for the past10 years.

70
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,135
I wish it ends with a happy ending.

71
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:09,846
Then I finally realized, "There is no god."

72
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:16,615
While in this hodgepodge world
filled with all sorts of misfortune,

73
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:21,276
I met you. Just like fate.

74
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,616
So, save me. Please.

75
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:31,116
Hey, you're asking me to save you but you want
to live here after you've seen who lives here?

76
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,205
If it's not this house, I'll die wandering
in the streets or from starvation.

77
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:42,615
If I die here or there, I would
rather die beautifully in this house.

78
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:47,305
They say the darkest place is under a lamp.
Starting from today, be my lamp.

79
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,026
So that this ahjussi can't get me.

80
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:54,956
I'm sorry but between us our friendsh-

81
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,655
Go inside, for now.

82
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,905
Stay in the living room. Stay behaved.

83
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,616
Yes.

84
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,416
See me for a moment.

85
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:28,645
How could a friendship not go on for 5
minutes? How could you tell her that?

86
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:33,185
- Ah! You asking me to take her supposed to be a secret? I didn't know.
- You did it on purpose, didn't you?

87
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,195
To a kid who has no place to
go and is really pitiable.

88
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:39,605
Ah, is that why you made her
stand outside when it's cold?

89
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,675
Don't ever come out.

90
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:44,605
What will you do? Do you have a way?

91
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:48,816
There is a way. Although
it's a bit secular.

92
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:55,596
Among 1, 2, 3, I pick 2. Here is $5000.

93
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,376
Why are you looking at me like that?

94
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,635
What does that mean?

95
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:12,835
This money... keep it.

96
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:16,685
I, who said those was the one
that didn't know what was what.

97
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:21,915
Now, I've seen this house.

98
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,295
So what does that mean?

99
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:25,295
This house is perfect for raising kids.

100
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:28,875
Let's have kids and live
a good lovey dovey life.

101
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,805
What type are you?

102
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:31,925
W-what?

103
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:36,795
What type of wife do you prefer? A
good wife and wise mother? Sexy?

104
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:40,735
A professional? Should I
change it up everyday?

105
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:43,475
You said I was no good,
that I was really no good?

106
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:47,425
I was saying all sorts of things. Cancel.

107
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:52,255
<i>Ahjussi, you are really handsome.
You are really cool.</i>

108
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,765
<i>Ever since I met you I never look at stars.</i>

109
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,665
<i>Why would I look at the stars? I
could just look at your eyes.</i>

110
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:03,145
<i>Ahjussi, do you hear my loud thoughts?</i>

111
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:04,255
What are you doing?

112
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,125
I know you heard it all.

113
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:11,685
I'm sorry. I keep on
thinking to myself loudly.

114
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,215
I lied about that.

115
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:18,455
A lie? You said you could hear my thoughts?

116
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,705
That lie started there.

117
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:24,295
Then that time when I was
abducted, how did you know?

118
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:30,395
I just felt it. I don't know exactly but it
seems to be because of the mark on your neck.

119
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:35,795
Scammer. In case my thoughts get caught,
I really thought of you quietly.

120
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:40,285
I did it in parts, I did it while singing
in between, even while looking at the leaf,

121
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,205
"I'm not thinking of ahjusshi,
I'm thinking of autumn foliage."

122
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:47,776
I made excuses like that. I was even
cautious when I thought about myself.

123
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,305
Why? What?

124
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:57,825
Why are you confessing about thinking
about me, making me all confused.

125
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:02,396
What makes you confused?
I really am the bride.

126
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:19,455
So... should I unpack or not?
I'm also confused.

127
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:23,786
It seems like you are not confused though. Put
down the money and don't unpack your things.

128
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:28,336
Is there a number 4, by any chance?

129
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,976
It must be something better, right?

130
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:35,876
Grandpa!

131
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,605
Huh?
- Oh!

132
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:44,475
Why is she here, Grandpa?
Why are you here with her?

133
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:47,265
She's the grandson that
I was talking about.

134
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:50,685
He'll be living a floor below you so

135
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:55,366
if you have something you need,
you can just ask of him.

136
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,465
Me? Me?

137
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,955
Hey, there are a lot of
people in your secretariat.

138
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,755
Do you not want your card usage released?

139
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:05,325
Among them, I'm most competent
so I will assist you.

140
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,535
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

141
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:10,855
As you can see he's not so trustworthy.

142
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:14,835
If something unfavorable happens,

143
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,295
please call here.

144
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,835
Thank you.

145
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:23,185
<i>Yoo San Woo CEO</i>

146
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:25,285
Are you the Chairman?

147
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:29,876
The Chairman's biological grandson,
third generation chaebol.

148
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:35,825
You must be tired. I will
be taking him as I go out.

149
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:38,896
Why? I have something to talk to her about.

150
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,755
Grandpa! Grandpa!

151
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,386
Goodbye.

152
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,725
Suite Room.

153
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,896
Wow!

154
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,656
Ah so nice.

155
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,546
Feels nice.

156
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,826
So this is a Suite Room.

157
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:37,016
It's a nice suite room but I'm by myself.

158
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,636
It's so spacious.

159
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,966
It's scary to be by myself.

160
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:58,105
Grandpa who is she?

161
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:00,615
You don't need to know.

162
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:05,945
Just mind assisting her to be comfortable.

163
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,045
Something really important relies on her.

164
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:11,945
Something important? What?

165
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,886
Your card.

166
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:20,885
So unbelievable.

167
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,865
I'm the chaebol.

168
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:26,395
Why is my card usage on the
hands of a high schooler?

169
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,495
Seriously.

170
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,965
Uncle, uncle! Grandpa
has some young girl...

171
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,935
Uncle, what's wrong? What's going on?

172
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:37,595
This is for neurasthenia, this is for
bipolar disorder, this is for insomnia.

173
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,435
So, I'm asking why are you taking them?

174
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:44,976
I am really fickle these days,
happy, sad, lonely, splendid...

175
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,755
I couldn't sleep.

176
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:51,916
Why are you lonely then splendid?

177
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,006
I lost weight.

178
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,996
That man... my uncle, what on earth...

179
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,375
Uncle, what's wrong?

180
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:15,566
I have the same symptoms. If I shed a tear
after seeing a woman for the first time.

181
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,066
What could that be?

182
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:24,205
<i>Hello, viewers. Today we have a
family medicine specialist with us.</i>

183
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:27,475
<i>We will spend time learning
about mental health.</i>

184
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:32,485
<i>Yes. Physical health is important
but compared to that, many people</i>

185
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,326
<i>overlook their mental health.</i>

186
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:41,015
<i>Bipolar disorder,
neurasthenia, and insomnia</i>

187
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:44,465
<i>are chronic illnesses that sticks
to modern day people like a shadow.</i>

188
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,025
<i>First, a sign of bipolar disorder</i>

189
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,025
<i>is impulsive shopping.</i>

190
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:54,746
<i>If a person close to you suddenly
buys many items, be suspicious.</i>

191
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,435
<i>Other symptoms include-</i>

192
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:03,295
<i>excessive self-confidence.</i>

193
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:05,975
Anyone want to go to the sauna with me?

194
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:08,366
Forget it if you don't have the confidence.

195
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,965
Wow, he's really excessive.

196
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,435
Uncle, let's tie him up.

197
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,766
Challenge accepted.

198
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:29,105
<i>One of the representative symptom
of neurasthenia is hypochondria.</i>

199
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:33,755
I think the reason I have heartburn
is because I have a stomach ulcer.

200
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,296
At least give me that.

201
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:44,085
You won't die by not having a stomach.
You just won't be able to eat.

202
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:45,855
You said you'll die when your
bride pulls out the sword.

203
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:49,055
Ah, so you're telling me to die?

204
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,765
- That was all we talked about.
- What's news?

205
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:57,785
If someone overheard, they'd think that I'm the only weird one, only
I'm small-minded. Someone like me doesn't have the worth to live.

206
00:14:57,786 --> 00:15:00,635
Why don't you go to her and tell her!

207
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:04,305
To pull the sword and kill me!
That I deserve to die!

208
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:07,546
- You look like you'll cry. Really.
- I'm barely keeping it in.

209
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,885
Is the bus stop this way?

210
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,676
Or that way?

211
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:34,476
Is ahjussi depressed?

212
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,646
But it's funny.

213
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:16,065
You hurt my feelings if
you're depressed now.

214
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:21,866
If you don't like it, just say so! What's with the rain
in commute time that causes everybody discomfort?!

215
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:42,935
Hello.

216
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,685
I'll escort you to school. Please get in.

217
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,505
Please drop the formal speech.

218
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,285
No, I don't want to.

219
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:52,005
Because I'm afraid you
might tell my grandfather.

220
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,055
I won't tell him.

221
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:56,406
Even if you don't tell him, someone will.

What are you doing? Get off, we're here.

226
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:26,435
I told you not here. Over there
by the 4-way intersection.

227
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:28,325
Absolutely never.

228
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:34,316
It's natural for a chaebol to drive a sedan
in front of the school to gather attention.

229
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:47,115
If you don't get off, I'll
do it again tomorrow.

230
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,115
- You're really not going to do it tomorrow?
- Tomorrow wouldn't be fun.

231
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,956
I've already drawn all their attention.

232
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:56,535
Isn't that Ji Eun Tak?

233
00:17:56,536 --> 00:18:02,985
Hey!

234
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:05,556
- Please go.
- You're Ji Eun Tak?

235
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:11,165
Yes. I was late introducing
myself, wasn't I? I'm Ji Eun Tak-

236
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,745
Then you're that shabashaba eyeshaba...
You cried a lot, didn't you?

237
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:17,925
Then, that time, that goblin book...

238
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:21,776
Ah, so you know my uncle?

239
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,985
All the pieces of the
puzzle have come together.

240
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:28,005
- Uncle?
- Ah! What happened to your aunt?

241
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:32,145
That punishment(beol)? That gold(geum)?
I mean that punishment(beol).

242
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,416
A fine(beolgeum)?

243
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,376
Is my aunt paying some kind of fine?

244
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:45,106
I don't know. I'm just curious about
how he carried out her punishment.

245
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:55,805
Where did you get this?

246
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:59,335
Why are you asking that kind of question?

247
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:03,346
Do you want to buy it or not?

248
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:09,166
It's because this is very
high quality, that's why.

249
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:15,385
I received it as an inheritance.
An inheritance.

250
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:19,125
- What's wrong with your face?
- My mom hit me. Since I'm pitiful, so please give us a good offer.

251
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,305
- You crazy...
- She hasn't been beaten enough. She needs a thorough beating.

252
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:24,826
Shut up!

253
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:37,065
One moment. This is a precious item so I have
to properly appraise it with some equipment.

254
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,796
<i>Soo Jewels
Gold.Silver.Jewels.Watches</i>

255
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:45,755
Why are you hitting me?

256
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:49,996
- Just get out.
- Keep your mouth shut, girl! You're embarrassing me!

257
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,476
What do you mean by stealing?

258
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,465
Stolen?

259
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:58,485
I said I brought this from my niece's drawer!
How many times do I have to tell you?!

260
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:01,025
- That's stealing, Mom.
- Shut up, punk.

261
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:05,055
You were the most thrilled. This punk was.

262
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,656
Sit.

263
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,975
- So this gold is your niece's?
- Yes.

264
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:16,956
Why did you lie to the jeweler
saying they were an inheritance?

265
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,975
How did I lie?

266
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:24,815
I never said it was inherited to me
but it was inherited to my niece.

267
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,975
Her mom, so, as my sister was dying...

268
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,245
Yes. That's enough.

269
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,025
I got it. What's your
niece's name and birthday?

270
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:38,685
She's in high school. She's a senior.
Her name is...

271
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:42,025
What was her name again? What was it?

272
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:43,625
- Eun Ji?
- Eunie?

273
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,465
Ah, these crazy punks. Are you
going to come to your senses?

274
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,916
Do you think this is a joke?

275
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,825
Listen carefully. So,

276
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,755
your niece in high school
whose name you don't know,

277
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:04,936
stole these gold bars made by the bank of Korea
and wich should be kept the FRB of New York.

278
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,925
And you stole these again.
Isn't that what you're saying?

279
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:10,715
No, it's not that we stole it!

280
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:14,665
Ah, if you can't believe me, go
to our home and ask her yourself!

281
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,005
I've been asking you whole time.
The adress, give me the adress.

282
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:21,256
The adress is Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.

283
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,536
Wait. Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

284
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:31,576
Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

285
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,005
What was it?!

286
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,175
What was our home's address?

287
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,995
We had a home?

288
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,486
We lived somewhere?

289
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:46,126
These crazy people. What is this?

290
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,335
Is she really Uncle's bride?

291
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,135
Why is she his bride?

292
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:01,655
Who knows. Probably god's joke.

293
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,055
Ah. That's why Uncle is depressed.

294
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,406
She's not his style.

295
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,615
God's joke went a bit far.

296
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:15,705
But, Uncle down the hall. My Uncle cherishes
that plate very much. The one you just froze.

297
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:19,106
Uncle said he bought that
himself from Louis the 14th.

298
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,045
- That's what he said.
- Deok Hwa.

299
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:31,175
I won't tell on you.

300
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:35,955
Is it because of that girl? The girl who brought
tears to your eyes the first time you met her?

301
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:39,075
Think carefully. Are you sure
that was your first meeting?

302
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,955
That's not what a man should do.
Take responsibility.

303
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:46,416
Even if you don't, that girl
might remember something.

304
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:49,865
- But...
- Yes?

305
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:53,375
- She was too carefree.
<i>- I'm Sunny.</i>

306
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,296
She did this to her hair.

307
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:02,146
She flipped it like that. And her lips.

308
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,766
She did this.

309
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,626
Like this? What?

310
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,275
I really never met her before.

311
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:19,025
Why would you not finish your sentence?

312
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,586
Ah, what did she do with her lips?

313
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:26,065
I won't ask.

314
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,096
Omo, look at the time.

315
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:41,155
Why are you suited all up?
Is it a marriage or funeral?

316
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:44,025
Ah, is this why they say
marriage is a tomb?

317
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,595
I'm a little reverent right now.

318
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:49,985
I wish that you would answer
honestly to the questions I ask.

319
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:54,865
You also do the international work, don't
you? Or is your English is too short?

320
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,815
What? Pardon?

321
00:24:56,816 --> 00:25:01,475
That's good enough.
Infortunatley, I need your help.

322
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:04,436
Why? Are you going to die abroard?

323
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:07,846
He's too mean.

324
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,826
Why is he avoiding me?

325
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,236
Why aren't you coming?

326
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:18,786
Why aren't you contacting me?

327
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:31,375
Open the door! I'm in front of your house!
Why are you avoiding me?

328
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:34,746
Come out! I know you're inside!

329
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:38,855
You're not coming out?

330
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:43,135
If you don't come out, I'm
going to blow this out!

331
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:46,935
Do you know what this is? It's
a very long and big candle.

332
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:49,715
I'm going to blow it out. I can't
assure you where I'll do it.

333
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:53,996
I'll summon you at a place
where you'll be embarrassed.

334
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:07,016
Do I still have to wait for now?

335
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:12,606
How long do I have to wait for now?

336
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:59,766
- It's been a while.
- You haven't aged at all.

337
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:11,645
I told you 4 was the answer to problem
#17, but you still wrote down 2.

338
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:16,616
No matter how much I solved it, it turned out
to be 2. Even though I knew the correct answer.

339
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:20,045
So I couldn't write down 4.

340
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,035
That was a problem I couldn't solve.

341
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:27,506
No. You solved it very well.

342
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:31,415
In your life, only your decisions
are the correct answer.

343
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:35,196
Ah. It was that kind of problem.

344
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:40,355
I see you became a lawyer. You
helped a lot of people in need.

345
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:43,735
I wanted to pay you back for
the sandwich you gave me then.

346
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:47,465
And I didn't have any other choices.

347
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,686
I knew you were there.

348
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:57,495
Ordinary people don't
forget miraculous moments.

349
00:28:57,496 --> 00:28:59,106
I know.

350
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,995
I gave thousands of people sandwiches.

351
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:07,946
But it's rare to see someone
who progresses like you.

352
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:13,696
Ordinary people stay in that miraculous moment
and ask for another moment of assistance.

353
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:17,226
"I know you're there."

354
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,516
As if they left their miracles up to me.

355
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:26,055
You changed your own life.

356
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:29,476
For that reason, I have
always cheered you on.

357
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:33,756
I knew you would do that.

358
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:37,075
Where am I going now?

359
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,605
You can leave through the
door you came through.

360
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:41,586
Afterlife is on the other side.

361
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,529
It's obvious that he's
going to a nice place.

362
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,420
I guess. Thanks for today.

363
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,229
Why do you bother doing this?

364
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,979
You don't have to do it.
No one's asking you to.

365
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,950
I don't need to, but if I
don't work, I'm not cool.

366
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,040
Sure, of course.

367
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,019
Where were you? You were not at home.

368
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,759
Did you come to my house?

369
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,359
Why do you avoid me?

370
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,879
Not avoid, I was busy?

371
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,589
You were busy to avoid me. As far as
I know, you don't even have a job.

372
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,620
Otherwise I was

373
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,319
- A girl who got abandoned by her husband?
- What?

374
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,309
Then what? You avoid me because you're a goblin, then avoid me because you're not. You
avoid me because I don't see the sword, then you avoid me because I see the sword.

375
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,059
Really petty, petty

376
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,510
Try to runaway, I will blow all this.

377
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,569
Really pretty.

378
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,849
I am really serious now.

379
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,700
Me too.

380
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,419
You do not have money but where
do you bought all these candles?

381
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,649
Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa

382
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,620
This bum.

383
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:13,369
Can't I just live at your house?
You have plenty of vacant rooms.

384
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,839
How do you know, rooms are empty or not?

385
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,949
Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa.
This bummm...

386
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,139
You said "wait for now." "For now" usually
means about an hour to half a day, at most.

387
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,149
But how many days passed. in the meantime,
It rained. Because of me, were you sad?

388
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,179
No.

389
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,410
You can tell me.

390
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:39,070
I've been preparing myself these past few days.
I'm determined to take in whatever you say.

391
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,530
Why are you getting determined?

392
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm the one who should be determined.

393
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,969
What determination?

394
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,760
You do not need to know.

395
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,160
Did you have dinner?

396
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,310
Why? Did you eat it?

397
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,399
Now that you know that I can see
the sword, I can't see you.

398
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,980
I didn't tell you to be like this.

399
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,960
What kind of determination do you have to make?
Don't do it alone but let's do it together!

400
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,149
Do you want some steak? Should
I order a room service?

401
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,380
Looking at you, changing subject
I am going to let it go.

402
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,330
I don't feel like cow today.
Let's eat something else.

403
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,480
All the expensive things in the room
were enticing me but I didn't give in.

404
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,280
This is it.

405
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:46,280
Will that be enough?

406
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,770
Choose anything that you want.

407
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,760
I can buy you everything
from here to there.

408
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,330
In a single payment.

409
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,899
Stand up straight. How can two
cans of beer make you like this?

410
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,060
Should I buy you toothbrushes?
From here to here.

411
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,531
Tadah!

412
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,110
Extra fine brushes.

413
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,149
Can you please just go. Go.

414
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,310
I don't want to. I will take you home.

415
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,809
Am I really your bride?

416
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,989
Yeah.

417
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,609
Then I can't meet with another man?

418
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:45,250
I don't want to recommend it.

419
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,359
Then what are you going to
do about my third wish?

420
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,410
Part-time job, my aunt's
family, boyfriend. Boyfriend.

421
00:34:54,390 --> 00:35:00,989
In this lifetime, that will never happen.
Don't put your hopes up.

422
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,319
Why?

423
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,649
Because I don't like it.

424
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,380
Where is there such a thing?
Do you like me?

425
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
No.

426
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,750
Your "no" isn't necessarily a no.

427
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,799
How did you live until now? Doing what?

428
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,540
I lived waiting for you.

429
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,009
Be quiet.

430
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,130
I said it quietly.

431
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,469
Then, if you're depressed it rains.
What happens when you feel good?

432
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,559
Pass.

433
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,390
Don't tell me flowers are
going to bloom or something.

434
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,839
No. Next question.

435
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,019
Can you fly?
- That's a piece of cake.

436
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,210
Show me next time.

437
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,870
I will.

438
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,090
I... what place bride am I?

439
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,780
You're the first and last.

440
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,290
Let's say it's the first but how
do you know it'll be the last?

441
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:29,041
Because I've decided it to be.

442
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,079
What if... I decided not to
be your bride, what happens?

443
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,180
Ahh...

444
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,280
Then this sword won't get pulled out.

445
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,880
Only you could do it. You need
to take this sword out for me...

446
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,070
for me...

447
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,839
to be pretty. I'm not pretty now.

448
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,699
Ahhh. Is it that?

449
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:24,869
In fairy tales, the cursed prince meets his
true love and turns back to himself, that?

450
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,549
In the frog prince, from frog to prince. From
Beauty and the Beast, from beast to prince.

451
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,740
For a goblin, from a goblin to a broo...

452
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,510
Let's pull it out some other time.
At the moment, when we need a broom.

453
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:46,850
You have no idea. I'm the crazy one
for laughing at this situation.

454
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,650
Fine. Some other time, then.

455
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,970
Not today. Today let's just laugh with you.

456
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,389
When the first snow comes?

457
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,610
First snow?

458
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,020
You need a broom then.

459
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
When the first snow comes.

460
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,199
When will the first snow come this year?

461
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,339
It looks good, really.

462
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,920
Let's take it together.

463
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,830
What's that?

464
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,759
Something good must have
happened last night.

465
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,689
In this autumn, and in a matter of
a day, flowers this big are just

466
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,399
crazily... bloomed beautifully.

467
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,449
Rain and snow can be explained as a change in weather.
What will you do about the flowers? You drank, didn't you?

468
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:27,319
"What are you going to do about the flowers?" "Flowers" "Uncle
you drank, right?" All those three things you said informally.

469
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,810
Should we just comfortably be brothers?

470
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,040
Should we? Hyung what did you do last ni-
- You insolent!

471
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,380
Just say that you don't remember!

472
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:35,830
What are you going to do?

473
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,479
It's not because of the alcohol but because of the
antidepressant. It's time for me to stop taking...

474
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,169
Why are you suddenly lowering your voice?

475
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,600
You won't even know if I tell you.

476
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,920
What is this?

477
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,180
It's a vacant seat. Let's sit there.

478
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,939
How could we meet in a place like this?
- Who?

479
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,600
It's the last episode. I can't miss the
last episode of the morning drama.

480
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:18,621
<i>Everyone lives with at least
a wound in their hearts.</i>

481
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,089
<i>Wound? Do you even know what that is?</i>

482
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,439
<i>Death is the only way I'll leave you.</i>

483
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,450
I asked you to buy snacks
last night, right?

484
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,570
No.

485
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,749
Don't think lightly but think properly.

486
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,149
Just wake up from your hangover.

487
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,939
You can't remember? With two cans of beer?

488
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,319
It's not because of alcohol
but because of the medicine.

489
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,650
Uncle, what's wrong with you?
You're scaring me.

490
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,929
Is there something there?

491
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,249
<i>Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter.</i>

492
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,949
<i>What?</i>

493
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,239
Daebak!

494
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,939
It's her daughter?

495
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,220
Oh my! I really did not know!

496
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,230
You're going home, right?

497
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,640
Are you finally suprised that
Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter?

498
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,949
What is this? What kind of memory is this?

499
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,799
What is? What is it?

500
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,119
<i>What if... I said I wasn't going to
be the bride. What would happen?</i>

501
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,350
<i>This sword can't be pulled out.
Only you can pull it out.</i>

502
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,040
Ah, you crazy goblin! Agh!!

503
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,929
- What should I do?
- Why? What's the matter?

504
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,050
I told her about taking out the sword!

505
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,919
Uncle, what are you looking at?
Are you ill?

506
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,219
Since it turned out like this, think it's for
the better. It good even if you die now.

507
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,580
Just try talking like that.
I'll burn your hat down!

508
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,939
I don't know him. He's a stranger.
A total stranger.

509
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,680
Work hard. I'm going first.

510
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,409
Ah, Uncle, what's the matter with you?

511
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,720
Who are you? Do you know me?

512
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,279
Uncle! Wow, during that
ruckus, he heard that?

513
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,430
Uncle!

514
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,329
Even if you smear crap all over
your face, it'll be pretty!

515
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:40,169
It's all in the past. "If you
cherish it, it becomes poop."

516
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,279
What are you talking about?
It's still fine. It's okay.

517
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,299
Unni. What's that shadow?
It's so pigmented.

518
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,459
Please give me one of those.

519
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,719
Yes. Please come this way.

520
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,779
I got you a purchase.

521
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,389
Thanks.

522
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,659
Do you have an appointment today? Where
are you going, looking so pretty?

523
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,469
Perhaps, did you get a boyfriend?

524
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,789
I'm looking pretty and waiting
for a call so I can get one.

525
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,269
But it's not coming. Why is that?

526
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,279
He must be pushing and pulling with you.
<i>[Playing hard to get]</i>

527
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,880
Did he get pushed? But I pulled.

528
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:35,309
But owner, why do you always look out the
window? Is there something out there?

529
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,799
I'm waiting.

530
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,999
For what?

531
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,299
I don't know. I'm always
just waiting for someone.

532
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,889
A customer?

533
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,230
No. Sir.

534
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,859
A prince charming on a white horse?

535
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,769
I don't like younger men.

536
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,220
Since it came to this, it would be
better if it's a king on a white horse.

537
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,939
You're the only one without
a name on the tombstone.

538
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,019
<i>[Yoo Jeong Woo]
[Don't bother this Goryeo person's rest]</i>

539
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,600
<i>[Yoo Seo Won]
[I hope the dirt over you is light]</i>

540
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,820
What is it? Did you pick it up?

541
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,769
Someone gave it to me. Hand it over.

542
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:46,559
Who did? That man who drove you this morning
or that old man in front of your house?

543
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,839
You are really so diverse.

544
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,009
Do you know what this name
card is before saying things?

545
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,449
It's written in there.
Chairman of Yoo Shin.

546
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,009
Exactly. He's deceiving you, dumbass.

547
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,079
Did that man tell you he's
close with the Chairman?

548
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,630
Let her be. As if she would be scared.

549
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,410
Why?

550
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,040
What?

551
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,750
Aren't you going to look down?

552
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,789
What is this?

553
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,249
What is this cigarette?

554
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,290
Right. It's your first time
seeing a cigarette, right?

555
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,789
You must be crazy!

556
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,459
In the school. Even more, in the classroom.

557
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,849
Teacher. No.

558
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,860
Hey, hand me a lighter.

559
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,040
What did I just say?

560
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:44,869
Lighter? You really won't do.

561
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,549
Come out. Follow me.

562
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:52,929
Teacher, no. This isn't mine.
This is Ji Eun Tak's!

563
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,339
She was going to smoke it, so I took it from
her! Search her. I said this was Ji Eun Tak's!

564
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,749
Hey, Park Seo Jin. That is yours.

565
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,389
Ji Eun Tak doesn't even smoke, just stop.

566
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,709
Hey class president, are you crazy?
Do you want to die?

567
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:12,339
You are the one who wants to die. You. You
know where the faculty room is, right? Go.

568
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,890
Go.

569
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,170
Straight.

570
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,059
Revenge on the girl that bullied you.
Blood revenge.

571
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,299
I did it.

572
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,809
That btch was so mean.
That feels so refreshing.

573
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,399
Hey. You say you're lonely. Why
don't you take her with you?

574
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,929
How could you say mean things? I
won't take that girl if I was dead...

575
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,800
Died.

576
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:55,549
If I woke up from dead, I
won't take her, Grandma.

577
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,679
We did well, right?

578
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,530
Hey.

579
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:00,620
I put the cigarette...

580
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,770
Thank you everyone.

581
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,429
I did it.

582
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,499
We'll be going first.

583
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,840
Why? What?

584
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,810
♪ <i>How can I get over you?</i> ♪

585
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,729
I thought you said you
don't go around in cars.

586
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,539
I'm just bragging about my car.

587
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,049
Do you have a license?
- What do you take me for?

588
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,000
I took you for a dunkard last night.

589
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,120
Yesterday, I didn't make
any mistakes, right?

590
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,409
You don't remember?

591
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,480
Can't you see that I regretfully
remember averything?

592
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,979
Have you had hangover soup?
Aren't you hungry?

593
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,039
Why do you ask me whenever you see me?
Can't you eat before seeing me?

594
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,049
It's because I want to eat with you.
If you don't want to then don't.

595
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,309
What do you want to eat together? Cow?

596
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:25,240
Cow? I haven't even thought of it
and I think it's such a good idea.

597
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,310
Stay here for a while.

598
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,800
We're here. Get off.

599
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:55,940
This is my way of saying
thanks for the maple leaf.

600
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:59,190
Daebak. You took me to the maple
nation for giving you maple leaf.

601
00:49:59,191 --> 00:50:01,380
Ahjussi, is this a honeymoon?

602
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,700
Get back in. Let's go back.

603
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:07,040
No. Let's go this way. I know Quebec well.

604
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,690
As if you know. Cow is this way.

605
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:12,271
Huh? What did you say?

606
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,531
Thank you for the meal.

607
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:30,471
There's a lot of swords.

608
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:34,800
Put that down and talk.

609
00:50:34,801 --> 00:50:37,390
Look at him all scared.

610
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:38,960
Eat. I thought you were hungry.

611
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:40,050
Yes.

612
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:43,930
That... as you eat, listen to what I
say without any misunderstandings.

613
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:46,791
It's because I am really curious.

614
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:55,210
This sword, what does the handle look like?

615
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:59,831
Are you doubting me?

616
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:06,400
Why are you getting mad? I'm just the cautious
type to make certain about these kinds of things.

617
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:08,711
That's called doubting.

618
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:16,340
The handle... there's a tiger.

619
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:21,480
Right? A white tiger. It's
really cool, isn't it?

620
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,501
Of course.

621
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:29,980
But then, I found out more about you.

622
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:32,640
But no matter how hard I find,
I couldn't find about that.

623
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:34,410
What about?

624
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:37,011
About being stabbed with a sword.

625
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:41,810
Why did that happen? Did you
do it yourself? Others?

626
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:45,161
By someone who I never
thought would do it to me.

627
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:52,481
It's a really painful story.

628
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:59,330
Then, nevermind. What about your age?
How old exactly are you?

629
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,371
939 years old.

630
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:08,641
I see it's a more painful story. I'm sorry.

631
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:14,800
But still... it must be
nice to live so long.

632
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:19,901
You don't age, you have a lot of money
and you meet your bride like this.

633
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:25,080
Do you want to live long? Even if you're the only one
that's staying the same and everything else flows?

634
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:27,550
I have you though.

635
00:52:27,551 --> 00:52:32,751
Since you will always be there so I
think living long would be okay.

636
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:49,201
You're awfully cheerful for someone
who has such a traumatic story.

637
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:55,201
It's been almost a thousand years. I
can't be sad for a thousand years.

638
00:52:56,201 --> 00:53:00,811
I'm just an energetic goblin who humbly
accepts his fate and live cheerfully.

639
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:07,000
Where would you find sadness that
goes on for thousands of years?

640
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:09,561
Where would you find a love that
goes on for thousands of years?

641
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,391
I give one vote that there is one.

642
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:20,100
Which side are you going to put it on?
On sadness or love?

643
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,891
A sad love?

644
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:26,451
If you don't believe me
should we have a bet?

645
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:32,200
What bet? How far did you research?
What else do you know?

646
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:35,400
You have lived alone for a long
time, you are very lonely,

647
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:39,130
fickle, ill-tempered, like
dark and humid places...

648
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:41,390
You researched mainly on bad things...

649
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:44,071
You bring good fortune and
misfortune to people.

650
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:47,150
And you don't make a family.

651
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:49,340
Maybe that's why you left
me alone in the hotel.

652
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:52,320
I was taking appropriate measures.
You should think about it yourself.

653
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:53,840
What thoughts?

654
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:57,210
If you don't want to then you don't
have to. You don't need to force it.

655
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,221
What?
- Being a goblin's bride.

656
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:08,670
What is your motive? The more I hear about it,
I keep noticing you wanting me to hate it.

657
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:13,130
Why are you saying those now? Ah! You
don't want me being the goblin's bride?

658
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:15,210
Or you have another woman?

659
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:18,370
"Even if I have another woman, I
don't like you so don't do it."

660
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:22,240
Seeing the sword, taking the sword out.
That's the order, right?

661
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:26,010
I will prove being the bride
by pulling that sword out.

662
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:27,510
Let's see if you become pretty.

663
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:30,070
Hey! Talk while you're there.

664
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:33,370
Then make me gold bars
with your magic club.

665
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,441
Why should I?

666
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,860
Hey! I don't have a club!

667
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:43,081
You don't have one? How could a
goblin not have a magic club?

668
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:55,960
Wow! The water became a sword!

669
00:54:55,961 --> 00:55:00,061
Wow! So cool!

670
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:03,370
The sword has been
misrepresented as a club.

671
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:09,241
I see. So taht's why they say love quarrels
are like cutting water with a sword.

672
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,791
It's not.

673
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,780
Right. During honeymoon,
it should be water fight.

674
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,371
Stand right there.

675
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,891
Hey!

676
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:36,830
Good for you, winning against a high schooler.
You use your powers to win over a high schooler?

677
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:38,710
Can't I use it then?

678
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,000
Do I not have abilities?

679
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:43,260
You can do all sorts of things

680
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:47,301
Don't have any specials powers other than being able
to see ghosts? Afer all, I'm the goblin's bride.

681
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:57,101
Do you wish you had one?

682
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,291
I want gold to come out this much.

683
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,591
Can you do it?
- No.

684
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:10,700
Stay here and wait.

685
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,840
Why?
- I have something to do.

686
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:16,090
I don't know when I will be back.
You can wait, right?

687
00:56:16,091 --> 00:56:20,271
Ah! And also, since you said
you're always near books.

688
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:24,790
Have it near you.

689
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,850
I will be sad if you leave me behind.

690
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,160
Just so you know.

691
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:30,990
I won't leave you behind.

692
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:33,611
Why? Because I'm the goblin's wife?

693
00:57:10,641 --> 00:57:12,961
Please deliver it to him.

694
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,211
Ahjussi!

695
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,971
<i>Mass is not proportional to volume.</i>

696
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,081
<i>A girl as small as a violet.</i>

697
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:35,331
<i>A girl who moves like a flower petal</i>

698
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:40,081
<i>is pulling me toward her with
more force than Earth's mass.</i>

699
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:52,141
<i>Just then, like Newton's apple,</i>

700
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,911
<i>I rolled toward her without
stopping until I fell on her...</i>

701
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:04,841
<i>With a loud thud.</i>

702
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:09,321
<i>With a thump.</i>

703
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:26,270
The red carpet is daebak! You
were the one who did it, right?

704
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,041
It's so fascinating!

705
00:59:34,531 --> 00:59:36,151
Ahjussi!

706
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:42,271
<i>My heart keeps bouncing between
the sky and the ground.</i>

707
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,061
