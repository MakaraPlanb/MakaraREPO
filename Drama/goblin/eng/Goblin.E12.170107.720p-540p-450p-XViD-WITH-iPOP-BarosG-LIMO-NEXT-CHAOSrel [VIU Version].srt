(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:14,098
I'm so sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,598
I find it hard to walk when there's a crowd.

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,728
You made it before I aged a year.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,328
- Shall we go to Bosingak Pavilion?
- Before we do,

7
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:24,928
can we hold hands?

8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,668
Right now? Just like that?

10
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:33,298
I'm too curious to wait.

11
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:43,268
Human's are strange beings. I want to play hard to get.

12
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,198
Do you want to hold my hand?

13
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:47,768
Yes.

14
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:49,228
Me, too.

15
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:54,198
I wan to hold your hand and hug you.

16
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:00,428
But I should at least know...

17
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,468
whose hand I'm holding and who I'm hugging.

18
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:06,968
You haven't answered my question yet.

19
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,228
What exactly are you, Woo Bin?

20
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:13,168
You haven't yet told me how you know my real name.

21
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:16,468
I'll only let you off the hook this year.

22
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:19,868
It'll be next year in just two hours.

23
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:43,007
Is it too much to ask?

24
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:46,947
I apologize.

25
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:53,807
Okay.

26
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:59,007
Shall we call it quits?

27
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,277
You pushed me away from the cars...

28
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:07,077
and I liked watching you solve math problems with a pencil.

29
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,947
It was all good,

30
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,377
but I can't do it anymore.

31
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,577
Let's say you dumped me.

32
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:18,377
Don't call me from now on.

33
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,607
Even if we meet by chance, don't say hi.

34
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,277
Happy New Year.

35
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,301
Let's start our romantic night again.

36
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,571
Is it still romantic?

37
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,941
Even more than before.

38
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,541
A dimly lit bar.

39
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,671
Simple foods.

40
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,841
Bitter soju.

41
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:07,071
A cruel fight.

42
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,901
Romance is everywhere.

43
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,871
If there was just one more thing, it would be perfect.

44
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,271
What?

45
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,241
First kiss.

46
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:20,371
- What?
- That was just a peck last time.

47
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:23,071
You can't move, okay?

48
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:39,971
Meanie.

49
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,171
You...

50
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,271
Did you forget I'm the goblin's bride?

51
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,071
It doesn't work on me.

52
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,241
In other words, you cannot avoid it.

53
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,501
I wasn't avoiding it.

54
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,771
It was hard enough avoiding it the first time.

55
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,271
Perfect.

56
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,325
There is something I didn't tell you.

57
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,295
I saw her past.

58
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,625
- You said it's a secret.
- I think...

59
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,325
she's the reincarnation of your sister.

60
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,865
Are you sure it's Sunny and not you?

61
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,025
Sunny's face in her previous life...

62
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:14,165
matches the face of that woman...

63
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:20,625
on the scroll you have.

64
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:24,865
Are you sure?

65
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:27,795
What did you see?

66
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,065
The woman I saw...

67
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,795
was standing in the middle of a palace.

68
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:38,865
She was dressed in white and looked noble.

69
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,565
She took an arrow to her heart...

70
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,095
and collapsed as she bled.

71
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,395
I told you those things.

72
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,525
Maybe not about her clothes...

73
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,935
or about the arrow...

74
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,865
What else? Did you see anything else?

75
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,765
She was on a palanquin and she smiled at someone...

76
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:10,225
through a small window.

77
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,525
Smiling, she asked,

78
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,025
- "Do I..."
- Do I look pretty today?

79
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:23,995
A voice answered to her.

80
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,265
- "You look..."
- You look ugly.

81
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,325
Is she...

82
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:43,625
really your sister?

83
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,495
Yes.

84
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,964
He's a new face.

85
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:28,534
He's the one who has been roaming about for a long time.

86
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,064
Oh, that one.

87
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,464
20 years ago,

88
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:34,064
he even escaped from a grim reaper after confronting one.

89
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,694
I think it's been about 20 years.

90
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,564
I came across a deceased soul...

91
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,894
and I had no information on it.

92
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,864
Really? I had a similar experience when I was nine...

93
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,534
It seemed like it had been roaming about for a long time.

94
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,794
It seemed fearless.

95
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,594
I never saw a deceased soul who didn't fear a grim reaper.

96
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:54,864
I thought it was strange.

97
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,734
Nice to meet you.

98
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:57,604
So you are the goblin's bride.

99
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:18,104
Yes, same here.

100
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:22,834
You shouldn't make yourselves at home in someone's place of business.

101
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,434
You'll keep the customers from coming.

102
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,664
It's time to do business, so please leave.

103
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:28,894
Cold-hearted brat.

104
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,164
You first. Hurry.

105
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:32,934
Unfriendly brat!

106
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:18,694
He felt...

107
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,464
In my 20 years of seeing ghosts,

108
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,794
I've never seen anything like it.

109
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:28,864
Let's forget.

110
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:31,894
I'm too busy to think about ghosts.

111
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:36,894
If I take all the classes within four days,

112
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,264
I'll have to start work later.

113
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,494
Like this?

114
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,194
A love letter? You're so annoying.

115
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,594
I'm too busy just trying to survive, and you wrote a love letter?

116
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,694
I am...

117
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,464
a grim reaper.

118
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,264
I want to see him.

119
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:28,994
I don't want to see him.

120
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:31,864
I want to see him.

121
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,394
How is it always exactly seven shots?

122
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:47,194
I know it'll end exactly after seven shots,

123
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:49,764
but started with "I want to see him."

124
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,734
I want to see him.

125
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:57,794
I don't want to see him.

126
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:00,334
I want to see him.

127
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:07,334
Have you ever been hit by peach flowers?

128
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:08,594
I have.

129
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:11,034
I got a beating at a shaman's house.

130
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,834
That scars for a while.

131
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,064
The previous ones were better.

132
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,164
Right? They were, right?

133
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,664
Have you...

134
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:24,594
ever wanted to get your memory back?

135
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:28,234
No.

136
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:30,834
What is a memory you've forgotten?

137
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,894
It's like a memory that you never had.

138
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,164
You never had it anyway, so why?

139
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:51,734
I...

140
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,764
miss it.

141
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,164
Don't.

142
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,294
We are all sinners.

143
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,694
We don't know what that longing will bring.

144
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,134
I know.

145
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:05,864
I know it.

146
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:10,534
Each time I long for it,

147
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,794
I don't know where it's going to take me,

148
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,494
and it dreads me.

149
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,294
But...

150
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,534
I still miss it.

151
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,764
It looks like you're drinking too much today.

152
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:46,364
I got caught. Sunny found out that I am a grim reaper.

153
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:49,334
Good job.

154
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,464
Where did she get...

155
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:54,964
a branch of peach flowers in the middle of winter?

156
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:02,664
Exactly.

157
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,164
What do I do now?

158
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,364
She must be very confused.

159
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,594
What are you worried about?

160
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,564
Since you already got caught, you should hold her hands.

161
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:10,964
And see if you see my face.

162
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,534
I said I got caught.

163
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,264
So casually hold her hand and see if you see me.

164
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:17,864
You are greatly mistaken.

165
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,364
Do you know how hard it is to see one's past life?

166
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,894
It comes to you as if someone is suddenly pushing it inside you.

167
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:27,094
When the lady in the picture came to life, she was so beautiful.

168
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,594
And her beauty totally made me go mad.

169
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,864
She's my sister.

170
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,534
So...

171
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:38,534
I did see one young and foolish face.

172
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,694
It was that young king.

173
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:42,264
My foolish sister must've only thought about him.

174
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,094
She doesn't care about her brother at all.

175
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,794
I'm here. What is it?

176
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,994
It's nothing. I'll come next time.

177
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:58,064
Give it to me. Don't look at my notebook.

178
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,364
Why did you write about me then?

179
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:02,994
What is this?

180
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:04,994
Did you forge a document again behind my back?

181
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:07,164
Stop pretending not to know what it is.

182
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,864
It's a love letter. It's a love letter you wrote.

183
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,194
Did he write a love letter?

184
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:13,564
He did for his first love.

185
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:17,164
I wanted to know how it ended and see how special it was.

186
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:19,694
I was going to ask for your help.

187
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,434
Do you know what it's about? It's not a love letter.

188
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:23,764
Whatever.

189
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,594
It was very well-written.

190
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,894
"One day after 100 years..."

191
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:30,694
"When the weather is good enough."

192
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,794
- That's not it.
- That is it.

193
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,734
Deok Hwa read everything to me.

194
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,064
"One day after 100 years..."

195
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,864
"When the weather is good enough."

196
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:40,964
That's impossible.

197
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,464
Deok Hwa could never read this.

198
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,064
That wasn't written anywhere.

199
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,864
I've been keeping it to myself.

200
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,894
One day after 100 years...

201
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,664
When the weather is good enough,

202
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,034
I hope I'll be able to...

203
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,934
tell her she was my first love.

204
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,564
Right. That's not it.

205
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,534
That can't be right.

206
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,994
Deok Hwa interpreted it for me.

207
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,064
It's a love letter.

208
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,964
When...

209
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:11,834
you blew away tens of cars,

210
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,334
did you tell Deok Hwa...

211
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:16,234
that I could help people forget?

212
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:17,464
No.

213
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,364
Come with me.

214
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,534
How did he know and...

215
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,134
ask me to come along?

216
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,294
Actually,

217
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:30,834
Deok Hwa found me the maple leaf.

218
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,694
I had lost it.

219
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,634
Guess where this leaf is from.

220
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:37,294
What's going on?

221
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,464
That's impressive.

222
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:45,764
That's impressive.

223
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:50,034
Why didn't I realize sooner?

224
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,964
He even dared to put the goblin's house in the market.

225
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:15,594
I don't know if it was the king, the divinity, or me.

226
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,934
This letter means "to hear".

227
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,234
I found her, She's at the ski resort right now.

228
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:29,064
That's because your boss was his sister in their past lives.

229
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:30,934
Shall we...

230
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:33,994
have a drink?

231
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:38,194
Finally, the goblin met the goblin's bride.

232
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:39,664
It's a destiny.

233
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,434
What about Yeo?

234
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,234
How could you make them meet?

235
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,634
One with a sword in his chest and the man who did it to him.

236
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,964
What brings you to my house?

237
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:50,964
Do you live here?

238
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:52,834
That's a destiny too.

239
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:55,334
He was looking for a house anyway.

240
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,064
You need to take down a notch.

241
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:58,734
What on earth are you thinking?

242
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,594
I love him particularly.

243
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:03,364
It's been 900 years since Kim Shin has been punished.

244
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:04,364
Is that still not enough?

245
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,864
That's how substantial one's life is.

246
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,734
Why didn't you create a perfect world...

247
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,634
without a sin in the first place?

248
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,234
Then nobody would look for the almighty.

249
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:29,994
Every child was conceived with love.

250
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:31,164
Stop torturing them.

251
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:33,494
Get rid of the hands that are covering his eyes.

252
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,164
Let them recognize each other.

253
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,834
Let them make their own decision.

254
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:38,964
It's too bad.

255
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:40,864
I loved him for his good looks.

256
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,464
They are finally here.

257
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,164
Deok Hwa.

258
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:49,634
Who are you?

259
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,334
Let's introduce each other.

260
00:19:54,764 --> 00:19:57,464
Please, no...

261
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,734
Please...

262
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,964
Don't pray to anyone. The almighty is not listening.

263
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:04,434
"The almighty is still not listening."

264
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:06,594
You were whining.

265
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,864
"The almighty must have had his reason for erasing my memory."

266
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:14,534
I will live whether or not I remember my memories.

267
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,064
The almighty must have his reasons.

268
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,494
You were guessing my intention.

269
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,464
I was always listening.

270
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,034
You were pleading for death, so I gave you a chance.

271
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:25,304
But...

272
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,664
why are you still alive?

273
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,094
I never erased your memory.

274
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:33,194
You chose to have your memory erased and yet,

275
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:38,064
you think it's the almighty's plan or mistake?

276
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:42,464
The almighty simply questions.

277
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:44,464
Fate is the question I throw.

278
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:45,464
You...

279
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,494
can find the answer.

280
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:54,334
You can say bye...

281
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,364
to this boy too.

282
00:20:58,094 --> 00:20:59,194
Well, then.

283
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,134
I'll get going then.

284
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,464
Why are you two here?

285
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,494
When did you come?

286
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,094
Why am I on the floor?

287
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:52,934
No way.

288
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:55,564
Did I just black out?

289
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,034
But I just had one drink.

290
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:02,164
Whoever you are,

291
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,194
let me hit you once.

292
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:06,834
Why would you hit him?

293
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,764
He doesn't have anything to do with it.

294
00:22:08,764 --> 00:22:10,164
Are you siding with him?

295
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:13,694
I'm sorry I kept asking you to go somewhere with me.

296
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:14,734
What?

297
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,764
What's wrong with him?

298
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:18,464
Are you serious?

299
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:20,564
Are you really Deok Hwa?

300
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:24,264
He's a butterfly. A butterfly.

301
00:22:24,264 --> 00:22:25,364
You must be drunk.

302
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:26,834
Come here. Come here!

303
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,794
Let go of me. Let me talk to him.

304
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,264
Let go of me. Let go.

305
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:36,234
It's hot. It's hot.

306
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:40,864
It's really good.

307
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:42,464
It turns out he's a grim reaper.

308
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:47,034
How did you find out?

309
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,564
How did you find out?

310
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:51,994
I witnessed a very strange moment.

311
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,734
We happened...

312
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,094
to cross paths a few times in my life.

313
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,034
Sorry I didn't tell you.

314
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,894
For a grim reaper, Woo Bin's...

315
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,094
really sweet, gentle, and...

316
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:07,094
Does he have a clingy ghost ex-girlfriend?

317
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,864
That was the first thought I had.

318
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:13,434
We aren't a good match. I'm way out of his league.

319
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,834
We live in two separate worlds.

320
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,594
How did you think of that?

321
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:20,864
I even had this thought.

322
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:25,034
If he's a grim reaper, then the man who says he's my brother...

323
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,734
must have really lived for nearly 1,000 years.

324
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:32,494
Is that true? Are you the wife of the goblin?

325
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,294
Technically speaking, I am his wife,

326
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:37,864
but I'm the breadwinner.

327
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:39,694
This is insane.

328
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:42,864
Boss.

329
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:45,294
Even if you hang out outside of our house,

330
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,994
it's very unlikely that you'll see Woo Bin.

331
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,164
He works late very often.

332
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,634
Give him a call.

333
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,464
How can I when he suggested we break up?

334
00:23:54,464 --> 00:23:58,234
I'd force myself to take his call if he were to contact me first.

335
00:23:58,694 --> 00:23:59,934
Just play along.

336
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,164
Okay.

337
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,164
Boss, I'm really sorry but...

338
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,894
Sure, do what you want.

339
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,764
I didn't say anything yet.

340
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:11,494
You're in college now and you want to work different hours.

341
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:12,894
That's incredible.

342
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:18,294
You're a real human being, right?

343
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:28,294
Welcome.

344
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:39,594
It's been a while since I got startled by a human.

345
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:41,294
Me, too.

346
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,434
Why are we eating chicken anyway?

347
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,864
The owner lives in the flat beneath mine.

348
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,894
We should help our neighbours.

349
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:50,964
Let's eat up and get going.

350
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:53,894
Early January is the busiest time of year.

351
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:59,294
Enjoy your meal.

352
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,294
We didn't order this.

353
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,334
It's on the house. It's a new menu. You guys have a tough job.

354
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:06,994
Thanks so much for noticing.

355
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,464
It tastes delicious.

356
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:14,164
What's the matter?

357
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:16,994
- Eat up.
- I'll dip it first.

358
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:26,994
How dare a ghost appear in front of a grim reaper?

359
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:28,634
It has been a while.

360
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:32,734
I see you have been living as a grim reaper.

361
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,894
What are you talking about? Do you know me?

362
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,694
- I do.
- You can't trick me.

363
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:41,494
Do you not want to know who I am?

364
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:45,134
And why I am so fearless as I stand here before you?

365
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,194
But most importantly,

366
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:53,094
do you not want to know who you are?

367
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,564
Go and hold the woman's hand.

368
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,094
I'm talking about the owner of the restaurant you just left.

369
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:08,534
People who committed serious crimes are born again as grim reapers.

370
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,664
She will show you what you did.

371
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:12,834
And also...

372
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:17,064
what part I played in it.

373
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,434
I never erased your memory.

374
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,534
You chose to have your memory erased and yet,

375
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:34,434
you think it's the almighty's plan or mistake?

376
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,694
What are you thinking about?

377
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,364
Something I shouldn't think about.

378
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:49,094
Why are you doing what you know you shouldn't?

379
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:52,234
If I don't do it today, I might do it tomorrow.

380
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:56,164
Don't do that. It's a bad time.

381
00:26:57,064 --> 00:27:01,594
We got a warning from the top because of the Janghang-dong case.

382
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:03,994
What did they say?

383
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:07,494
"Remember that you are sinners."

384
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,864
It's so confusing and worrying.

385
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:13,294
Here are this month's name cards.

386
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,434
Was I given an answer...

387
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,294
or a question?

388
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:20,964
I gave you name cards.

389
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:41,364
I'm home.

390
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:48,294
He has three hours.

391
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:51,594
Cause of death is cardiac arrest.

392
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,994
You should say goodbye.

393
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:56,664
I said all I wanted to during our lifetime.

394
00:27:58,364 --> 00:27:59,864
I don't want to see him...

395
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,364
feel sorry for me or be apologetic.

396
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:08,864
See him off for me.

397
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:11,194
I will.

398
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:13,534
Tell him to be born again.

399
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,664
In his next life,

400
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:21,664
tell him not to serve any man and to be free.

401
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,894
Tell him I thank him.

402
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:29,294
That I was very grateful.

403
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,864
What is going on?

404
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:53,994
Prepare a black outfit. You'll hear of Chairman Yu's death.

405
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:58,364
Check on him every now and then.

406
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,494
You're so mean, you don't know how I feel

407
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:10,934
This is unbearable. My back hurts.

408
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:14,934
Just wait until I'm CEO.

409
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:18,364
I'll come here every day, drag everyone out to dinner,

410
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:20,364
and check their work.

411
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:24,364
I'll compliment your worst outfit and make you wear it forever.

412
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,734
- Deok Hwa.
- What?

413
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,494
Did Grandpa tell you to watch me from up close?

414
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:34,494
You need to come with me. Right now.

415
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,264
I don't get off work for hours.

416
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:38,834
I brought your suit. Change in the car.

417
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:42,364
What suit?

418
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:41,094
The man whose every second on this earth was good...

419
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:43,664
Here he rests.

420
00:31:44,294 --> 00:31:45,494
Yu Shin Woo.

421
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:54,564
(The man whose every second on this earth was good.)

422
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:59,934
(Here he rests. Yu Shin Woo.)

423
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,641
So this is what it's like...

424
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:35,781
to be immortal.

425
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:44,741
Chairman Yu must keep turning back to look.

426
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:51,081
He'd be worried about you.

427
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:55,381
That's why...

428
00:32:56,581 --> 00:32:58,041
the ones left behind...

429
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,611
should live even harder.

430
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,181
We might cry from time to time,

431
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,141
but we should smile a lot...

432
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,211
and cheer up.

433
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,051
You're...

434
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:18,811
obligated to do that in return for the love you received.

435
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,311
Would you like...

436
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,941
something to warm you up?

437
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:38,481
I'll have something...

438
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,381
with Deok Hwa when he's back.

439
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:00,811
What do I do now?

440
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,511
I didn't get to treat him well.

441
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:07,711
How can he leave me...

442
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:12,181
making me feeling guilty like this?

443
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:17,611
How can I keep living while feeling sorry to him?

444
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:25,481
What do I do now?

445
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,011
How will I live alone?

446
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,281
You're not alone.

447
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,081
Uncle.

448
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,311
You have me.

449
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,111
You and I will be together,

450
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,181
so don't worry.

451
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,811
Uncle...

452
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,881
You should get up and eat something.

453
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,111
Come on, these apples look like rabbits.

454
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,911
Do you want me to make you gold?

455
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,911
Do you want me to walk through walls?

456
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:23,411
Deok Hwa, you can have my camera.

457
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:25,411
I know you wanted it.

458
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:31,441
Forget it. My grandpa got it for you.

459
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,841
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

460
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:40,381
I should have given you time to get yourself together.

461
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:41,711
I regret it.

462
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,911
However, there's order in this world.

463
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,011
I know.

464
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,711
We've been tending a goblin for generations.

465
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,811
Thank you, everyone.

466
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:01,411
I have to go do something.

467
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,281
I thought he might be bothered by this.

468
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,551
You know what he's like.

469
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:23,511
I do.

470
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,641
Mr. Kim has been appointed as the CEO.

471
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,511
Grandpa had everything prepared before he left.

472
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,511
I'm glad.

473
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:35,211
I'm not ready yet.

474
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,941
Right.

475
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,481
I'll start learning the work from the ground up.

476
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:49,681
I bet that's what he would have wanted.

477
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:53,641
- Okay.
- I'll also...

478
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,211
start learning go.

479
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:02,411
Then I'll become your brother, your father,

480
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,681
then your grandfather.

481
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,381
Just like my grandfather.

482
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:13,811
All right.

483
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,441
(Yu Deok Hwa)

484
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:40,441
(Kim Do Young)

485
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,341
If someone...

486
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:52,841
by the last name Kim and first name Shin comes to you...

487
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:56,281
and says that he is here to retrieve his belongings,

488
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,411
give it to him.

489
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:01,781
All I've left behind belongs to him.

490
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:04,711
He will come to you through rain...

491
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:07,411
and leave as a blue flame.

492
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:10,581
Then you will know it's him.

493
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:31,481
He left, right?

494
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:38,081
Who are... Do you know me?

495
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:41,111
I do. A kid who is nothing but nice.

496
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,841
That's why you light up this world.

497
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:47,911
Remember, your good-nature is what will bring you luck.

498
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,581
Sure.

499
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:52,081
I'm not a kid, though.

500
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:54,211
Do you want to go for a drink?

501
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:56,681
You can go drinking with someone beautiful.

502
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,811
You are beautiful.

503
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,681
You should drink with a human.

504
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:01,811
Bye.

505
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,581
What was that?

506
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,511
Why are you making so much?

507
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:14,781
Deok Hwa is coming.

508
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:18,681
Pass me the pepper.

509
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:23,111
I'm jealous of Deok Hwa. He has an uncle.

510
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,711
Don't mind me.

511
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:29,181
I'm jealous of everyone and I feel empty these days.

512
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,441
Just tell me right out.

513
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:31,841
I know you want an uncle like me.

514
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:34,081
A super handsome uncle.

515
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,051
What is it?

516
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,441
When did you say you became a grim reaper?

517
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:49,111
Over 300 years ago. Why?

518
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,611
Is something on my face?

519
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:58,881
It's just that for a second,

520
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,841
I saw a face I didn't see in you before.

521
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:04,611
Who? What kind of face?

522
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,641
A face I shouldn't see.

523
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,051
Hey. Sit, help, or go to your room.

524
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:32,481
Why are you prowling?

525
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,381
I'm being proud of you for becoming useful.

526
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,611
An heir of a conglomerate...

527
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:42,141
should naturally think that work outside of office hours as training.

528
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:45,711
What is it?

529
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:49,411
(Kim Woo Sik)

530
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:12,011
Today is first day of school. I'm a university student.

531
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,781
There is a freshmen party, so I'm wearing a dress.

532
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:15,841
No.

533
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,381
I'll get going.

534
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:20,141
Deok Hwa will drive you.

535
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,081
I have an appointment today.

536
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:23,581
If something happens...

537
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,911
I know.

538
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,741
Perfect, right?

539
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,111
You forgot something.

540
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,411
I know what it is.

541
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,551
I'm not sure why you would close your eyes.

542
00:41:58,411 --> 00:41:59,581
You're perfect now.

543
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:02,281
Is this the one from Canada?

544
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,051
I'm a bit touched.

545
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:08,311
By the way, what does this mean?

546
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:10,681
It's French for "Fate ordained by the sky".

547
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:14,211
The absolute destiny far beyond the realm of humanity...

548
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,681
That's a word that I like. "Fate".

549
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,681
How did you know?

550
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:27,051
No blind dates. No romance. No Tae Hee.

551
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:30,381
No man is allowed within 30m radius of that necklace.

552
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,381
That's what I make of your fate.

553
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,551
Gosh, that's what I decided to go to college for.

554
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,811
There's no other way. That is the deity's will.

555
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:39,481
You're running late. Go on.

556
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:42,211
I'm off.

557
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:18,081
(Eun Tak)

558
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:21,741
I got to school safely and cheerfully.

559
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:24,311
I'm sending you this so you won't feel so down.

560
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:26,041
Good luck on your appointment.

561
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,581
She's wearing the necklace...

562
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,441
and took the picture well so there aren't any men in it.

563
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,281
Good girl.

564
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:43,941
(Interview for experienced applicants of Chunwoo Group)

565
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:38,841
I shall follow your order.

566
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,011
Please forgive me.

567
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:47,181
I will follow you soon.

568
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,941
We must have missed each other...

569
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:09,211
since I'm still alive.

570
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,981
You must have been very lonely.

571
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:19,041
Please forgive me.

572
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,711
Mr. Kim Woo Sik, Mr. Choi Sang Gil,

573
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,641
and Ms. Lee Ji Yeon, please come in.

574
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:31,681
Okay.

575
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:43,441
I passed?

576
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,411
Thank you. Thank you so much.

577
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:51,511
Honey.

578
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:53,741
I passed.

579
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,681
Dad!

580
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:58,011
Come here.

581
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,081
Should we order jjajangmyeon?

582
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:06,641
This is the residence the company offers.

583
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:08,941
For me?

584
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:10,841
Yes. You did well on the interview.

585
00:46:13,611 --> 00:46:15,511
This is the car the company offers.

586
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:17,081
For me?

587
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:19,611
Yes. You did very well on the interview.

588
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:20,981
Gosh.

589
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:25,011
This is the name of your son who will be born on the first of May.

590
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:28,341
He will bring light to this world generation after generation.

591
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:29,611
My son will?

592
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:30,811
Yes.

593
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:33,711
By the way, who are you?

594
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:35,641
I should have introduced myself sooner.

595
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,581
I'm Kim Do Young, the CEO of Chunwoo Group.

596
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:39,711
You're the CEO?

597
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:41,781
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

598
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:44,041
But... I mean...

599
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:46,711
Why are you giving me more than I deserve?

600
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:48,611
You saved the country in your previous life.

601
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,311
I did?

602
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:52,611
Yes.

603
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:32,381
Hello?

604
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,681
Where are you right now?

605
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,411
Why are you still not home? Do you know how dangerous it is outside?

606
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:38,141
It's 5pm right now.

607
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,281
The sun is still high up.

608
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:45,511
You should go easy on the nagging.

609
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:47,441
What did you say? Where are you right now?

610
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,011
I've been asking since a while ago.

611
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:50,841
Me?

612
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:54,211
You'll be surprised if I tell you.

613
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,481
I'm here in this confined space.

614
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:04,981
Are you kidding me?

615
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:06,741
Over there.

616
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:11,581
- One, two, three.
- Look pretty.

617
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:19,581
It's a good picture.

618
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:22,641
You managed to put on a smile amid the hustle and bustle.

619
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:26,941
When do we get out of here?

620
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:30,541
I don't know. Five minutes later?

621
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,811
Why then?

622
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:36,641
It might get romantic in the meanwhile...

623
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:38,441
in this small and confined room.

624
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:40,541
That won't happen.

625
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:42,211
I'm pretty sure it will.

626
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:49,411
Like this.

627
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:52,581
It's rounded up to 5 dollars and 21 cents.

628
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:54,411
See? Wasn't that romantic?

629
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:59,511
Why would you pay me back in a small and confined room?

630
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:04,781
You should pay my boss back for the sweet potatoes with that money.

631
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:07,011
Did she tell you to urge me?

632
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:11,541
You miss your sister, but my boss is living in the present.

633
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:15,011
It's awkward for you to go see her, but you do miss her. Am I right?

634
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:18,211
You could go there to pay her back.

635
00:49:18,211 --> 00:49:20,581
I'm making you an excuse to go see her.

636
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:23,311
I'm going to work. Do you want to come with me?

637
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:26,611
I do miss her, but she scares me.

638
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:28,181
I'll go some other time.

639
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,341
This is amazing. You two are realistic siblings.

640
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,381
Let's go out now.

641
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,981
What? Already?

642
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,211
Why?

643
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:41,681
It's really cold out.

644
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:44,481
How's school?

645
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:46,141
Do you like it?

646
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:51,741
By the way, Tae Hee is...

647
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:52,981
That son of a...

648
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:55,511
Was I asking about him? I was asking about school.

649
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:57,511
I mean...

650
00:49:57,811 --> 00:50:00,711
Tae Hee is going to the US. Major League Baseball.

651
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:04,341
I read that goblins recognize true talent.

652
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,581
I was going to say that's really cool.

653
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:07,941
I don't want to brag,

654
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:12,211
but I've been able to recognize true talent for a long time.

655
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,941
Hwang Hui was the most significant one.

656
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:16,981
Maeng Sa Sung was something, too.

657
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,581
Sure.

658
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,681
A grown-up is talking here.

659
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:22,211
I'm afraid I'm a busy person.

660
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:25,411
I'm late for work.

661
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:29,211
Look where we are. What are you rambling on about?

662
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:30,711
I'm off to work.

663
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:39,481
Okay. Call me if anything.

664
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:45,511
This is awkward in this small and confined space.

665
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:48,411
Wait, those two mean the same thing.

666
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,541
I want to come here every day.

667
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,211
Wind bomb.

668
00:51:03,211 --> 00:51:04,911
Come over here.

669
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:31,081
It's late. Go straight home.

670
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:32,441
Your grandma is waiting.

671
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:40,611
We meet again.

672
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:44,981
Back there, I did not properly introduce myself.

673
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:49,441
I am Park Joong Won.

674
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:55,511
You look like you know who I am already.

675
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,511
I do not.

676
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:02,311
Kim Shin.

677
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:05,041
Did he not tell you...

678
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,281
that he is the one who killed me?

679
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:12,641
The punishment that was given him...

680
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:15,681
grows in weight like life.

681
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:19,081
The price of my life is in there as well.

682
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,311
What do you want?

683
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,011
Nothing.

684
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,341
I just want to tell you an interesting story.

685
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:38,281
Since you know me, you must know Yeo as well.

686
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,981
The sword in Kim Shin's chest...

687
00:52:40,981 --> 00:52:43,211
was put there by Wang Yeo.

688
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:46,911
The start and end of this tragic fate...

689
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:49,081
was Wang Yeo.

690
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:55,141
Do you know with whom Yeo now lives?

691
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,781
How could I know?

692
00:52:57,881 --> 00:52:59,881
Yeo is living...

693
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,511
with Kim Shin right now.

694
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:08,541
That's absurd.

695
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,081
That is correct.

696
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:14,981
The nameless grim reaper.

697
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:17,711
He is Wang Yeo.

698
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:23,031
What do you think will happen...

699
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,591
if the two of them recognize each other?

700
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:32,355
That is correct.

701
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:35,255
The nameless grim reaper.

702
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:37,985
He is Wang Yeo.

703
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:41,905
What do you think will happen...

704
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:44,465
if the two of them recognize each other?

705
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:49,724
Whether or not Kim Shin kills me...

706
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:52,424
all depends on you now,

707
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:55,754
as his death is in your hands.

708
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:03,124
Come to think of it, you control death.

709
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:04,624
You're wrong.

710
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:10,724
The grim reaper that we know has a name.

711
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,024
Kim Woo Bin.

712
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:27,484
Did you ask what it is that I want?

713
00:54:30,524 --> 00:54:31,654
I...

714
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:35,984
want their demise.

715
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:16,654
Get out of the way. One for the couple.

716
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:18,824
No way. I sat down here first.

717
00:55:26,554 --> 00:55:28,584
Yeo is living...

718
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:32,054
with Kim Shin right now.

719
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:36,284
This is insane.

720
00:55:40,324 --> 00:55:41,624
Missing Soul.

721
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:44,024
What? Darn it.

722
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:50,724
Thanks.

723
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:54,224
I'm sorry for startling you.

724
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:57,484
Why are you here? Did you come on purpose?

725
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:00,654
I felt trapped.

726
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:03,924
I had no one else to talk to.

727
00:56:04,754 --> 00:56:06,024
What is it?

728
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,784
Is it about my boss?

729
00:56:10,354 --> 00:56:11,554
This and that.

730
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:17,354
They say if you commit a great sin in your prior life,

731
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:20,784
you become a grim per.

732
00:56:21,584 --> 00:56:23,754
What sin?

733
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,154
I don't know, either.

734
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:30,984
But I think...

735
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:36,284
I may have been in Shin and...

736
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:40,584
his sister's history.

737
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:46,154
There are three people who committed great sins in history around then.

738
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:50,224
Kim Shin, who cut off the heads of the enemies.

739
00:56:51,754 --> 00:56:56,154
Wang Yeo, who ordered the death of Kim Shin...

740
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:57,754
and his sister.

741
00:56:59,854 --> 00:57:01,784
And the one who led...

742
00:57:02,154 --> 00:57:05,384
Kim Shin and his sister to their grave...

743
00:57:06,324 --> 00:57:07,554
Park Joong Won.

744
00:57:07,984 --> 00:57:11,924
Kim Shin is still alive.

745
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:16,024
and Kim Sun was reincarnated as Sunny.

746
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:20,984
That means I am Wang Yeo...

747
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:25,084
or Park Joong Won.

748
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:28,054
That's is all I've thought about.

749
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,584
The nameless grim reaper.

750
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,754
He is Wang Yeo.

751
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:37,684
But...

752
00:57:39,154 --> 00:57:41,224
regardless of which one I am,

753
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:46,854
I am Shin's enemy, aren't I?

754
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:52,324
Regardless of which one I am,

755
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,284
Sunny and I...

756
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:00,454
cannot be, right?

757
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:23,724
Oh my gosh. I almost hit you.

758
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,584
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

759
00:58:26,854 --> 00:58:29,224
Yes, a little.

760
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:31,424
Sorry, but we're closed.

761
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,954
You're right. Okay then.

762
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:35,954
See you later.

763
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:45,784
Okay. Come back another time.

764
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,384
No. Never.

765
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:56,924
Do not serve her any medicine.

766
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:00,754
Your Majesty reigns over his people,

767
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:02,584
and it's said Your Majesty is controlled by a divinity.

768
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:05,784
Apparently, this divinity refers to Kim Shin.

769
00:59:21,754 --> 00:59:23,454
(Kim Woo Bin)

770
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:32,324
Hello?

771
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:35,324
Let's meet.

772
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:37,824
You wanted to break up.

773
00:59:38,684 --> 00:59:41,154
I'm in front of your home.

774
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:44,754
Wait right there. Is he insane?

775
01:00:06,254 --> 01:00:08,284
How could you just show up like this?

776
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:10,984
I was home, so I have no makeup on.

777
01:00:14,754 --> 01:00:17,084
I came to get my ring back.

778
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:19,424
We still have that excuse left.

779
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:27,624
Why do you look like that?

780
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:30,484
Didn't you come because you missed me?

781
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,124
I did.

782
01:00:34,324 --> 01:00:36,224
- But?
- But...

783
01:00:36,854 --> 01:00:38,954
I am afraid I may be...

784
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,484
a certain somebody.

785
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:46,654
I take a step back.

786
01:00:48,084 --> 01:00:49,754
What are you doing?

787
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:52,324
Everything about me is wrong.

788
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:58,624
I sincerely hope that this choice...

789
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:00,684
is the right one.

790
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:05,424
- Don't do this.
- As I am not alive,

791
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:08,954
I have no name.

792
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:11,284
You...

793
01:01:12,924 --> 01:01:14,054
asked after me.

794
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:19,654
Thank you for that.

795
01:01:21,424 --> 01:01:22,654
I said stop.

796
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:24,484
The kiss of a grim reaper...

797
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:28,554
brings back memories of your previous life.

798
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:32,454
I fear what I was...

799
01:01:33,584 --> 01:01:36,424
in your previous life.

800
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:40,754
But I wish you are left only with good memories.

801
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:44,324
I hope that...

802
01:01:45,824 --> 01:01:48,254
a part of them are memories...

803
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:50,854
of your older brother.

804
01:01:51,484 --> 01:01:52,554
And...

805
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:55,724
I hope that he is...

806
01:01:57,454 --> 01:01:58,884
Kim Shin.

807
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,424
Your brother has returned in triumph again.

808
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:45,754
Between the two of us,

809
01:02:45,854 --> 01:02:47,824
whom do you wish to be alive?

810
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:51,024
- Your Majesty.
- Answer me.

811
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:55,154
Or have you already made your decision?

812
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:59,454
Of course, whether I live or your brother lives,

813
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,324
you have nothing to lose.

814
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:06,524
You're a fool, Your Majesty.

815
01:03:07,424 --> 01:03:09,284
Do you want to die?

816
01:03:10,724 --> 01:03:12,454
Why are you dressed like that?

817
01:03:14,854 --> 01:03:18,354
You are already mourning.

818
01:03:19,524 --> 01:03:21,654
Bring the queen's jewellery box.

819
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:30,424
Why aren't you wearing anything?

820
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:33,124
I did not give you these to keep in a box!

821
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:37,724
I can't tell anymore.

822
01:03:38,454 --> 01:03:40,784
I don't know if my enemies are the barbarians or your brother.

823
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,654
Park Joong Won is your enemy.

824
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,254
Your brother, the man that the barbarians could not kill...

825
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:06,524
I will kill him today.

826
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:07,624
Your Majesty.

827
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:09,724
Your brother's crime...

828
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:12,084
will be treason.

829
01:04:15,154 --> 01:04:17,154
Wear this ring and greet him...

830
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,254
as my queen.

831
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:43,224
Whose side are you on?

832
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:47,654
Even once, were you ever on my side?

833
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:49,754
Even once,

834
01:04:49,754 --> 01:04:51,824
did you ever care for me?

835
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:54,324
For one second, did you ever...

836
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:58,624
love me?

837
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:11,924
Do not side with him.

838
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:15,524
That is...

839
01:05:16,884 --> 01:05:19,484
the only way you can preserve your life.

840
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:25,154
You have to make a choice.

841
01:05:27,154 --> 01:05:29,384
Will you live as my woman...

842
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,824
or will you die...

843
01:05:36,154 --> 01:05:37,684
as the traitor's sister?

844
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:42,154
The woman who loves you...

845
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,254
is the traitor's sister.

846
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:32,354
What was that?

847
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,124
What did I see?

848
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:40,794
What was that?

849
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:43,054
That was...

850
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:45,524
your past life.

851
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,024
Was...

852
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:53,084
Kim Shin...

853
01:06:54,454 --> 01:06:56,154
in your past life?

854
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:04,754
Was I...

855
01:07:06,684 --> 01:07:08,754
a part...

856
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:14,324
of your past life?

857
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:35,554
Can you...

858
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:41,154
look into my eyes?

859
01:07:46,324 --> 01:07:49,854
Leave only the shining, happy memories...

860
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:55,294
and forget...

861
01:07:57,084 --> 01:08:00,384
all the sad and hard moments.

862
01:08:02,654 --> 01:08:06,084
Whether they were in your past life or present...

863
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,724
And...

864
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:16,924
forget about me.

865
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:39,154
I hope that...

866
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:45,724
you at least have a happy ending.

867
01:09:56,254 --> 01:09:57,754
You, over there.

868
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,924
Why are you staring into my shop again?

869
01:10:02,424 --> 01:10:03,854
What is it today?

870
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:07,294
An accessory? A biscuit? Socks?

871
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:14,654
I'm not here for that.

872
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:18,424
I owe you for the sweet potatoes.

873
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,584
Let's say that was my treat.

874
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:34,624
So, dear brother.

875
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,824
Did the king really say...

876
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:41,354
I was ugly?

877
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:58,024
Even if you're on the battlefield,

878
01:10:59,524 --> 01:11:01,884
how can a brother not send his sister a reply?

879
01:11:05,884 --> 01:11:06,984
Are you...

880
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:11,294
Are you really...

881
01:11:11,824 --> 01:11:14,324
I'm sorry it took me this long to recognize you.

882
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:17,754
I promised to become happy,

883
01:11:19,424 --> 01:11:21,024
but I couldn't keep it.

884
01:11:25,854 --> 01:11:27,724
I'm sorry.

885
01:11:49,224 --> 01:11:52,054
Persimmon, flowery shoes, and silk.

886
01:11:52,484 --> 01:11:54,084
Thank you.

887
01:12:14,154 --> 01:12:18,024
You must come see me more often from now on.

888
01:12:42,854 --> 01:12:45,624
Can you help me if you're not too busy?

889
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:04,924
Is something wrong?

890
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:06,324
Just...

891
01:13:07,324 --> 01:13:08,884
Something is bothering me.

892
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,584
Did you fight with my uncle again?

893
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:11,624
No.

894
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:14,354
Even before that.

895
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:17,584
Ever since that day, it's been happening.

896
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:19,154
When?

897
01:13:31,524 --> 01:13:33,384
What is it? Are you okay?

898
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,854
That day?

899
01:13:51,124 --> 01:13:52,754
It couldn't be because of him.

900
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:54,424
We were at a temple then.

901
01:13:54,424 --> 01:13:55,884
- A temple?
- Yes.

902
01:13:56,024 --> 01:13:57,684
He sent up a lantern.

903
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,824
He does it once a year.

904
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:04,754
He does it in remembrance of the people he owes.

905
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:07,254
They had two syllable names.

906
01:14:07,754 --> 01:14:09,924
Kim Sun...

907
01:14:10,324 --> 01:14:12,754
and Wang something.

908
01:14:12,754 --> 01:14:14,084
It was in Chinese characters.

909
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:19,224
What happens if I do this?

910
01:14:24,484 --> 01:14:25,684
A pursued stone.

911
01:14:29,024 --> 01:14:30,124
Hey.

912
01:14:31,324 --> 01:14:32,384
Look at that.

913
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,294
She's acting like she can't see me.

914
01:14:40,224 --> 01:14:43,384
Hey, you little punk!

915
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:56,984
She's not acting.

916
01:14:58,154 --> 01:15:00,224
She really can't see me.

917
01:15:12,484 --> 01:15:13,484
Me too.

918
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:17,924
Pardon?

919
01:15:20,384 --> 01:15:23,524
I'm excited to pick you up, too.

920
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:33,584
I'm so happy you came to pick me up at school.

921
01:15:34,954 --> 01:15:36,124
Forget it.

922
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:40,154
I was just thinking about something.

923
01:15:40,724 --> 01:15:42,324
Did something good happen?

924
01:15:42,324 --> 01:15:43,724
You look like it.

925
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:45,324
That took you a while to ask.

926
01:15:46,424 --> 01:15:48,824
My sister, Sun...

927
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:50,624
finally remembered me.

928
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:52,754
Really? Really?

929
01:15:52,754 --> 01:15:54,484
That's great news.

930
01:15:54,624 --> 01:15:56,124
How?

931
01:15:57,794 --> 01:15:59,484
I didn't ask her.

932
01:15:59,924 --> 01:16:01,084
You're right.

933
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,124
How did she remember her previous life?

934
01:16:05,424 --> 01:16:06,624
What's wrong?

935
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:09,324
Are you saying...

936
01:16:11,924 --> 01:16:13,124
Can you...

937
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:16,124
pull the car over for a minute?

938
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:25,124
Please listen to me...

939
01:16:25,824 --> 01:16:27,754
without getting upset.

940
01:16:27,924 --> 01:16:30,294
I've thought about it a lot.

941
01:16:31,854 --> 01:16:32,854
What is it?

942
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,684
I believe that you are someone much bigger...

943
01:16:37,024 --> 01:16:38,654
than what I know.

944
01:16:38,654 --> 01:16:40,084
What are you talking about?

945
01:16:42,384 --> 01:16:43,524
I...

946
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:47,254
met someone deceased,

947
01:16:47,924 --> 01:16:49,124
and I think...

948
01:16:49,954 --> 01:16:52,254
it's Park Joong Won.

949
01:16:53,024 --> 01:16:54,024
How...

950
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,854
do you know Park Joong Won?

951
01:16:56,854 --> 01:16:58,154
I'm sorry,

952
01:16:58,954 --> 01:17:01,524
but overheard what you said...

953
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,424
to the Grim Reaper.

954
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:06,354
At first, I thought he was just an evil ghost.

955
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:10,854
However, I can't tell what he's after.

956
01:17:11,154 --> 01:17:14,424
I feel like strange things happening around me are related to him.

957
01:17:14,424 --> 01:17:17,054
Maybe Sunny remembering you...

958
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:19,024
might be because of him.

959
01:17:19,024 --> 01:17:20,954
I'm glad you told me. Thank you.

960
01:17:21,384 --> 01:17:24,124
I'll drive you home. Stay there and don't go out.

961
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:26,354
A goblin's house is the safest place.

962
01:17:27,424 --> 01:17:28,424
Okay.

963
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:45,554
I avoided you for 900 years. I can't believe I ran into you.

964
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:48,054
How futile.

965
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:51,754
Do not worry.

966
01:18:52,954 --> 01:18:54,854
I will get rid of you right away.

967
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:56,484
However,

968
01:18:58,124 --> 01:19:00,224
you must tell me why you suddenly showed up...

969
01:19:01,054 --> 01:19:03,824
after hiding for the last 900 years.

970
01:19:04,624 --> 01:19:07,854
Despite all those years,

971
01:19:07,854 --> 01:19:11,484
you have failed to find insight since you are a mere warrior.

972
01:19:11,884 --> 01:19:16,654
You had your enemy trudge along with you. How pathetic.

973
01:19:17,154 --> 01:19:19,924
I will be glad to tell you.

974
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:25,254
That tongue of yours is still senile after 900 years.

975
01:19:26,954 --> 01:19:29,524
I will pull out your tongue first.

976
01:19:29,924 --> 01:19:33,624
Then I will cut your body into pieces.

977
01:19:36,824 --> 01:19:39,024
I will do it right now.

978
01:20:01,754 --> 01:20:05,124
You, I or the 900 years.

979
01:20:05,824 --> 01:20:09,224
You will not be able to hurt me with that sword of yours.

980
01:20:18,854 --> 01:20:21,794
Did living as a goblin...

981
01:20:22,424 --> 01:20:26,924
make you think that you actually became the almighty?

982
01:20:34,324 --> 01:20:37,154
I will kill you no matter what, so do not worry.

983
01:21:03,724 --> 01:21:08,524
The longing within makes one die of an unworthy death.

984
01:21:08,724 --> 01:21:12,424
During the 20 years you spent rotting,

985
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:15,454
Yeo grew powerful...

986
01:21:16,424 --> 01:21:17,654
beyond recognition.

987
01:21:19,424 --> 01:21:21,254
If you speak of that name one more time...

988
01:21:21,254 --> 01:21:25,854
Do you know the identity of the grim reaper by your side?

989
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:28,794
He's the man who gave you that sword...

990
01:21:28,794 --> 01:21:32,884
and the one who pierced your heart with it.

991
01:21:33,824 --> 01:21:36,254
That man is...

992
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:38,924
Wang Yeo.

993
01:21:41,954 --> 01:21:42,984
Ludicrous.

994
01:21:42,984 --> 01:21:46,084
Your foolish sister...

995
01:21:46,084 --> 01:21:48,424
fell for him again in this life.

996
01:21:51,024 --> 01:21:52,624
I pity you.

997
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:59,154
You will never have your revenge.

998
01:22:09,984 --> 01:22:11,224
I heard you cried.

999
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,084
Why? Even I don't cry.

1000
01:22:14,084 --> 01:22:16,984
Who is the woman in the painting by the way?

1001
01:22:18,084 --> 01:22:21,154
I don't remember. I just feel.

1002
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:25,054
I was just extremely sad.

1003
01:22:26,884 --> 01:22:28,554
My heart felt like it was breaking.

1004
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:32,794
A super handsome uncle.

1005
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:40,854
Have you seen a ring like this?

1006
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:34,224
Is the grim reaper in your previous life?

1007
01:24:35,794 --> 01:24:38,354
- Have you seen him?
- Excuse me.

1008
01:24:38,924 --> 01:24:42,084
What do you think you're doing in my restaurant?

1009
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:45,854
Do you think I'm really Kim Sun because I remember my past life?

1010
01:24:45,854 --> 01:24:47,154
Is that man...

1011
01:24:50,054 --> 01:24:51,684
really Yeo?

1012
01:24:55,884 --> 01:24:59,024
- I have to go home.
- I asked you a question.

1013
01:25:10,794 --> 01:25:12,054
Even in this life,

1014
01:25:13,884 --> 01:25:15,654
you are...

1015
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:19,684
protecting that fool.

1016
01:25:54,684 --> 01:25:56,324
Was I?

1017
01:25:57,854 --> 01:26:01,284
Was I really Wang Yeo?

1018
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,984
The feelings without memories...

1019
01:26:06,154 --> 01:26:08,754
Is that...

1020
01:26:09,924 --> 01:26:11,624
the punishment I gave myself...

1021
01:26:12,884 --> 01:26:14,854
so I won't forget who I was?

1022
01:26:50,924 --> 01:26:52,684
As expected,

1023
01:26:53,984 --> 01:26:56,654
it looks like I'm the worst memory.

1024
01:26:58,324 --> 01:27:00,154
To you...

1025
01:27:01,454 --> 01:27:04,784
and to Kim Shin, both.

1026
01:27:05,224 --> 01:27:06,984
You can hear me, can't you?

1027
01:27:11,554 --> 01:27:14,024
I hear yours, too.

1028
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:16,724
I hear it very clearly.

1029
01:27:50,484 --> 01:27:52,554
Warrior Kim Shin...

1030
01:28:02,454 --> 01:28:04,454
greets you, Your Majesty.

1031
01:28:48,084 --> 01:28:51,484
(Goblin)

1032
01:28:55,484 --> 01:28:57,454
This royal garment...

1033
01:28:59,354 --> 01:29:01,454
is without an owner.

1034
01:29:06,484 --> 01:29:07,754
Maybe this is...

1035
01:29:12,384 --> 01:29:14,824
what you're looking for.

1036
01:29:22,684 --> 01:29:23,854
If so,

1037
01:29:27,424 --> 01:29:28,954
take it.

1038
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:01,524
It is my royal decree.
