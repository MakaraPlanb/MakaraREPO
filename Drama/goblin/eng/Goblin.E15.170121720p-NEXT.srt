00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,710
(EPISODE 15)

2
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,480
Oh, you again.

3
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,380
I'll say.

4
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,810
"I'll say"?

5
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Is that what I just said?

6
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,810
Wait!

7
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,750
Lady.

8
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,510
- Me?
- It's good to see you here.

9
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,880
- Do you know me?
- No.

10
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,110
But that necklace you're wearing.

11
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,650
- This?
- I made that.

12
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,680
A man asked me to design it.

13
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,210
Must have been 10 years ago.

14
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,210
10 years? What man?

15
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,450
You should know better.

16
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,610
You're the owner of the necklace.

17
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,450
Do you know what it means?

18
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,150
- No.
- It means...

19
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,210
"a match made in Heaven" in French.

20
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,150
Destiny made outside of man's boundary.

21
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,480
Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?

22
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,050
Will you stop? You're out of places to try.

23
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,350
There's one place I haven't tried.

24
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,180
The place she's at.

25
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,250
Then go. I give my permission.

26
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,550
Can I go?

27
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,510
Would it be okay to cause her confusion?

28
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,410
Is it okay to confuse me? I'm on edge because of you.

29
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,880
I feel so empty inside.

30
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,610
Are you crazy?

31
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,050
He lived for a long time, too.

32
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,450
Put that back before you cause an international dispute.

33
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,110
He wants us gone.

34
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,080
He's scary when he's angry.

35
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,280
Gosh, this is just so weird.

36
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,050
How could we meet here?

37
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm on a business trip. I'm here to research...

38
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,450
designs to put on the corners of our furniture.

39
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,680
- What are you on about?
- I don't know.

40
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,350
How have you been?

41
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,950
Are you following me?

42
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,480
Is that a crime?

43
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,850
- What should I do?
- I'm not a bad man.

44
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,950
How would I know that?

45
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,310
By spending time with me.

46
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,480
I have no reason to do that.

47
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,780
My company sponsored your radio show.

48
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,880
You offered to buy me a meal.

49
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,110
Is this your first time in Canada?

50
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,250
Let's go this way.

51
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,880
Did I tell you I'd be in Canada?

52
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,450
- Didn't I just say I'd go abroad?
- I think you mentioned Canada.

53
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,180
You said something about maple leaves.

54
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,550
Maple leaves?

55
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,480
I remember that.

56
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,910
Let's go this way.

57
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,550
Is this enough?

58
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,910
It's fine.

59
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,280
It's nice like we're on a picnic.

60
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,310
Not for you, for me.

61
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,450
Is this enough for me?

62
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,210
Remember how much I sponsored your show with?

63
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,480
The thing is,

64
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,150
this trip was sudden, not planned.

65
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,150
I didn't bring that much money.

66
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,380
- What do you like?
- Beef.

67
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,650
I'm not much of a meat-eater.

68
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,050
You love it.

69
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,650
How do you know that?

70
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,480
Well... Who doesn't like meat?

71
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,410
Don't avoid my question.

72
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,750
Did you have someone dig up my information?

73
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,910
To find out if my family...

74
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,210
is on par with yours?

75
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,650
Who said I'd date you?

76
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,650
You're not a catch at all.

77
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,380
You need to buy me meat.

78
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,110
That should taste lovely.

79
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,050
I'll call you later. Bye.

80
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,750
There's nothing much this way. Go that way.

81
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll show you around.

82
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,850
Can you do that?

83
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,980
I don't want to be a nuisance.

84
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,410
It's okay. I'm sure you did it out of excitement.

85
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,680
You seem to know Quebec well.

86
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,180
Were you here before?

87
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,450
Yes. I was here with my first love.

88
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,410
We came here four times.

89
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,710
You have a girlfriend, then.

90
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,950
Not anymore.

91
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,750
Why did you break up?

92
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,880
I was very far away for a very long time.

93
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,610
It took a toll on her.

94
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,080
She'd forgotten all about me.

95
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,250
First loves never work out.

96
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,650
You must've loved her a lot.

97
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,080
I guess I did, considering I can't hold back.

98
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,910
What are you holding back?

99
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,180
I want to hold her hand...

100
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,850
and hold her close.

101
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,950
The woman forgot about you...

102
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,550
but you didn't forget her.

103
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,280
No.

104
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,510
Never for a second or a day.

105
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,150
What a lucky woman.

106
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,080
Have you heard?

107
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,110
If you catch a falling maple leaf,

108
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,810
you fall in love with the person you're with.

109
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,350
Is that what your first love said?

110
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,150
Yes, and I caught a leaf.

111
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,980
Do you still believe that? It didn't work out for you.

112
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,850
You're here with me because it didn't work out.

113
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,880
And you have a thing for me.

114
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,910
Men can be really silly. They tell the woman they like...

115
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,450
about their exes.

116
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,880
- Is that so?
- Isn't it?

117
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,480
Are you an idiot? A teenager?

118
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,610
Do you believe catching a leaf makes you fall in love?

119
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,110
He fell for that woman's tricks.

120
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,880
He's such an idiot.

121
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,110
(YOU ARE HIS BRIDE.)

122
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,250
Who are you?

123
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,680
Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?

124
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,950
I don't remember anything.

125
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,780
I don't even know which chunk of my memories I lost.

126
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,210
My goodness.

127
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
I don't remember anything.

128
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,580
Nothing at all.

129
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,810
Let's just go and ask.

130
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,450
That should be quicker.

131
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,480
Why are you here?

132
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,150
Are you staying here?

133
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,880
- Yes.
- I see.

134
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,850
I have a question.

135
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,750
Did we...

136
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,250
meet somewhere before?

137
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,880
About 10 years ago?

138
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,950
Mister.

139
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,450
It's a bit weird but I'm not hitting on you.

140
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,450
I keep having this weird feeling.

141
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,950
Do you like me?

142
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,250
No. I said I'm not hitting on you.

143
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,950
Yes.

144
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,310
You're my type.

145
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,850
For your information,

146
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,520
I don't have a boyfriend.

147
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,680
I'm not very lucky with men in this life.

148
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,980
I'm just saying.

149
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,980
I'll get going then.

150
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,810
Have a nice walk.

151
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,080
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

152
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,680
You go first.

153
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,880
You were right.

154
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,480
A sandwich wasn't enough.

155
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,210
Why don't we have early dinner? Aren't you hungry?

156
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,780
It will be my treat.

157
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,780
I was going to ask you out for dinner too.

158
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,850
I know a restaurant that serves good beef.

159
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,810
Beef.

160
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,880
I was thoughtless.

161
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,710
My feet hurt like crazy because I didn't bring my sneakers.

162
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Your feet might hurt, but you must look beautiful.

163
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,110
It's okay.

164
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,780
At least you now know that you have to take sneakers with you next time.

165
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,480
I know. It's not like I've been abroad before.

166
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,780
I know.

167
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,020
Why would you go there now when you're just about to turn 30?

168
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,610
When I was 29, I didn't even travel as far as to the corner store.

169
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,650
Really? Thank you.

170
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,910
I didn't have any appointments.

171
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,380
I've been traveling around just fine...

172
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,150
for someone who's never been abroad before.

173
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,580
I rarely get lost and I never miss a meal.

174
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,410
Now, I'm going to have a big chunk of beef.

175
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.

176
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,020
It's the man that has to be nice, not the restaurant.

177
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,850
I have to go. I'm sleepy.

178
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,350
Okay. Have a good night.

179
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
The future I saw was right.

180
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,480
Over here, Sir.

181
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,910
You ended up meeting this guy.

182
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,250
I'm embarrassed that I can't stop smiling.

183
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,050
Did you come here...

184
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,250
with your first love too?

185
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,810
You fed her a really expensive meal.

186
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,410
It was useless though. She forgot all about it.

187
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,080
Did you see her even after breaking up?

188
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,550
Yes.

189
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,650
I heard that the memory about first love often gets glamorized...

190
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,250
and you get disappointed when you meet again.

191
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,480
No, it's not true. She's still beautiful.

192
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,680
Excuse me.

193
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,310
I'm going to order. Are you ready to order?

194
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,350
Yes.

195
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,910
- I will...
- What do you think about...

196
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,310
a girl who just became quite beautiful?

197
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,210
I recently became quite beautiful. Of course that's what I think.

198
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,680
Can we meet again tomorrow?

199
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,810
I'm flying out tomorrow afternoon.

200
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,020
Before you go.

201
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,550
And also in Korea.

202
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,750
Welcome.

203
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,310
She won't be here today, either.

204
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,980
Just give her this.

205
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,410
No wonder I wanted to go to work all of a sudden.

206
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
Are you...

207
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,480
Goodness.

208
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,580
Are you the one who's been looking for me?

209
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,080
Yes. You are Yu Deok Hwa, right?

210
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,480
The previous owner of the building.

211
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,310
Do you remember the chicken restaurant on the first floor?

212
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,310
Nine years ago.

213
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,850
I remember of course. You never paid rent on time.

214
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,210
Why were you looking for me?

215
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,410
You sent me a letter through this person, didn't you?

216
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,910
Can I...

217
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,880
get his contact number?

218
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,310
Do you want his number, not mine?

219
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,850
I'm a little busy, you see.

220
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,150
(SUNNY NOT SUN HEE)

221
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,010
Let's see.

222
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,780
Where is a nice and remote place...

223
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,210
for the people who just started dating?

224
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,380
There's nothing much here. Let's go that way.

225
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,250
Is this...

226
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,180
you?

227
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,410
Are you...

228
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,580
a ghost?

229
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,980
Did you die this time?

230
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,780
Is that why I kept seeing you?

231
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,310
Do you...

232
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,950
still see ghosts?

233
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,610
Still?

234
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,180
How do you know that I can see ghosts?

235
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,180
Who are you?

236
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,080
Are you really a ghost?

237
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,050
How do you know that I used to see ghosts?

238
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,180
Is your name...

239
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,850
Kim Shin by any chance?

240
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,880
You came here 10 years ago with me. Is that correct?

241
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,050
Why don't I remember it at all?

242
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,610
Please answer me.

243
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,150
Who are you?

244
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,810
Why did I write not to forget you?

245
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,810
Why did I write that I am your bride?

246
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,480
You are Kim Shin, right?

247
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,550
You are, aren't you?

248
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,850
I'm not.

249
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,450
It's late. You should go back to the hotel.

250
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,550
Why aren't you surprised?

251
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,710
- What?
- I sat here all of a sudden.

252
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,450
Why aren't you surprised?

253
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,110
Do you know who I am?

254
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,810
You look like you do.

255
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,580
No. It's my first time seeing you.

256
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,380
I looked at you because you sat down.

257
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,010
You came to my shop, didn't you?

258
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,810
You brought Producer Ji's letter.

259
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,410
Yes.

260
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,180
You cried on the street.

261
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,410
On a cold day, you were walking...

262
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,480
in the street while crying, so I remembered you.

263
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,210
Did you cry because of me?

264
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,380
Many people get surprised, but not many people cry.

265
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,110
You look...

266
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,880
very similar to one woman I know.

267
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,610
Not too many people look like me though.

268
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,380
Anyway, let's introduce each other.

269
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,550
What's your name?

270
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm Wang Yeo.

271
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,280
It sounds like a king's name.

272
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,810
My name is Sunny. S, U, N, N, Y.

273
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
I wanted to see you.

274
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,580
I saw you on surveillance camera.

275
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,580
You were so handsome that...

276
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,510
I was curious about how much more handsome you'd be in person.

277
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,310
It turns out you look better on screen.

278
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,550
Thank you for delivering the letter.

279
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,110
Thanks to you, Eun Tak got to travel abroad.

280
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,580
Now that I saw you in person, I will get going now.

281
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,250
I have to run the shop.

282
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,880
It's cold, so don't cry while walking.

283
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,780
Your face will freeze.

284
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,550
It was...

285
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
nice seeing you.

286
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:10,664
Same

287
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:47,188
It was

288
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,380
nice seeing you, too.

289
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,470
Mr. Kim Woo Bin.

290
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:06,498
It was...

291
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:09,222
nice seeing you.

292
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,220
It was nice seeing you, too.

293
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,920
Mr. Kim Woo Bin.

294
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,180
Remember.

295
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,040
You must remember.

296
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,080
His name is Kim Shin.

297
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,310
Why is it raining so much?

298
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,610
Why isn't the part-timer coming?

299
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,210
The number you have dialed is not available.

300
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,580
Please leave a message after the tone.

301
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,510
What is going on?

302
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,780
Gosh, you startled me.

303
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,140
Kid, what are you doing there?

304
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,610
My grandma didn't come home yet.

305
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,710
At least you should be home, then.

306
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,580
You're Eun Tak's friend, aren't you? Come inside for now.

307
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,880
Eun Tak isn't here today. She skipped work.

308
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,410
Come in.

309
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,110
My goodness.

310
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,440
There you go. It's hot so blow on it before you drink.

311
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,140
When is your grandma coming?

312
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
Later at night when she's made money.

313
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,940
You're pretty unfortunate yourself, aren't you?

314
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,740
Grandma said there are many people who are more unfortunate than me.

315
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,210
Good boy.

316
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,340
It's all the deity's fault.

317
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,810
He should distribute more evenly. Only the unfortunate gets the worst.

318
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,680
Don't you think so? He's such a jerk.

319
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,210
You'll get punished if you say things like that.

320
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,780
It's okay.

321
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,640
I've been through a lot starting with the goblin couple...

322
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,780
and the Grim Reaper. I can speak ill of him.

323
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,840
He made me remember my past life and then tried to erase it again.

324
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
I wonder just how many people suffered because of him.

325
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,610
Don't you think oblivion is the deity's way of showing grace?

326
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,410
It's so you won't fall in agony.

327
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,810
Who does he think he is? What gives him the right?

328
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,780
Do you see that?

329
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,940
At my restaurant, even the deity has to fetch his own water.

330
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,580
Just like how I decide my own life.

331
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,540
It's my life and my memory.

332
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,010
He didn't even ask for my opinion. I didn't ask for it.

333
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,210
I'll take care of my own life.

334
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,940
I really wish he stays out of it.

335
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,180
Okay. I understand.

336
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,310
Who are you to say that?

337
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,640
(5 YEARS AGO)

338
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,180
- All right. A bit more to go.
- Thank you.

339
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,910
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

340
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,510
Are you moving?

341
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,380
Yes. I've been saving up.

342
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll still go to your restaurant to have chicken.

343
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,980
You should come. I'll give you a discount.

344
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,040
It's hard labour what you do.

345
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,480
- I'll move this one.
- Okay.

346
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,110
Hello, I just moved in today. I live on the rooftop.

347
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,980
It's nice to meet you.

348
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,410
Then...

349
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,910
Today is our first day.

350
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,880
Sure.

351
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,280
Excuse me.

352
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,010
Just a minute.

353
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,940
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

354
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,410
Brother?

355
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,110
To the one who thought...

356
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,610
that oblivion would bring me peace of mind.

357
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,540
The moment our eyes met, I knew...

358
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,750
that you too retained your memories.

359
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,210
Hence, in this life, we'll have to...

360
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,080
I hope...

361
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,280
at least you get this happy ending.

362
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,980
Live in each of our happy endings...

363
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,610
and ignore this tragedy.

364
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,340
I pray that in our next life...

365
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,480
The meeting with you is short and the wait is long.

366
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,110
The wait will be short and the meeting shall be long.

367
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,080
I don't have a religion.

368
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,640
You called 10 times just to tell me that?

369
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,840
That we won't need an excuse to see each other.

370
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,080
Entitled with our own dearest names.

371
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,580
What is this?

372
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,280
Is this a coincidence?

373
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,180
So we could greet each other when we accidentally run into each other.

374
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,250
Every clumsy thing...

375
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,940
that I do is incorrect.

376
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,680
With our love always being the solution.

377
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,040
I pray that we can meet like that.

378
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,410
It was nice seeing you.

379
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,440
I'm just happy that I saw your face.

380
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,480
Same here.

381
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,250
Kim Woo Bin.

382
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,610
Sometimes, you're Kim Woo Bin.

383
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,310
Wang Yeo.

384
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,580
And sometimes, you're Wang Yeo.

385
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,140
Please live a long and happy life.

386
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,780
Goodbye.

388
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,310
Why did that chicken restaurant owner ask for his number?

389
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,910
Who is Ji Eun Tak that was written on that letter?

390
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,380
Why do I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't know?

391
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,710
Of course, a rich heir...

392
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,580
should experience amnesia at least once in his life.

393
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,610
Although...

394
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,380
I feel like I could be someone important to them.

395
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,580
I didn't think it through.

396
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,180
If she forgot about me,

397
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,910
then I'm probably worth being forgotten.

398
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,980
I just...

399
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,250
miss her a lot.

400
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,340
Mister.

401
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,610
If you catch a leaf falling,

402
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,040
- your love will come true.
- Your love will come true.

403
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,280
No matter how I think about it, I think you're a goblin.

404
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,410
I love you.

405
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,080
There is no sadness that lasts for eternity.

406
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
There is no love that lasts for eternity either.

407
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,750
I'm going to vote that there is.

408
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,410
Which one are you voting for?

409
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,980
Love or sadness?

410
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,340
Sad love.

411
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,140
I missed you.

412
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,580
I won't leave you behind.

413
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,540
Why not? Because I'm the goblin's bride?

414
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,340
I miss you.

415
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,880
I miss you.

416
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,980
Where are you?

417
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,810
I miss you.

418
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,440
It's really amazing now that I think about it.

419
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,940
You said you'd come back as rain...

420
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,750
and as snow.

421
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,040
You kept your promise.

422
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,580
You came on the day of the first snowfall.

423
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,840
"On the day of the first snowfall every year,"

424
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,840
"the goblin agrees to be summoned by me."

425
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,140
"I will be waiting for you."

426
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,180
Was it really because of the agreement?

427
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,780
I begged you not to go.

428
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,380
How could you leave me?

429
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,580
Even if that was for the best,

430
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,780
you took my hands to...

431
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,980
I'm sorry.

432
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,980
It's okay, you kept your promise.

433
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,440
What was the meaning of returning to nothingness?

434
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,380
That I wouldn't be able to see you.

435
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,610
I didn't know why,

436
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,110
but I turned insane whenever it rained.

437
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,180
It hurt and I cried.

438
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,380
I even mumbled to myself.

439
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
No pills could help me.

440
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,480
I should have lived well...

441
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,840
in return for all the love you gave to me.

442
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,410
I'm sorry.

443
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,780
I'll make you happy from now on.

444
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,240
I'm saying this because I think you haven't noticed,

445
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,880
but you've been touching me for a while.

446
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,080
You're making me feel embarrassed.

447
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,440
I'm checking...

448
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,940
because I still can't believe it.

449
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,010
I'm not sure if this is a dream.

450
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,280
It's not a dream.

451
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,580
I had too many...

452
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,180
dreams like this.

453
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,710
It's not a dream.

454
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,610
I still can't believe it.

455
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,180
I'm too surprised.

456
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,480
My heart is still racing.

457
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,840
Do you want me to surprise you even more?

458
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,310
I can buy you the whole row...

459
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,740
in one transaction.

460
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,610
Then I want a drink.

461
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,610
What about you?

462
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,780
That sounds good.

463
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,610
By the way, I don't think...

464
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,010
I should call you Mister any more.

465
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,010
"Honey" is a bit too much.

466
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,910
In 10 years, we'll be the same age.

467
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,640
Why don't we just call each other by names starting now?

468
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,940
No way.

469
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,310
Right.

470
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,410
What about my boss? Did you see her?

471
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,840
Just from afar. She didn't see me.

472
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,710
She earned a lot of money,

473
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,780
so she's a landlord now.

474
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,180
Could it be thanks to her brother who brings wealth?

475
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,580
Anyway, she's well.

476
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,540
What about the Grim Reaper? Did you see him?

477
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,540
He's still living at my house.

478
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,610
I'm not sure if he's well.

479
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,810
We really found friendship in each other now.

480
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,540
Actually, it's been a while.

481
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
What fates the two have.

482
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,040
Me too.

483
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,210
I missed you, too.

484
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,980
A lot.

485
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,510
I love you.

486
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,710
A lot.

487
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,310
You're leaving again.

488
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,440
I want to stay with you longer too,

489
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,240
but I only took a few days off from work.

490
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,610
Since I'm a human,

491
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,480
I have to take a taxi to the airport...

492
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,240
and leave a record with immigration.

493
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,110
Otherwise, I'll be arrested.

494
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,310
- I'll visit you at jail.
- Come on.

495
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,240
Or do you want to take the plane with me?

496
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,310
I've never thought about that.

497
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,610
Don't you want to take it with me?

498
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,210
I do, but I don't have a passport.

499
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,310
I came in a rush, so I didn't get a chance to.

500
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,840
Then I'll see you in Korea in about 17 hours.

501
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,510
It's going to take so long.

502
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,880
You'll be late, let's go.

503
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,510
Just one more minute.

504
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,810
Just one more time.

505
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,780
Did you wait long?

506
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,580
For 17 hours. I thought I was going to die.

507
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,040
When the gate opened and I saw you walk out...

508
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,610
You saw an angel, right?

509
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,380
You're not an angel.

510
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,610
Let go of my hand. Let go.

511
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,840
Never.

512
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,910
Did you forget your boyfriend is a goblin?

513
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,880
This is cheating.

514
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm so excited.

515
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,480
I forget there are cool things behind your doors.

516
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,580
Hello.

517
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,880
Ms. Ji.

518
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,410
Where's Ms. Kim?

519
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,040
You should've called.

520
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
She didn't come in today.

521
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,140
I guess she made enough money.

522
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,040
Okay. Thanks.

523
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,810
Where did she go?

524
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,040
Is she busy?

525
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,280
I'm a little nervous.

526
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,280
I'm old enough to know better.

527
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,810
It's a long trip.

528
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,410
He'll be here soon.

529
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,140
This feels...

530
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,640
longer...

531
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,280
than 70 years.

532
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,240
Sorry.

533
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,710
I'm very late.

534
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,810
How many years has it been since we saw each other?

535
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,780
It's been 73 years.

536
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,710
It was my first birthday after we got married.

537
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,440
You said you'd be back after training.

538
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,410
You said you'd be right back.

539
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,440
But they created the DMZ.

540
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,340
I thought...

541
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,880
they would remove it soon.

542
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,710
It took long to finally give you this.

543
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,040
I'm too old...

544
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,040
to even put it on.

545
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,140
You are still...

546
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,780
just as pretty.

547
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,540
I've aged, waiting for you. How am I pretty?

548
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,840
If you were going to make me wait this long,

549
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,180
you shouldn't have said you'd be back soon.

550
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,080
Why don't you sit and talk?

551
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,040
The tea's gone cold, so I'll have to reheat it.

552
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,640
It's chilly out.

553
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,340
Thank you.

554
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,140
I'm so glad I can see you like this before I go.

555
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,740
I have no regrets now.

556
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,240
So where are you buried?

557
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,780
Were you buried somewhere warm?

558
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,340
I was buried in the North,

559
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:33,410
so azaleas will bloom on that mountain in the spring.

560
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,040
You're late.

561
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,840
Yes. I had an unexpected deceased soul.

562
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,910
You have an unexpected guest, too.

563
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,740
Hi, Mr. Grim Reaper.

564
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,480
May I just call you "Grim Reaper" now?

565
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,640
Missing Soul.

566
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,080
She really is an unexpected guest.

567
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,910
She remembered everything.

568
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,410
She recognized me.

569
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,440
"Missing Soul".

570
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,880
I haven't heard that in so long.

571
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,540
I heard everything.

572
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,410
How could you not come once when you remembered everything?

573
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,480
What good could seeing a grim reaper bring to a human?

574
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,610
It's been a while.

575
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,010
I've been enjoying your radio show.

576
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,240
It's been way too long to say it's been a while.

577
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,880
I'm already 29 years old.

578
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,980
29.

579
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,040
I see.

580
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,440
Let's eat. Wash your hands.

581
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,580
Shall I tell you a secret?

582
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,710
Yes.

583
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,540
You will meet a grim reaper when you are 29.

584
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,510
Even if it's not me.

585
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,710
That's the fate of a missing soul.

586
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,010
This world requires order...

587
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,780
and nine...

588
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,340
is the closest lower number to 10,

589
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,580
a perfect number that symbolizes the almighty.

590
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,110
I wish you luck then...

591
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,680
as well.

592
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,840
You met me...

593
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:30,310
at the age of 29 as well.

594
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,010
You met a grim reaper.

595
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,820
Eun Tak, it hasn't been a month yet.

596
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,090
Are the symptoms...

597
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,290
No. I came to say bye...

598
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,890
and to thank you for everything.

599
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,890
Thank you...

600
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,820
for keeping me alive.

601
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,390
Otherwise, I would've been very miserable.

602
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,320
I finally remembered how to be happy.

603
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,820
That's great.

604
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,660
But...

605
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,720
what is that method?

606
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,190
I smell meat.

607
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,120
Your taste hasn't changed.

608
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,890
I have the pan on the stove.

609
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,220
Hold on. Oh, did you eat yet?

610
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,860
If not, eat with me.

611
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,520
You're holding the same book you were holding nine years ago.

612
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,490
When will you finish reading that?

613
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,760
A man reads and writes the same book 100 times.

614
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,790
Look at you lie.

615
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,260
How cute.

616
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,720
- Is it obvious?
- Yes.

617
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,790
What is this? Where am I?

618
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,490
Under the blanket.

619
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,490
You're really vulgar.

620
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,820
Leave if you don't feel like it.

621
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,320
It's so warm.

622
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,260
What are you doing?

623
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,360
Now that I'm warm I feel sleepy.

624
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,390
One, two, three...

625
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,490
Four, five...

626
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,920
What's wrong?

627
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,660
I was so scared.

628
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,520
Scared that it's a dream.

629
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,920
That I'm still dreaming.

630
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,620
It's not a dream.

631
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,090
You scared me.

632
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,590
From now on, show up before I count to three.

633
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,860
Don't go anywhere, okay?

634
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,520
Okay, I won't go anywhere.

635
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,220
Get in bed.

636
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,820
You left me once.

637
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,960
I'm sorry.

638
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,120
You, over there.

639
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:32,320
Why did you leave Eun Tak's room to stare into mine?

640
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,790
Are you Mr. Restaurant?

641
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,760
Mr. Restaurant?

642
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,720
So that's what happens.

643
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,620
You choose that path in the end.

644
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,190
It is good to see you smile.

645
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,090
Who's smiling? Should I smile right now?

646
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,820
Your temperament has not changed at all.

647
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,390
Maybe not now, but you smile in the end, so all is well.

648
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,660
Where are you going dressed like that?

649
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,860
Are you actually leaving? Hey.

650
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,890
Make my part-timer...

651
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,160
a happy woman.

652
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,190
Your foolish little sister...

653
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,690
will be happy as well.

654
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,220
Where did he go so early in the morning? Scalpel.

655
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,220
Uncle Tenant.

656
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,320
What's that watch? I want it.

657
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,920
Time is everything in my line of work.

658
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,720
A grim reaper prefers black.

659
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,620
I like it. This is your breakfast. Do you like it?

660
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,020
There you go again.

661
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:18,860
You're still so careless.

662
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,390
Do you even know what you're saying?

663
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,760
He just found you out.

664
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,690
I found out about you first.

665
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,060
You had blue flames all over you when you came over.

666
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,920
I thought it was spontaneous combustion.

667
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,560
You careless goblin.

668
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,520
Deok Hwa, it'll be hard to believe, but you should know the truth.

669
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,620
About what?

670
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,920
That he's a goblin and you're a grim reaper?

671
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,520
- How do you know that?
- We just told him.

672
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,520
Oh, right.

673
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,290
I don't understand why you aren't shocked.

674
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,990
Grandpa told me ever since I turned six.

675
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,190
That I have an uncle who's a goblin.

676
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,120
That our family served that goblin for generations.

677
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,760
I thought it was some kind of odd religion.

678
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,260
I never imagined he meant a literal goblin.

679
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,390
I understand. It would be hard to imagine.

680
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,860
Prove it.

681
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,590
Prove it if you can. Both of you, if you please.

682
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,260
How was that?

683
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,520
Ever seen psychokinesis at work? What do you think?

684
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,660
Even humans can do that.

685
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,420
Don't you know David Copperfield?

686
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,890
Get out.

687
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,620
- That's all you have.
- You need to come with me.

688
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,990
You'll find out we aren't going anywhere nice.

689
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,260
Uncle.

690
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,820
If that is your fate, so be it.

691
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,320
He was such a good boy.

692
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,360
I will get revenge.

693
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,890
It must be done before we become close.

694
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,720
(NASA PHONE NUMBER)

695
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,290
Uncles, you got it all wrong.

696
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,160
I wanted to ask if I can set up a branch here in Seoul.

697
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:16,890
Uncles.

698
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,660
Uncles?

699
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,020
Uncle.

700
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,960
Aunt?

701
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,360
Why do you look so surprised? I'm not banned from visiting.

702
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,020
Do you have any food?

703
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,060
No? I knew it.

704
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:47,060
I bet you order in all the time because you're rich now.

705
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,160
Come inside. I'll cook you something.

706
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,890
I'm not a picky eater. I wouldn't mind something grilled.

707
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,460
How are Gyeong Mi and Gyeong Sik?

708
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,560
- Have you seen them?
- I don't care about them.

709
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,560
No news is good news.

710
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,490
Good riddance, I say. I'm better off without them.

711
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,960
Is this where you live? You make money, don't you?

712
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,890
I guess good grades get you nowhere.

713
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,590
Is it a monthly rent?

714
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,990
Get me something to eat. I'm sure you're busy.

715
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:32,690
Next week, we'll look into a few cases everyone can relate to.

716
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,420
Thank you. Giving us some valuable legal advice...

717
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,520
was lawyer Kim Yoo Na.

718
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,960
I hope you have a weekend ruled by common sense.

719
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,890
I'll play you a song and after the commercial break,

720
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,960
we'll come back with part three.

721
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,890
How was that?

722
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,660
You should switch jobs. You were awesome.

723
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,390
You didn't even listen.

724
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,160
You look upset. Shall we have a drink?

725
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,690
No. I have to go and see the chicken lady...

726
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,890
and I have plans. Maybe next time.

727
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,190
See you around.

728
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,120
Bye.

729
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,290
I'll be packed and gone by the weekend.

730
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:33,590
Very well. I'll inform your landlord.

731
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,460
Okay.

732
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,590
What got into you? One trip abroad...

733
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,420
and you're acting like a foreigner?

734
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,590
I missed you, Boss.

735
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,220
You're never at work or at home.

736
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,090
Where were you?

737
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,760
Packing up to move.

738
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,660
You're moving? Your home or business?

739
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,320
Both.

740
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:08,990
To overcome my new house phobia.

741
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,020
There's no such thing.

742
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,720
I got this for you from Canada.

743
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,720
I've been carrying it around hoping to meet you.

744
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,020
Did you find what you went to look for?

745
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,790
Everything. I found everything.

746
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,090
You won't believe me even if I told you.

747
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,620
I found everything and a boyfriend.

748
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,420
In Quebec of all places. It was destiny.

749
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,620
Is your destiny handsome?

750
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,090
Incredibly.

751
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,260
He has large, clear eyes and he served his country.

752
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,420
He must be so stubborn.

753
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,060
He is.

754
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,620
- What?
- I know you have low standards.

755
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,060
Did you have fun with Mr. Restaurant?

756
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,590
I'll introduce him to you one day.

757
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,620
I really want you to meet him.

758
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,760
Forget it.

759
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,560
- Why?
- I saw him leave your room.

760
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,260
Do what you want.

761
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,530
What is it?

762
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,120
Just. I was thinking of old times.

763
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:29,290
Okay. You do as you want with that, too.

764
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,460
Take care of yourself, okay?

765
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,690
What's wrong?

766
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,320
You sound like we'll never see each other again.

767
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,160
Goodbye, then. I have to meet someone.

768
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,190
Okay.

769
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, you again.

770
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,960
I'll say.

771
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:01,660
He's a Canadian ghost.

772
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,320
That man...

773
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,560
was a ghost.

774
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,860
I didn't see them for a while.

775
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,160
Why have I started seeing them again?

776
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,960
Why are you so deep in thought?

777
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,620
Hi.

778
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,920
I was thinking about Canada.

779
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,490
Not about me?

780
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,320
I was thinking about Canada,

781
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,760
and naturally, I started thinking about you.

782
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,060
You said you went there four times with your first love,

783
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,560
that you fed your first love beef,

784
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,260
and that your first love is still just as pretty.

785
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,160
And?

786
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,660
So I was thinking...

787
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,990
maybe I am that first love.

788
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,720
And?

789
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,120
And something is off.

790
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,820
Then who was that first love that you said you met...

791
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,660
during late Joseon?

792
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,490
You.

793
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,790
Liar.

794
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,690
Before we even met...

795
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,490
Before I even knew,

796
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,120
you had come by.

797
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,690
I saw you on the 12th year of King Chuljong's reign.

798
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,660
You in the far future.

799
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,690
- Liar.
- It almost seems like a lie.

800
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,720
That's so cool. I'm so excited.

801
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,960
It really seems like a lie...

802
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,260
that the first love was me.

803
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,990
That's right. Then back then...

804
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:33,360
when I made a wish during the first snowfall,

805
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,120
was that...

806
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:38,190
how the warrior Kim Shin looked?

807
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,030
Yes.

808
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:42,030
I see.

809
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,460
I was really curious...

810
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,960
about your past that I didn't know.

811
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:49,960
But I got to see you.

812
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,560
- Did I look strange?
- No. You looked cool.

813
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,960
A man from Goryeo.

814
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:04,590
Yes. That's why I'm saying this.

815
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:09,220
I'm saying this because today is just about right.

816
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,530
I'm saying this because you are still shining.

817
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,030
I'm saying this because...

818
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,490
you were that first love.

819
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,890
On another day that is just about right,

820
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,290
will you be my bride?

823
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,820
For a long, long time...

824
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:29,390
Goodbye.

825
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,060
Goodbye.

826
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,920
Is this our happy ending?

827
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,190
That is...

828
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,820
the instincts of that moment...

829
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:44,920
and completely...

830
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,660
one human being's choice.

831
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,690
I'm sorry.

832
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,890
I'm so sorry.
