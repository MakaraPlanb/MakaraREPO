Are they Men in Black? (Referring to the movie, Men

You should get out.

25
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,209
Get your things, too.

26
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,169
Did you get hurt? Where?

27
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,159
Hurt... that is...

28
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,709
What?

29
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,268
"Did you get hurt?" How can you ask that?

30
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,869
When you sliced the car like that?

31
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:36,299
Wait here for a while.

32
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,298
What are you going to do?

33
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,199
Are you going to kill them?

34
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,799
You're not going to kill them, right?

35
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,718
- No.
- You always say, "No."

36
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:58,988
You also came with the Grim Reaper. Do
you think that man came to save me?

37
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,669
That sounds more natural.

38
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:08,358
Don't worry. I won't kill them.
It's just to show how angry I am,

39
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,909
so that they would think
that dying would be better.

40
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,698
Aigoo!

41
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,298
Save us!

42
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,258
Save us! Please save us!

43
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,368
Save us please!

44
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,528
For two days, this road
will disappear on the map.

45
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,868
It means that you won't have any luck
to be found by someone for two days.

46
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:44,038
It might hurt like you're dying but you won't die.
Fortunately, the police will discover you after two days.

47
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:50,139
You will pay for your crime at the police station. You
should be thankful that you didn't have to pay me.

48
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,729
At times, a god is hiding
among those you bully.

49
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,439
Say your thanks to that child.

50
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:12,098
You two had a fight. That's all.
You didn't see anything.

51
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:16,909
Ah. You won't be able to reconcile forever.

52
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,699
A car...

53
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,579
You didn't bring one?

54
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,868
We don't usually go around in cars.

55
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:45,329
Ah.

56
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,018
Perhaps...

57
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:53,259
I'm asking, just in case. Am I dead?

58
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,628
Is this road the way to the afterlife?

59
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,518
This is just a countryside road.
We just saved you earlier.

60
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,568
Then are you going to kill me now?

61
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:08,968
Am I captured? Alive?

62
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:13,858
<i>I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we
going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?</i>

63
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:18,428
<i>Calm down. We are with a 19-year-old
who isn't done getting mad.</i>

64
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:21,758
I never knew the two of
you were this close.

65
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,458
For someone who asked to be saved, what should
I do when you bring along the Grim Reaper?

66
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,798
<i>I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we
going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?</i>

67
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,659
Keep quiet!

68
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,789
Why are you shouting?

69
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:49,739
Why does this road not
have a single car pass by?

70
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:56,198
<i>Someone made it so that no car
would pass this road for two days.</i>

71
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,989
<i>I said keep quiet!</i>

72
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:19,979
Why haven't you left yet?
You said you were leaving.

73
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,828
Soon.

74
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,208
Ah. Don't mind me. I didn't ask
because I was really curious.

75
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,419
I know.

76
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,698
But how did you come? I wasn't able
to blow out the lighter earlier.

77
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,628
I'm not sure. I think I just heard you.

78
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:38,238
"Save me" or something like that.

79
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,238
I just thought to myself though.

80
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,329
Maybe you thought aloud.

81
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,598
You could have chosen not to come.

82
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,709
There was no reason not to come.

83
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:58,018
I'm sorry then. You came to save someone who
is not even your bride in your busy schedule.

84
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,668
I did some research.

85
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,758
You were right when you said
I was living on a bonus.

86
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,649
I heard you saved me and
my mom 19 years ago.

87
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,829
So I'm fine being a bonus now.

88
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:19,288
It was thanks to being born
that I was able to meet my mom,

89
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,858
so I've decided to not dislike you.

90
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,779
- It looks like you dislike me.
- No, I don't.

91
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,908
If I met you again by any chance,
I really wanted to tell you that.

92
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,739
I'm sure you wished not to meet me.

93
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,919
- I think you dislike me, for sure.
- No, I don't.

94
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:44,098
From now on, I won't
summon you or think of you

95
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:48,348
and I won't do anything. So you
should be rest assured and leave.

96
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:53,208
I hope your household stays in peace
and I hope you meet a good person.

97
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,798
A pretty someone who
discovers your sincere self.

98
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,509
Ah, not the face but the heart.
You said you don't look at faces.

99
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,798
It's all cooked so you should eat.
I will be going then.

100
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,679
Wait.

101
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,769
I didn't eat but I'm paying?

102
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,178
It was your idea to eat.

103
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,838
I also didn't eat.

104
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,308
And... I don't have money.

105
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,219
Then I'll pay. You give your time.
Eat before you go.

106
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,928
Right now... are you feeding me dinner?

107
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,538
Yeah.

108
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,579
There's no way those men fed
you before abducting you.

109
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,828
I don't want to. I don't
want to eat with you.

110
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,529
If you want to, then pack it for me. I will
thankfully accept the spicy rice cakes.

111
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:48,829
You do dislike me.

112
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,958
Here, Uncle, listen carefully.

113
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:00,848
Eun Tak lost her parents when she was young.
She was abused by her aunt and her cousins.

114
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:03,528
Shabashaba... How much did she cry?
(Kid's Korean Cinderella song)

115
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:08,068
Who made her cry? Her
aunt and those siblings.

116
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,258
There's no need to search deeply. The
whole neighborhood knows about it.

117
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,558
Eun Tak's mom left an insurance
payout of $1.5 million.

118
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,469
Since they won't be able to control the money once she
becomes a legal adult, the aunt must be really abusing her.

119
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:21,859
Why are you looking at me like that?

120
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,438
I'm in the middle of being shocked
about how useful you are.

121
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,368
A chaebol has to

122
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:29,318
use money and power to look
into a person's background...

123
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,998
- Where did you get the pictures from?
- I took them while on stakeout.

124
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,988
But I didn't see Eun Tak. She must be busy.

125
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,599
What is that?

126
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,939
Me. It came out nicely.

127
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,008
By the way, Uncle, why did you
ask me to look into this?

128
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,728
To punish them.

129
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,808
How?

130
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,968
Uncle, are you feeling okay?

131
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,178
Is this punishment? It's gold.

132
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,088
How could you give gold as punishment?

133
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,348
- What about me?
- You worked hard.

134
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,218
Why? What about me?

135
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,168
Why can't I receive that?

136
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,138
Didn't I commit a lot of sins?

137
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:09,349
Aren't I deserving of a huge punishment?

138
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,689
Those bastards. Did they catch her or not?
Why aren't they calling me?

139
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:25,728
Keep quiet, you punks! Your
mother is worried sick here!

140
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,878
Laughing here?

141
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:32,598
That money is about to go into
the bellies of those thugs.

142
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,488
You borrowed it yourself anyway.

143
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,758
Oh, right. I should have
starved you to death.

144
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,938
It's no different now, either.

145
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:44,288
Right. I was the crazy bitch.

146
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:47,849
What was I thinking to have
two kids a year apart...

147
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:01,258
- What is that?
- It's gold, you bitch!

148
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,628
Wow, Ji Eun Tak. She changed
all that money into gold.

149
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:06,088
There was a reason why she
insisted there was no bank book.

150
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,358
This is why there's no bank book.

151
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,288
As soon as the sun rises, let's go to the
pawnshop. Let's split it equally. Equally.

152
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,578
Just you try to pull some tricks.

153
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,228
This bastard... I'm your mom!

154
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:17,818
Give it to me.

155
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,749
Let go! Let go!

156
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:57,129
Mom! Wake up! That bitch
Kyeong Mi ran with the gold!

157
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,779
That crazy bitch!

158
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:03,118
Why is the line busy the whole time?

159
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,878
I know. The line is busy now.

160
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,449
With which bastard is she talking to?

161
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,458
She's talking to this bastard! Hang up!

162
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,288
Hurry! Hurry and grab a taxi!

163
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,788
Taxi! Taxi!

164
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,468
- I'm in a hurry.
- Get out of the way. Move!

165
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,769
Mister, go!

166
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,398
Yes, Grandfather, Uncle is eating...

167
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:30,249
He has a spoonful and I even
put some kimchi on for him.

168
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,118
Seollongtang (beef bone soup).

169
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,429
Yes, yes.

170
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:39,918
But, Grandfather, about the card... Hello?

171
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,929
Hello?

172
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:47,038
Honestly, if you could just say
a word then this problem...

173
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,129
Uncle, are you listening?

174
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,048
What are you watching? What?

175
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,069
Television.

176
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,678
He's a pitiful person. I should not be getting mad
at such a pitiful person, a 3rd generation chaebol.

177
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,848
He was exactly at that age.

178
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,268
Who was?

179
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,888
The king I protected.

180
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,488
He was 17 years old.

181
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:12,428
You protected a king? Awesome!

182
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,808
Uncle, were you a Nae-si, by chance? (Nae-si
means eunuch - sounds like four-o-clock)

183
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,929
No, I was an Oh-si.
(between 11 to 1)

184
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:21,968
He's a pitiful person, Deok Hwa.
He needs your help now.

185
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,889
The most splendid hour of the day.

186
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,629
I was blinded

187
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,559
and ceaselessly blamed someone.

188
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:37,688
Was it the king or god?

189
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,249
Or myself?

190
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,829
I forgot that.

191
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:51,638
<i>Him?</i>

192
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,058
What?

193
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,648
My rage of 1,000 years. The reincarnation
of the king that killed me.

194
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:58,308
Look closely.

195
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,498
Did he get reincarnated?

196
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,978
I don't know. If he's reincarnated,
he'll be just that age.

197
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:05,199
Eunuch. Eunuch. Your Highness. Eunuch.

198
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:09,958
Forget him. The hatred and sense of
revenge is making you miserable...

199
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,679
Then are you happy because
you can't remember?

200
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,968
I can't know by just looking.
I need to touch him to know.

201
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:19,228
- What is?
- How am I supposed to utilize you?

202
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,018
What can you find out with touching?

203
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:26,159
Then again, why do you think he
would be reincarnated as a man?

204
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,968
- Is it her?
- I can't know with just watching. I need to touch to know.

205
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,848
What happens if you touch? What?

206
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,528
It's her! Say that it's her.
I'm prepared to forgive.

207
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,018
- I thought it was a rage of 1,000 years.
- He must have had his reasons.

208
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,348
As you know a rage is everywhere
then nowhere... Where are you going?

209
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:49,279
What happens if you touch? Why are
you only talking among yourselves?

210
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,679
Aigoo, aigoo.

211
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,869
Oppa!

212
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,498
Greetings, Senior. I'm Grim
Reaper Kim of '22 class.

213
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,518
Greetings, Senior. I'm Grim
Reaper Kim of '23 class.

214
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,518
You're working hard. Sit down.

215
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,938
Yes, we will work hard.

216
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,458
Aigoo, so new.

217
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:29,218
There was a time we were like that, too.

218
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,898
Class of '22, Reaper Kim.

219
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,859
- Rest.
- Yes, we will work hard.

220
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:38,628
You're here. By the way, Seniors,

221
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,048
why aren't you checking the company email?
You know the miscellaneous omitted persons?

222
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:45,168
It's been approved and
they've made a task force.

223
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:47,568
I hope you submit the list
before the end of the year.

224
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,838
I don't have any. You've got two, right?

225
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,558
Who says? Who said I have two?

226
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,429
Everyone says you have two.

227
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,388
- I'll submit it soon.
- I'd appreciate that.

228
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,998
It's time for me to go now.

229
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,599
I'll see you at the winter workshop.

230
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,009
Aigoo, work hard.

231
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,099
That's her. Her.

232
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:28,059
Greetings, Seniors. I'm
Reaper Kim of class of '23.

233
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,928
- Ah, yes.
- Nice to meet you all.

234
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,179
Go on.

235
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,598
So pretty.

236
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,998
She should be an angel.
Why is she a grim reaper?

237
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:44,898
Her class is so excited because of her.

238
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:49,229
You are the one who's so excited
because of her from our class.

239
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,758
Move out of the way!

240
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,018
Oppa! Oppa!

241
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,598
Are you alright?

242
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,858
Then I will be going now.

243
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,068
Bye. And also,

244
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,198
we have a company dinner
at the end of the month.

245
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:09,769
There's a penalty if you miss out.
I hope you miss out.

Reaper Kim of class of '22.

247
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,818
Did you call the OR?

248
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,428
We don't have time! Hurry up!

249
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,038
Mr. Choi Young Jae?

250
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,148
I'm sorry, later. The
guardian should wait outside.

251
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,618
Age: 33. Byeongshin Year,
Moosul Month, Gisa Day.

252
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:32,839
Died at 17:41. Cause: Overwork.

253
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,379
It's you, right?

254
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,998
Am I... dead?

255
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:44,329
Hey! Choi Young Jae!

256
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,968
Choi Young Jae!

257
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,348
No, Oppa.

258
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:51,358
Young Jae...

259
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,858
- Oppa!
- Choi Young Jae!

260
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:56,898
Young Jae...

261
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,809
Oppa!

262
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,388
Thanks to your emergency treatment

263
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,409
this patient is saved.

264
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,609
The vitals are stable.
The patient is alive.

265
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,919
It's a relief.

No. Why can't this be refunded?

<i>I already told you earlier, customer. If you don't
have the receipt then we can't give you a refund.</i>

<i>I'm not sure if I bought a

Look. If there's something
like this in a book

280
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:52,528
then what should I do? Give me a refund.

281
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:55,682
I already told you. You need
to bring your receipt...

282
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,322
I will buy that.

283
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,772
Are you the owner of this memory?

284
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:04,761
Yes, yes. It's my memory. I will buy it.

285
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,811
It doesn't have an
evidence that it's yours.

286
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:11,172
Try to guess which neighborhood
this leaf came from.

287
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,872
But then, even if I tell the
name of the neighboorhood

288
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:17,942
you wouldn't know.

289
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,782
That's right.

290
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:26,991
I thought I lost it. Thank you.

291
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:32,261
I get that. I think you're past
the age to be reading that.

292
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,832
No, just for research.

293
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,998
What about you? Why this book?

294
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,731
Ah. I know a goblin.

295
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:44,991
- Huh?
- What?

296
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,782
Doesn't everyone know a goblin?

297
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:48,821
Really?

298
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:51,142
What do you mean, really, Young Woman?

299
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:54,362
What do you say when someone
asks for the deposit? "No."

300
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,052
This closet is nice.

301
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:59,602
"I don't want to."
What if someone asks to buy you snacks?

302
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:01,232
Get lost.

303
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:05,528
Pay for the book. $10 dollars.

304
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:07,662
Until when do I have to sit?

305
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,722
I'm sorry.

306
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:13,891
But,

307
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,312
this book should be
considered a used book, no?

308
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,942
No, I don't want to.

309
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,292
Get lost.

310
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,022
Uncle!

311
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,842
G- G-Grandfather.

312
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:48,582
I came to see how he was doing
coming from the dry cleaners.

313
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,161
But then, I see there was a visitor.

314
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:55,088
Ah. A vi-visitor.

315
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:57,682
Who are you?

316
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,782
My uncle's house...

317
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:02,192
for what reason did you come?

318
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:13,141
I am... that person's friend.
I came to play.

319
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,581
Ah! You came to play at
your friend's place.

320
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:18,092
I see you're a very close
friend of my Uncle's.

321
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:20,081
Because Uncle is going overseas

322
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,422
you must have came to say goodbye.

323
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,282
Farewell.

324
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:33,332
Be careful of your health.
Don't come ever again.

325
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,981
I hope you'll be happy and
until you die over there...

326
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:38,522
Farewell to you. You and I aren't close.

327
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:41,142
Hurry and go out from my house.
Don't ever come back.

328
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:42,778
Uncle, why are you acting this way?

329
00:33:42,802 --> 00:33:44,371
Towards your really really close friend.

330
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:45,502
Do you think it isn't right?

331
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:48,672
You leave also. Really really quickly.

332
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,788
Wow. How could he do that?
Isn't he too much?

333
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,201
That's what I'm saying.

334
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:56,451
Right? How could he kick me out too?

335
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,272
Would a real uncle really do that to me?

336
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,382
- He will be going soon.
- That should be the case.

337
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:10,631
If not, you will be the one to go.

338
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,031
Somewhere.

339
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:15,952
That place isn't somewhere good, right?

340
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:21,268
- Come in.
- No thanks.

341
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,832
- No matter how much you plead...
- Not you.

342
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:26,052
You go to your own house to get scolded.

343
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,592
1-0.

344
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:43,062
Me? Get scolded? Why will I be scolded?

345
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:47,282
Did you perhaps tell Grandpa everything?

346
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,111
Wow! So petty!

347
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:53,258
How much did you tell him? I should
know so that I would match things up.

348
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:56,362
Did you match with me when you
put the house up for rent?

349
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:07,331
I can't go. Where would I go?

350
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:09,592
Even if I die, I will be
a ghost of this house.

351
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:18,212
Oh yeah.

352
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,742
<i>Good Night 1:1.</i>

353
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,252
Blood... right?

354
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,972
Hey! Grim Reaper! Aren't you
going to clean this up?

355
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:47,051
Hey! I'm sorry! Clean this up.

356
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:48,462
Yes?

357
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,862
You,

358
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,782
do you sleep here?

359
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:06,721
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you
but I keep missing the timing.

360
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:09,132
I'm really sorry.

361
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:11,642
But how did you know?

362
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:17,122
I don't brush my teeth in the store.

363
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,382
I have another proof.

364
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:27,641
<i>Boss, honestly</i>

365
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:30,692
<i>I sleep in the store.</i>

366
00:36:35,122 --> 00:36:39,892
<i>Boss, can I inconvenience you a bit?</i>

367
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:48,531
<i>Boss, I'm sleeping in the shop for now.</i>

368
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:50,432
<i>As that's my situation for now.</i>

369
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,471
<i>I stayed here well.</i>

370
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:57,972
<i>I got kicked out of the house.
Please save me.</i>

371
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:02,892
- I'm sorry.
- Is it because of your aunt?

372
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:04,822
That's also the reason.

373
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:08,932
I ran out of places to go.

374
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,881
Aren't you going to ask more?

375
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:13,991
What's the use of asking? It's
not like it will get solved.

376
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:17,562
I'm just doing what I can help solve it.

377
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,822
Here, your pay for one week.

378
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:23,861
I will give you your pay weekly. Why?

379
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:26,762
If I give it to you monthly,
you might not get it.

380
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:29,921
Even if you do sleep here,
go to the sauna and wash up

381
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:32,182
and order out to eat.

382
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:40,292
Thank you.

383
00:37:40,312 --> 00:37:44,032
If you're that thankful after receiving what
you should get, people will belittle you.

384
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,852
Not for the money

385
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:48,268
but I am thankful for your coolness.

386
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:51,222
That money is cool, part-timer.

387
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:54,522
Go and wash up. Grill one
squid before you go.

388
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,332
Are you going to drink?

389
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:00,052
No, just the squid. I can't
even put my lips near alcohol.

390
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,772
- Because I get drunk if I drink too much.
- What?

391
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:45,212
No! No! Cancel that!

392
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,812
You must have been reading a book.

393
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:16,712
I'm someone who is near a book and has
deep taste in music and paintings.

394
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:21,821
I'm sorry for disturbing your reading.

395
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:24,981
I know. Why disturb me? You
said you won't be calling me.

396
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:26,911
I didn't. It was a mistake.

397
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:30,692
While grilling the squid, the leg
caught on fire and I blew it.

398
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:33,611
Was it tasty?

399
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:36,031
Why are you here? Haven't you left yet?

400
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:40,202
I was packing my things. I was
packing my books. A lot of books.

401
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,472
Well then, since I need to finish packing.

402
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,461
- Wait...
- You always talk to me when I'm about to go.

403
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:49,831
It's you who's always leaving
when I'm about to say something.

404
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:52,061
- I have something I'm curious about.
- I'm not giving you $5,000 (oh baek).

405
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:56,801
That startled me. I heard it as
you won't confess (go beak).

406
00:39:56,802 --> 00:40:00,842
It's because you always say
things that are out of place.

407
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:02,301
From where did it start to be my fault?

408
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:06,231
From there. From where I
should see something.

409
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:10,162
That's why, what should I see?

410
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:13,132
In order to have effective value to you.

411
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:18,032
Are you going to say you
see it if I tell you?

412
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:21,792
No. Even if I see it I'm
going to say I don't.

413
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:25,152
If I see that, what if you
start treating me better?

414
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:28,578
What if you give me $5,000, buy me
meat or ask me if I want anything?

415
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:32,861
Then it would be very tiring for me.
You're not that good.

416
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:34,221
It's my first time hearing that.

417
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:38,462
Really! Really! It's my first time hearing that. Where
are you looking at when an adult is talking to you?

418
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,672
Don't answer if you don't want to.

419
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:45,801
That... don't you see anything unique?

420
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:49,792
Something that looks painful.

421
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:55,391
Ah that...

422
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:57,961
- You see?
- I thought it was something great.

423
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:00,881
Goodbye. I'm busy so I will get going.

424
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:04,022
Hey, do you want to eat meat? Do you
have something you want to have?

425
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:09,831
- $5,000.
- You said you were busy. Hurry up and go.

426
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:12,392
Then meat. This way.

427
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:38,731
It's the last meat. Do you see it?

428
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:43,532
Yes. It looks really tasty.

429
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:47,232
I ate well.

430
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:50,602
I'm asking if you see it?
You don't see it, right?

431
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:54,282
Are you getting mad at me right now?

432
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,632
- Did you hear it that way?
- Yes.

433
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:02,961
I'm sorry.

434
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:07,092
I was going to ask about the fresh juice
but the tone of my voice went up, right?

435
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:12,342
Fresh fruit juice?

436
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:18,091
What do want to drink? You
can order an expensive one.

437
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:22,432
I'm full though. This one, large size.

438
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,881
Aren't you full?

439
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:28,132
Me too, the same one.

440
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,931
I will help you with the bill.

441
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:32,902
She's asking about the bill.

442
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:35,252
I won't pay for it.

443
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:39,931
What's with you? I though you
said you don't like fruit.

444
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,411
What's with you? Is there
anyone you will kill in here?

445
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,581
I'm a regular here.

446
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:50,031
Perhaps, is it me? The one
that will die here today?

447
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:54,681
Perhaps... you lured me with beef

448
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:58,511
and juice. I got caught with
the two of you in it together?

449
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:03,492
It's a misunderstanding. Honestly,
I am on the same side as you.

450
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:10,291
<i>You see the sword. You see the sword.</i>

451
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:13,361
<i>You will take that sword.</i>

452
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:15,071
What are you doing?

453
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:18,461
What do you mean? Why are
you on the same side as me?

454
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,781
What is she? Why isn't she getting it?

455
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:22,681
She's someone who overcomes
everything you expect.

456
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:25,492
That means the files would be no joke.

457
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:31,882
Then, spend a good time. I
have prior appointments.

458
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,851
He really must have came just to
drink juice. That's something new.

459
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:43,551
But then, why did he say he
was on the same side as me?

460
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:46,232
It's the matters with the gods.
You don't need to know.

461
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:52,201
But then, isn't that ahjussi
uselessly handsome?

462
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:56,861
One needs to be handsome for people to
follow well, do they choose it that way?

463
00:43:56,862 --> 00:44:00,342
Are all grim reapers handsome?

464
00:44:01,052 --> 00:44:02,271
Is that handsome?

465
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,491
Yes! That is handsome.

466
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,452
Then what about me?

467
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:16,202
Ahjussi... you just look.

468
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:23,262
Don't drink this. You are full.

469
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:29,392
Oh, that ahjussi is also handsome.
The water must be nice here.

470
00:44:36,582 --> 00:44:41,872
<i>I will be there soon. See you soon.
I love you.</i>

471
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:48,062
Honey. I miss you so I
will hurry and go there.

472
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,341
What are you doing?

473
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:07,762
Something anyone would do.

474
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:10,731
Are you alright?

475
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,432
Magic.

476
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,891
Oh my. I'm sorry.

477
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:17,411
I'll untie it.

478
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:19,382
Yes?

479
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:33,372
Ahh!

480
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:37,771
I'm so sorry.

481
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:41,192
- No.
- It's untangled.

482
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:58,902
Are you alright?

483
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:04,971
Yes. Today is a really strange day.

484
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:08,531
As if I was caught in a magic.

485
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,841
That's why I'm asking,
do you have a boyfriend?

486
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,981
No. My family's very strict.

487
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:16,852
So they were strict.

488
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:20,351
Do you have a girlfriend?

489
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:24,662
I've been single since birth,
because I was waiting for you.

490
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:31,831
Kiss. Kiss.

491
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,371
Kiss!

492
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,381
Are you Cupid?

493
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:38,451
That was that, right?

494
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:44,032
Every 100 years, 1 or 2 people are born
with the same face from the previous life.

495
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:46,702
For that, I know the man's previous life.

496
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:50,741
That woman was not to lose that man.

497
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:53,921
Wow. What is the past life?

498
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:57,402
Is that the man who saved a country
that I have only heard about?

499
00:46:58,512 --> 00:47:04,301
He was worse than a landlord that
extorted his tenant farmers.

500
00:47:04,302 --> 00:47:08,261
But why did you help? Are you
also granting bad guy's wishes?

501
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:11,641
Where do you find that? You
make nice people lose hope.

502
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:18,211
I'm not their guardian god, but rather the guardian
god of the man and woman those two just lost.

503
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:20,341
<i>I love you.</i>

504
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,201
<i>I love you too.</i>

505
00:47:22,202 --> 00:47:24,101
<i>I miss you so I will hurry over.</i>

506
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:27,011
<i>Don't hurry, just slow down or
else you'll get hurt. Okay?</i>

507
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,861
Wow!

508
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,291
The man was a liar and a coward.

509
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,101
And the woman was ungrateful.

510
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:37,981
Now, those two will be each other's hell.

511
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,051
Wow. That's pretty cool.

512
00:47:40,052 --> 00:47:45,892
I make those magic-like moments
for humans once in a while.

513
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:52,962
But then, from earlier, why are you
talking like in historical dramas?

514
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:57,112
Just when I thought I figured you out.

515
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:03,371
Of course. Is my life like this

516
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:06,641
because I committed a
huge sin in my past life?

517
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:11,642
Is the punishment being
born as the goblin's bride?

518
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:21,801
I don't know what you were in your past life. In the present life, it's
still early to tell at 19 years old. And you are not the goblin's bride.

519
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:24,011
You're not falling for it.

520
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:27,511
My life's been full of lots of misery
and hardships, but I like my life too.

521
00:48:27,512 --> 00:48:31,321
I received a lot of love from my mom.
I now have an umbrella.

522
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:33,922
And it's nice to have met you.

523
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:41,152
It was nice. It's in past tense.

524
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:47,051
You also have grudges. You haven't
answered whether you see it or not.

525
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,611
Do you see it or not?

526
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:56,392
My mom said this. A person needs to recognize where he's supposed to lay
down before stretching out his legs and know when it's time to leave.

527
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:00,491
You understand what I mean, right?

528
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:02,342
I don't.

529
00:49:03,192 --> 00:49:06,522
It means we're only until here.

530
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,752
I will be going this way. Goodbye.

Wow. That's pretty cool.

539
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:26,981
Uncle, you looked like a painting just now.
What about the uncle down the hall?

540
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,851
- Not yet.
- Well, he must be working overtime.

541
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:35,661
Uncle. You see, I might become a grim
reaper like the uncle down the hall.

542
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:38,971
If you open the last room in hallway
of life, there is death, isn't it?

543
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:40,741
And the one to greet you is
the uncle down the hall.

544
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:44,541
Wake up. There's no chance with you.

545
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:49,771
I don't like to say this but in order to become
a grim reaper you need to commit a big sin...

546
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:52,801
Big sin? What?

547
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:53,981
How did you know?

548
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:56,581
Heol! Daebak! (Awesome)
Is he really a murderer?

549
00:50:56,582 --> 00:50:58,961
Wow! You can never know
with a person's face.

550
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:03,141
Not that. How did you
know he is a grim reaper?

551
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:07,281
Uncle, don't you feel like
your question is a bit late?

552
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:12,681
That time, when you were depressed and you were creating clouds and whatnot
in the living room. When the uncle down the hall came in, I was so nervous.

553
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:14,681
But then that uncle didn't
change his expression.

554
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:18,861
<i>- What's wrong with him?</i>
- And with me in there you just said yourselves about grim reaper and stuff.

555
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:21,191
<i>Grim Reaper who's saying all sorts
of things in front of the kid.</i>

556
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:23,741
<i>I hope you don't find the grim
reaper's ability laughable.</i>

557
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:29,442
Was that all? His face is all white and
such red lips and wears all black clothes.

558
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:34,182
I thought it was some celebrity.
Then I will be going then.

559
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:50,161
You. How did you know I was a grim reaper?

560
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:55,321
If you do this, then how could I not know?
A person who was there is now here!

561
00:51:55,322 --> 00:52:01,211
Please be careful! Both of
you are so uncontrollable.

562
00:52:01,212 --> 00:52:04,711
I got caught because of you.
Goblin who talks about others.

563
00:52:04,712 --> 00:52:10,222
Look at how you look, if it's because of me. Grim
Reaper who might be a murderer in his past life!

564
00:52:23,022 --> 00:52:28,011
You, it's not like you haven't killed
a single ant and not punished!

565
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,232
Tsk.

566
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:38,561
He must be so hurt. What should we do?

567
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:41,502
Don't you see that I'm not
all that inclined either?

568
00:52:43,102 --> 00:52:45,502
A big sin?

569
00:52:52,082 --> 00:53:00,082
<i>Unfilial, disloyal, immodest,
unrestricted, unvirtuous.</i>

570
00:53:02,852 --> 00:53:05,901
Let's not go there. It won't be that.

571
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:08,491
<i>Yeah. It's not.</i>

572
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:11,692
Why? Why are you here?

573
00:53:15,522 --> 00:53:21,701
A responsible action. The effort of the
better person, most would call it apology.

574
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:24,942
I was too much earlier. I'm sorry.

575
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:29,151
Among these, what is not?

576
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:30,551
- Unfilial?
- Get out.

577
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:32,541
I was also too much just now.
I thought you would laugh.

578
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,342
Get out.

579
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,371
What's so important about the past life?

580
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:39,551
It's not important to me what you did
or what you were in the past life.

581
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:44,002
- Really?
- Yeah. Because whatever you were, it's unchanging how I don't like you.

582
00:53:50,282 --> 00:53:52,511
I can't laugh.

583
00:53:52,512 --> 00:53:57,161
Even when they first met, I thought Uncle
would kick out the uncle down the hall.

584
00:53:57,162 --> 00:54:00,681
But on the contrary they are
cozily getting along well.

585
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:04,221
One person is miserable from
forgetting the past life

586
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:08,321
and one person is miserable for
not forgetting the past life.

587
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:13,222
Among those two existence they
are relying on each other.

588
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,111
We are just

589
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:22,661
people who are shortly
passing in their long life.

590
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:25,302
I see.

591
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:31,231
But you already knew too?
Jeez, those uncles.

592
00:54:31,232 --> 00:54:33,771
I worry they might get detected outside.

593
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:37,111
You just worry about yourself.

594
00:54:37,112 --> 00:54:41,322
Stretch arms out. And back.

595
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:45,291
No way I am your real grandson.

596
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,621
You would never treat your
real grandson like this.

597
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,482
I'm going to take revenge.

598
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:23,039
As you already know, this is the
building I got for my 9th birthday.

599
00:55:23,063 --> 00:55:25,712
I do know. What did you get
for your 8th birthday?

600
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,602
I received dislike. But
that was all in the past.

601
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:32,392
- And now as I grew to be an adult...
- You are still being disliked, I'm sure you know.

602
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:34,452
Since you use the card a
lot without consideration.

603
00:55:34,453 --> 00:55:36,442
So you stopped it.

604
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:41,382
So I'm telling you this. I'm trying to
find out how to cash out on this building.

605
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,652
So start with vacating this place.
Make it costless and tidy.

606
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:46,952
First, start with that
chicken shop that's folded.

607
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:50,752
There's something you need
to know first. First,

608
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:57,372
that chicken shop has a sign that says
"closed" which means it's closed, not folded.

609
00:55:57,373 --> 00:56:02,402
Second, we didn't come together. I tailed
you, by the order of the chairman, right?

610
00:56:02,403 --> 00:56:07,902
What kind of a tailing is so open...
well I thought we came together.

611
00:56:07,903 --> 00:56:12,672
Let's do this then. Soon, a phone call will come
to the secretary's office. A woman will ask this.

612
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:17,792
If I work there. Then you can just
tell her I do work there. That's it.

613
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:20,312
But you don't.

614
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:24,092
Secretary Kim is seriously...
working so upright.

615
00:56:24,093 --> 00:56:27,083
My grandpa must feel so sturdy.

616
00:56:28,783 --> 00:56:34,983
I need to get a new card.
Please? Just once?

617
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:49,952
Where are you going?

618
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,842
- Supermarket.
- Supermarket?

619
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:56,053
Your repertoire is getting
more and more insincere.

620
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:58,812
You don't see that I'm
carrying a shopping tote?

621
00:56:58,813 --> 00:57:01,343
I didn't know it was a shopping tote.

622
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:14,452
How can you actually follow me?
You don't trust me?

623
00:57:14,453 --> 00:57:16,313
Have you made yourself trustworthy?

624
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:20,762
You were going to go to her but since I was going
to follow you, you came to the supermarket.

625
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:24,192
Last time at the cafe too. You brought
her there but you got caught by me.

626
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:27,412
I'm not going to take her away.
I'm totally rooting for her now.

627
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:30,592
Why are you rooting for her?

628
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:34,492
I'm really on the same team as her. They say
the bride will die if she pulls the sword.

629
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:38,482
Going forever is better
than going abroad, right?

630
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:43,952
She can't see the sword right this moment, but I want
to believe in the miracle that one day she might.

631
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:47,093
I'm wagered my life on that day.

632
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:52,173
There are lots of people watching here.

633
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:00,682
Alright. Just promise me one thing.

634
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:02,452
What, suddenly? What promise?

635
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:05,283
That you won't touch that kid if I leave.

636
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:09,782
Really? You're really leaving?

637
00:58:09,783 --> 00:58:12,032
However,

638
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:15,992
the moment you try to take her away, I
will come straight back to that house.

639
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,423
So leave her be.

640
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:22,052
When are you leaving?

641
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:24,873
The day after tomorrow. Happy?

642
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:20,912
You weren't detected?

643
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:25,092
How can you come to the house? If
my aunt finds out, we're all dead.

644
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:26,972
My aunt's family is asleep?

645
00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:27,833
I don't know.

646
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:30,293
You scared me.

647
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:38,122
But what brings you to my house?

648
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:40,283
To see me?

649
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:44,183
Should I?

650
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:47,012
What did you say?

651
00:59:47,013 --> 00:59:50,183
I guess I thought of you. Briefly.

652
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:54,353
So I guess I came to see you.

653
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:58,052
Why?

654
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:01,442
I'm not a bride and I'm not pretty.

655
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:05,543
You keep having to save my life
and I'm just a pest to you.

656
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:10,293
Why would you come see me?

657
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:14,043
I guess I wanted to see this.

658
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:25,252
Now that I saw it, I'll leave. Your aunt's family
disappeared. The house is vacant, so you can go in.

659
01:00:25,253 --> 01:00:28,242
My aunt's family's disappeared?
Really? When?

660
01:00:28,243 --> 01:00:30,662
But how come you came if you didn't know?

661
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:33,742
Oh, I left something here,
so I came to get it.

662
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:35,552
What?

663
01:00:35,553 --> 01:00:37,693
Just something.

664
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,363
You don't need to know.

665
01:00:53,493 --> 01:00:55,212
Alright then.

666
01:00:55,213 --> 01:00:58,562
I'm leaving then.

Excuse me. Oppa in black.

679
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:55,653
You don't need a hairpin?

680
01:01:56,623 --> 01:01:59,482
I don't prefer hairpins.

681
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,022
Then buy one for your lover.

682
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:02,062
I don't have a lover.

683
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:06,253
A lover, you could have then not have.

684
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:10,872
But this, once you buy it,
you'll always have it.

685
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:13,303
See it in a mirror once, Oppa.

686
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,053
How much is this?

687
01:02:56,223 --> 01:03:01,253
But I grabbed it first. Wait, but
you're crying because of it?

688
01:03:03,073 --> 01:03:04,403
What?

689
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:08,473
Want me to concede to you?

690
01:03:18,703 --> 01:03:21,072
I don't want to for free though.

691
01:03:21,073 --> 01:03:23,152
If you give me your phone number.

692
01:03:23,153 --> 01:03:24,742
I don't have that kind of stuff.

693
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:26,923
You don't have a cellphone?

694
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:28,663
Are you poor?

695
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:31,652
I don't really have a need for a cellphone.

696
01:03:31,653 --> 01:03:34,373
Are you sure it's not because you
don't want to give me your number?

697
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:38,213
Concession, cancelled.

698
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:48,023
Give me your number. Write it down
and leave it here, with the ring.

699
01:03:49,673 --> 01:03:54,912
First, let's exchange our names. You'll
need to know my name to call me.

700
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:56,753
Nice to meet you.

701
01:03:57,953 --> 01:03:59,823
I'm Sunny.

702
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:11,933
Seon Hyo?

703
01:04:16,163 --> 01:04:22,023
If that's better for you, go with that. It's just
a stage name so it doesn't really matter what.

704
01:04:28,633 --> 01:04:30,812
Card?

705
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:32,643
Cash?

706
01:04:33,413 --> 01:04:36,282
Who's going to pay?

707
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:39,552
It doesn't matter who pays.

708
01:04:39,553 --> 01:04:44,953
Both will end up paying a
very expensive price anyway.

709
01:05:24,723 --> 01:05:26,243
I...

710
01:05:28,453 --> 01:05:30,483
came late.

711
01:06:48,053 --> 01:06:53,112
<i>I'm fine.</i>

712
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:58,303
<i>This is also my fate.</i>

713
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:05,653
<i>So go. Don't stop and go to the king.</i>

714
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:35,532
You're really going to be like this?

715
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:39,883
I heard you're not even the goblin bride.
Just come with me then.

716
01:07:40,573 --> 01:07:42,012
Mean girl.

717
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:46,882
You won't listen to me, right?
Fine, I'm just babbling myself.

718
01:07:46,883 --> 01:07:51,193
I'm going to play foul on
all those people you know.

719
01:07:52,983 --> 01:07:55,423
I'm going to kill that woman first.

720
01:07:57,623 --> 01:08:03,052
The &+### shoe! I'll just &#@!

721
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:06,482
Scary. Hey, that woman's scary.

722
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,832
Boss. Are you alright?

723
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,422
Be honest.

724
01:08:11,423 --> 01:08:16,282
Is my beauty gone these days? I
totally got the vibe though.

725
01:08:16,283 --> 01:08:19,362
He should totally be calling by
now and then some. Why isn't he?

726
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:22,522
Oh, the ring? That man?

727
01:08:22,523 --> 01:08:25,012
- First, please calm...
- I can't calm down.

728
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:27,792
He's the best-looking man I've ever seen.

729
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:31,543
Do you see how hard I work? How I
drink this everyday for good skin?

730
01:08:32,223 --> 01:08:34,863
But why isn't he calling?

731
01:08:35,673 --> 01:08:40,292
Good-looking men always tend to act
like good-looking men. Just forget him.

732
01:08:40,293 --> 01:08:42,363
How can I forget?!

733
01:08:43,163 --> 01:08:47,043
He's the only man that ever conceded to me.

734
01:08:48,763 --> 01:08:53,923
The ring was pretty though.
It seemed perfect for me.

735
01:09:16,683 --> 01:09:17,842
<i>Do you have a pen?</i>

736
01:09:17,843 --> 01:09:20,853
<i>I don't. Just say it.</i>

737
01:09:21,623 --> 01:09:23,733
<i>That was kind of funny.</i>

738
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:31,123
<i>Is it science?</i>

739
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:35,803
<i>The finishing of a phone
number is the lips, right?</i>

740
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:14,723
Careful.

741
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:18,412
Hello.

742
01:10:18,413 --> 01:10:20,622
What's all this? Is my family moving?

743
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:24,292
You're not in touch with your aunt?
Your aunt said she's moving.

744
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:29,222
A new family is moving in the day after tomorrow
but nothing's ready so I'm suffering here.

745
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:31,912
She moved?

746
01:10:31,913 --> 01:10:34,742
What about me then?

747
01:10:34,743 --> 01:10:36,292
What about me then?

748
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:41,452
How can you ask me that? You need to ask your aunt
that. Your aunt took away all the deposit money.

749
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:44,013
If you have something to take, take it.

750
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:55,923
<i>Lovers</i>

751
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:47,873
Ji Eun Tak.

752
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:54,662
Take out everything that's in
that bag and your pockets.

753
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:56,313
Quickly.

754
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:19,932
Teacher, this...

755
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:24,522
Quiet. I see you have all
sorts of stuff for fire.

756
01:12:24,523 --> 01:12:29,402
Cigarettes? You haven't taken out
cigarettes, do you feel guilty now?

757
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:33,312
Teacher, I really had a reason for this.
I don't smoke cigarettes.

758
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:36,173
The kids said they saw you smoking.

759
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:40,303
Let's get it over quickly shall we?

760
01:12:41,133 --> 01:12:43,323
Hold out your hand.

761
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:47,073
Quickly.

762
01:12:48,313 --> 01:12:49,863
Both of your hands.

763
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,992
Look at how thorough you are.

764
01:12:58,993 --> 01:13:02,263
This is why smart kids are scary.

765
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:11,612
Ji Eun Tak, I find it very scary when
kids like you are good at studying.

766
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:16,212
You act nice and pitiful in front of me but
you'll act completely different behind me.

767
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:19,402
It's kids like you that cause
trouble once in society.

768
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:26,333
And then the truly good people will be
the ones who pay for it, okay, Eun Tak?

769
01:13:44,143 --> 01:13:45,743
Thanks.

770
01:13:49,443 --> 01:13:51,943
Why alcohol all of a sudden?

771
01:13:53,783 --> 01:13:58,192
What about you? How's
alcohol ever suddenly?

772
01:13:58,193 --> 01:14:04,892
The more the better when it comes to wine, women and meat.
I've kept up with the principles plenty when I was a general.

773
01:14:04,893 --> 01:14:07,062
- You were a general?
- Ha

774
01:14:07,063 --> 01:14:10,762
You were never able to ask me about
past before, how could you dare?

775
01:14:10,763 --> 01:14:12,842
But you don't know what I was.

776
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:14,673
What were you?

777
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:20,502
Your stuff?

778
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:22,292
See how you bluff. What, you were a king?

779
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:24,132
Have you packed all your stuff?

780
01:14:24,133 --> 01:14:29,253
Ah, my stuff... well, very simply.

781
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:33,623
Go safely.

782
01:14:34,313 --> 01:14:36,602
- I'll phone.
- You know I don't have a phone.

783
01:14:36,603 --> 01:14:38,663
That's why I said it.

784
01:15:22,723 --> 01:15:28,242
What are you doing? It's driving me crazy. Are
you really like that after one can of beer?

785
01:15:28,243 --> 01:15:30,842
- I don't know where she is.
- Who?

786
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:34,913
She's not summoning me. Since she's
not summoning me I can't find her.

787
01:15:35,563 --> 01:15:39,562
I thought I was omniscient and there
was nothing I couldn't do, but...

788
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:42,293
I can't even find her.

789
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:47,192
All the stuff I have is all just useless.

790
01:15:47,193 --> 01:15:51,443
That's true. Just eating and playing.

791
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,882
Then, what did you do before that?

792
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,652
I have to find her, always like this.

793
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:01,942
Just phone her, wouldn't she have a phone?

794
01:16:01,943 --> 01:16:06,723
Yeah, I don't know her number.

795
01:16:08,873 --> 01:16:10,853
Now it's best if I don't know.

796
01:16:32,893 --> 01:16:34,703
He found her.

797
01:16:52,163 --> 01:16:57,733
Mum, are you doing well?

798
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:05,862

The rain. It'll stop soon.

When you are melancholy it rains?

814
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,073
Yes.

815
01:18:59,103 --> 01:19:03,282
Then when there's a typhoon,
how melancholy are you?

816
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:05,853
That's not me, but the earth's melancholy.

818
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:19,643
The rain's about to stop.

01:19:20,443 --> 01:19:23,243
My mood just got better.

820
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:32,342
I didn't summon you though.

821
01:19:32,343 --> 01:19:34,223
Yes, you didn't summon me.

822
01:19:34,993 --> 01:19:38,123
I've been busy as well, here and there.

823
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:42,313
I've also had a lot to do.

824
01:19:44,603 --> 01:19:46,593
- Now it's going to be a problem.
- What?

825
01:19:47,633 --> 01:19:51,662
Now every time it rains,

826
01:19:51,663 --> 01:19:53,602
I'll think that you must be melancholy.

827
01:19:53,603 --> 01:19:58,963
When I'm already so busy with all the troubles and
hardships in my life, I'll have to worry about you too.

828
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:04,923
Aren't you cold? Why are
you here like this?

829
01:20:07,543 --> 01:20:09,493
Because I'm unhappy.

830
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,813
Now it'll just become a cold.

831
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:17,563
- What?
- My misfortunes.

832
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:23,523
It finds me just when I'm about to forget
and I contract it when it comes time.

833
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:28,713
Well, it doesn't mean that they bother me. <i>[The word for
'bother' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

834
01:20:29,373 --> 01:20:32,042
You're not saying that you know something, right? <i>[The word
for 'bother' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

835
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:34,873
Well, I guess there is something prickling you. <i>[The word for
'prickle' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

836
01:20:35,553 --> 01:20:38,532
Stop saying it. The word that
I hate the most is that.

837
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:41,393
Well then I chose really well!

838
01:20:49,363 --> 01:20:52,673
Keep going with what you're saying.

839
01:20:55,213 --> 01:20:57,612
I expect you won't be able
to hear it without tears.

840
01:20:57,613 --> 01:20:59,653
I'll try to bear it.

841
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:05,882
Do you perhaps know that saying? <i>'To
humans, there are four stages of life.'</i>

842
01:21:05,883 --> 01:21:09,462
<i>'The stage of sewing the seeds, the
stage of watering the sewn seeds,</i>

843
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:13,753
<i>the stage of harvesting the watered seeds,
and the stage of using the harvested seeds.'</i>

844
01:21:14,593 --> 01:21:18,522
How do you know that? That's what
only the deceased says to the dead.

845
01:21:18,523 --> 01:21:21,482
It's my 19th year as a
goblin bride, you know.

846
01:21:21,483 --> 01:21:26,482
I heard what the ghosts were saying.
So it's really unfair.

847
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:31,842
The life that I can't get past,
is just work and work again.

848
01:21:31,843 --> 01:21:33,963
I can't get past the second stage.

849
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:39,303
Mourn.

850
01:21:40,513 --> 01:21:41,592
To a kid?

851
01:21:41,593 --> 01:21:42,982
Then?

852
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:48,452
There's lots. Tap on the shoulder.
Pat my hair. $500?

853
01:21:48,453 --> 01:21:51,252
Ah gosh, your hands?

854
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:55,932
My hands, since they do a lot
of work, have to rest a bit.

855
01:21:55,933 --> 01:22:01,572
Well.. since they are kept for when I
receive important things, like a bouquet.

856
01:22:01,573 --> 01:22:04,102
What? Why?

857
01:22:04,103 --> 01:22:06,213
Forget it.

858
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:14,503
Present.

859
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:26,933
It's pretty right?

860
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,233
- It is pretty.

You asked me yesterday.

It's because I want to keep hearing it.
Since it makes me happy.

874
01:23:58,703 --> 01:24:02,242
- You've got a message.
- No, that's the sound of the doorbell.

875
01:24:02,243 --> 01:24:04,772
It's the first time in 60 years.

01:24:18,383 --> 01:24:21,412
We're not going to see someone
appear from time to time are we?

879
01:24:21,413 --> 01:24:24,722
Why are you being scary like that?

880
01:24:24,723 --> 01:24:26,982
- Go and have a look.
- I can't though.

881
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:30,362
Hey what kind of Grim Reaper who boasts and
is so dignified like that can't do it?

882
01:24:30,363 --> 01:24:31,883
And you?

883
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:35,463
Oh jeez.

884
01:24:40,323 --> 01:24:43,292
Isn't this the Goblin's residence?

885
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:47,003
This is my house. Did
you come to see me? <i>Me?</i>

886
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,762
Do you have an appointment with me?

887
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:52,423
No, I found the wrong place-

888
01:24:57,683 --> 01:24:59,913
Did you even let her know your house?

889
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:06,272
What are you doing here? How
did you know to come here?

890
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:10,762
I asked the ghosts where the Goblin's house is.
<i>But why is that Grim Reaper at your house...?</i>

891
01:25:10,763 --> 01:25:15,452
I guess a couple fight is going on,
well whatever, sort it out between you.

892
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:17,883
Since I'm in the middle of being upset.

893
01:25:21,913 --> 01:25:23,292
Do the two of you live together?

894
01:25:23,293 --> 01:25:26,403
Until today. But why did you come?

895
01:25:27,343 --> 01:25:32,733
There was something I didn't have the chance
to say. You know about asking me what I see.

896
01:25:33,313 --> 01:25:35,432
What happens if can see it though?

897
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,902
Why are you asking? You
can't see it anyway.

898
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:39,053
Who says I can't see it though?

899
01:25:40,873 --> 01:25:45,242
One, if I see it, does it mean we
have to get married straight away?

900
01:25:45,243 --> 01:25:50,343
Two, if I see it, will you give me $500?
Three, if I see it...

901
01:25:53,663 --> 01:25:56,073
will you not leave?

902
01:26:00,163 --> 01:26:05,323
Please don't go. Just stay here, in Korea.

903
01:26:07,483 --> 01:26:09,393
Can you not?

904
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:18,832
You... do you really see it?

905
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:20,422
- If I see it?
- Prove it.

906
01:26:20,423 --> 01:26:24,152
You answer first. Out of one, two
and three, what will you do?

907
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:25,932
You can't see it.

908
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:29,883
