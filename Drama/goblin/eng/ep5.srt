Mister!

♫ Mysterious discovery ♫

7
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,900
Mass is not directly
proportional to volume.

8
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,330
A girl as small as a violet flower.

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,050
A girl who moves like a flower's petal.

10
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,030
Is pulling me towards her with a
stronger force than her mass.

11
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,550
At that moment,

12
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,810
just like Newton's apple,

13
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,230
without stopping, I rolled
towards her until I fell on her

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,390
...with a loud thump.

15
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,170
...with a thump, thump.

16
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,030
The red crossing was amazing!
You did that, right?

17
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,030
It's so fascinating!

18
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,750
Mister!

19
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,150
My heart keeps bouncing between
the sky and the ground.

20
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,260
Are you angry?

21
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,040
It was my first love!

22
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,510
- Episode 5 -

23
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,780
I... will walk.

24
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,620
It's okay to stop the car over there.

25
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,210
I memorized the area around the hotel,

26
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,710
- and if I walk I will be there soon...
- Do that then.

27
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,520
Goodbye!

28
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,800
Only the Goblin's bride

29
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,560
can pull out the sword.

30
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,410
When she pulls out the sword, you will
become dust and finally be at peace.

31
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,620
Sometimes in life, a strange
genre suddenly gets into the mix.

32
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,520
What genre was your day?

33
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,880
A romantic comedy? A strange,
but beautiful fantasy?

34
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,230
A sad melodrama?

35
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,630
Can you not do this?

36
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,880
Talk to me like a normal person. You
scare me when you act like this.

37
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,070
I'm sorry for startling you. I
want to ask you for a favor.

38
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,094
I'm really sorry for asking
this, but can you fill up the

39
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:14,880
refrigerator that's in the
room where I used to live?

40
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,380
The refrigerator?

41
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,954
It hasn't been too long since
I passed away. Mom was

42
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,600
busy with the funeral and
hasn't been to my place yet.

43
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,070
If my mom finds out that
the refrigerator is empty,

44
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,410
she will be heartbroken.
Please help me out!

45
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,110
But... I don't have any money.

46
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,100
Ah... I wasn't able to think that far...
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,930
Ah! There is a way!

48
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,190
Thanks.

You lived well while being in this world.

61
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,550

What's this? Is it a coincidence?

66
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,870
It's not for me. Why didn't you call me?
I was waiting. You said you would!

67
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,260
I will do it. I'll go and do it right now.

68
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,550
Go where? Are you going
to look for a pay phone?

69
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,940
I have a phone at home. At home...
I'll call soon.

70
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,210
So funny!

71
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,670
When we've bumped into
each other like this?

72
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,050
Ah! It was nice to see you.

73
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,540
It's driving me crazy...

74
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,103
Instead of a phone call, how about coffee?
There are a lot

75
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:57,280
of coffee shops in Seoul and
I have a lot of free time..

76
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,010
♫ I keep on asking you ♫

77
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,450
♫ I'm always verifying with you ♫

78
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,860
Excuse me...

79
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,910
Are we just going to keep drinking coffee?
When the sun has gone down?

80
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,440
Isn't the daylight too short?

81
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,310
It's not short. You've been
like that for an hour.

82
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,910
Aren't we going to say hello? We're
not going to ask how we've been?

83
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,930
We aren't going to have a conversation?

84
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,680
Hello. Have you been well?

85
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,360
♫ I'm saying she's
pretty, pretty, pretty ♫

86
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,620
Yes. Have you been well, too?

87
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,340
Is my ring well? You still
don't have a phone?

88
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,920
Yes, I've been well.

89
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,990
The ring is fine. I don't have a phone.

♫ Despite the weather ♫

91
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,670
Be honest with me. You
forgot my name, right?

92
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,790
It's Sun Hyo.

93
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:29,830
It's Sunny, not Sun Hyo.

94
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,270
Seriously...

95
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,570
You are such a funny man!

96
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,060
Are you acting like this on purpose?

99
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,940
I can't help looking... when you smile.

102
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,080
Now that I think about it, I don't

105
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,200
She asked my name, but
even I don't know it.

106
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:46,400
She asked me how I was, too. To ask someone
who's not alive if they are doing well?

107
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,910
That girl's smile

108
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,020
in the sunlight of the brightest
time of the day, Oshi. (11AM-1PM)

109
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,590
That moment during which I am reminded
of the moment my life was shattered.

110
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,170
I made up my mind.

111
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,950
I must disappear.

112
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,950
Before I want to live longer,

113
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,830
before I want to become happier...

114
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,720
For you,

115
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,610
I have made the inevitable decision

116
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,540
to leave this world.

117
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,900
But... I hear your voice.

118
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,800
Are you really going to die?

119
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,760
Yeah.

120
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,330
[$1,540]

121
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
By any chance, did you drink?

122
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,210
No way.

123
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,380
Yes, you did. The refrigerator
is completely empty.

124
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,430
Chocolate, peanuts, even beef
jerky, there is nothing left.

125
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,780
Fine, you could eat and drink.

126
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,548
However, why did you throw
away the empty bottles? You

127
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,390
thought I wouldn't notice if
you threw the bottles away?

128
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,070
I had my reasons...

129
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,790
Chairman said that if I need
anything I should say it.

130
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,340
I'm sorry, but can you pay for me?
I don't have money.

131
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,430
I don't have any money either. I don't...

132
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,640
I... don't have any money.

133
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,690
I was about to pay...

134
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,470
Oh, you startled me.

135
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,870
I'm going in.

136
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,800
Mister, why are you here?
Deok Hwa told you everything?

137
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,610
Like what?

138
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,390
The thing is... he told me off.

139
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,050
He isn't someone with such a clear
conscience where he can tell others off.

140
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,610
I emptied out the refrigerator completely.

141
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,390
Couldn't you pay this somehow...?

142
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,770
Once I get my pay from my part-time
job I will repay you diligently.

143
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,830
It's not possible?

144
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,310
To be honest, you're the
one who drank the alcohol.

145
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,080
I used the rest for a good cause.

146
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
If you ignore me, I will
blow all these out.

147
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,290
I can make you come in and
out of here all day today.

148
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,980
Don't make wishes anymore.

149
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,570
You don't have to do it anymore, because
I will be by your side from now on.

150
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,320
Let's go home.

151
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,290
Which house...?

152
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,340
The house where I live,

153
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,810
since you are the Goblin's bride.

154
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,420
Mister, do you love me?

155
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,710
If that's needed, I will do that, too.

156
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,370
I love you.

157
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,430
♫ Since I had too many bad memories ♫

158
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,220
♫ I erased you ♫

159
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,640

If that's needed, I will do that, too.

163
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,750
I love you.

164
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,950
Do you dislike me that much?

165
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,010
How much and how do you dislike
me that you are this sad?

166
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,270
The rain just continues to pour.

167
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,960
Well, it's fine.

168
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,880
Even if you dislike me, even if you're sad,
I'm still going to live at your house.

169
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,250
I'm in no position to be picky about
whether I get a cold or warm goblin.

170
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,420
In the end, all I have to do is
to take the sword out, right?

171
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,820
Yes, that's all you have to do.

172
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,930
Please wait. I'm going to pack my things.

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,810
I'm not asking because I'm so curious.

176
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,771
Regardless of the fact that we
are in a vague relationship

177
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,450
that's closer than cohabiting
but farther than a marriage,

178
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,210
I'm the Goblin's bride.

179
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,250
I should at least know the name of the
Goblin who's going to be my husband.

180
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:34,100
Us... I guess there's no "us" yet.

181
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,430
I think it started before you were born.

182
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,220
Us.

183
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,590
Sometimes Yoo Jeong Shin;
other times, Yoo Jae Shin.

184
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,580
Currently I'm Yoo Shin Jae.

185
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,370
My real name is... Kim Shin.

186
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,310
We can go...

187
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,370
It's green light.

188
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,430
Today... is the day we put out the trash.

189
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,150
You are refreshing every time I see you.

190
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,990
Give it to me. I will do that from now on.

191
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,630
What's with her? Why is she trying
to impress me all of a sudden?

192
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,420
She will be living with us starting today.

193
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,870
For your sake, the choice
that I have to make...

194
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,250
it's to end my life.

195
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,988
I'm rooting for the path
that's ahead of you

196
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
and the things you will do.
Let's go inside.

197
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,310
Yes. Please take care of me.

198
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:23,160
So, the thing that I will be doing in the
future... there must be a lot of housework.

199
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,110
It must be 4 digits, right?

200
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,040
Probably have to press the
star (*) at the end...

201
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,600
You don't know the passcode? Both of you?

202
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,950
We've never keyed in the
code before going in.

203
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,113
It reminds me of that moment...
Right before you

204
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,040
go in the haunted house
at an amusement park.

205
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,100
You feel scared and nervous, and
you don't know what's inside.

206
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,480
And you wonder if you'll be able
to come out safely once you go in.

207
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,410
Come in.

208
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,620
You... Why here...? Why is she...
When and how is she here?

209
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,920
She's going to be living
with us starting today.

210
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
Please take care of me.

211
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,600
Tell her the passcode.

212
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,002
1004 (ANGEL). But why is she
living here? (T/N: "cheon sa"

213
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:35,330
- (1004 AND ANGEL ARE HOMONYMS
IN THE KOREAN LANGUAGE.)

214
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,870
Why? What about me? About me?

215
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,760
You drink that in one go. Sober up.

216
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,010
We should get a cozy
chair right about there.

217
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,766
Is this a photo studio? It
would be better to have

218
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:54,580
pastel colored wallpapers
that soothe your emotions.

219
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,150
Is this a kindergarten?

220
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,170
We'll put a 19th-century romanticism art.
And a fireplace here would be good.

221
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,120
Is this a hotel? Over there, we should
have a Scandinavian style wallpaper.

222
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,700
- Is this a model house? She's my guest!
- It's my house!

223
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,940
It's my room.

224
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,830
I'm okay with everything.

225
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,490
We'll put up some 19th-century romantic
art style wallpaper on this side.

226
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,910
And we'll put a pastel-toned
fireplace over here. To be fair.

227
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,080
Then for now, should I sleep
on the living room sofa today?

228
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,548
If you are uncomfortable
having me in the

229
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,110
living room, the flower
garden is okay, too.

230
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm not in the position to
discriminate where to sleep.

231
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,808
- So, if you are going
to bring someone in, you

232
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,800
should get a bed fi... -
Sleep in my room tonight.

233
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,170
With you?

234
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,660
No!

235
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,950
Then what about you?

236
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,330
- What does this mean?
- I shall sleep on the bed,

237
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,450
so don't worry about me and
sleep comfortably on the sofa.

238
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,610
Look at how strangely this Goblin talks.
Never. It's my bed. You'll make it unlucky.

239
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,790
I know. I told you not to concern yourself.

240
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,040
- Go and sleep in the sofa in the living room.
- I can't sleep on the sofa.

241
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,400
- She'll probably be going in and out.
- Then go sleep in a hotel!

242
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,150
I can't sleep at a hotel.
She's in that room alone.

243
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,540
Where are you going?

244
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,600
The miscellaneously omitted... I'll
make her sleep in the flower garden.

245
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,670
- Were you always this inconsiderate?
- Yeah.

246
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,440
- Then I will sleep on the sofa.
- Don't talk to me.

247
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,480
Please help her a lot when she's around.

248
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,620
Aigoo. It's so comfortable.

249
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,710
Do I have to sit like this?

250
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,340
My book.

251
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,030
I told him to look at it. Did
I tell him he could have it?

252
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,160
[THE STARS MIGHT TAKE YOUR GRIEF AWAY]

253
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,570
He didn't throw it away.

254
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,400
He's preciously cherishing it.

255
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
What book is this?

256
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,530
I don't know Chinese characters.

257
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,150
Even in a foreign land,
the war does not stop.

258
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,980
With swords and arrows, snatching
the land and the grains.

259
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,210
Taking lives.

260
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,520
The god of the foreign land and the
god of Goryeo are all the same.

261
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,540
The child who left Goryeo with me...

262
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:13,400
I buried him and his
grandchild's grandchild.

263
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,910
I, in a chair in a corner of a room,

264
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,410
I spent days and weeks.

265
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,490
My will is not words that are
left in the face of death.

266
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,080
Dear God,

267
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,570
my last testament is to ask you for death.

268
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,593
Though I have at times
regarded this life as a

269
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:42,510
reward, in the end my
life was a punishment.

270
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,800
Anyone's death...

271
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,890
I couldn't forget one.

272
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,610
So I...

273
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,450
am to end this life.

274
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,820
However, God is not listening as always.

275
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,960
Have you seen God?

276
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,350
Perhaps, are you looking at him now?

277
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,460
I told you not to talk to me. How
could someone like me see God?

278
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,910
I have seen him before.

279
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,260
- What does he look like?
- Just...

280
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,240
It was a butterfly.

281
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,426
It's always like that.
It makes you not able

282
00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:45,280
to touch a passing
butterfly recklessly.

283
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,160
If he had at least shown me his face,

284
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,350
then I could resent him objectively.

285
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,010
I know.

286
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,920
If God really does only give
you how much you can handle,

287
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,410
I wonder if he didn't overestimate me.

288
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,780
Are you having a hard time?

289
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,490
Don't worry.

290
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,240
God whom humans see that often...

291
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,440
how could we not see him even once?

292
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,540
Right, this is the Goblin's house.

293
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,460
I wonder what they do for breakfast.

294
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,400
I wonder if there's any groceries.

295
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,670
They have everything that's needed,

296
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,470
but it feels lonely somehow...

297
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,950
How beautiful.

298
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,670
I wondered how it would be
since it's a men's household.

299
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,530
It's been such a long time since
I've had a meal prepared by someone.

300
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,870
I didn't say I was going to give you any.

301
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,430
Thank you for the meal.

302
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,880
I will earn my own allowance. And starting
tomorrow, I will take care of my own meals.

303
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,660
- I will also do the laundry myself.
- That's how we usually do it.

304
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,530
A wealthy household like this
usually has helpers that do...

305
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,350
What's this? Did you
practice without me knowing?

306
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,190
You seem to be in top form.

307
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,500
Since you two are like this, I see
why you can't get any helpers.

308
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,910
So I wrote down a few things
in a similar context.

309
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,510
I wish you would abide by them.

310
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,190
My appeals. First, I hope
it doesn't rain often.

311
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,497
Since the citizens would
be uncomfortable, so as

312
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,970
long as I am living here, I
wish you would be happy.

313
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,360
2. If you have any complaints, please
say them. Saying that you'll take me

314
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,763
or you would make things
that could make you

315
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:54,190
take me, I hope there
would be none of those.

316
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,193
3. If you have something
urgent, please call

317
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:58,400
first. Don't just suddenly
appear in front of me.

318
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,900
Ji Eun Tak. 010-1234-1234. And you
can't do so during class hours.

319
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,450
Not during work and I turn
it off in the library.

320
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,010
I will be going to school.

321
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,050
Could she be telling us to call her?

322
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,680
Is she looking down on us because
we don't have cellphones?

323
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,560
Really?

324
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,120
I want this one in chic black. I like it.
You have this bluish-blue. You like it?

325
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,351
This punk is over-excited
since it's his first

326
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,360
time seeing something like this.
Explain it.

327
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,380
Now, now. Take your time memorizing your
numbers. This is called a smart phone...

328
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,020
I'm okay, so just explain it to
him who's never seen this before.

329
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,440
What he said is right. You
only need to explain to me.

330
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,040
Uncle, do you know how to use it?
This thing is very smart...

331
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,200
Do you think I didn't use it
because I don't know how?

332
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,360
- It's because I don't have any need...
- When I watch dramas,

333
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,030
they look at each other's
faces when they call.

334
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,360
If you were that desperate, you should
have bought this 300 years ago!

335
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,640
These uncles, seriously. I
will teach you that later.

336
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,150
Now, first. Let's go to the Play store.

337
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,640
- Now?
- What?

338
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
W-Why are you getting up?

339
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,700
- You said let's go to the Play store.

00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:18,710
[THE SWORD, PLEASE. AND KEEP THIS
A SECRET FROM MY COLLEAGUE.]

509
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,200
You startled me.

510
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,870
What is your dream? What do you want to be?

511
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,887
While eating this much
and not taking out the

512
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:30,840
sword and just studying,
what is your dream?

513
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,112
A radio PD (PROGRAM DIRECTOR).
For the rolling

514
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,310
admission, I studied
that department as well.

515
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,732
That's not what I'm saying.
How will you get

516
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,400
accepted to college when
lacking such comprehension?

517
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,200
Why would you wish me bad?

518
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,680
Actually I thought about it carefully,

519
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,140
and about you getting pretty,
I put it on hold for now.

520
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,110
On hold? Are you sure you
thought about it carefully?

521
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:58,304
What if you kick me out after
I lose my effective value?

522
00:48:58,316 --> 00:49:01,410
The thought of that is so
stressful that I can't study.

523
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,110
If you can't even study, then why are
you finishing up the snacks every time?

524
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,820
See! Your true colors are showing.
You begrudge it?

525
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,020
That's why, how nice would it have been
if you gave me the $5000 when I asked?

526
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,672
Hey, still, I am water and fire
and someone who's here but

527
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:19,410
not, so how can I be so crass
as to bounce it off with cash?

528
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,420
I'd accept it with refinement, of course.

529
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,670
But... why does it have to be $5000?

530
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,050
The amount is too ambiguous. It'll be hard
to even rent a place with that in Seoul.

531
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,930
I don't even dare to dream
about renting a place.

532
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:38,660
Until I grow up, it's
money to stay at a sauna,

533
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,610
and if ever I do get accepted into
college then I would need tuition.

534
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:46,981
I came up with that exact
amount after careful

535
00:49:46,993 --> 00:49:50,880
calculation of student loans
and various living costs.

536
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,140
That ambiguous $5000 is like $5,000,000 to
someone like me who has nothing. Happy?

537
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:07,280
Give her $5000. How could you do that?
So coldhearted.

538
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,380
I have something I am curious about.

539
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,540
I won't give you $5000 (OHBAEK).

540
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,650
That startled me. I heard
it as confess (GOBAEK).

541
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,360
Give her $5000.

542
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,350
Make your pronunciation clear.
I got startled!

543
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:20,520
He said to give me $5000.

544
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,340
Go and study.

545
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,060
But, then, is your name Kim Shin?

546
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,600
Yeah. Why?

547
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,260
Your name... is really cool.

548
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,480
Seriously, he's not calling. Call.

549
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
Boss, are you busy?

550
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,610
I don't even remember when I was last busy.

551
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:16,270
Then... can I call you Unni for a while?
I have no unni that I can confide in.

552
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,900
Wanting to call me unni...
then there's only one genre.

553
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,980
Are you pregnant?

554
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,640
No!

555
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,660
- Then?
- Just...

556
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,680
What do you think about marrying early?

557
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,950
How old is the guy? 19? 20?

558
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,080
A bit more.

559
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,650
It's not much even if you say so.
What kind of kid is he?

560
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,467
He's always near books, he
has deep taste in music and

561
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:47,620
art, and he also used to work
for the country back then...

562
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,840
Not that, what does he do to you?
Does he treat you well?

563
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,210
Ahhh...

564
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,570
For now. Since he needs me.

565
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,300
Then what about you? Do you like that punk?

566
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,210
No.

567
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,120
Then what about that
punk, does he like you?

568
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,590
No.

569
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,310
What's that then? Both of you don't
like each other. Why do this marriage?

570
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,470
I know, right.

571
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,340
What's with this marriage?

572
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,940
Continue with your work.

573
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,480
Mister, do you love me?

574
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,120
If that is needed, I will do that, too.

575
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,440
I love you.

576
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,940
I don't need that love.

577
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,070
Make sure you're not the one who needs it.

578
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,640
Just wait and see if I
let him become pretty...

579
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,400
I'm back.

581
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,870
Are you folding laundry? I will do it, too.

582
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,430
You were always doing this by
yourself before, right? I can tell.

583
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,870
Thank you for recognizing it.

584
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:37,950
So all the bathroom towels are washed by
Mr. Grim Reaper. No wonder it felt killer.

585
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,670
Can you please refrain from
the expression "killer".

586
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,270
I'm sorry.

587
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:51,470
I really like the towels in this house.
They are soft and fluffy.

588
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,690
Thank you.

589
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,290
Netherland's representative painter
of the 17th century royal family.

590
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,075
Rembrand van Rijn's painting
best known as "The Night

591
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,780
Watch" unveiling the spectrum
of light and darkness.

592
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,749
But actually the true name of
the paiting is "The Militia

593
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:11,000
Company of Captain Frans Banning
Cocq." Where should I hang it?

594
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,700
That scarf, I think I saw that when
you were 9. It's the same one, right?

595
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,440
You're right.

596
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,250
It's a keepsake from my mom.

597
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:34,040
My mom thought that I could see ghosts
because of the mark on my neck.

598
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,184
So she always placed this around
my neck since I was a child

599
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:39,990
in hopes that I wouldn't see
ghosts when it's covered.

600
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:47,370
But it was no use. But it became a habit.
Now this is like my mom.

601
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,620
Give her $5000 (OHBAEK). - Why do keep
on telling me to confess (GOBAEK)?

602
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,319
And also you! You've got a
story to every question.

603
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,730
I'm too scared to even
ask you a question now.

604
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,180
- What's with him?
- I didn't reply to you though.

605
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,430
He has a really bad personality.

606
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,380
You must have had a hard time.

607
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,500
But, have you decided on a name?

608
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,599
Hey, Senior. Aren't you going to study?
You might

609
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:10,680
not get into college if
you do well (KEEP IT UP).

610
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,440
Why would I not get in if I do well?
If I do well then I would go in.

611
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,570
Nevermind. Go in and study. Would
you be a radio PD if you do that?

612
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,910
Oh, you want to be a radio PD? So cool.

613
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:24,130
Yes, I liked radios since I was a child.

614
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,140
I was the one who mentioned about
radio but why are you talking to him?

615
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,640
Talking with people that I live with...

616
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,040
People? See if there are any people that
you live with. Look at the sword here!

617
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,229
Mister, perhaps if you
haven't decided on a name,

618
00:55:37,241 --> 00:55:40,250
how about Park Bo Gum?
Park Bo Gum (GUM=SWORD)?

619
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:46,500
What "gum?" Just because I have been
lenient because you see the sword!

620
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,170
Seriously.

621
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,430
Whose fault is it that I have this
mark and that I can see ghosts?

622
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,770
Have what? It's pretty.

623
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,120
Mister, did you just lift my hair?

624
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,450
Ahh! That's why you got stabbed with a
sword. People get stabbed for a reason.

625
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:09,220
How could you poke a person where it hurts?
Are you a psychopath?

626
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,899
Mister, do you think you weren't
like that at first? You said I

627
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,560
wasn't the goblin's bride, don't
live in rumors but in reality.

628
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,450
You must think you've never poked where
it hurts and you're all soft and fluffy!

629
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,140
I said that for your sake! For you.

630
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,452
If it's for me, give me a boyfriend!
Part-time work, my aunt's family,

631
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,320
and boyfriend! My wish for a
boyfriend has not come true yet!

632
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,510
- It's here! Your boyfriend!
- Where? Where here?

633
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,450
Here! Right in front of you! Me!

634
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,060
He must be crazy. What boyfriend?

635
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,600
With whose permission? Does he like me?

636
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,410
Give me $5000.

637
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,060
After 900 years...

638
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,790
If we argue about it, it would
be husband not boyfriend.

639
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,050
Should I go and make that minor correction?

640
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:40,640
It's a mess.

641
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:57,300
Someone can't even call
because he has no name.

642
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,610
They are just...

643
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,960
Someone can't even call
because he has no name.

644
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,230
They are just...

645
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:17,220
- It's so dark in here.
- What are you doing?- You're still at that?

646
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,720
Leave. Both of you.

647
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,130
What's wrong with Uncle down the hall?

648
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,180
It a face that's thinking of a woman.

649
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,400
What did I do? Where?

650
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,770
This must be that woman's number.

651
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,580
Put that down while I'm talking.

652
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,160
Uncle, this kiss mark, did you
try kissing it or not? Honestly?

653
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,810
You need to follow me. That
place won't be a good one.

654
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,720
- Uncle.
- It's going.

655
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,560
Hey! Don't!

656
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,950
If you won't call then why get her number?

657
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,960
To appear human. You never
know when I would call.

658
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,140
Now is that time.

659
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,300
Hello?

660
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,780
Like a human. Hurry.

661
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,170
Not Seon Hee, but Sunny

662
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,800
Hello, I am...

663
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,500
No. Should I go roughly?

664
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,610
What are you doing? Don't
you recognize my voice?

665
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,150
Not this, either.

666
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,490
Hello. Oh my! Hello.

667
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:31,180
- I go for the third.
- You were listening?

668
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,110
Why aren't you getting caught?

669
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:37,740
Isn't it cool? Fascinating, right?
I could do this, too.

670
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,660
Ding.

671
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,510
Eat, eat.

672
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,690
Freeze.

673
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,050
Hello.

674
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,130
Hello.

675
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,800
You know how to call.

676
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,780
I thought you didn't or
maybe you broke a finger.

677
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,800
Ah, yes. I learned. My finger is not
broken. Thank you for the concern.

678
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,780
So my number was there.

679
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,110
Yes. Your number is here.

680
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,960
I waited for your call.

681
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,820
Ahh... yes.

682
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,660
"Ahh... yes." Is there nothing after?

683
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,740
Don't you have anything
more you want to say?

684
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,773
- For example?
- Morning, lunch or night? When is the

685
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:41,830
most comfortable time to
meet or something like that.

686
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,700
Morning, lunch or night? When is
the most comfortable time to meet?

687
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,860
I find it comfortable to meet in the
morning and separately at night.

688
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,250
I must seem human, so I'll walk.

689
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,370
Get in.

690
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,800
A human won't be able to
walk all the way to Incheon.

691
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,500
Ah!

692
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,110
- It's here. Your boyfriend!
- Where? Where here?- Right here! In front of you! Me!

693
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,410
I was startled because
you were in front of me.

694
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:29,290
I was thirsty... that...
I have to go to work.

695
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,340
Ji Eun Tak...

696
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,280
Yes?

697
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,820
You called me just now.

698
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,920
- I did? - Yes.- Why? - I know. Why?

699
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,530
Because it's awkward.

700
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,890
Me, too.

701
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:04,580
Then... should I say I'm hungry, naturally?

702
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:11,020
Will you? Then I will naturally
say, "Do you want to eat beef?"

703
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:17,110
I will go and get my coat then come out.
Go and wear your coat.

704
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,940
I'm done wearing. Let's go.

705
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:30,350
Wow! This is my second time here. I
might be a regular at this rate.

706
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:34,020
We sat there back then.

707
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,110
Welcome to Quebec. Please have a seat.

708
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,790
That's why, I should have
gone abroad to know.

709
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,843
So what, travelling abroad at 29?
When I was 29, I

710
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:20,220
didn't even go to the supermarket
in front of my house.

711
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,750
- Really?
- I didn't have any appointment?

712
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,660
I've been traveling around just fine, for
someone who's never been abroad before.

713
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,210
I only get lost a little and I don't
skip meals and I can eat a cow.

714
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:36,220
I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.

715
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,880
It's the man that has to be nice, not the
restaurant. I have to go. I'm sleepy.

716
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,780
Okay. Have a good night.

717
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,250
CEO, over here.

718
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:22,150
At the age of 29, you're still shining.

719
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:31,860
But I'm not... by your side.

720
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:41,810
My life of eternity has
finally come to an end.

721
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:47,770
In the time after my
death, you are still here.

722
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:57,790
You've forgotten me and your life
is perfectly complete with me gone.

723
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,980
I have to disappear

724
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,990
to make you smile.

725
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,450
This is the decision I have to make.

726
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:16,320
I have to end my life.

727
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:38,960
♫ Where I am, who I am ♫

728
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,900
♫ This loneliness like a prison ♫

729
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,880
In the end,

730
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,740
that's the decision I made.

731
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:55,350
♫ This place that everyone
just passes by me ♫

732
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:58,890
♫ Oh, where I am ♫

733
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:07,210
♫ Who are you? Who are you? ♫

734
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:14,060
♫ This happiness I cannot hide ♫

735
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:24,560
♫ Even if I dig around the
world like I am crazy ♫

736
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,450
♫ Dearest, where are you ♫

737
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:32,190
♫ I will find you ♫

738
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,930
♫ I will recognize you ♫

739
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:43,250
♫ No matter what you look
like I will recognize you ♫

740
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:50,770
♫ I will remember it. I
will recognize you. ♫

741
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:55,390
♫ Even if you are somewhere I am not ♫

742
01:06:55,390 --> 01:07:05,510
♫ I will not forget. Your
speech, expression, everything ♫

743
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,270
- Preview -

744
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:19,690
He's still handsome and still strange.

745
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:23,690
I know he's strange but when I
see his face, I forget all that.

746
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:28,290
You don't press down the head like that.

747
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:35,270
You're supposed to brush it gently.

748
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:41,930
Can you make me prettier now?

749
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:47,180
- Yes.
- You shouldn't get hurt anymore.

750
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,750
You've been hurt many times.

751
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,900
I left the deed of the
property in the room.

752
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,720
This is really your house now.

753
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,860
Have a long and happy life.

754
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:07,630
And I have a favor to ask.

755
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:14,070
When I disappear, her
mark will disappear, too.

756
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:22,180
When that happens, erase her memories.
Don't let her blame herself.
