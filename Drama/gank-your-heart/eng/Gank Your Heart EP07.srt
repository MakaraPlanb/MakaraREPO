Suprise

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,832
Are you surprised

11
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,423
Why are you all here

12
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,599
I consider that I can not find you If I don’t come here

13
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,808
Busy man

14
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,128
Since you guys come Let’s have a meal together

15
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,859
OK Let's go

16
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,405

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,178
Xuan

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,441
Help me to look after the shop

19
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:51,065
Let’s start our dinner  But I want to discuss Luotian  He is not credibility and integrity

20
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:54,684
We  supposed to come together  But he came back to work after he received a phone call

21
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:55,883
Yes he always like this

22
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:59,911
He is a workaholic We need to understand  Let’s have a drink

23
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:04,156
Brother Gu, I'm sorry I missed your retirement banquet today

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,512
Don’t worry We are brother

25
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:10,501
It’s fine I know that you feel difficult to adapt to the formal occasion   Don’t push yourself

26
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:16,083
It is such a long journey to my place  I really feel a little bit

27
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,062
Feeling what

28
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:22,733
I really feel a bit sorry  I promised to pay you a fancy meal but I failed to do it

29
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,396
Time flies

30
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,636
We are all retired

31
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,821
Boss Can your laptop run normally

32
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,460
Can you just leave

33
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:36,547
It is not suitable to play computer games

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,196
If we think back to our trainees’ period

35
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:45,627
We are all struggling and extremely diligent in preparing the competition  We never know to stop since we were afraid of losing our chances

36
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,316
That’s why you are the ace

37
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:48,834
No I does not mean it

38
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,299
It’s ok

39
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,140
Do you know that he was

40
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,859
Do you remember

41
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,090
Eat steamed bun and drink stilled water everyday

42
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:59,461
I thought you are a saint and won’t be lured by women

43
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,731
I do not have your social skill and attractiveness  How can I find a girlfriend

44
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:05,457
Come on  Stop trying to fool me

45
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,298
one of the beautiful and famous woman in our industry Shu Wen

46
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,220
He can hold it

47
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,487
You are drunk  Stop saying stupid things

48
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:17,319
Alright just let it pass  Let’s drink and forget the past   It is passed

49
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,551
But you still have a beef with someone

50
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,408
Who are you talking about  Who do you have a beef on

51
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,946
It is good now

52
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,174
Right

53
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:31,729
Alright Just drink  Today we come here for the gathering  Yeah gathering

54
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,088
You come

55
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,411
When is your flight tomorrow  I can give you a ride

56
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,659
I am good I can back home alone

57
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:54,502
Wait

58
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:58,405
I heard from manger Zhao that you refused the invitation to a talk show

59
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:03,340
I am not willing to do something which might  waste my time

60
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:10,910
You should know

61
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,940
Why did Sun leave the industry

62
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,662
I know

63
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,397
He has got a reason

64
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,530
Actually in those years

65
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,658
He is the most enthusiastic one in our team

66
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,915
He is also the most talented

67
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:27,122
However at that moment e-sport is not approved by the general public

68
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:31,302
He could only accept the reality when his parents was ill

69
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:35,581
I can not understand that   Captain

70
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,984
You are asking me to fight the cruel fact or compromise my beliefs

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,834
Business is a double-edged sword

72
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:48,479
We have to adapt it in order to survive in this community

73
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,086
I understand

74
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,068
Don’t intervene the team training  try to follow my instruction

75
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:00,683
Good

76
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,716
I will take this

77
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,242
It looks pretty good

78
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:18,205
These are the five latest champions which are released by IConquer

79
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:23,711
Zhiheng  Jincan  Yubang  Gongxichangqing and Xin  These are their personal details

80
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,227
At this moment  our first priority is to obtain the five new champions

81
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,940
Beat our competitor wit an unexpected move

82
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:34,163
You want to count on the new champion  Did you really consider the consequence

83
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:39,492
We still not very familiar with these champions since we just get it  It would be quite difficult to master them in a short period of time

84
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,917
You are right  However our opened are facing the same problem

85
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,781
They are still in the exploring stage

86
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,943
If we could one step ahead them

87
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,239
Then we would give them a big surprise

88
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,435
By contraries

89
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,340
What if our enemy is one step further us

90
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,041
We would drop into a passive condition

91
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,857
Brother Kong is right

92
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,219
Commander Ji

93
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,923
You are my captain now

94
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:02,731
I will obey you without any hesitation

95
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,475
me too

96
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,563
Thanks for your trust. We can do it

97
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,758
But we have got a new problem now

98
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:16,123
But we do not have enough time to practice the new champion

99
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,938
Director Zhao Request on of us to join the reality show

100
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,824
It will waste a lot of time

101
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:23,249
That's alright   I know about this

102
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,124
OK

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,878
let's start training

104
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:28,491
Let's do it Bro

105
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,684
Fighting

106
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,095
This is my champion  No one can take it

107
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,143
Finally got it

108
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:39,616
Let it go

109
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,442
At least we have got some viewings

110
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,585
Pay attention  we have to master these champion in the limited time

111
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,007
Director Jin

112
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:12,515
Yesterday, the director of GDV called me and they said that it was impossible to cooperate with us in the future

113
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,385
Why

114
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,975
Don’t you know it

115
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,817
Ji Xiangkong have been invited by GDV to join the reality show

116
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:23,847
Ji Xiangkong has refused because he said he don’t have spare time

117
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,631
But

118
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,249
But  what

119
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,435
Speak

120
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:32,673
But he has got spare time

121
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:37,182
To duo with the female streamers from You Xing

122
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,542
Is it true

123
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:43,948
Director Jin

124
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,879
We cannot offend the people of GDV

125
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,267
Director Jin

126
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,143
Xiangkong

127
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,655
What a coincidence  I am going to find you

128
00:09:57,655 --> 00:10:00,578
I heard from manager Zhao that GDV and you

129
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,609
Director Jin

130
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,795
I want to explain the detailed of the event to manager Zhao

131
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,118
I have confirmed the date of the reality show with GDV

132
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,143
impossible

133
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,008
Why I didn't know it

134
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,700
Ah You do not know it  didn’t you

135
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,771
You need to ask your phone

136
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,820
GDV still keeps calling you  and you didn’t pick up the calls

137
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:23,969
Are you sure

138
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,572
Nothing in my phone

139
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,821
Look at it look

140
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,726
There is nothing on my phone

141
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,411
Oh Director Zhao

142
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,323
Stop don’t offend against our business cooperation agreement

143
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,967
Once you told me I would try my best to fit your requirement

144
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,789
Director Jin If you don’t have other instructions I will go first

145
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:48,350
Focus on your training

146
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,481
You listen to me please I didn’t receive any call in fact

147
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,525
Enjoy your tea

148
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:08,262
I don’t want to drink it  Stay away from me

149
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:13,396
Help me close the door

150
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:33,804
It is not suitable for me  Isn’t it

151
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:36,232
To become a host of IConquer

152
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,915
Although you are assigned from other department you might not adapt the style here

153
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,634
But I can only give you one month

154
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,936
If the problem hasn't been solved by then

155
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,620
I am sorry about this

156
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,600

Love you Pei Xi

216
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:20,054
Qiao Xin is so lucky  Pei Xi was right again

217
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,287
Now come back to the team of Ji Xiangkong

218
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:24,959
Could he get it right this time

219
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:25,962

D

224
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,554
Is D right or not

225
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,021
The answer is wrong

226
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,115
Ji Xiangkong

227
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:59,745
In fact our punishment will give our audience some entertaining effect

228
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,278
Are you OK Qiu Ying

229
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:03,069
Bring Qiu Ying up

230
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:05,564
Ji Xiangkong  You are persecuting me

231
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,963
You are persecuting me

232
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:10,657
We can see that Qiu Ying is feeling angry

233
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,236
Why do you always get it wrong

234
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,598
I was a little nervous because this is my first time to join the entertainment programme

235
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,294
We can see that Qiu Ying is getting emotional

236
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:19,565
Does it hurt

237
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:28,473
OK  The last question also belongs to Ji Xiangkong

238
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,518
So far they did not answer any questions correctly  so they really need to chin up

239
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:33,137
Please listen to the question

240
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,888
The ability of the champion Zeus is released from his left hand or his right hand

241
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,595

00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:51,874
I  Qiu Ying  I never know the feeling of being afraid

247
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,806
The left hand

248
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,950

00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,198

Let me see your real capability

267
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,441
We can see that the two professional players are focusing on their lane and do not care so much about their partner

268
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,443
But in the other lane  Qiao Xin and Qiu Ying are playing so aggressive

269
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,235
Qiao Xin

270
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:57,025

00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,432

Dodge  Dodge Dodge

274
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,395
Qiu Ying has been expelled to the turret area by Qiao XIn

275
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,658
She is so low  Pei Xi Please come and help me

276
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,357
Pei Xi joins the fight and root  Qiu Yng with the ability

277
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,321

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,414
I do not want to die with you

280
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:27,865
Qiao Xin reunites with Pei XI’s champion creator  and they slay Qiu Ying effortlessly  nice work for them

281
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,510
The first blood

282
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:30,752
Die again

283
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:33,069
We can see that Ji XianKong is pretty low right now But he decides to stay at the mid lane

284
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,008
Are you trying to solo us

285
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:38,687
Solo you two

286
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,211
I thought I am battling with three people

287
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:44,172
Ji Xinagkong

288
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,637
He is a spy from your team doesn’t he

289
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:52,138
If you want to win this game  please listen to my order

290
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,395
I said if you really want to win this then you just listen to me  Do not leave your position

291
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,351
I am not trying to help you  I just don’t anyone to block my way

292
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,756
Is she asking Ji Xiangkong for help

293
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,793
Wait What are they doing now  Why is she stopping at there

294
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,112
Ji XianKong comes to the mid lane

295
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:04,444
Hurry up, Pei Xi

296
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:07,292
He is so slow  Take him down

297
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,353
You have to stay here   Don't go anywhere

298
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,619
Pei Xi is rushing toward Ji XianKong

299
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,844
So waiting me to die is your strategy

300
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,368
If you want to win  You have to listen to me  Do you understand

301
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,118
You should wait at bush  Told you to stay there

302
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:21,585
What is she doing  Pei Xi has followed Ji XianKong to the turret area

303
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,986
Hide yourself  Don’t get into their vision area

304
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,596
Are you sure  You don't need my help

305
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:28,954
Ji XianKong is getting more dangerous

306
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,362

I know  I know

317
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:49,999
Wait for a good things to drop into one’s lap  It is such a good tactic for them

00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,485
Clear the wave of mid lane with me   I’m  coming

319
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:53,092
The speed that they pull off the turret is so fast

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,041
They take the turrets down   Now they are pushing the base

321
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,989

But

337
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:14,928
But

338
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,784
Depends on your ability

339
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:18,182
is Ji Xiangkong

340
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:22,528
Actually he does not give me any help at the beginning    However  you can't imagine the ending of it

341
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,673
You can never imagine how good he is

342
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:28,192
We kicked the ass of Pei Xi and Qiao Xin That feeling is amazing

343
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,850
It does not make sense

344
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,048
But that is the truth

345
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,540
But that is the truth

346
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,266
Director An

349
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,064

Got it

355
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:56,231
Thanks Thanks Thanks

356
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,494
People always call you a battlefield liar

357
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,115
In fact just someone call me that

358
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,446
Actually you got me at that moment

359
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,012
A little pitfall

360
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:12,603
I didn't expect that you would believe it

361
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:14,930
good

362
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:19,189
I thought that the rookie will become your encumbrance

363
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:20,840
I also didn’t expect it

364
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,946
The rookie can be utilized at the key moment

365
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,957
Everyone does have a chance to fully demonstrate their talents

366
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,468
This is my principle of employment

367
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:30,097
If there was a one-to-one battle today

368
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:31,677
You don't have a chance to win

369
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,224
Maybe

370
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:35,889
You are holding the best Action Per Minute record in the league

371
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,996
I probably will lose the battle with you

372
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,365
But you can not forget

373
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:42,089
Iconquer was never an individual competition

374
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:46,652
You better make all out effort on the series

375
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,398
I will keep improving  Since we are a team of five

376
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:52,044
See you on tournament

377
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,667
Ji Xiangkong  Ji Xiangkong

378
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:08,816
wait a minute wait

379
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,022
wait

380
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,414
You forget your dolls

381
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,310
Director Ann let me give it to you

382
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,560
Thanks

383
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:23,546
Doesn't matter

384
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:24,743
Actually

385
00:25:24,743 --> 00:25:26,758
I should say thank you to you

386
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:29,314
Thank you for letting me win the championship today

387
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,347
And the competition of today

388
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:34,961
You did a great job

389
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,331
I will do it better without you

390
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:39,743
I know

391
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:41,413
But I still want to say thank you to you

392
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,424
Do you have anything else

393
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,943
Your hand

394
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:56,678
I want

395
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:59,440
Invite you to have a meal with me

396
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:01,743
Buy me a meal

397
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:05,317
I have been fooling you the whole day  but you till pay me a meal

398
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,282
Are you feel better now

399
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:10,940
Nothing Nothing

400
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:14,332
Actually It is quite exciting to stand on that stage

401
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,199
Actually

402
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:20,568
I have a dream

403
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:24,704
I've always wanted to be an e-sports host

404
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,162
I go back to study recently

405
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,663
However I found that IConquer is not that simple as I think

406
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,405
Moreover I am feeling a bit confused

407
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:36,331
I just know a professional player

408
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:37,842
So

409
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:39,737
So you want to ask me to teach you

410
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,684
OK

411
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:44,796
How to teach

412
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,281
Let me tell you

413
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:49,695
I made a analyzation video about the abilities of Queen of Thorns

414
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,441
But the reaction of the video is really bad

415
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:53,363
I received so many criticism from so many netizens

416
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,090
If you do have time

417
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,600
Can you give me some suggestion

418
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,625
OK We watch it here

419
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,307
Or go to your place

420
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:04,700
My home

421
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,219
You have been working so hard   just try to become closer with me

422
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,782
Let the rumor going around

423
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:13,984
I

424
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,416
Don’t get me wrong

425
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:17,961
You get out of my way

426
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:20,177
Keep acting

427
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,634
Keep acting like you don’t care  don’t you

428
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,307
I have been so proactive  Come on  Just go to your home

429
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:28,640
Ji Xiangkong

430
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,260
You have crossed the line

431
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,820
Yes I am

432
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,425
Or you have been too exaggerated

433
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:39,653
You are the person who pretend to be my supporter at Vancouver

434
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:41,074
At the show of IConquer

435
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:43,212
You are the person who dance for the likes

436
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,100
You do not ask for the truth

437
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:48,224
You are also the guy who involve in the secret photography conflict

438
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:50,914
It also happens at the reality show today

439
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:52,448
Ask yourself

440
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:57,364
Without those little tricks  You can never become a qualified and approved host in the gaming industry

441
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,965
Let me tell you

442
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,820
The reason that the industry can have such spectacular development

443
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,581
Is the effort and time that the people spend on it

444
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:06,939
You wan to take the shortcut

445
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,490
Sorry No way

446
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:12,360
Ji Xiangkong

447
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,931
Whatever I did

448
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,207
You don’t have competency to assess me

449
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,542
Beat it

450
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:33,000
Why are you in my room

451
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,699
I miss you

452
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,772
Your palace are comfortable than me

453
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,747
What's this

454
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:40,881
You don’t need to know

455
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,222
What do you looking for

456
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:46,123
The video of Qiu Ying

457
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:48,475
She has been criticized strongly

458
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:55,090
Queen of thorns is not a lane bully

459
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,038
Queen of thorns does not good at trading

460
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:58,520
However she would   However she would consume her own mana

461
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,427
However she would consume her own mana

462
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:01,854
She can not keep spamming her abilities

463
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:06,506
I made a analyzation video about the abilities of Queen of Thorns but it received so many negative comments

464
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:08,865
Don’t waste your time on some meaningless stuff

465
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,931
How can it be the meaningless stuff

466
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,563
Did she join your reality show

467
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:15,838
You two won the championship

468
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,795
When you guys met again by chance in the reality show I felt it must be fate

469
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,435
You look so boring

470
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,612
Maybe we can re-manage the difficulty of the training programme

471
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:27,876
I I I

472
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:30,693
I am not that idle  I can tell you that I am buried in work

473
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,058
I am working on something

474
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,820
It can deal tons of damage to enemy champion on the same vertical line

475
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:39,760
Queen of Thorns is not a bruise champion

476
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:42,357
She can not do the dot effect

477
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:47,608
She is just a support champion  If she was died once, it would influence the player’s tempo

478
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:48,774
She is right

479
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,658
So you have to  play safely and focus on farming

480
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:53,284
Am I being too fuzzy

481
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:33,438
How about you

482
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,657
You say thank you to that liar  Did he impress by your generosity

483
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:39,276
Reflect how fuzzy he was

484
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,908
I am only

485
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,307
Say thank you to him

486
00:30:58,462 --> 00:31:00,000
I told you

487
00:30:59,998 --> 00:31:04,315
You should stay away from Ji Xiangkong because of his bad reputation

488
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,889
I Know

489
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,017
Thanks for your reminder

490
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:25,458
Mum

491
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,482
Am I really that bad

492
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,030
But I will work harder in the future

493
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,961
I will prove myself

494
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,084
The blue team still have the acceleration buff

495
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:57,051
It can be used after the first skill and second skill

496
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:02,738
So So

497
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:52,053
Although you give me a bad comment

498
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:56,053
I still want to say thanks to you because you do spend your time on watching my video

499
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,414
I will keep improving myself

500
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:02,830
Welcome to point out my mistakes which I made in the video

501
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:05,088
You are quite humble

502
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,867
Let me give you some suggestions and discuss with you

503
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:29,142
You come

504
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:32,991
Hello Hello

505
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:34,620
What do you want to drink

506
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,063
Sit down Please

507
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:41,403
Emmm

508
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,313
Did you stuck at a traffic jam

509
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,706
We should meet at another place which is close to VNG

510
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,168
So that it will not influence your training

511
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:52,885
It is so difficult to ask you to hang out  It is really difficult

512
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:54,465
To be honest

513
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,038
In this industry

514
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,449
After so many years I have never seen such a talented player like you

515
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,374
The Penta kill on that day

516
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,602
It was so great

517
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:07,466
double kill    quadra kill     rampage

518
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,779
You know before you entered team VNG

519
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:16,439
I've been paying attention to you

520
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,305
But Your cousin Summer and Shu wen

521
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:23,185
We have been friends for so many years but I still cannot reach their level

522
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,404
But to be honest

523
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,687
VNG are not suitable for you

524
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:29,941
Do you know

525
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:32,574
A solo can never play better than a team

526
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:35,128
It emphasizes the importance of teamworking

527
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:38,780
If your teammates were trolling  you would not allow to beat the game  What can you do

528
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,216
Thus VNG always misses the championship because of this reason

529
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:43,574
Alright

530
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:46,362
You want me to transfer to the team Legends

531
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:49,385
If you agreed with the transfer  I could accept your demands

532
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:50,798
Who is the captain

533
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:52,927
Is Ji Xiangkong
