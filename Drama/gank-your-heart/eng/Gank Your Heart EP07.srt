00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,140
Episode 7

2
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,340
The pictures are all deleted.

3
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,380
Can't finish the task now, what to do now?

4
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,090
I'm also caught.

5
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,610
It's not auspicious to go out today.

6
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,930
chest out, take deep breaths.

7
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,930
It's okay. Heads up,

8
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,990
Let's go.

9
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,430
We have to work hard tomorrow too.

10
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,870
Boss, four computers.

11
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,150
Identification card?

12
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,230
Surprise!

13
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,310
Are you suprised? Are you shocked?

14
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,190
Why did you all come here?

15
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,030
If we don't come here, can we find you?

16
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,230
Busy man.

17
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,780
let's have a gathering.

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,780
Since we're already here,

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,620
Sure, let's go.

20
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,300
It seems like I can't leave.

21
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,820
Ah Xuan,

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,120
look after the shop well.

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,320
Eat, eat some.

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,280
Luo Tian, this rascal.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
Let me tell you, he's too unloyal.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
We agreed to come together.

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
and went to work overtime.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
Midway, he received a call,

29
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
He's always been like that.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's a workaholic.

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,720
Let's understand him.

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,640
Unreliable, come, let's drink.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,990
Lao Gu,

34
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,550
I couldn't go for your departure today,

35
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm really sorry.

36
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,110
What are you saying?

37
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,470
between brothers.

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,470
There's no need to be sorry

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,430
It's okay.

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,510
We know you're not used to these occasions,

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,310
we won't force you.

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,060
You guys specially came from so far,

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,100
just to see me,

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,340
I do feel a little-

45
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,580
A little what?

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,500
Today,

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,460
I do feel a little embarrassed

48
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,690
I said I will treat you guys to a feast.

49
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,810
We made it too simple and crude.

50
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,410
Time really flies.

51
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,850
Lao Gu has quit now.

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,490
Boss.

53
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,730
Is your computer working?

54
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,730
Why not you go home, is that okay?

55
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,650
It's not suitable to game today.

56
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,610
Our training

57
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,130
really rack our brains.

58
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,520
No one dares to even relax.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,880
We pushed ourselves and practiced daily.

60
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
weren't fast enough.

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
We were just worried our hands

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
We made it seem like we weren't tired.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
That's why you're the ace.

64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm not-

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,120
This is not what I mean.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay.

67
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,430
Did you know? That time, he-

68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,190
Do you remember?

69
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,390
plain steamed buns daily.

70
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,390
He'd drink water and eat

71
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,950
I thought he came from a temple.

72
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,670
He doesn't do anything else,

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,670
doesn't even have a girlfriend.

74
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm not as handsome,

75
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,940
I can't talk as well as you guys,

76
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,060
how to find a girlfriend?

77
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,460
You should forget it,

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,740
It's okay to exaggerate about others,

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,340
but in our clique,

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,060
uncountable pretty ladies,

81
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,820
Shu Wen,

82
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,620
are all attracted to him in a matter of minutes.

83
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,900
don't blindly say things.

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,900
You drank too much,

85
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,860
It's okay.

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,180
It's all in the past now.

87
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,740
Come, let's drink.

88
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,420
Don't talk about it, it's over.

89
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,980
It's in the past.

90
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,900
It's over yet you are still

91
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,980
in contact with her.

92
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,210
Who's in close

93
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,890
contact with each other?

94
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,370
The current situation now is pretty good.

95
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,650
Is that right?

96
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,850
Let's drink, okay?

97
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,810
the old days today.

98
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,810
We're here to talk about

99
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,240
Come, talk about the old days.

100
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,860
You're here?

101
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,020
What time's your flight tomorrow?

102
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll go send you off.

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,020
No need.

104
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,340
I can go alone.

105
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,140
Oh right,

106
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,700
I heard Manager Zhao

107
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
but you rejected it.

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
pushed you to go for a reality show,

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,060
I don't like those things that

110
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,060
are a waste of time.

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,730
You should know

112
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,970
why Lao Sun

113
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,650
left this industry right?

114
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,410
I know.

115
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,170
He has his difficulties.

116
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,210
Actually, in those years,

117
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,750
Amongst the five of us,

118
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,270
he was the most fanatical.

119
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,790
He was also the most gifted.

120
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,310
During the digital competition back then,

121
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,990
people thought he wasn't promising.

122
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,790
So once his parents fell ill,

123
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,110
he could only accept reality.

124
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,430
Leader, I don't understand.

125
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,350
Do you want me to go against reality?

126
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,870
Or do you want me to accept reality?

127
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,110
There are down sides to a business,

128
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,710
but there are also plus points.

129
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,510
We must learn to adapt,

130
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,430
in order to go further.

131
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,220
I understand.

132
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,420
In future, as long as it doesn't affect

133
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,260
the team's practice

134
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,060
I'll try my best to cooperate.

135
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay.

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,840
I'll take this away.

137
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
It's photographed pretty well.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
The five new heroes of Conquer,

139
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
Zhi Heng, Jin Can,

140
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,990
Yu Bang, Gong Xi Chang Qing,

141
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,990
and Ah Xin's details are all here.

142
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,150
Our most urgent mission currently

143
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,390
is to get this five heroes.

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,630
During the internal trial game,

145
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,190
catch the opponents off guard.

146
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,060
for this competition?

147
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,060
You want to rely on the new heroes

148
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,500
Have you thought this through?

149
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,620
these new heroes.

150
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,620
We just started practicing with

151
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,020
If we want to win

152
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm afraid it'll be tough.

153
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,050
Not bad.

154
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,530
But, our opponent and our situations

155
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,450
are the same.

156
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,290
We're both getting to know the new heroes.

157
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,170
If we can

158
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,290
grasp the characters earlier,

159
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,610
we can win.

160
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,850
On the other hand,

161
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,690
if our opponents familiarise and use them,

162
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,450
we will also be easily defeated.

163
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,210
Kong ge is right.

164
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,530
Ji Shuai,

165
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,370
you are our leader now.

166
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll comply with everything you say.

167
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,040
Me too.

168
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
Thank you for your trust brothers.

169
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
Let's work hard together.

170
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,350
But, now we have a new problem.

171
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,750
The time is too short.

172
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,310
Manager Zhao let one of us

173
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,590
attend a reality show.

174
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,300
It's such a waste of time.

175
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,100
It's okay, I know this.

176
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,980
Okay.

177
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,580
Let's start training.

178
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,220
Let's practice, brothers.

179
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,460
All the best!

180
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,900
Yu Bang is mine,

181
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,780
no one can snatch from me.

182
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,940
Finally done with it!

183
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:42,970
Thinking about it,

184
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,630
it's good enough that people are watching.

185
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,070
Let's seize time and practice

186
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,790
with the new heroes on Conquer!

187
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,470
Chairman Jin,

188
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,870
Yesterday, the director of Aurora videos

189
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,870
called and said that

190
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,740
it'll be impossible to

191
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,980
work with us in future.

192
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,980
Why?

193
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,380
Don't you know?

194
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,940
Aurora videos selected

195
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,560
Ji Xiang Kong to attend the reality show.

196
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,360
It was all rejected by Ji Xiang Kong.

197
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,320
He said he has no time.

198
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
But

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
But what?

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,160
Speak.

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,160
But he has the time

202
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
to be with that UXStar host

203
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,760
played as a duo.

204
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,760
The two live streamed and

205
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
There's such a thing?

206
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,750
Chairman Jin,

207
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,910
we can't afford to offend

208
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,470
Aurora videos.

209
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,060
Chairman Jin.

210
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,700
XiangKong.

211
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,260
Just nice, I was going to look for you

212
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,380
I heard from Manager Zhao

213
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,490
you and Aurora videos

214
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,650
Chairman Jin,

215
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,690
I came to talk to Manager Zhao

216
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,530
about this matter.

217
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,690
I already confirmed the

218
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,970
reality show's schedule with Aurora videos.

219
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,090
Impossible, this-

220
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,850
I- How come I didn't know?

221
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,530
You didn't know?

222
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,450
Then, you'd have to ask your phone.

223
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,530
Staff from Aurora videos

224
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,960
kept calling you but you didn't pick up.

225
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
Really?

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
There's no call!

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,910
Look!

228
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,870
There really isn't.

229
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,470
Right, Manager Zhao.

230
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,070
In future, any business collaboration

231
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,430
that doesn't affect the team's practice,

232
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,820
as long as you tell me

233
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,020
I will cooperate actively.

234
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,860
Chairman Jin.

235
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,940
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

236
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,420
Practice well.

237
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,660
No, I really didn't receive it.

238
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Really didn't.

239
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,770
Have some tea.

240
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,890
Have some tea.

241
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm not drinking, leave quickly.

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Close the door for me.

243
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,500
Am I really not suitable

244
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,620
to be Conquer's host?

245
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,700
Although you just adjusted from

246
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,420
the real life version,

247
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,540
maybe you're still not used to it.

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,140
But, I can only give you

249
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,210
one month's time.

250
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,450
If until then,

251
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,610
the problem's still not solved,

252
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,130
I can only be apologetic.

253
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,390
[Dear Miss Qiu Ying! Your China Business Bank's loan totals to RMB 2,200,000. Currently you've paid RMB 10,600, please arrange for repayment before the 25th of this month. Thanks!]

254
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,070
[Unknown number]

255
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,270
Hello?

256
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,590
Hello,

257
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,550
Is this UXStar's Qiu Ying?

258
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,670
Yes, and you are?

259
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,990
I am Director An from Aurora videos.

260
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,150
This week, Saturday,

261
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,550
we are holding a reality show.

262
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,350
We're inviting Conquer's professional players

263
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,940
and female hosts to participate.

264
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,380
Do you have the time?

265
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Director An, about that,

266
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Time isn't a problem for me.

267
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,720
But...

268
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,760
Don't worry.

269
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
We will pay you for appearing.

270
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,240
I will send the

271
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,480
full details to your email.

272
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,640
Thank you Director An.

273
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
There's always a way out!

274
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
Thank you God.

275
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,540
Pei Xi!

276
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,090
I just applied some hand cream,

277
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,970
my hands are a little slippery.

278
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,890
Can you help me out?

279
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,650
No need, thank you.

280
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,610
I have mine.

281
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Qiu Ying.

282
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,200
Director An.

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,240
Ji handsome.

284
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
This is Qiu Ying who's grouping with you.

285
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,110
No, Director An,

286
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,430
I-

287
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm pairing with Ji Xiang Kong?

288
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,950
Yeah.

289
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,470
Pei Xi and Qiao Xin are a group.

290
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,990
You two are a group.

291
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,350
You guys can rest here first.

292
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,660
I'll inform everyone

293
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,540
before the filming begins.

294
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Qiu Ying.

295
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,040
What's the matter with you?

296
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Aren't you always in good relation

297
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,520
with Ji Xiang Kong?

298
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,860
Why does it matter to you?

299
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,380
Your idol is leaving.

300
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
Pei Xi, wait for me!

301
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,580
What are you looking at?

302
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,140
In order to appear on this show,

303
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,300
you did quite a lot right?

304
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,900
What do you mean?

305
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,980
Don't tell me the grouping

306
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,220
is purely a coincidence.

307
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,690
Ji Xiang Kong, I'm telling you

308
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,530
I, Qiu Ying, came to this show.

309
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,570
I am honestly

310
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,770
invite here.

311
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,090
Besides, before I came here,

312
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,870
I didn't even know

313
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,390
my partner is you, asshole.

314
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,710
Really?

315
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,910
Okay.

316
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,670
Then, later, I'll

317
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,630
definitely let you enjoy the limelight.

318
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,430
Wrong answer.

319
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,470
Still pretty awesome.

320
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,350
Am I wrong?

321
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,830
Is it D?

322
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,190
Qiu Ying, are you okay?

323
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,070
It's okay.

324
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,190
There's still another chance later on.

325
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,300
Okay, come.

326
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,020
Third question.

327
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,540
We're coming back to Pei Xi's team.

328
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,860
How can the rock beast be able

329
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,060
to take on various positions in the team?

330
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,360
A, decided by skill.

331
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
B, decided by attributes.

332
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,080
C, decided by looks.

333
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
D, decided by outfit.

334
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,160
The correct answer is?

335
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,680
D.

336
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,400
Congratulations, correct answer.

337
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,200
Pei Xi, love you.

338
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,280
Qiao Xin is really lucky.

339
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
Pei Xi answered correctly again.

340
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,110
Then, we've come to

341
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,910
Ji Xiang Kong again.

342
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,590
Will they be able to get it right this time?

343
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,630
Listen to the question.

344
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,110
How many times can

345
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,590
the ignited stick cause harm?

346
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,620
A, once.

347
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,700
B, twice.

348
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,380
C, thrice.

349
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,300
D, unlimited times.

350
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Please answer carefully.

351
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,770
D.

352
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,170
D, is that right?

353
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,850
Wrong answer.

354
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,850
Ji Xiang Kong!

355
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,930
Our punishment set up

356
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,570
still has a little bit of

357
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,770
visual illusion.

358
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,040
Qiu Ying, are you okay?

359
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,160
Quickly find someone to help Qiu Ying up.

360
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,000
Ji Xiang Kong,

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,440
you're just messing with me.

362
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,960
You're just messing with me.

363
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,680
Now, we see that Qiu Ying

364
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,800
is a little angry.

365
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,630
A little frustrated.

366
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,150
Why do you always answer wrongly?

367
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,870
I'm participating on a reality show

368
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,550
for the first time.

369
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,550
I'm a little nervous.

370
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,270
Qiu Ying still

371
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,430
looks a little moody.

372
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,430
Did it hurt when you fell?

373
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,300
Okay, so currently,

374
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,180
we are at our last question.

375
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,420
It's also on Ji Xiang Kong.

376
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,700
Currently, this side has yet to succeed.

377
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,700
So you'll need to work hard.

378
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,300
Listen to the question please.

379
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,460
Hero Lightning God's skill

380
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,940
is shot from the left hand

381
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,060
or the right?

382
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,810
Simply choose between the two options.

383
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,730
Please answer.

384
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,770
Ji Xiang Kong, if you have the ability,

385
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,170
continue answering wrongly!

386
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,570
Let me tell you.

387
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,690
I

388
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,360
I, Qiu Ying, was never

389
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,240
afraid.

390
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,960
Left hand.

391
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
Left hand.

392
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,320
Wrong answer.

393
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,420
Qiu Ying.

394
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,100
Qiu Ying are you ok?

395
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,300
Ji Xiang Kong, you did it purposely.

396
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,380
You did it purposely.

397
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,220
Today, this team

398
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,380
didn't get any questions correct.

399
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,020
Qiu Ying who is inside, you must hold on.

400
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,660
Okay.

401
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,660
After this round's tussle,

402
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,020
Pei Xi and Qiao Xin's team

403
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,140
are currently first.

404
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,180
Then, let's invite Qiao Xin

405
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,020
and Qiu Ying on stage.

406
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,660
Please.

407
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,530
Congratulations to Pei Xi's team.

408
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,570
So, do you guys have anything

409
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,230
you want to say now?

410
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,390
I'm very grateful

411
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,950
Is it meaningful?

412
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,550
And my partner, Pei Xi.

413
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,190
I'll decide if it's meaningful or not.

414
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,190
Okay.

415
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,230
Then, let me once again congratulate

416
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,110
Pei Xin's team

417
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,390
for entering the next round first.

418
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,550
Dear Audience, you are now watching

419
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,230
Aurora video's

420
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,350
heavily weighted reality show's

421
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,150
ace heroes competiton site

422
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,980
brought to you by

423
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,220
Good shop high end snacks.

424
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,740
Coming up next,

425
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,500
we are entering the second round,

426
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,500
2V2 battle.

427
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,520
I hope that you can treat

428
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,680
this competition seriously.

429
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
Let me see your true abilities.

430
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,630
We can see that

431
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,390
the two professional gods

432
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,990
are peacefully developing on the line.

433
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,430
not bothering about their team mates.

434
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,260
But Qiao Xin and Qiu Ying

435
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,460
are fighting fiercely.

436
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,540
Qiao Xin.

437
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,100
Who called you to be against me?

438
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,570
Qiu Ying, stop chasing.

439
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,170
If you're unable to fight, then retreat, Qiu Ying.

440
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,090
Dodge.

441
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,410
Qiu Ying was chased into the vacinity of

442
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,570
the imperial tower by Qiao Xin.

443
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,010
She's 'bleeding' and injured.

444
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,850
Pei Xi, quickly come and help me.

445
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,010
Pei Xi appeared at this moment

446
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,210
and controlled Qiu Ying with one move.

447
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,530
Ji Xiang Kong, I'm dying.

448
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,640
Quickly come and save me.

449
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,040
I can't anymore.

450
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,360
I don't want to die

451
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,960
with you.

452
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,840
Qiao Xin turned around to cooperate

453
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,760
with Pei Xi's creator,

454
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
killing the injured Qiu Ying.

455
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,640
Nice.

456
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,680
First blood.

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,230
Died again.

458
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,390
We see the injured Ji Xiang Kong,

459
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,430
is still remaining in the middle,

460
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,390
Don't you want to play 1V2?

461
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,070
What do you mean 1V2?

462
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,500
I think it's more like 1V3.

463
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,780
This Ji Xiang Kong

464
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,900
is in with you guys right?

465
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,020
If you want to win,

466
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,700
then follow me.

467
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,540
I said, if you want to win,

468
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,900
then follow me, don't go anywhere else.

469
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,540
I'm not helping you,

470
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,060
I don't want you to drag me down.

471
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
Am I seeking help from Ji Xiang Kong?

472
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,770
Wait, what are we doing?

473
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,330
Why did Qiu Ying

474
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,730
ran till midway and stopped moving?

475
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,570
Ji Xiang Kong is midway.

476
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,250
Pei Xi, come here quickly.

477
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,930
He's injured.

478
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,890
Quick, chase him.

479
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,490
You stay here,

480
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,210
don't go anywhere.

481
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,810
Pei Xi,

482
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,800
directly charged towards Ji Xiang Kong.

483
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
You're making me wait for death alone.

484
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,520
Is this your tactic?

485
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,320
If you want to win,

486
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,240
then follow what I instruct you, do you hear me?

487
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,680
Wait in the bushes.

488
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
If I don't call you over, don't come over.

489
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,920
What's she doing?

490
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,060
Pei Xi is following Ji Xiang Kong.

491
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,660
After reaching the tower,

492
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,500
hide well.

493
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,700
Don't be in their line of sight.

494
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,580
You- you're sure

495
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,620
that you don't me to help you?

496
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,820
If this continues, it's dangerous

497
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,860
for Ji Xiang Kong.

498
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,300
Stay there, don't move.

499
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I've attract Pei Xi over.

500
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,420
Okay, go, we can fight now.

501
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,860
Fight.

502
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,700
What do I do?

503
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,180
Fight, do something drastic.

504
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,140
Okay.

505
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,060
Control him, control.

506
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,020
This is a trap.

507
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,140
Ji Xiang Kong's used his skills

508
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,500
to control Qiao Xin and Pei Xi.

509
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,020
Qiu Ying cooperated with Ji Xiang Kong

510
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,860
and killed Qiao Xin.

511
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,900
Nice.

512
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,580
A wave.

513
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,300
Continue chasing, don't.

514
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,540
Don't let your hands leave the keyboard.

515
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,660
Got it.

516
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,980
What a wave of waiting for the target.

517
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,890
Follow me and push.

518
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:00,490
Coming.

519
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,010
The speed that they're pushing

520
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,050
the tower is really fast.

521
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,610
They pushed it off.

522
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,010
Now, push the last crystal.

523
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,090
Come on!

524
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,450
Nice.

525
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,950
Congratulations to Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying.

526
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,030
Ji Xiang Kong, we won!

527
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,110
Congratulations.

528
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,670
This was also a very exciting

529
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,470
competition.

530
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,070
Come, let's also welcome

531
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,990
Pei Xi and Qiao Xin.

532
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,470
Come onto stage, please.

533
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,270
Okay, Pei Xi and Qiao Xin.

534
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,870
Then, I announce.

535
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,310
The second round of the competition

536
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,790
Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying

537
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,270
won the 2V2 battle.

538
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,350
Congratulations to both.

539
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,480
Hi?

540
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,510
I'll tell you a piece of good news.

541
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,110
I won!

542
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,710
You- You won!

543
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,790
The prize is

544
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,950
Limited edition Conquer's doll,

545
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,190
Good shop's member rewards card

546
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,430
and a laptop.

547
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,860
Really?

548
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,780
No.

549
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,580
But,

550
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,380
based on your standard,

551
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,860
It's Ji Xiang Kong.

552
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,330
At first, he was truly messing with me.

553
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,410
But, in the end, when it got urgent,

554
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,130
you don't know how powerful he is.

555
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,730
He defeated Pei Xi and Qiao Xin

556
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,970
like falling water.

557
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,770
Too addictive!

558
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,450
This isn't reasonable.

559
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,690
But the reality is exactly so.

560
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,450
Maybe he conciously discovered.

561
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:46,930
Director An.

562
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,250
Qiu Ying, sorry.

563
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,970
Ji handsome left this doll behind.

564
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,400
Can I trouble you to hand it to him?

565
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm really too busy.

566
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
Thank you.

567
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,320
Can I take a picture with you?

568
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,120
- Thanks.

569
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,120
Sure.

570
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,910
One, two, three.

571
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,630
Okay.

572
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,030
Thank you!

573
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,500
Others call you the battleground's swindler

574
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,980
There definitely are people who call me that.

575
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
You definitely tricked me just now.

576
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,860
It's merely a small trap.

577
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,700
I didn't expect you to really fall for it.

578
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,860
Not bad.

579
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,500
At first, I thought that rookie

580
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,060
will become your burden.

581
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,770
I didn't expect

582
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,850
you'll still be able to make use of her.

583
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,770
People do their best.

584
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,490
This is my principle for using people.

585
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:38,810
If the battle today,

586
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,730
was 1V1,

587
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,720
you definitely won't win.

588
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,240
Perhaps.

589
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
You are the quickest in all the alliances.

590
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,200
If I battled you alone,

591
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
there's a higher chance of me losing.

592
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,560
But, don't forget.

593
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,900
Conquer is never a

594
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,180
solo competition.

595
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,100
It'd be best if you brought out your capabilities today

596
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,900
during the internal trial game.

597
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,340
I'll only do better.

598
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,420
Because we are

599
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
a five member group.

600
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,340
See you at the internal trial game.

601
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,980
Ji Xiang Kong!

602
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,300
Wait a minute!

603
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,410
Wait a minute!

604
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,650
You forgot your doll.

605
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,690
Director An asked me to send it to you.

606
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,910
Thanks.

607
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,150
No problem.

608
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,230
Actually,

609
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,030
I should be the one thanking you.

610
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,230
Thank you.

611
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,910
For allowing me to be a champion today.

612
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,790
And you did well

613
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,310
for today's battle.

614
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,670
Without you, I could have played better.

615
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,190
I know.

616
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,230
But I still want to thank you.

617
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,950
Is there still anything else?

618
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,670
Hand.

619
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,220
I want to

620
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,860
treat you to a meal.

621
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,520
Treat me to a meal?

622
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,080
I messed with you the whole day.

623
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,120
Yet, you still want to treat me to a meal?

624
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,000
You didn't injure yourself during the fall did you?

625
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,800
It's ok.

626
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Actually,

627
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,040
the elevation stage,

628
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,000
was pretty exciting.

629
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,200
Actually,

630
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,400
I have a dream.

631
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,070
I've always wanted to be a

632
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,550
gaming host.

633
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,030
I've been learning these days.

634
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,230
But I figured

635
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,470
Conquer doesn't seem

636
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,740
as simple as I thought.

637
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,340
And before I understood,

638
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,100
I got to know you.

639
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
A professional gamer.

640
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,060
So,

641
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,620
So you want me to teach you.

642
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,770
Sure.

643
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,690
How to teach you?

644
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,530
It's like this.

645
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,050
I made a brambles queen

646
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,770
hero skills explanation video.

647
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,610
But it's horribly made.

648
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,490
And I got scolded badly by netizens.

649
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,250
If it's convenient for you,

650
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,770
can you have a look at it for me?

651
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,730
Okay, let's watch it here.

652
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,400
Or do we watch it at your home?

653
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,880
My home?

654
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
You put in so much effort

655
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,520
isn't it all to have

656
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,400
an affair with me,

657
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,230
and spark some gossip out?

658
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,390
I-

659
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,670
I didn't mean it this way.

660
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,070
Let go.

661
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,430
Act, continue acting.

662
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,900
Loosening the reins in order to grasp better isn't it?

663
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,420
You're already so direct.

664
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,340
Let's be more straight forward, okay?

665
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
Let's go, to your home.

666
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,940
Ji Xiang Kong.

667
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,460
You are too much!

668
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,940
Am I too much

669
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,820
or are you being dramatic?

670
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,540
It's you who were pretending

671
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,100
to be Gu Fang's fan in Vancouver.

672
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,410
On the conquer programme,

673
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,570
in order to increase views,

674
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,730
you were the one who danced.

675
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,690
The one who didn't ask for the truth

676
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,850
and secretly filmed and uploaded the conflict video

677
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,730
was still you.

678
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,480
Including today's reality show.

679
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,240
Ask yourself.

680
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,880
Besides being a little smart,

681
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,840
how are you good enough

682
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,480
to join the gaming industry

683
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
as a qualified host?

684
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,520
Let me tell you.

685
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,420
Many people worked hard and

686
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,060
seriously in order to get

687
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,220
the industry to this stage.

688
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,700
and seek a shortcut,

689
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,700
If you want to have a quick success

690
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,140
Sorry, there's no way.

691
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,220
Ji Xiang Kong.

692
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,500
No matter what I, Qiu Ying, do

693
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,900
there's no way an asshole like you

694
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,860
can educate me!

695
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,260
Step aside.

696
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,130
Why did you come to my room again

697
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,970
when there's nothing to do?

698
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,410
It's because I miss you.

699
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,570
Besides, it's comfortable here.

700
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,570
What's this?

701
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,830
Why does it matter to you?

702
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,270
What are you watching?

703
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,830
Qiu Ying's video.

704
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,030
She got scolded really badly.

705
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,630
When the brambles queen is laning,

706
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,430
it can't be too long.

707
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,790
Can't use up too much of

708
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,070
the opponent's hero's blood levels.

709
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,030
But it will cause oneself-

710
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,430
But she will use up her own skills

711
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,830
so you can't use it normally.

712
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,630
I made a brambles queen

713
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,190
hero explaination video.

714
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,550
I got scolded badly by netizens.

715
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,870
If you have nothing to do, don't watch

716
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,910
this type of nonsense.

717
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,830
How is this

718
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,020
a nonsensical thing?

719
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,620
Didn't she also go for

720
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,700
that reality show of yours?

721
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,620
You two even became champion.

722
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,300
Speaking of which,

723
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,900
the both of you are pretty fated.

724
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
I think you are pretty bored.

725
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,520
Why not we add

726
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,800
two hours of practice for you?

727
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,280
I-

728
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm not bored at all.

729
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm busy, let me tell you.

730
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm busy.

731
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,200
When faced with an opponent's hero

732
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,760
of the same level,

733
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,120
it can cause really bad damage.

734
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,080
When the brambles queen is laning,

735
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,040
it can't be too long.

736
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,430
Can't use up too much of

737
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,670
the opponent's hero's blood levels.

738
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,590
It's an auxiliary hero.

739
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,510
If it dies once,

740
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,110
it affects their own blood levels as well.

741
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,270
What she says is true.

742
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,060
So, you need to develop it carefully.

743
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,700
Was it a little too much?

744
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,110
How was it?

745
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,390
You thanked that liar

746
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,750
Was he shocked

747
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,470
by your generousity?

748
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,950
And reflect on how mean he was?

749
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,660
I just

750
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,820
told him thank you.

751
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,980
Let me tell you.

752
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,050
Ji Xiang Kong was

753
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,170
always talked about negatively.

754
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,610
It's best to stay further away from him.

755
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,730
I got it.

756
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,960
Thanks for your reminder.

757
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,420
Mom.

758
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,540
Am I really that bad?

759
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,980
I will definitely work really hard.

760
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,820
I won't let others look down on me anymore.

761
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,290
The hero here with me

762
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,490
also has the speeding effect.

763
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,250
You can use it after you've used the first two skills.

764
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,030
Produced roughly, excessively made.

765
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,390
There are many mistakes.]

766
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,390
[Produced roughly, excessively made,

767
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,720
Although your comment was very negative,

768
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,120
but I'm still very grateful that you

769
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,760
clicked into my video.

770
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,280
I'm still working hard and learning.

771
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,280
As for the wrong parts in the video,

772
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,550
you're welcome to criticise and correct it.

773
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,870
Still pretty humble...

774
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,430
Then I'll come and

775
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,110
guide you.

776
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,700
And pick out your problems.

777
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,130
You're here.

778
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:46,930
Hello.

779
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,810
What would you like to drink?

780
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,930
Have a seat.

781
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,480
That-

782
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,560
The traffic's pretty bad right?

783
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
If I knew, I would have booked

784
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,000
besides VNG.

785
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Right?

786
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,360
That way I won't hold up

787
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,240
your practice time.

788
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,310
Being able to get you to meet me

789
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,910
is really too difficult.

790
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,670
Truthfully speaking,

791
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,230
I've been in this industry

792
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,110
for many years.

793
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,030
I've never met

794
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,630
such a genius player like you.

795
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,700
The five kills that day,

796
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,700
was really awesome.

797
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,500
Double kill.

798
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,580
Quadraple kill.

799
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,620
Runaway.

800
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,460
Did you know?

801
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,100
Earlier, before you were in VNG,

802
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,700
I've started noticing you.

803
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,460
But your cousins, Xia Tian and Shu Wen,

804
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,450
are old friends for many years.

805
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,650
I'm too inferior to compare.

806
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,570
I don't have a choice.

807
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,770
But, I'll say something truthful.

808
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,050
VNG isn't really suitable for you.

809
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,530
Do you know?

810
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,000
Being strong alone, can't be qualified as strong.

811
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,080
Besides, this is a

812
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,600
team game, am I right?

813
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,760
Your team mate is messing with you.

814
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,800
They can't bring good results.

815
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,200
Then what do we do?

816
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,320
That's why in these years

817
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,660
VNG is always

818
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,900
one step away from championship.

819
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,060
Am I right?

820
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,820
You want me to transfer to Legends

821
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,220
As long as you're willing,

822
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm willing to accept anything, really.

823
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,420
Who's the leader?

824
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,220
Is it Ji Xiang Kong?
