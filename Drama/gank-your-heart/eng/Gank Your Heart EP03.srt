[Episode 3]

3
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,540
You guys finally

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,420
gotten the champion after participating

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,700
in Iconquer for so many years.

6
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,500
It's not easy, congratulations.

7
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,460
Losers.

8
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,740
If we are losers just because

9
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,740
we lost a match,

10
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,860
then haven't you guys

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,860
been one for many years?

12
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,970
The champion is still ours next year.

13
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,850
Where's Gu Fang?

14
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,330
Is he hiding under his blanket crying?

15
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,910
-Talk nicely.             -Don't be rash.

16
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,710
Isn't he very strong last time

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,150
when he used the Spirited Princess?

18
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,110
How did he become

19
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,990
so so so so useless?

20
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,950
Who are you saying?

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,670
Ji Xiang Kong attacking someone,

22
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,590
and it's Jeffery.

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,230
Hey Jeffery,

24
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,150
stop.

25
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,550
Stop.

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,670
Get on the van, all of you.

27
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,550
What are you guys doing?

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,190
Still not behaving yourselves even at overseas. Hop on.

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,400
Sister Xin.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Sister Xin,

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,400
your review

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
for Iconquer just now

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,840
was done really well.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
It's no doubt the first

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,520
host in You Xing.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,430
Everyone, don't you agree?

37
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,950
Yes.

38
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,670
Without you guys,

39
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,430
supporting me behind my back,

40
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,270
I wouldn't be

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,550
able to be where I am today.

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,430
How about this,

43
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,740
I'll treat you guys coffee next time.

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,380
How about it?

45
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Okay. Thank you, Sister Xin.

46
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,930
Based on how she talks, she's indeed number 1.

47
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,290
Not bad,

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
trending number 1.

49
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,720
President Liu.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,360
Come on in.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
Hurry, Qiao Xin, have a seat.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,600
President Liu, what time is it now?

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,910
Aren't you going home yet?

54
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,430
Don't bother with those.

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,150
Here, do take care of your health.

56
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,270
Have a seat first.

57
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,190
Here.

58
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,670
How can I trouble you

59
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,430
with this stuff?

60
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,380
You see, our Iconquer page

61
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,700
is able to get it's first opportunity

62
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
is all due to your hard work.

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,860
Iconquer in the future

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,260
will be our company's

65
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,020
highly valued programme.

66
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,500
You'll have to work harder.

67
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,580
Don't worry, my programme usually is the first

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,340
amongst all programmes with highest views

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,180
but sadly, I'm down on luck.

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,340
Who gets to go to Vancouver

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,340
to interview was decided

72
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,060
through lucky draw.

73
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,580
Such a good opportunity

74
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,130
is missed just like that.

75
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,890
The life programme transfer some people over.

76
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,890
Boss have to be fair

77
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,290
so he had it drawn.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,410
It's not nice of me to object right?

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
You say this Qiu Ying, she's

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
definitely incomparable to

81
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,720
you interms of professionalism and experience

82
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
but if there's a chance,

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,240
do help her more.

84
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
But you don't say,

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,020
she just sent me a video

86
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,660
on Legends and Tatan

87
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,780
getting into a fight

88
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,500
after the competition.

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,740
If this goes online, it's going to trend.

90
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,140
It's now trending number 1.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,620
Our You Xing, gamer programme

92
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,620
is after all young

93
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,140
comparing to big

94
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,740
companies like Ji Guang.

95
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,700
This is not comparable

96
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,700
so we can only have suprises

97
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,820
on our content.

98
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,820
Qiao Xin,

99
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,660
I watched you grow up.

100
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,940
I have high expectations of you.

101
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,060
Ji Guang

102
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,970
has such top notch commentator like Luo Tian.

103
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,490
I hope you'll become

104
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,250
the Luo Tian of our company.

105
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,130
I won't let

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,370
your hopes down.

107
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,250
Qiao Xin is indeed Qian Xin,

108
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,550
I definitely see you well.

109
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,190
Let me appreciate this

110
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,470
number 1 trending topic a little longer.

111
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,270
Ji Xiang Kong, congratulations.

112
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,630
You're on the trending topic again.

113
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,870
Isn't it a usual thing

114
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,830
for us to trend?

115
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Usual?

116
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,590
You fighting with Jeffery

117
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,590
just now, was filmed

118
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,990
and uploaded online.

119
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,990
See for yourself.

120
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,540
Who filmed it?

121
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Even posted it online, there's no morality.

122
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Someone named Qiu Ying

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,640
under You Xing.

124
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Do you guys know her?

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
You guys just hope that your Manager Zhao

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680
is able to settle

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
this issue properly.

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,440
Otherwise,

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
punishment will be waiting for you all.

130
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,590
This Ji Xiang Kong,

131
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,510
I can't get through his phone.

132
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,100
-His phone is always off.          -Qiu Ying.

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,820
Yan Yan.

134
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,820
Welcome our great hero home.

135
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,460
Do you know?

136
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,170
The moment you posted the video

137
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,770
yesterday, the views rose up to

138
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,410
number 1 online.

139
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,890
Number 1?

140
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,530
I surpassed Qiao Xin?

141
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,650
Yes, it's a sensation

142
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,850
in our company.

143
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,490
President Liu is very happy.

144
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,850
Go look for him quickly.

145
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,490
He's waiting for you.

146
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,850
Okay, I'll head up first.

147
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,210
Where are you going?

148
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm... I'm buying something to drink.

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,920
Do you want anything? I'll get it for you.

150
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Did Qiao Xin get you to buy her coffee again?

151
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,350
We are colleagues anyway.

152
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,110
I'm just helping her on the way.

153
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,750
Yan Yan, you can't be so weak.

154
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,710
I'll teach you a way.

155
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,300
I guarantee she wouldn't

156
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
order you to buy her coffee anymore.

157
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,260
Let's go.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,120
No,

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
why isn't there anyone?

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Is there no work today?

161
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,280
Shouldn't there be fresh fowers and salutes

162
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,440
to welcome us?

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,220
We are at least still the first runner up.

164
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,460
Second in the world okay?

165
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,100
Nobody cares about the second.

166
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,820
So practical?

167
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,300
This society is this practical.

168
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,980
Everyone must be tired,

169
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
unpack your stuff

170
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,060
and rest well.

171
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,820
But coach, where do we place the trophy?

172
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,500
-Put it at the achievement shelves.         -Okay.

173
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,060
Bye, coach.

174
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,980
I'll head out for a while.

175
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,740
Help me put my luggage back.

176
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Don't enter my room.

177
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,500
If you were to make

178
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,260
my room a mess,

179
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,500
you'll sleep in the training room.

180
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,380
No, Brother Kong,

181
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,140
it was pretty harmonious

182
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,900
when we were dorm mates.

183
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,050
Talk to me about harmonious

184
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,810
when you have

185
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,850
pack up your pig sty.

186
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,210
Aren't you also staying...

187
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,570
Let's go.

188
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,990
Let's go.

189
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,710
Qiu Ying, you're back.

190
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,230
That's great, congratulations.

191
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,070
Thank you.

192
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,350
Qiu Ying.

193
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,750
Yi Yi,

194
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,790
you're awesome. Number 1 on the net.

195
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,030
It's also your credit too.

196
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,030
How?

197
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,270
Isn't Qiu Ying awesome?

198
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,380
Our Qiu Ying is back,

199
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,740
isn't it?

200
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,500
President Liu.

201
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,500
You did well this time round.

202
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,340
Nice work.

203
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,700
Here, give her a round of applause

204
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,380
as encouragement.

205
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,940
Thank you President Liu and everyone.

206
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,620
You've worked hard this time.

207
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,980
Here, clet's have a chat on the results

208
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,000
this time round.

209
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Okay.

210
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll go get busy first.

211
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
-I'll wait for you at home.          -Wait for me.

212
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,280
All the best.

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Hello.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,880
Hello, manager Zhao.

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,710
Xiao Xin Xin.

216
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,470
It's regarding the video that filmed

217
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,350
the conflict at the carpark.

218
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,190
I have something to say.

219
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,900
This trip to canada

220
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,300
must be tiring.

221
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,860
It's okay, that's what I should be doing.

222
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,500
And I have many shortcomings this time

223
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,420
with my job,

224
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,490
I'm here to apologise.

225
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,210
It's nothing,

226
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,850
your performance is great.

227
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,850
This is your first interview.

228
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,730
Everyone do see

229
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,850
your hard work,

230
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,330
it's already perfect.

231
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,170
Thank you, President Liiu.

232
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,650
I'llcontinue to work hard.

233
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,690
All the best.

234
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,650
Oh, President Liu.

235
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,770
Will i bring trouble to

236
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,930
the company after I uploaded

237
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,640
the conflect video

238
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
between Legends and Tatan?

239
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
Totally not.

240
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,480
You're only reporting the truth,

241
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,120
you're not adding oil to fire.

242
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
The team will not

243
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,120
hold it against us.

244
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,310
-That's good.           -Don't worry.

245
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,910
Hello?

246
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,190
Hello, I'm Zhao Yang from Legends.

247
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,020
manager Zhao,

248
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
hello.

249
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,260
I'll ask you something.

250
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,860
Is there such person, Qiu Ying under your company?

251
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,220
Yes.

252
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,500
We do have such a person.

253
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,460
You should know then

254
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,340
about the video she uploaded.

255
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,340
Qiu Ying

256
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,180
is not back yet.

257
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,820
What to do?

258
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Why not let's wait for her to return

259
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,100
so I can understand the situation better.

260
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,820
Don't give me bullshit.

261
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,700
You better settle

262
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,490
this matter well, otherwise

263
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,650
wait for my lawyer's letter.

264
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,410
Do you hear me?

265
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,290
No, Manager Zhao,

266
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,890
don't get angry just yet.

267
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,360
President Liu, did I caused

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
trouble for the company?

269
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,840
He said it's a bad influence

270
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
so he will nnot accept

271
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,720
our interview in the future.

272
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,180
How about

273
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,380
I go and explain to them

274
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,940
and apologise?

275
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,900
See if it's able to be resolve.

276
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,780
You don't have to go, don't worry about it.

277
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,140
The company will settle this issue.

278
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,900
I remember

279
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,500
Qiao Han and Manager Zhao

280
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,220
has a good relation.

281
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,500
She can settle this issue.

282
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,340
Also, about trending number 1...

283
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,860
Technically, our company

284
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,220
will give a sum of money as reward

285
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,820
but now,

286
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,060
we are revamping out programmes

287
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,100
so I'm in a lot of stress.

288
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,180
Let us talk about

289
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,060
the cash reward next time?

290
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,630
if only Ji Xiang Kong arrives earlier

291
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,150
in that operation just now,

292
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,230
it wouldn't be like this.

293
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,750
He's known for being a crippled,

294
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,670
what do we do?

295
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,110
Is there any free instant noodles here

296
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,140
today, Boss?

297
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,420
Yoou're already the world's first runner up,

298
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,780
you're still here to eat my instant noodles.

299
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,420
Bos,, the computer hanged.

300
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,460
Coming.

301
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,600
Xiang Kong, wait for me upstairs.

302
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,560
Qiu Ying, I'm done with my stuff.

303
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,680
How about you?

304
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,200
What reward did President Liu gave you?

305
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,750
No reward.

306
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,030
If the issue is not settled,

307
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,030
I might even need to compensate.

308
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,300
Why?

309
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,740
Don't film on the streets

310
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,340
if you have nothing better to do.

311
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't you think that you can

312
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,700
do a random broadcast just because you thought it was something big.

313
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,890
Just in case,

314
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,010
you cause trouble to the company.

315
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,170
Okay, we know.

316
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,810
Yan Yan,

317
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,850
I told you to get me coffee.

318
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,850
Why did you take so long?

319
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,250
Here's your coffee.

320
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,520
I wanted ice removed,

321
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,680
why did you get something so hot for me?

322
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,160
I... I... I forgot.

323
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,870
What's this?

324
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,990
It's so disgusting.

325
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,070
This is the cafe's new release,

326
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,380
it's called Sea Salt Butter Beer Coffee.

327
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,020
I bought you a cup

328
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,340
thinking that you'll like it.

329
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,900
Is this even for human?

330
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,580
You can't even do a simple

331
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,460
task Sister Xin asked

332
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,260
you to do.

333
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,660
Look how angry you made her.

334
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,740
She still has to host later.

335
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,500
Right, Sister Xin?

336
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,170
I'm... I'm... Sorry, Sister Xin.

337
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,450
I'll definitely buy the

338
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,330
flavour you like next time.

339
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,370
I'll definitely not

340
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,770
hold you back for your hosting.

341
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,450
I'm sorry, Sister Xin.

342
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,290
Sorry.

343
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,080
I don't need you to

344
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,640
buy me coffee anymore, do you hear me?

345
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
So stupid.

346
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
Why is she so stupid?

347
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,900
She said I don't need to buy her coffee anymore.

348
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,340
That's right.

349
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,980
Is Gu fang still okay?

350
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,820
Why don't you ask about me?

351
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,820
Aren't you

352
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
used to getting scolded?

353
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,650
Why didn't you change tactics?

354
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,650
Gu Fang's condition is clearly not okay.

355
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,970
I mentioned to let Brother yao

356
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,970
to switch with captain.

357
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,410
but Zhao Yang and Coach Luo

358
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,370
doesn't agree.

359
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,350
It's not bad.

360
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,190
Huo Yao goes to mid

361
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,430
to contain Jeffery,

362
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,790
you guys have a 80% chance to win.

363
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,190
Gu Fang is unwilling to?

364
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,550
I didn't tell him.

365
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,830
He's almost 30,

366
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,030
he doesn't have much time

367
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,910
in this battlefield.

368
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,180
If Gu fang were to retire,

369
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
what do you have in mind?

370
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
I really hasn't thought of this question.

371
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,760
Truth to be told,

372
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,200
it's all thanks to him

373
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,560
that I'm able to stay in Legends.

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,040
Don't you forget,

375
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,760
what did you say

376
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,840
when you were taken

377
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,150
away from me.

378
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,150
How could I forget?

379
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,790
Getting the champion is my dream.

380
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,470
You'll go on forward

381
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,590
with Gu Fang's and

382
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,190
mine dreams.

383
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,300
Brother Sun, I'll be really stress

384
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,460
if you say that.

385
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,700
Afraid now?

386
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,420
Are you backing out?

387
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,940
I heard

388
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,100
Manager Zhao from your team

389
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,290
don't see you in the eye.

390
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,250
It doesn't matter if he don't see me in the eye.

391
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,810
He have thoughts

392
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,730
on earning money only.

393
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,210
Scheduled us to participate

394
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,850
in commercial events

395
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,010
one after another.

396
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,530
He doesn't dare do anything

397
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,930
when captain is around,

398
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,130
I don't know

399
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,410
what it'll be like

400
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,610
after captain retires.

401
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,250
Here, big host Qiu.

402
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,160
Congratulations. You gained fame in a single battle.

403
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,080
Don't laugh at me anymore.

404
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400
Producer Lu,

405
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
you're spot on.

406
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,230
The days of eating grass awaits me

407
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,070
when I'm back

408
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,990
from this impromptu trip.

409
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,310
It's okay.

410
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,550
I didn't ask you to return me the money right?

411
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,470
I'm... I'm not rushing

412
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,620
you either.

413
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,580
No hurry.

414
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,820
Our Yi Yi is

415
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,820
still the best to me.

416
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,340
Of course.

417
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,460
Because you're my favourite.

418
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,100
Hurry, eat up.

419
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,300
Eat more, you're too skinny.

420
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm famished.

421
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,580
It's not bad.

422
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,620
Right? It's nice right?

423
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,410
Oh,

424
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,730
the day you went Vancouver,

425
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,130
the car booked by the company

426
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,290
went to the train station instead.

427
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,050
You guess, what happened?

428
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,520
Is there still a need to guess?

429
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,480
Must be Qiao Xin's doings.

430
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,960
You say Qiao Xin,

431
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,120
doesn't put her energy

432
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,800
into work

433
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,240
but thinking of pranking others,

434
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,580
how despicable.

435
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,500
Forget it.

436
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,420
I have no energy to even

437
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,300
think about her now.

438
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,020
Right, don't mention her.

439
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,340
Do you know, Yi Yi?

440
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,180
This trip to Vancouver

441
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,100
brought me many touching moments.

442
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,140
That moment when the competiton was lost,

443
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,500
I saw many fans of Legends

444
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,420
crying.

445
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,700
I almost cried myself.

446
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,900
Although I don't understand what's going on.

447
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,220
Then why did you cry?

448
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,340
I was touched.

449
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,700
Then,

450
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,410
I followed Legends to the bar.

451
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,130
I saw Gu Fang

452
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,410
sitting in a corner drinking.

453
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,890
Then he told Ji Xiang Kong

454
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,090
something.

455
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,010
That moment, I suddenly understand

456
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,030
that to many people,

457
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,310
it's not just a competition,

458
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,790
it's their dream.

459
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,390
I know,

460
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,790
you're a person with dreams.

461
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,470
So when you see people who are similar to you

462
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,550
out there,

463
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,470
you definitely

464
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,110
can't help but to relate to them.

465
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,710
Actually, I'm quite envious of them.

466
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,630
They'd do anything for their dreams.

467
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,550
They can just cry out loud if they fail,

468
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,950
unlike me.

469
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,390
Ever since my Dad married that woman,

470
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,620
my biggest dream is

471
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,100
to have a house of my own.

472
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,820
So I work my life off to earn money,

473
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,860
work hard for my job.

474
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,680
I used up all my savings

475
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,200
to pay for the

476
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,880
down payment of this house.

477
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,080
This house

478
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
is a promise I gave my Mother.

479
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,520
So no matter what, I have

480
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,840
to secure this job

481
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,270
at You Xing.

482
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,030
Right, Yi Yi.

483
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,390
I suddenly

484
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,670
have a new thought.

485
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,350
Since I chose this job,

486
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,420
and I got transferred to gamer programme.

487
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,060
I must be a professional host

488
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,180
that understands my job well.

489
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,900
It's good to have dreams

490
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,660
but I have to remind you that

491
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,130
on the road to success,

492
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,810
there's many obstacles

493
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,770
waiting for you.

494
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,210
Even if there's no obstacles,

495
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,370
there's many things

496
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,970
that's different from what you think.

497
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,570
Forget it.

498
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,570
Enough said.

499
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,650
I'll go get some fruits.

500
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,670
Who are you calling?

501
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,190
That damn Ji Xiang Kong

502
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,590
from Legends.

503
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,150
I've been calling and texting

504
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,790
him from

505
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,750
Vancouver till now,

506
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,590
but he's not picking up

507
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,740
or replying my text.

508
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,660
Wait, you mean Ji Xiang Kong?

509
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,100
No,

510
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,700
what's the situation between the both of you?

511
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
Why did you have his number?

512
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,500
He took my Mother's necklace.

513
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,780
From now on,

514
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,580
I'll call him every

515
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,500
half an hour.

516
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,580
If he doesn't pick up

517
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,620
by tomorrow morning,

518
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,020
I'll go straight down to Legends.

519
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,060
I must get my

520
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,090
necklace back.

521
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,610
How did he get hold of

522
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,970
you necklace?

523
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,930
it's a long story.

524
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,420
Get off.

525
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,140
You kicked me?

526
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,100
Who asked you to sleep in my room

527
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,220
and even placed you feet on my pillow.

528
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,050
This... This is your room?

529
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,650
No, that...

530
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,490
Your phone kept ringing yesterday night,

531
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,050
I came in to check on you.

532
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,710
Then, I fell asleep.

533
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,070
It's okay, don't be afraid.

534
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:12,990
You continue to sleep.

535
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,990
Go back to your room.

536
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,470
NO, don't move.

537
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,110
Don't you move.

538
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,790
I can claim rewards if I can continue my dreams.

539
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,830
Don't you move.

540
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,750
Claim rewards?

541
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,870
If you don't go back,

542
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,790
you'll be sleeping in the training room.

543
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,470
No, don't be fierce.

544
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,430
Are you going back or not?

545
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,910
I'll leave, okay?

546
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,190
Come back.

547
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,870
What do you want now?

548
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,910
Wash up my pillow.

549
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,260
Stubborn enough.

550
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,140
How many calls did she make?

551
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,160
That's right, it's here.

552
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
Hello, who are you looking for?

553
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,280
Hello.

554
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm looking for Ji Xiang Kong.

555
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,640
Did you book an appointment?

556
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,480
No.

557
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,750
You must be a fan.

558
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,310
You can't enter without appointment.

559
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,550
Is he in today?

560
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm not too sure.

561
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,700
Why don't you wait for him outside?

562
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,340
Okay, thank you.

563
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,530
Qiu Ying.

564
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,410
You are?

565
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,490
I'm Lin Yi Xuan.

566
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,690
I'm a member of

567
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,810
the team, Legends.

568
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,690
I know.

569
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,610
I've seen you during the competition,

570
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,490
it was wonderful.

571
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,450
Really?

572
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,090
I watch your broadcast too.

573
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,560
Really? Such a coincidence.

574
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,360
The one where you ate worms was really nice.

575
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,320
The one where you guys didn;t get champion

576
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,520
was splendid too.

577
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,030
You're here to apologise right?

578
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,550
You know how much trouble you've

579
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,470
caused Brother Kong

580
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,430
after you upload the video

581
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,910
of them in conflict.

582
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,780
Yes.

583
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,140
Didn't I came specially

584
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
to apologise?

585
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,660
Because I thought it's more

586
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,780
sincere that way

587
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,060
so I came specially.

588
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,620
Can you bring me to Ji Xiang Kong?

589
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,740
Sure.

590
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,700
But do you dare to go?

591
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Of course.

592
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,260
Thank you, Brother Xuan.

593
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,090
Welcome, follow me.

594
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,290
You place is pretty big here.

595
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:33,970
Of course.

596
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,810
I'll tour you around.

597
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,490
This is one of my

598
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,650
favourite hero.

599
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,280
-Brother Xuan, all the best.             -Bao Di.

600
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,520
Brother Xuan.

601
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,920
Both of you stop playing.

602
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,800
So noisy.

603
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,160
Yi Bo, pass me a bootle of water.

604
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,100
No need.

605
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,780
Give me the bag,

606
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,540
it's not for you.

607
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,380
Here, give it to me.

608
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,500
Let's go.

609
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,460
Zi Xuan and Xiao Yu, work well.

610
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,620
Stop gossiping.

611
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,060
Stop playing games there.

612
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,420
Go back to work.

613
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,580
Okay, Brother Xuan.

614
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,500
Brother Xuan, you're impressive.

615
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,020
I'm already very conservative.

616
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,300
Here's the history of our team.

617
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,220
Everytime I walk pass here,

618
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,460
I get emotional.

619
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,330
Whhy don't I see you?

620
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,370
Look carefully before saying.

621
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,670
This are the trophies

622
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,470
won by our team.

623
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,790
This few are won by me.

624
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,750
Of course, it's only a portion.

625
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,710
Rest are in the storage area.

626
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,750
I know that one,

627
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,150
it's the one where

628
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,470
you got first runner up.

629
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,750
I sa wit with my own eyes

630
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,950
when the trophy got handed over.

631
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,230
I was so touched.

632
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,990
Here,

633
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,350
is the best place

634
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,390
of our team Legends.

635
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,830
It's our training room.

636
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,230
Seems awesome.

637
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,030
Of course.

638
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,830
All our equipments are

639
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,990
world's top notch.

640
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,150
These are the brothers from

641
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,260
the training team.

642
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,860
They are practicing their basic foundations.

643
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,380
You professionals

644
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,780
have to practice basic foundation?

645
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,580
Of course.

646
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,380
Basketballer

647
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,340
have to practice how to dribble a ball too.

648
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,780
Ding Guan Sen,

649
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,960
you worked too hard.

650
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,280
Remember to rest okay?

651
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,240
Be mindful of your body.

652
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,440
Guys, buck up.

653
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,280
Let usshout our slogan.

654
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,240
Come.

655
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,760
It's the Legends calling...

656
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
We never give up,

657
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,560
it's the Legends calling.

658
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,750
Everyone is so passionate.

659
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,310
It's about done.

660
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,270
That's the gym.

661
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,620
We could've reach by just

662
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,660
coming up from there,

663
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,300
yet you made me walk such a big round.

664
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,340
Are you playing tricks on me?

665
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,340
No.

666
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,260
Go on in,

667
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,460
Brother Kong has ben in there for a long time.

668
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,980
Let me tell you,

669
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,050
Brother Kong is a very nice person.

670
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,410
You just have to

671
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,570
beg him a little,

672
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,690
he'll definitely forgive you.

673
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,890
He must be thirsty after gyming for half a day,

674
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,330
give this to him

675
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,090
and melt his heart.

676
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,210
He's clearly the one

677
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,770
that tricked me multiple times,

678
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,250
why do I have to beg him?

679
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,370
Thank you.

680
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,420
Don't you know it's rude to not

681
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,900
knock the door before you enter?

682
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,340
What are you here for?

683
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,500
I...

684
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,860
Why did I look for you for?

685
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,260
What are you doing?

686
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,770
You came looking for me,

687
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,370
how do we talk

688
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,050
if we don;t get closer?

689
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,690
wear your clothes properly

690
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,510
before talking to me.

691
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,510
My clothes are on?

692
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,550
You...

693
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,230
You call me 50 over times last night

694
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,470
and came looking for me today,

695
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,310
what do you want?

696
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,630
Sorry.

697
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,430
I uploaded the video

698
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,270
where you had a conflict with jeffery

699
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,030
online,

700
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,270
I've caused you trouble.

701
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,670
Also, I filmed you and Gu Fang

702
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,070
without permission

703
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,310
so please me maganious

704
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,550
and forgive me.

705
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,110
Then,

706
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,900
return me my necklace.

707
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,060
So you apologise to me

708
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,780
just to get back your necklace.

709
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,660
don't go.

710
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,360
What?

711
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,920
I'm in a body of sweat,

712
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,040
At least let me shower first

713
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,200
before talking to you.

714
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,160
Sure, go ahead.

715
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,320
but don't you run away.

716
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Okay,I won't.

717
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,160
Wait for me at the cafe beside.

718
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,500
What are you wearing?

719
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,740
Here,

720
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,660
put this]s pink romeo on.

721
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,730
I guarantee you to have her.

722
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,730
Still have her?

723
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,530
What taste.

724
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,530
Act, continue acting.

725
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,810
She's already here at Legends.

726
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,530
Don't think that I don't know

727
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,290
what's going on.

728
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,690
You're sweet enough to

729
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,530
prepare a gift for her.

730
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,050
I did not.

731
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,850
Act.

732
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,410
Yes, look for it.

733
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,800
Can't find it right?

734
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,840
Don't bother, It's with me.

735
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,160
Give it to me.

736
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,360
Wait.

737
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,520
Tell me clearly,

738
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,550
which state are you guys at?

739
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,390
There's not state to talk about.

740
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,350
What state?

741
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:46,950
I have to return it to her.

742
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,510
Give it to me, quick.

743
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,390
I saw this necklace

744
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,110
when we were in Canada.

745
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,750
You're still telling...

746
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,390
Enough, give it to me.

747
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,310
You don't...

748
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,430
Lightly.

749
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,700
It's pretty fragile.

750
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
Brother Kong.

751
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,940
Brother Kong, I...

752
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,100
Did I screw up again?

753
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,580
What do you think? Leave.

754
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,900
Okay.

755
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,660
Is there a need to be shy?

756
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,620
Here, your coffee.

757
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,180
Useless.

758
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,140
Anxious?

759
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,980
First you left you necklace in the car,

760
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,650
then you gave me your number.

761
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,130
Based on dramas,

762
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:07,970
it should be a

763
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,210
prefect beginning.

764
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,610
Not bad.

765
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,210
Ji Xiang Kong,

766
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,670
do you really think

767
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,630
I left my necklace

768
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,070
in your car on purpose?

769
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,550
Okay, I admit

770
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,110
I lied to you that day.

771
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,990
I got close to you on purpose

772
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,230
but I'm not so munipulative

773
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,790
to leave the necklace in your car.

774
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,630
I came today

775
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,630
to get back my necklace.

776
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,870
Return it to me.

777
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,710
Thank you.

778
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,460
Why is it broken?
