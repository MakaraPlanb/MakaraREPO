00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:34,850
GANK YOUR HEART

00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,134
Episode 3

3
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,546
You finally got a champion during these years.

4
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,022
It's not easy.Congratulations.

5
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,781
Loser.

6
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,259
If we are losers just because of once failure,

7
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,627
you have been losers for many years.

8
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:52,059
We will stll be the champion next year.

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,054
Where is GuFang?

10
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:58,382
Is he crying on the bed?

11
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,572
Watch your words.

12
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,268
Was he very strong,

13
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,462
 when he used the Holy Spirit Princess?

14
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,574
Why  does he become

15
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,450
so so so useless now?

16
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,502
What are you talking?

17
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,854
Ji Xiangkong hits people.

18
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,710
with Jeffery.

19
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,291
Hey,Jeffery.

20
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,462
Stop.

21
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,486
Stop.

22
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,710
Get on the car,all of you.

23
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:26,790
What are you doing?

24
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,366
Why you so disruptive abroad?

25
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,245
Get on the car.

26
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:53,375
Xin

27
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:54,527
Hey,Xin.

28
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,727
The review of the IConquer you hosted is so fantastic.

29
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,775
You really deserve to be the best host in YouXing Video.

30
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:00,479
Do you think so?

31
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,604
Yes.

32
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:05,540
Without your support in my backward,

33
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,878
I would never have the achievement today.

34
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:09,503
Well,

35
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:10,655
let me pay your coffee someday.

36
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:11,295
Is that OK?

37
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,739
OK,thank you.

38
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,351
Do you busy.

39
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:25,311
As for eloquence, she is really number one.

40
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:39,903
Good.

41
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,271
We got the first in real-time data.

42
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:45,599
Boss Liu.

43
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,263
Come on,QiaoXin.Have a seat.

44
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,165
What time is it now,Boss Liu?

45
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,847
Don't you go back home?

46
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,045
You don't have to do this.

47
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,647
Take care of your health.

48
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,071
Sit down first.

49
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:55,550
Come on.

50
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,042
How can I ask you to do these things?

51
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,750
Our IConquer part latestly occupied the opportunity

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,263
due to your effort.

53
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:04,675
The future of IConquer part

54
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,399
is the major project of our company transition.

55
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,807
You have to work harder.

56
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,500
Don't worry.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,342
The click rate of my each program 

58
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,583
is always the first among all the parts.

59
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,335
But I am not very lucky.

60
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:16,716
The opportunity to take interview in Vancouer 

61
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,275
is decided by draw lots.

62
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:19,903
Such a good opportunity.

63
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,375
I just missed it.

64
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,063
Lots of freshman were transferred from Life part.

65
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,367
Big boss wants to be fair.

66
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:27,779
So i didn't disagree with

67
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,975
 the idea of draw lots.

68
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:29,795
Right?

69
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:31,615
Speaking to QiuYIng,

70
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,767
she must be worse than you 

71
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,133
both in professinal knowledge and experiences. 

72
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,391
You could help her a lot,

73
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,799
if possible.

74
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,050
But what suprised me most,

75
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,087
she just sent a video back.

76
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,007
After the competion,

77
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,450
the Legends and Tatan had a fight.

78
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,191
It caused a hot debate after uploading online

79
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,303
which reached top one among the real-time news.

80
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:54,975
The IConquer part of YouXing 

81
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,999
is still immature,

82
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,687
which cannot compare with the field leader like GDV.

83
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,540
So we should pay more attention 

84
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,425
to make our content attractive.

85
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:03,400
QiaoXin,

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,505
I've witnessed your development.

87
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
I do have high expectation on you.

88
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,790
GDV has the top commentator like LuoTian.

89
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:12,511
I really wish that

90
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:13,925
you will be YouXing's LuoTian.

91
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,250
I will never let you down.

92
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,911
You are still that QiaoXin.

93
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,639
I didn't choose the wrong person.

94
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:22,850
Let me appreciate

95
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,450
 the top one of real-time news.

96
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,016
Congratulations,Ji Xiangkong.

97
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,598
You became the trending tipic again.

98
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:42,100
Do we often become the trending topics,

99
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,650
aren't we?

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,668
Often?

101
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,162
Someone shot a video about your fight wirh Jeffery,

102
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:48,154
and uploaded it on Internet.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,067
Look,

104
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:52,952
who did that?

105
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,567
It's so immoral to post online.

106
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,544
QiuYing

107
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,720
who works for YouXing Video.

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,192
Do you know her?

109
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,063
You just pray for Manager Zhao to figure out this crisis pr.

110
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,660
Or

111
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,708
all of you should be punished.

112
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,802
What's wrong with Ji Xiangkong's phone?

113
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,375
I cannot call him all the time.

114
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,300
Why does his phone always power off?

115
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,650
QiuYing.

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,416
Yanyan.

117
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,225
Welcome back!

118
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:38,900
Do you know that

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,350
the click amount reached top immediately 

120
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,550
as soon as your video released out.

121
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:44,984
Top.

122
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,056
So did I surpass QiaoXin?

123
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes,

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
you have raised some attention in our company.

125
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,048
Boss Liu is so happy.

126
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,848
You'd better to see him as soon as possible.

127
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:54,552
He is waiting for you.

128
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:55,480
OK,I will go.

129
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,832
Where are you going?

130
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:02,840
I, I am going to buy some drinks.

131
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:04,932
What do you want? I can buy for you.

132
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,832
Did QiaoXin ask you buy coffee for her again?

133
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,332
We are all colleagues.

134
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,380
I just help her in convenient.

135
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,875
Yanyan,

136
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,968
you cannot be so flabby.

137
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,281
Let me tell you a solution,

138
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:22,700
which ensure that she will never ask you to do so.

139
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,104
What?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,216
Why is there no one?

141
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,176
Does nobody work today?

142
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:58,125
Didn't they prepare 

143
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:58,375
some flowers and salutes to welcome us?

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,100
some flowers and salutes to welcome us?

145
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,104
At least,we are the runner-up.

146
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:03,743
Nobody cares the second place.

147
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,300
So realistic?

148
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,391
The society is so realistic.

149
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,775
You guys must be tierd.

150
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,675
Pack up your suitcase

151
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,635
and have a rest.

152
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,875
So where should the trophy go,coach?

153
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:15,007
Put it on the display case.

154
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:15,600
Ok.

155
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,899
Bye,coach.

156
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:21,487
I am going out.

157
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,575
Take my luggage into my room.

158
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,900
Don't stay in my room.

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,575
If you mess my room up again,

160
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,125
I will let you live in the trainning room.

161
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,623
We lived together so harmony before.

162
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:32,300
Don't talk me with this unless you clean up your pighome.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,456
You also live in the....,too.

164
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,321
Go,go,go.

165
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:50,105
Let's go.

166
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,497

167
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,097

Thank you.

00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,401
QiuYing.

170
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,425
Yiyi,Yiyi.

Thanks to your help.

173

What do you think?

174
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:07,746
Is my QiuYing so great?

175
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,000
Our QiuYing is coming back.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,608

You did so fantastic this time.

178
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:14,976
Come on and give her some applause.

179
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:15,509
to encourage.

180
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,976
Thank you guys.

181
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,752

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,459
Hi,Manager Zhao.

190
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:40,525
Little Xinxin.

191
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,471
I want to talk about 

192
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:48,050
the affair your team members caused in parking lot.

193
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,910
You must have been a hard work

194
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:52,094
in Canada.

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
This is what I should do.

196
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,341
I realize that I am still lack of some expriences

197
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,650
during this 

198
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,944
after this business trip.

199
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,400
I am here to apologize.

200
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,100
 You don't have to do this.

201
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,649
The things you did are really excellent.

202
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,240
It's your first interview.

203
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:06,968
Everyone witnesses your effort.

204
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,568
You've been very perfect.

205
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,025
Thank you,Boss Liu.

206
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,150
I'll keep working hard.

207
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:12,275
Fighting.

208
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,248
Well,

209
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:17,464
The video about the fight between Legends and Tatan

210
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:18,936
I released.

211
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,787
Does it bring any troubles to our company?

212
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,544
Absolutely not.

213
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:26,727
didn't any lies.

214
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:27,825
The Legends will not

215
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,081
finds our trouble.

216
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,890
Well,OK.

217
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,184
Don't worry.

218
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,482
Hello.

219
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,527
Hi,I am ZhaoYang from Legends.

220
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,623
Manager Zhao.

221
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,287
Hey,hey,hey.

222
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:45,827
I want to ask you a question.

223
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,975
Is there a person who named QiuYing in your company?

224
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:48,625
Yes.

225
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,831
We do have such a person.

226
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:52,775
You must know the video she released in Internet.

227
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,530
But QiuYing hasn't came back yet.

228
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,275
What should I do?

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,950
I will ask the situation after she coming back.

230
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,718
Is that OK?

231
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,275
Don't waste my time.

232
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,700
You have to deal this thing clearly.

233
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:03,198
Or you will have my  lawyer's letter.

234
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:03,700
Do you hear that?

235
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:04,606
Sorry,Manager Zhao.

236
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,025
Please calm down.

237
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,812
Boss Liu,did I cause any trouble 

238
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:11,783
to our company?

239
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:17,031
It's said that the video has caused baleful influence.

240
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,591
They will not accept our interview any more.

241
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,023
What about

242
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,552
let me give a apologize to them?

243
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,128
Maybe they will forgive us.

244
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,728
No,no,you don't have to worry about this.

245
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,719
Our company will handle this issue.

246
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:29,972
I remember that

247
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,583
QiaoXin seems to be familiar with Manager Zhao.

248
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,823
Maybe she can deal with it.

249
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,767
Speaking to the Top 1 among real-time news,

250
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:40,250
our company will give your bonus as usual.

251
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:42,125
But now,

252
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,525
we are in the transition period.

253
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:44,143
I have lots of fiancial pressure.

254
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:46,225
So the bonus might be delayed to give you.

255
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
If Ji Xiangkong had arrived early,

256
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,725
it would not happen.

257
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,743
He is famous for his respond slowly.

258
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:17,500
What should they do?

259
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:28,135
Hey,

260
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:30,754
do you have free instant noodles today?

261
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,314
You've already been the worlwide runner-up.

262
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,111
Why you still grift my instant noodles?

263
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,351
Hey,my computer crashed.

264
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,375
OK,I got it.

265
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,487
Wait me at second floor,Xiangkong.

266
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,191
QiuYing, I bought the coffee.

267
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,125
And you?

268
00:12:58,368 --> 00:12:59,520
Did Boss LIu give you any award?

269
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,225
I didn't recieve any awards.

270
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,447
If the issue can't be figure out well,

271
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:07,431
we possiblely will pay the compensation.

272
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:10,503
Why?

273
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:13,383
In the future,

274
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,599
don't shoot casual video.

275
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:16,775
Donot think it's possible to 

276
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,119
use a simple video to catch attention.

277
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,383
Or you will bring big trouble to our company.

278
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,367
OK,I know.

279
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:27,079
Yanyan.

280
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:32,263
Why you took so long to buy a coffee for me?

281
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:36,589
Here you are.

282
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,650
I want coffee without ice.

283
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,600
Why you bought a hot coffee?

284
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,399
I,I,I forgot it.

285
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,001
What is this?

286
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,001
Why it tastes so bad?

287
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:56,982
It's the new arrival in Cafe,

288
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:00,423
named salt-butter-beer coffee.

289
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,367
I thought you'd like it.

290
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,400
So I bought one for you.

291
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,183
Are you sure human can eat it?

292
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:10,212
Why you cannot do such little thing well?

293
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:11,687
Xin is very mad at you .

294
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,156
How does she host program?

295
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,325
Right,Xin?

296
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:20,903
Sorry,Xin.

297
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,175
I will buy your favorite taste in the future.

298
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,223
 I will buy your favorite taste in the future.

299
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:27,208
I will not mess up your host.

300
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:28,775
Sorry,Xin.

301
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,383
I don't need you buy coffee for me anymore.

302
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:35,659
So stupid.

303
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,050
Why she is so stupid?

304
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,361
Did she say that she don't need me buy coffee?

305
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,796
It's so great.

306
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,575
How is GuFang these days?

307
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,263
Why don't you care about me?

308
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,900
You've already

309
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,170
got used to the bad comments.

310
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,167
It's obvious that GuFang's statu was wrong.

311
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,450
I had suggested

312
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,455
 to change the position between Yao and captain.

313
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,407
But ZhaoYang and coach Luo

314
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:18,951
 didn't agree with it.

315
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,679
This idea sounds good.

316
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,919
Let HuoYao be the Middle

317
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,196
in order to control Jeffery.

318
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,671
You would have 80% win rate.

319
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,475
Did GuFang disagree with it?

320
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,811
I didn't tell him.

321
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,127
He is almost 30.

322
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,525
There is only little time

323
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,943
 left for him in the competition.

324
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,319
If GuFang plans to retire,

325
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,111
what are you going to do?

326
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:04,647
I haven't thought about this before.

327
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:07,015
But to be honest,

328
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:08,487
I can stay in Legends

329
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:09,639
because of him.

330
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:15,911
You have to remember

331
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,895
what did you say

332
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,879
when you were taken by him from here?

333
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,875
How can I forget it?

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
It's my dream to be the champion.

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,135
You will keep going on 

336
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,351
with GuFang's and my dreams.

337
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,447
Sun,you really give me lots of pressure.

338
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:34,599
Are you afraid?

339
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:36,135
Do you want to give up?

340
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,231
I heard that Manager Zhao doesn't like you very much.

341
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,279
I don't care him.

342
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,711
He only cares about money.

343
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,175
He ranged lots of commercail activities

344
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:47,847
for us one by one.

345
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,703
But,when captain is here,

346
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,855
he doesn't do too over.

347
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,031
If captain plans to retire,

348
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,167
I have no idea what will happen.

349
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:00,071
Come on,hoster Qiu.

350
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:02,887
Congratulations,you are famous now.

351
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:05,895
Don't be laugh at me, editor Lu.

352
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:08,839
You really predicted that

353
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:10,852
after a temporarily decided trip

354
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,852
I have to save mony for a long time.

355
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:16,007
It's not a big deal.

356
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,360
I haven't ask you to rent my money back.Right?

357
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,768
I don't need my money currently.

358
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:22,535
Take your time,take your time.

359
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,475
It's Yiyi who treats me best.

360
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,183
Of course.

361
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,295
The person I love most is you.

362
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:31,623
OK,let's eat.

363
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:33,512
You have to eat more.You are too thin.

364
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,216
I'm so hungry.

365
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,535
It tastes good.

366
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,623
Yes,it is.

367
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:41,607
Well,

368
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,300
the day you went to Vancouver,

369
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:45,511
the car of our company

370
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,815
went to the train station 

371
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,735
Do you know what's going on?

372
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,079
It's obvious.

373
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,184
It must be QiaoXin.

374
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,458
Why doesn't QiaoXin

375
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,259
put her energy into work?

376
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,712
She always likes to counteract others.

377
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,935
It's so bad.

378
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:03,815
I don't have time to think about her thing.

379
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,159
Yes,we don't talk about her.

380
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:08,807
Do you know that,Yiyi?

381
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,407
I really touched so much 

382
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,199
when I went to Vancouer.

383
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:15,309
The moment that the Legends losed,

384
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,450
I saw so many fans crying.

385
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,943
I almost cried,too.

386
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,271
Although I didn't understand most of the competition.

387
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:25,256
So why you wanna cry?

388
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,663
I'm so impressive.

389
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:30,503
After that, I followed the Legends to the bar.

390
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,511
I saw GuFang drinking in the corner.

391
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,825
Then he talked a lot to Ji Xiangkong.

392
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,089
I suddenly understand that

393
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,173
it's not only a competition for many people,

394
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,623
it's dream.

395
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:47,207
I know

396
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,935
you have your dream.

397
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,647
So you will have the same feeling with 

398
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,950
with the people who have dreams too.

399
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,511
I really admire them actually.

400
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,415
They could fight for their dreams with all their efforts.

401
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,231
They also could cry when they failed.

402
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:06,791
Not like me,

403
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,287
since my father married that woman,

404
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:11,975
my biggest dream is

405
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,727
having my own home.

406
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,671
So I've tried my best to earn money,

407
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:18,759
work hard.

408
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,743
I spent all my saving

409
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,280
 to pay the down payment of this house.

410
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:32,583
This house

411
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,311
is my promise for my mom.

412
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,895
Therefore,the job of YouXin,

413
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,531
I definitely keep it well anyway.

414
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,655
Yiyi.

415
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,983
I suddenly have a new idea this time.

416
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,671
Now that I chose this career,

417
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,847
and I transfered to IConquer part. 

418
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:53,600
I must be a hoster 

419
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,175
who masters her professinal skills well. 

420
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,287
It's good to have dream,

421
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:58,823
but I have to remind you

422
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,800
there are so many traps waiting for you

423
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,883
on the way to your dream. 

424
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,518
Even  without big traps,

425
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,799
there are still many things

426
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,207
which are different from your thought.

427
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:09,959
Well,we don't talk about this.

428
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,879
I am gonna take some fruits.

429
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:32,871
Who are you calling for?

430
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:35,751
The Legends,Ji Xiangkong.

431
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,045
I've been calling and texting him all the time from Vancouver,

432
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,800
he hasn't responded me at one time.

433
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,749
Wait,you are talking about JiXiangkong.

434
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:44,800
What?

435
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,975
What happened between you guys?

436
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
How do you have contact numbers?

437
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,343
He took away my mothers' necklace.

438
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:52,825
From now on,

439
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,167
I will call him half an hour.

440
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,383
If he still doesn't respond me 

441
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:56,279
until tommorrow morning,

442
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,623
I will go to the Legends directly.

443
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,495
I must take my necklace back.

444
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
So how did he

445
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,152
take away your necklace?

446
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:07,879
It is a long story.

447
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:37,639
Get off my bed.

448
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:46,599
You kick me!

449
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,071
Who let you sleep in my room,

450
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,287
and put your feet on my pillow?

451
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,463
Is this your room?

452
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,471
What?

453
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:57,991
Your phone is ringing all the time last night.

454
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,719
I came here to have a look

455
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,063
an then I fell in sleep.

456
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,919
It's OK.Don't be afraid.

457
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,071
Keep sleeping.

458
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:04,967
Get back to your room.

459
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:05,927
No,don't touch me.

460
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:07,719
I'm dreaming to accept the prize.

461
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:08,647
Don't touch me.

462
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:09,504
Accept the prize?

463
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:10,727
Go to sleep in the training room.

464
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,790
No,don't be so mad.

465
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,799
Do you go?

466
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,527
FIne,fine,I go.

467
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:17,950
Wait.

468
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:18,870
What's wrong with you?

469
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,446
Wash my pillow.

470
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,599
So persistent.

471
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:36,519
How many times she called?

472
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,087
It must be here.

473
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,815
Hello,who are you looking for?

474
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,543
Hi.

475
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,207
I am looking for JiXiangkong.

476
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:56,743
Do you have any appointment?

477
00:22:58,407 --> 00:22:59,047
No.

478
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:02,025
Are you his fans?

479
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,566
You are not allowed to come in without appointment.

480
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:08,839
Could tell me whether he is here today?

481
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,927
I don't know.

482
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,527
How about you wait him outside?

483
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,135
OK,thank you.

484
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,135
QiuYing?

485
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,015
Are you?

486
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:30,471
I am Lin Yixuan

487
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:32,583
I am the starting player of the Legends.

488
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:34,466
I know,i know.

489
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,231
I did watch your match which was very wonderful. 

490
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,383
Really?

491
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,303
I did watch your live show.

492
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,711
Really?

493
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:42,503
The moment you ate worms was really nice.

494
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:48,135
It's also very wonderful when you failed the champion place.

495
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,039
Are you here for apologizing?

496
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:57,775
Do you know how you hurt Kong

497
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:59,695
after you released the fight video between Kong and Jeffery?

498
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,426
Yes,I know.

499
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,583
So now I come here to apologize specially.

500
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:06,650
Because I think it's more honest

501
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,848
 to pay a visit.

502
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:08,907
So i am here now.

503
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,964
Could you please take me to see Ji Xiangkong?

504
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:13,799
OK.

505
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,063
But do you dare to go?

506
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:18,535
Of course.

507
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:19,495
Thank you,Xuan.

508
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:21,479
Let's go.

509
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,426
This place is very large.

510
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,582
Of course.

511
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:24,875
Let me show you a short path.

512
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,111
This is one of my favorite heros.

513
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:31,518
Hey,Xuan.

514
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:32,606
Come on,Bao.

515
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:34,982
Hi,Xuan.

516
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,475
Don't play the game you guys.

517
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,161
Too noise.

518
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,172
Give me a bottle of water,Yibo.

519
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:40,629
No,no.

520
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:41,589
Give me your bag.

521
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,101
It's not for you.

522
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:46,615
Go.

523
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,831
Keep working,Zixuan,Xiaoyu.

524
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:51,247
Don't talk too much gossips.

525
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,735
Don't play game here all the time.

526
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:54,951
Go back to your work place.

527
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:56,180
OK,OK.

528
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,959
You are so imposing.

529
00:24:58,228 --> 00:24:59,751
I've restrained myself a lot.

530
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,783
Here is the history of our team.

531
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,575
Everytime I pass by here,

532
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,652
I am so impressive.

533
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,055
Why I can't see yours?

534
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,495
Take a closer look.

535
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:24,071
These are our trophies.

536
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:24,900
Half of this is mine.

537
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,700
It's only a small part.

538
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,805
Others are stored in the warehouse.

539
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,935
I know that one.

540
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:30,720
It's the trophy of  the competition

541
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,424
when you got the runner-up.

542
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:34,247
I saw you hold the trophy with your hands.

543
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:35,490
I was so impressive.

544
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:36,935
Here

545
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,495
is the greatest place in the Legends.

546
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,159
Our war room.

547
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,875
It looks so good.

548
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:43,810
Of course.

549
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,023
All of our equipment are the best in the world.

550
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,183
They are little brohers of our war room.

551
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:52,061
They are practicing the basic skills.

552
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:52,940
Do the professional players

553
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,853
also need to practice basic skills?

554
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:55,687
Of course.

555
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,223
The hoopman also needs to  practice ball handling.

556
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,832
Ding Guansen.

557
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:00,664
You work so hard.

558
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:01,895
You have to have some rest.

559
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:03,239
Take care of yourself.

560
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,535
Cheer up,guys.

561
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,367
Let's  shout our slogans.

562
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,007
Come on.

563
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:08,871
Legends' mission.

564
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:13,415
Legends' mission.

565
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:17,959
Never give up!

566
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,391
They are all enthusiastic.

567
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:23,911
We've almost visited all of here.

568
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:25,550
This is the fitness room.

569
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:31,079
Just upstairs.

570
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,281
Why you took me hang out  so many places?

571
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,497
Are you fooling me？

572
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:35,815
No,no.

573
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:36,548
Hurry up.

574
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:37,991
Kong has been practicing for a while in there.

575
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:39,719
I tell you

576
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:40,999
Kong is a very nice person.

577
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:43,550
You just beg him slightly,

578
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,021
he is bound to forgive you.

579
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,271
He must be thirsty.

580
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,487
Give it to him.

581
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,215
Melt his heart.

582
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:53,863
He fooled me so many times.

583
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,633
Why should I beg him?

584
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:56,423
Thanks.

585
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:09,255
You are so impolite

586
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:10,407
to come in without knocking the door.

587
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:11,879
What are you coming for?

588
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:12,775
I.

589
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:19,367
What am I coming here for?

590
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:29,977
What are you doing?

591
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:34,245
You are here for me.

592
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:34,693
We stand so far.

593
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,583
Don't you feel tired to speak so loudly?

594
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,150
Please put on your clothes 

595
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,000
before you talking to me.

596
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,407
I am wearing my clothes well.

597
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:45,031
You

598
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:47,862
You called me 50 times yesterday.

599
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:49,078
And you come to see me today.

600
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:50,279
What do you want to do indeed?

601
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:56,935
Sorry.

602
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,402
I shouldn't release your fight video in Internet

603
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,031
which brought you lots of troubles.

604
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,343
And I shouldn't shoot your conversation with GuFang

605
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,727
without your persmission.

606
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,840
Can you not be mad at me anymore？

607
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:09,500
And then,

608
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,975
give my necklace back.

609
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,367
The true aim of your apology 

610
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:17,031
is to ask for your necklace.

611
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:18,825
Don't go.

612
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:20,423
What are you doing?

613
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:23,110
I am so sweaty.

614
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,400
You have to let me take a bath first

615
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,168
before talking to you.

616
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:31,111
OK,fine.

617
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,479
Don't leave.

618
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:35,719
OK.

619
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,127
See you at the near Cafe.

620
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:52,313
What are you wearing?

621
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,828
Come on.

622
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,630
Put on this pink Romeo.

623
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,075
You will definetly get QiuYing.

624
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:04,020
Get her?

625
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:05,108
What taste?

626
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,412
Keep lying.

627
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:09,981
She came here to see you.

628
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,197
I know what happened.

629
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,117
You are so careful 

630
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:14,333
to prepare present for her.

631
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,988
I didn't prepare any presents.

632
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,961
Keep acting.

633
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:19,975
Yes,find and touch.

634
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:20,935
Miss it?

635
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:24,425
Don't waste time.I got it.

636
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,399
GIve it to me.

637
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,103
Wait.

638
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:28,871
Tell me fitst.

639
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,000
How you get along with each other?

640
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:32,221
Nothing happened.

641
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,053
What are you talking about?

642
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:33,801
I have to return it back to her.

643
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:34,275
Give it back to me.

644
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,950
I've seen this necklace in Canada.

645
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,590
You are still lying to me.

646
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,475
Don't waste my time. Give it to me.

647
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:37,975
Stop,stop.

648
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:39,214
Be careful.

649
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:43,108
It's so fragile.

650
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:47,773
Kong?

651
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,996
Did I do something wrong?

652
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:53,044
Go away.

653
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,100
OK.

654
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:27,601
Why am I so shy?

655
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,497
Here is your coffee.

656
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:29,457
So stupid.

657
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,409
Wait for a long time?

658
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,736
First left your necklace on the car,

659
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:50,824
and then gave me your phone number.

660
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,896
It sounds like a sweet meeting

661
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,624
of a love story in idol drama.

662
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:57,000
You acted very well.

663
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:58,875
JiXiangkong,

664
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,168
Don't you think

665
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,984
I left my necklace on your car deliberately.

666
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,912
OK,I admit.

667
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,304
I lied to you that day.

668
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:12,984
I approached you on purpose.

669
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,375
But I am not so unscrupulous 

670
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,719
to leave my necklace in your car.

671
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,639
I am here today 

672
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,431
just for my necklace.

673
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:22,650
Give it back to me.

674
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,200
Thank you.

675
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:39,272
Why is it broken?
