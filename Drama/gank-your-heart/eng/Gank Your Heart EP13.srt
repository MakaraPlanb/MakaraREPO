1
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:39,729
OK

2
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,890
Let's see together

3
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:44,268
Team Legend chose the Gongxi Changqing first

4
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,850
Shit  They chose the Gongxi changqing

5
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:50,756
They have to give Lin yixuan to keep auxiliary hero with more poweful

6
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,016
We choose Jincan

7
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:56,823
Actually this champion¡¯s healing ability has the longest cooldown time in the game

8
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,801
VNG chosed Jincan

9
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:04,401
Legends has picked another mysterious champion Zhi Heng 

10
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:06,156
The support player are doing the gank, isn¡¯t it 

11
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:11,609
The role of these two champions are supportive, but the champion Gong Xi Chang Qing are more specialized at buffing his teammate. 

12
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,498
Comparatively, the gaming style of the champion Jin Can is preferred to do the roaming and ganking.

13
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:17,146
Among the support champions he can do more damage per second

14
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:21,137
But I think today's game is really splendid

15
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,182
Alright both team has finished the ban-pick session 

16
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:27,087
So far team VNG has leading one match 

17
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:30,740
The second match of the new beta series has started 

18
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:50,489
It's good, this seat is good way to view the competition

19
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:55,007
Sitting at here I can clearly see the facial expressions of the players on the stage 

20
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:00,269
Why you take a long time to take photos

21
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,304
I just look around I do not except is too wide here

22
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,528
Dummy

23
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,536
Ah  I heard a news that Ji XiangKong has made a promise at the board of Directors 

24
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,666
If he lost the game today, he would leave the team Legends

25
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,959
Therefore this match is especially important to him 

26
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,703
Are you serious

27
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:30,057
My news is always accurate, doesn¡¯t it 

28
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:35,459
Fighting  Fighting

29
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,310
The match we are still gonna to focus PeiXi in order to deal with their strategy 

30
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,070
No Problem  Finish them at the early game

31
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:49,603
Avoid initiating the Try to farm clear the wave and jungle 

32
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,253
OK I understand

33
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,993
We can gank Pei Xi Yao Follow me to the mid lane 

34
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,040
We can gank Pei Xi Yao Follow me to the mid lane 

35
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,714
OK I come here

36
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,981
This is a trap 

37
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,812
Shen yue  Please come to help me

38
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:05,910
I was trapped by Lu Feng  Qi Can you come to help me 

39
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,238
Qi yue come here

40
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,300
OK I come now

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,020
Qi Yue arrived on time and used the ability conversely limited the movement of Hou Yao  Successfully bring Pei Xi back to their turret 

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,721
you come here quickly

43
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,974
OK I am coming

44
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:19,870
Engage Engage I can finish them I got it  Nice 

45
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,814
Please come to protect me I trade him

46
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,956
Perfect

47
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:25,387
Ji XiangKong and his teammates are putting so much pressure to Pei Xi in the early game in order to bother his Champion¡¯s development 

48
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,981
In the mid- late game Pei Xi are forced to initiate the team fight before he has finished his build

49
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:32,230
Okay Now how are they going to deal with it

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,564
This fight we are still gonna to focus Pei Xi

51
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,011	
Xuan and Li Rinan goes to take their jungle

52
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:36,938
OK Linan Please follow me OK

53
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,059
Captain

54
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,850
Qi Yue and Pei Xi are coming to the mid lane

55
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,928
Qi Yue is staying around Pei Xi  We can not find a chance to kill him

56
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,253
Don't worry You can do it

57
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,618
I tank it We can fight

58
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,081
I will freeze the lane  You wait at the bush and don¡¯t come out 

59
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:53,607
I think the decision of Ji XianKong is quite risky  Can you freeze it

60
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:54,339
I can't do it

61
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,378
This time Ji Xiang Kong and Lu Yao are getting so low 

62
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,735
Lu Feng is still waiting a chance 

63
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:58,763
What do they want to do

64
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:00,691
They  must recall  Mid lane has no pressure to push 

65
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,132
The jungle has respawned Qi 

66
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,127
Back to clear the jungle  Go

67
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,014
Qi Yue and Shen Yue has backed to their jungle area  Be aware guys 

68
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,561
OK OK

69
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,044
Actually Pei Xi thougt we have been back home

70
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,350
Let't go we can fight Pei Xi togethre

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,716
We definitely can take the kill if we wait the here 

72
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,740
Ji XiangKong has engaged and rooted Pei Xi

73
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,052
Another ability is ruthlessly targeted Pei Xi 

74
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,443
Without doubt Legends make some unpredictable plays 

75
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,080
Captain Be careful There are three opponents over there

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,621
I will handle them

77
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,613
We can fight  Yao I can use my ult Yao 

78
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,576
I will control hime first

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,491
Get ready for it

80
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,400
You have a good performance in the last competition

81
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:33,831
I am not gonna to betray my dude 

82
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,235
But you have already done it 

83
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:39,821
You don't want to become a captain didi't you

84
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,020
I don't want

85
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,055
How about your contract

86
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,569
you don't want to

87
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,069
have a good connection with the company

88
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:52,947
Zhan Yang You

89
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,635
You have to make a decision be careful

90
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,941
I give you a warning 

91
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:00,815
If Jixiangkong stay here

92
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,949
You will be failed

93
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,278
I want to make this clear with you 

94
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,091
Even I dissolute the contract

95
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,596
I won¡¯t betray my dude 

96
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:11,663
Huo Yao

97
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,322
You do have time to consider it

98
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,711
Think about it carefully 

99
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:38,926
Beat him Don¡¯t hesitate We can engage Don¡¯t be pussy I tank it Yao Use your ult Where is your ult Yao Can trap them  Yao where is your ult  What are you doing Yao 

100
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,845
What are you doing Yao

101
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,236
you are suck

102
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,576
What is Yao doing again Why did he miss the ult again

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,620
The cage didn¡¯t trap Pei Xi Now they are gonna to be in trouble This is so unlucky 

104
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,464
How can they be counter-kil

105
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:52,643
What is happening 

106
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,326
Ah what are you doing Huoyao

107
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:59,150
Why are you so serious

108
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,940
Because you told me

109
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,569
This match determines the transfer decision of Ji XiangKong 

110
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,646
So what

111
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,455
As his friend

112
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,942
Actually I hope he can win

113
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,787
Are you serious Qiu Ying

114
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,955
Are you worrying about him 

115
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,684
I don't want to talk with you please see the competition

116
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:21,699
At this moment Lin Yi Xuan arrives and heal back the hp of Ji XiangKong 

117
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,574
However, Qi Yue suddenly engage A team fight is broke out at the mid lane VNG is starting to come back 

118
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:28,148
As what we expected  Gong Xi Chang Qing are not good at ganking as Jin Can 

119
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,594
Moreover 2 vs 3 is really a bad fight

120
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:35,538
Too late Kong Leave I will protect you Leave I can¡¯t you Just withdraw from the fight We can¡¯t win the fight 

121
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,071
They were leading the game, aren¡¯t they 

122
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:41,743
How is that happen 

123
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,328
Since Huo Yao has missed his ult

124
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,282
So they can finish Pei Xi 

125
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,920
It is so unlucky

126
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,931
Let¡¯s move back to the players Qi Yue and Pei Xi

127
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:52,225
They utilized their abilities and finish Ji XiangKong 

128
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:55,208
I think that it is quite unfortunate

129
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:59,211
Ji XiangKong eventually can¡¯t dodge the ult combo of Qi Yue and Pei XI 

130
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:08,682
You don't be nervous

131
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:13,697
I can not ensure the reliability of my news  What if it was false

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,901
Out of abilities Can you handle it  My abilities are all in cooldown

133
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,833
We can not make it  Just finish it

134
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,962
Calm down We can do it

135
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,013
We can see that VNG has pushed to the final highland

136
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:31,548
However the fastest respawning time of the members of the Legends still need 5 more seconds  They absolutely can¡¯t make it

137
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,045
What are you doing Huo Yao

138
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:44,278
How dd you do it

139
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:52,426
Congratulation to VNG take down the championship of the  IConquer¡¯s mysterious warrior series 

140
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,677
Congraluations VNG

141
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:57,623
Great

142
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,872
Why are you give you hand

143
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,962
It was great

144
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,069
Don¡¯t take it serious Okay

145
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,446
Betrayer you did it on purpose

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,861
Betrayer

147
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:12,769
Yao didn¡¯t mean it 

148
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,156
Are you serious

149
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,890
You were being skeptical during the first match  Second match you missed the ult

150
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:23,409
Dare you tell the people that you are a professional player

151
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:29,157
Do you know Kong will leave

152
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,013
Lin Yixuan

153
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:37,399
You guys leave first

154
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,691
Huoyao need stay at here

155
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,598
I don't want to go

156
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:48,444
I want to hear the words from my dear Yao and how he explains this incident

157
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,125
You speak

158
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,267
Lin yixuan you go first

159
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,074
No

160
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,094
Go out

161
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,983
Xuan go go go

162
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,036
Go

163
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:23,384
Yao give me a reasonable interpretation

164
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,453
I hope my conjecture is wrong

165
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:37,875
I know

166
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,533
Whatever I want to explain

167
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,154
is too late

168
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:52,053
Zhao yang has come to find me

169
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,645
If I did not listen to his order

170
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,900
He is not going to renew my contract

171
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:04,218
So you don¡¯t care about the dude on the battlefield

172
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:05,386
No£¬coach

173
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,407
I admire that the first match is my fault

174
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,872
I really want to stay here Coach

175
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,449
coach

176
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,837
I am 28 years old

177
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:21,523
I  have been in this industry for ten years

178
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:25,671
I want to earn the championship

179
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:32,377
But if I lost the contract with Team Legends at the moment

180
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,445
I will end my professional careers

181
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,947
However In the second match I  am notdeliberate

182
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,156
Before the beginning

183
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,042
I have already vowed

184
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,236
I will never betray my teammates again

185
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:58,323
I can except that I leave the Team Legends and I don¡¯t want to betray my dudes

186
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,385
Xiangkong

187
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,701
It is my mistakes

188
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,412
I know

189
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,321
whatever I explain now

190
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,587
I am so sorry for your guys

191
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,855
I am so sorry to you

192
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:40,889
But you don¡¯t need to worry

193
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,796
I am going to explain with board of directors

194
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,812
All the fault lies with me

195
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,849
There are no connections with you

196
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:50,772
what do you want to say

197
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,159
Tell them Zhao yang is intimidating you at the moment

198
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,830
Then you lose the game advisedly

199
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:59,215
We can believe you

200
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:01,225
But I don't think they can believe you

201
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,117
If you said something to them

202
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,558
You can't stay at our team then

203
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,234
Xiangkong

204
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,507
Contract already made according to your requirements

205
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:25,304
You can check it please

206
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,433
When  can I go to the Legend

207
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,889
If you deal everything with VNG, you can come here whenever

208
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:02,962
Great

209
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:10,567
This a good thing for me I want to take a photo to keep the memorial moment

210
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,505
Are you OK now

211
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:03,469
Director Jin

212
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,826
You see that the data yesterday It is a mistake of Huo yao

213
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,194
It is my responsbility

214
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,817
He told me he has uncomfortable before the competition

215
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,969
But I don't remember it

216
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,905
You don't need to make a excuse for him

217
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:22,666
I am so clear about this competition

218
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:28,528
It is the problem of Ji xiangkong¡¯s tactical Then Huo yao make the mistake

219
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,628
Director Jin

220
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,318
Maybe you can't believe me

221
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,011
but you should believe the choice of Gu Fang

222
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:38,379
In order to keep Ji xiangkong

223
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:38,488
He would rather sign an unequal contract with our team

224
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:39,735
What kind of unbalance

225
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:41,640
It is business

226
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,093
Are you it is unbalance

227
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:50,623
Coach Luo

228
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,087
Ji XiangKong has made a promise at the board of Directors

229
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,990
Director Zhao

230
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,812
I think we should talk something at a free time

231
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,167
who

232
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,486
We don't have anything need to talk

233
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,166
It is not Ji xiangkong¡¯s responsibility in this competition 

234
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,158
You don't know didn't you

235
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,663
what's matter with me

236
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:13,015
It is so interesting

237
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:17,161
The next term will come soon

238
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:22,172
Except Ji xingkong I don¡¯t know who can take on the responsibility of being a captain

239
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,821
Director  You need to consider be careful

240
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:30,790
Director this is a contract with Peixin

241
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,104
You look it first

242
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,411
Who are right

243
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,554
This game

244
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,016
Already give you a answer

245
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,946
Xuan

246
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,785
Ji is still not give you call back

247
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,559
What's matter with him

248
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,066
Xuan You don't...

249
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,319
Huo Yao

250
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,020
You need to give an answer for the company

251
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,764
Are you understand

252
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:14,669
Xuan

253
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,481
Our coach already have a conversation with Dorector Jin

254
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,798
If he can get a good result

255
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,538
I can't believe he can solve it  He went for a long time If he got a good result he will be back now

256
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:25,121
I don;t want to talk with you please stop speaking

257
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,441
Huo yao   Xuan

258
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,364
You are not a children

259
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,628
And you are a man

260
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,847
You should't let Jixiangkong to carry your responsiblity

261
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,388
Huoyao  Xuan Xuan Xuan

262
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,862
He don't want like this

263
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,965
Xuan We are friend

264
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,115
He doesn't

265
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:42,118
He is not my friend

266
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,149
He is not a friend of Ji

267
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,004
Why do you treat yao like this

268
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,762
How does he treat to me

269
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:51,003
How does he treat to Ji

270
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:53,931
Let  me tell you

271
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:57,436
If you want to become a friend with him

272
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:02,153
Then we can't become a friend

273
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,797
I hope ji will not leave

274
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,725
But I also hope Yao will not leave as well

275
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,534
I

276
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:13,797
I don't want to lost you you are my friend

277
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:18,615
We said we need to become the champion together next year

278
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,540
Xuan

279
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:39,478
Yao

280
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,030
Ji he can't leave from here

281
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,606
It is great for the contract

282
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:15,263
If Peixi come here

283
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:18,023
For the next term's competition

284
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,778
I except we can get a good result

285
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,262
Thanks for the support of Director Jin

286
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:23,891
But

287
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,520
Peixi is the first time come to our team

288
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,768
I am afraid

289
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,724
Someone can't understand him

290
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,077
Have a bad corporation with him

291
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:34,397
Director Zhao

292
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,295
What do you mean

293
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:37,445
Nothing to express

294
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,765
If a company want to expand

295
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,217
We are pay attention to rewards and punishments

296
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,044
Responsibility to the people

297
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,095
I think someone

298
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,180
one of them should be take their responsbility

299
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,480
In this competition we all know that this is responsibility of Huo yao

300
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,120
It is no matter with Ji xiangkong

301
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,183
Coach Luo

302
00:19:56,183 --> 00:20:01,061
Huo yao usually play in a stable level, you are the coach you should know that 

303
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,250
If not Ji xiangkong use a bad tactical I think Huo yao will be good now

304
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,066
You

305
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,573
What the matter

306
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,389
We can do that

307
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,663
Maybe they should talk about the question face to face

308
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,889
Who is the wrong then he will leave

309
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,904
Is it fair

310
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:23,990
You required them talk face to face

311
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,024
Yes

312
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,262
Are you trying to break up the team

313
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,623
Director Jin

314
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,229
Coach Luo don't want do this

315
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,572
All ways cannot be through

316
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:37,113
How can we do now

317
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,664
I will undertake

318
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,895
It's my fault in this competition

319
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,309
No matter with others

320
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,778
Director Jin Coach Luo

321
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,654
I will keep my promise

322
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,617
xiangkong

323
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,430
Xiangkong

324
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,075
You don't have to undertake something

325
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:06,493
It is not your responsibility

326
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,367
Director Jin

327
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,885
They lose the because of    Coach Loser is loser

328
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,322
I am goona to leave

329
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,832
He already made a decision

330
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,261
Director Jin

331
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,769
We need to make the termination contract as soon as possible

332
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,990
Yao you can stay here

333
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:57,532
Xiangkong

334
00:22:58,363 --> 00:22:59,768
I know it is my mistakes

335
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:02,917
I should to leave

336
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:07,392
You know

337
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,062
Zhao yang be directed against to me

338
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,092
If I don't leave

339
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,318
Then, he will send me packing in the future

340
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,179
Then  How about Lin Yixuan

341
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,176
Did you consider it

342
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,059
xiangkong Yao

343
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,996
Don't speak anything

00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:23,858

345
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:26,521

348
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,419
Coach

349
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,692
How about the result of the discussion

350
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:24,526
Yixuan

351
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,560
We lost the game

352
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,704
Someone need to take the consequence

353
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:32,297
Yao

354
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,189
Yao is gonna to leave

355
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:37,088

Are you flighty

359
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,895
It's you not me

360
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,128
You said you will win the world championship with me

361
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:05,800
You leave alone now

362
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,053
you are a liar liar

363
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,073
Commander Ji

364
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,287
If you left we can't finish the game

365
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:15,401
You need to follow with me

366
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,160
We explain to Director Jin

367
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:20,987

It is impossible for VNG depends on their situation at the moment

432
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:32,198
In addition

433
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,296
It is so boring stay at VNG

434
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,006
Legends Team is intersting isn't it

435
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:40,008
Yes

436
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,500
Because they have Ji xiangkong

437
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:45,284
You object to Ji xiangkong Aren¡¯t you

438
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:52,415
Why are you laughing

439
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,577
You want to have a comparison with Ji xiangkong

440
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,981
But Ji xiangkong He give the captain to you

441
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,301
He was left

442
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,726
Do you still want to go Legend Team now

443
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,152
What do you mean

444
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,046
He has left didn't he

445
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,681
If you don't believe me you can ask them

446
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,996
Do you want to ask

447
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:16,751
You can't leave because I am not finish my talking

448
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,155

I don't have spare time

451
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,030
Pei xi

452
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:31,114
You should have a meal deal with us and you need to pay the bill because you changed team

453
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,099
You are great You became the captain of Legend Team

454
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:36,312
Get out of the way

455
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,652
Peixi Peixi

456
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:43,304
You guys said Peixi instead the the Ji xiangkong

457
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:47,324
Yes

458
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,197
Peixi is been a captain of Legend Team

459
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:50,618
You don't know didn't you

460
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:51,688
I tell you

461
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:56,497
I think that Peixi is a suitable people to become a successor for Gufang

462
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,233
Ji xiangkong should be retired

463
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:18,851
Ji xiangkong

464
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,486
Why are you leave form Legend Team

465
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,487
What's the relationship with you

466
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:25,342
I have an agreement with Legend Team now

467
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,115
I know

468
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:34,979
You are the new captain of Team Legend

469
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,624
My teammates are great

470
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:38,750
I hope you can give them a good guidance Then you can get a good result

471
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,392
I can play at anywhere

472
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:42,216
I don't care who is my opponet

473
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,140
Although you are best in solo match but the peak is a group games

474
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,401
You should lead to the team to do better

475
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:53,742
Instead of being a hero and fighting alone

476
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,931
You don't forget

477
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,402
You are the captain

478
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:58,032
It is a ridge of whole team

479
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:01,176
It is my purpose that I join to the Team Legend

480
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:04,882
I don't need someone that they can only rely to me

481
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,765
Then they will become my encumbrance

482
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:08,698

00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:12,052

488
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,020

Don¡¯t worry about the milk tea I can pay the bill everyday if you feel happy

509
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,685

You raise me aren¡¯t you I could raise you

511
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:01,387
If you don't mind eat instant noodles everyday

512
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:03,460
It is fine

513
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,722
Oh

514
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:11,257
You entered 100 in the district service

515
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:14,500

516
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,188
I am so clumsy

517
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:19,072
You have a deep understand about yourself

518
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,238
It is so easy for you professional players

519
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:27,635
But For our basic plays

520
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,215
It is so difficult

521
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,484
Alright

522
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:35,388
Today because you paid me a cup of milk tea

523
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:36,826

524
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:37,999

527
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,363
I think we don't need to go

528
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,991
Because I am a rookie

529
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:47,544
I don't care about this

530
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:49,594
Why

531
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:53,049
Someone like you in the Dream home

00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:02,830
