1
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,825
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:38,300
Episode 29

3
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:49,875
Xiangkong

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Actually I still

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,575
don't understand

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,975
Why did you

7
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:56,775
refuse Peixi

8
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,325
Do you really not understand

9
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,275
Is it because that

10
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,150
you don't like

11
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,100
Peixi's unique play style

12
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:04,500
No, it's not about dislike

13
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:05,850
it's inapposite

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,150
But right now he is

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,850
the strongest player in the union

16
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,975
Some many teams want to recruite him

17
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,950
Besides, he is so addicted to

18
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,150
playing games with you

19
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,325
How valuable

20
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Peixi's personal consciousness

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,425
is too strong

22
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,450
When he was in Legend

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,775
Coach Luo told him about this

24
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,175
But he is still unwilling to

25
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:22,900
make change

26
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,075
You can help him

27
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,325
You have helped Tongwu Lusheng

28
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:27,650
You said

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,925
everyone has shortcomings

30
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:30,775
Therefore

31
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,100
I want him to see

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,325
his shortcomings clearly

33
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,000
and want to make change

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
from the deep of the heart

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,850
There's no perfect statics

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,250
only teams that trust each other

37
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,550
so that they can achieve each other's goal

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,550
But

39
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,350
what if you refuse him

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,650
he really gives up

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,550
what to do then

42
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:48,950
He won't

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
According to his personality

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,300
Once his decision is made

45
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:52,075
no one

46
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:52,900
can prevent him

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,750
Alright  stop thinking it

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,800
We go to deal with

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,900
the business of brother Sun

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,225
Brother Sun

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,700
Ask yourself

52
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,675
Don't you really want to go back to the competition field

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,525
and fight again

54
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,025
1:40 pm

55
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,450
Flight GF2839

56
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,425
to Singapore

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:27,875
Hello

58
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,925
What are you doing in Singapore

59
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,900
Not me, it's Shuwen

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,225
It seems that she really doesn't

61
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:38,075
plan to tell you

62
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,600
Does she tell you what happened

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,325
between her and Ligan

64
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:43,500
No

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,775
Now I am telling you

66
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,209
clearly

67
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,350
She told everything to Ligan

68
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:49,800
After leaving Weiteng

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,550
she would go to Singapore

70
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,475
to communicate and study

71
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,500
She goes to study abroad

72
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:58,150
Great

73
00:03:58,825 --> 00:03:59,925
Is it great

74
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,675
Brother  If she leaves

75
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,375
we won't be able to know

76
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,150
when she will come back

77
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,625
Boss  turn on three computers

78
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,225
I'm busy now

79
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,000
I've got to hang up

80
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:09,575
Hello

81
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:17,575
Gufang

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,950
Has everyone arrived

83
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,175
I have

84
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,750
no qualification to persuade her to stay

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,675
Xiangkong

86
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,500
Sister Wen

87
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,925
Are you so reluctant to let me go

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,125
that you want to have breakfast with me

89
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:47,975
before I go

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,725
It's three hours

91
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,900
before the flight takes off

92
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,375
After we finish the breakfast

93
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,425
if you still insist

94
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,300
to go to Singapore

95
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:57,725
I promise I will take you

96
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:58,650
to the airport on time

97
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:01,175
It turns out that you have another purpose

98
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,925
But unfortunately

99
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,725
I have nothing

100
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,950
to miss

101
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,350
in this place

102
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:48,550
Take care

103
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,425
Safe journey

104
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:01,225
Why are you

105
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:02,225
the boss

106
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,450
Went out

107
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,950
without looking after your shop

108
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,450
I said hello to your guests

109
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,575
in place of you

110
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:10,425
and told them something went wrong in your family

111
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,025
I closed the shop in advance

112
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,375
Aren't you

113
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,225
in the airplane now

114
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,700
The moment before the flight took off

115
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,325
you sent me the message eventually

116
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,550
It looks like

117
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,800
you really don't want me to stay

118
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:38,650
SunZeyi

119
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:42,700
When I first saw you

120
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,975
playing the game that year

121
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,325
I fall in love with you at once

122
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,375
Do you know that

123
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,175
Even if my parents drove me out of the house

124
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,175
I was willing to follow you without shame

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,850
What about you

126
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,350
How could you

127
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,925
leave me

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,798
leave the team

129
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:07,775
because of three hundred thousand from Ligan

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,700
This thing

131
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,725
You  you have to let me explain

132
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:19,625
Say it

133
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,200
But I don't want to hear it now

134
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,175
You go with me to a place

135
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,275
Hurry up

136
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,350
Why do you bring me here

137
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,375
After we won the championship that year

138
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,425
We decided to

139
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,375
bought here

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,625
Though the team dismissed later

141
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,850
no one would be willing to

142
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,925
sell it

143
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,275
This place is

144
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,600
like our home

145
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,700
No matther how long you've been leaving

146
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
You are always number one

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,200
in our Pioneer

148
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:19,750
Do you remember

149
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,675
You had the most followers

150
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,025
Everytime we finished the game

151
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:26,025
Those followers would

152
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:26,800
give us

153
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,925
boxes of drinks in front of the gate

154
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,575
The drinks that those followers gave

155
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,825
were all dunk by Summer secretly

156
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,550
Go inside and have a look

157
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,225
Audiences

158
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,825
You just saw SunZeyi's

159
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:42,775
visionless judgement

160
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,775
visonless judgement

161
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,050
Great  a big move

162
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,150
harvested the enemy's remaining blood

163
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,250
Amazing

164
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,275
SunZeyi is fighting agaist three enemies

165
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,350
SunZeyi is fighting agaist three enemies

166
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,650
This is a textbook version of

167
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,775
the operation

168
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,975
SunZeyi is bleeding

169
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,875
He's escaping

170
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,050
from the death

171
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,546
Great

172
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,775
SunZeyi turned back and defeated

173
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:03,950
the enemy who chased him

174
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,825
SunZeyi is bleeding

175
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:06,425
Wait

176
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,050
Look his position

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,950
He is going behind

178
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,275
SunZeyi is on the scene

179
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,075
The chance of Pioneer is coming

180
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,600
SunZeyi  SunZeyi

181
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,350
SunZeyi begins to harvest

182
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,425
begins to harvest

183
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,125
Five kills

184
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,750
SunZeyi took five kills

185
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:36,900
Number one  Numver one  Number one

00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,375

Sword towards the king

239
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,525
Heard from Summer

240
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,325
You arranged this today

241
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,750
You invited all the fans

242
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,300
His big mouth

243
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:42,850
Anyway

244
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:44,650
I should say thank you to you brothers

245
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,200
Thank you

246
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,120
for letting me find

247
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,676
the first member of Phoenix

248
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:54,800
I know you refused me

249
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,000
but I will want to

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,075
join Phoenix

251
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:58,700
In this season

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,300
except for Phoenix

253
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm not going anywhere

254
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,400
What if Phoenix

255
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,350
really can't accept you

256
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,500
No matter what position you give me

257
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,125
I will try my best

258
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,325
No matter what position

259
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,075
Yes

260
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:23,950
If it's just a training mate

261
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,200
will you do it

262
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,091
Okay  deal

263
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,671
A training mate of Phoenix

264
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:43,675
We five

265
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,225
finally reunite

266
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,275
Yes

267
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,525
Usually it's you that are absent

268
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,375
ot you

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,600
Should you say

270
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,450
thank you to me today

271
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,775
Yes  thank you

272
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:52,950
Should I introduce you

273
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,850
a girlfriend

274
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:55,700
According to your discernment

275
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,775
I don't believe you

276
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:57,725
Summer  you really would

277
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:58,750
never say something nice

278
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,500
I tell you

279
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:00,675
Brother Summer

280
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:01,800
I propose a toast

281
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,775
This thing today

282
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,900
is well done

283
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,075
Well  do you mean

284
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,750
I  I used to be dependable

285
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,575
No you're always dependable

286
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,200
Good word

287
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,300
Brother

288
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:17,850
Brother

289
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,325
No

290
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:22,400
What did you call me

291
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,200
I called you brother

292
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,825
No no no

293
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,525
Everytime you appear to be so gentle

294
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:28,625
I think something is wrong

295
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,750
I'm going to take Dream Traveler

296
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,225
as the training base of Phoenix

297
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,650
You are not

298
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,450
in Phoenix

299
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,300
Why are you helping them

300
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:44,925
I am the member of Phoenix

301
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,675
Now I announce officially

302
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,875
I am the training mate

303
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:58,275
of Phoenix

304
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
JiXiangkong

305
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:04,675
You make me brother

306
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,175
be your training mate

307
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,800
No Summer

308
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,575
You have to hear my explanation

309
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,725
This thing  he

310
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,275
Being the training mate is my willingness

311
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,950
as long as I can join Phoenix

312
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,225
Do some water

313
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:19,450
run into your head

314
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,075
Does he force you to take wrong medicine

315
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,075
I'm not capable of that

316
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,850
Okay

317
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:27,375
You're enough

318
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:28,650
Peixi said

319
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,650
he is willing to do it

320
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,700
You just let him be

321
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,250
Yes

322
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,000
The Phoenix

323
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,325
is lack of a training base

324
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,250
Should we give them

325
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,575
our training base as a gift

326
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,875
So  Dream Traveler

327
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:45,425
God

328
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,525
My brother goes to be a training mate

329
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,500
Now I give Dream Traveler

330
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,325
Others harm fathers

331
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,450
He harms his brother

332
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
Forget about Dream Traveler

333
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,950
Xiangkong

334
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,950
I

335
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,025
want to represent Pioneer

336
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,425
to give our training base

337
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,600
to you as a gift

338
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,775
What about it  Do you have any objection

339
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:04,525
No

340
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,975
as long as it's not Dream Traveler

341
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,025
I have no objection to it

342
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,025
No objection  I'm so happy

343
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,975
Here

344
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,975

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,775
this mine now

346
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
For our Phoenix

347
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,350
to win the championship as early as possible

348
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,175
Let's cheer in place of wine

349
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:21,175

Yixuan  you're coming

355
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,675
Yixuan come come come

356
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,050
Sit sit sit

357
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,500
Hi captain

358
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:38,875
Hi brother Sun

359
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:39,850
Hi Mr. Luo

360
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,150
Hi brother Summer  hi sister Wen

361
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,925
I I  I bought some fruits

362
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:44,875
but don't know if it's enough

363
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,550
So thoughtful

364
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:47,775
Put here

365
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:51,950
Brother Kong

366
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,375
Do you form a new team

367
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,550
Why don't you tell me

368
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,600
Why is Peixi here

369
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:15,450
Now I'm one member

370
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,800
of Phoenix

371
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,525
You recruit him but not me

372
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,550
Do you think

373
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,375
I'm not stronger than him

374
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,075
Axuan you misunderstood

375
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:32,550
That we don't tell you

376
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,500
is because that I know

377
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,525
you will support us

378
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,075
Will you

379
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,225
Besides

380
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,750
We can't afford

381
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,275
your transfer fee

382
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,375
I pay my own

383
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,500
penal sum

384
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,500
Axuan

385
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,175
If you stay in Legend

386
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:01,700
you will be able to enter

387
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,850
Global Finals

388
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:04,625
If you go with me

389
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,950
it equals with starting from zero

390
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,625
I don't want you to

391
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,450
take such a big risk

392
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,650
Well brother Kong

393
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,950
My

394
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,700
biggest dream in this life

395
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,225
is to play games with you

396
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,675
and win the championship together

397
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,225
Penal sum

398
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,575
I will figure it out

399
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,025
None of your business

400
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,200
Axuan

401
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,150
Axuan Axuan Axuan

402
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,050
Leave it

403
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,075
You know his temper

404
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,850
Let him calm down

405
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,100
We go to talk with him

406
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,125
later

407
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,175
You really don't know how to speak properly

408
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,825
I just told the truth

409
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,200
You know if it's the truth

410
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,825
You all come down and say goodbye to me

411
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,875
No need to be so grand

412
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,825
Shuwen you can't go

413
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:14,700
You go upstaires first

414
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,350
to help brother one

415
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,500
clean up

416
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,250
You haven't seen each other for a long time

417
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:19,150
You guys

418
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:20,850
know the rules

419
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,575
Hurry up

420
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:22,400
Go

421
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,900
Bye

422
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,350
Go home  byebye

423
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,325
Stay safe on the road

424
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,650
Everything's fine  I'm leaving

425
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,250
I go to say goodbye to my master

426
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,225
Okay

427
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,375
Master

428
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,450
Slow down on your way home

429
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:41,025
I've watched

430
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:41,900
the rewind's video this week

431
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:42,975
The global perception

432
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:44,275
is much better than before

433
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,050
Really

434
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:46,975
I was concerned

435
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:47,950
I was so busy these days

436
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,975
that the video

437
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:49,950
was meda so roughly

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,275
It must be hard to be the team leader

439
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,600
have to learn many things

440
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
and lead the whole team

441
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,600
If you come across

442
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,750
something difficult

443
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,150
ask me anytime

444
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,350
Take it easy

445
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,350
If something happens to me

446
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,850
you can't get away with it as a master

447
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,425
Right

448
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm still investigating

449
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:11,025
the leak of tactics

450
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:11,900
As long as there's progress

451
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,575
I will tell you at once

452
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,150
Actually

453
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,975
whether this thing can be investigated thoroughly

454
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,175
is not really necessary

455
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,775
At least

456
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,425
I've made

457
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,550
such good friends

458
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,825
The things I learnt in JDV

459
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,775
can be used to manage the team

460
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,450
for Xiangkong

461
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:28,700
Okay

462
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,775
Own a girlfriend like you

463
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,700
JiXiangkong is very lucky

464
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm leaving

465
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,225
Brother Sun

466
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:50,775
It's late

467
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:51,850
I have to go as well

468
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:52,800
Why are you laughing

469
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,025
Sister Wen  bye

470
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,600
Brother Sun byebye

471
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
Sister Wen byebye byebye

472
00:22:59,125 --> 00:22:59,875
Be safe

473
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay

474
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,225
Tell me when you arrive

475
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:11,050
Bye

476
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,225
Your brothers

477
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:25,000
go away immediately once finish eating

478
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,700
I go up to help you clean

479
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:51,650
Shuwen

480
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:55,350
Stop cleaning

481
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,000
You're tired for a day

482
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,075
It's late

483
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:00,675
I I send you back

484
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,075
What do you mean

485
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:08,825
Drive me away

486
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,050
No I didn't mean it

487
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,475
In the afternoon

488
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:14,200
Didn't you say

489
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,225
that you want to explain clearly to me

490
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,750
Tell me

491
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,075
I want to hear now  tell me

492
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,400
My thought was too simple at that time

493
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,300
I thought

494
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,675
after you won the championship

495
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,050
You dare to mention the championship

496
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:30,650
Do you know

497
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,350
on the evening when we won the championship

498
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,400
I cried the whole night

499
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,375
How sad I felt

500
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,825
I was alone

501
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:43,000
alone outside

502
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:45,750
without you

503
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,850
What's the point

504
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,450
to be the champion

505
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,650
I know your every day

506
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,675
in Vancouver

507
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:00,375
I asked others to take care of you for me

508
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:01,975
But in the end

509
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,950
you're gone

510
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,175
The moment I lost you

511
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,275
I realized

512
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,375
I had no chance

513
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,625
to find you again

514
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:21,275
Shuwen sorry

515
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,600
Do you still love me

516
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,125
These years

517
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
except you

518
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,225
no one can step into

519
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,200
my heart

520
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,600
SunZeyi

521
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,550
You are a son of a bitch

522
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:38,900
Come

523
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:39,825
Let's start

524
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,525
Wait

525
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,150
What are these

526
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,475
It's dirty inside

527
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,575
Thank you

528
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,050
I don't need it

529
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Peixi

530
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,250
What about this

531
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:04,950
If you really think

532
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,825
it's dirty

533
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:07,050
you can go to the yard

534
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,850
of the gate

535
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,050
and wait for us

536
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,497
After we finish cleaning here

537
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,400
We will call you inside

538
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,125
Is it okay

539
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:13,800
No

540
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:19,675
Okay

541
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:21,675
Xiangkong

542
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,425
Is Peixi willing to a training mate

543
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,875
Or what

544
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,250
I'm not capable of forcing him

545
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:32,325
But we all recognize

546
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,750
Peixi's ability

547
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,325
For entering Phoenix

548
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,775
he is willing to a training mate

549
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,325
Don't you still accept him

550
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,175
But at this moment

551
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:45,075
he's not the most suitable person in my heart

552
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,950
Finally we make it

553
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
I almost finish here

554
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,125
Do you clean it up

555
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,475
Meal is ready

556
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:06,475
Go downstairs and have meal

557
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,825
No wonder it smells delicious

558
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:08,725
I'm starving

559
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,975
Smells delicious

560
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:17,625
Can't wait

561
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,350
Have a try

562
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,350
It's so delicious

563
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,475
Good taste

564
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,100
Thank you Xiangkong

565
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,000
for making me back

566
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,500
Brother Sun  why do you say thanks to me

567
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,725
You belong to this place

568
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,900
Right brother Sun

569
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,075
Did you live in that room

570
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:51,400
Yes I used to live there

571
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,700
Good

572
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Then you should keep liveing in that room

573
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,250
and I will live in the room

574
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,750
beside the training room

575
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,700
Peixi select one

576
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,000
Which room do you live in

577
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,275
I

578
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:05,950
can live in anywhere

579
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,200
I pick the room beside Brother Sun's

580
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,950
Okay

581
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,950
You help me move a bed

582
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,325
I live with him

583
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:16,950
No

584
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,050
Why do you live with me

585
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,650
Qiuying will be jealous

586
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,075
Yes

587
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:23,425
OKay

588
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:24,975
I will move on my own

589
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:26,475
I must

590
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,750
live with you

591
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,400
Peixi

592
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:31,125
I'll get jealous

593
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:32,750
Well

594
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,325
Why does he live with me  Peixi

595
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,825
Practicing

596
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,150
Don't look at me

597
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,325
I'm nervous

598
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
Why do you get this

599
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:58,875
Ranyan stick  so beautiful

600
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,025
It is beautiful

601
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,025
but it's useless

602
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,500
This effect needs to be superimposed

603
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:06,050
At lease three sticks can work

604
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,975
I don't care  it's beautiful

605
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,875
Look  so beautiful

606
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,125
like fireworks

607
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,275
Do you like fireworks

608
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,575
Which girl doesn't like it

609
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:31,250
Everytime I let off fireworks

610
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:33,000
I get a feeling that

611
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,775
the world is lightened for me

612
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,750
Don't you have this feeling

613
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,925
right now

614
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:14,275
Xialing

615
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,425
When will we have a pinnacle game

616
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,275
Yes

617
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,075
You are a master

618
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,050
When will you carry us

619
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:23,900
Son

620
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,100
Are you hungry

621
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,250
Here have a meal

622
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,075
I'm not hungry

623
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,850
Why aren't you hungry

624
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,650
You didn't eat too much at noon

625
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:38,750
Hurry  be good

626
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,475
I want to stay alone

627
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:42,300
Is it okay

628
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:16,750
What't wrong

629
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,475
Is he still unwilling to eat

630
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,375
The window for transfer

631
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,175
will be closed

632
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:40,900
in less than a month

633
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,250
We have to get people together as soon as possible

634
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:52,750
Actually I think

635
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,425
these few people

636
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:54,825
are all great

637
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:55,450
Or

638
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,650
you think about

639
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,425
these people again

640
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,175
Besides

641
00:33:58,175 --> 00:33:59,950
there are all top players in national games

642
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:01,750
This one  this one

643
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,525
both agree to join us

644
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,175
Think again

645
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Actually these people

646
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,500
have no characteristics

647
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:14,150
Just advice  no offence

648
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,775
But the situations are

649
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:18,875
First

650
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,300
No way to give them

651
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,325
a satifactory salary

652
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:22,150
Second

653
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,325
new team

654
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,600
the fact that we can attract

655
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,950
the top players in national games

656
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,100
is very great

657
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:30,900
Or

658
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,800
call them and we can practice together

659
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,300
But I think Peixi is right

660
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,375
These people

661
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,850
have no characteristics

662
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,850
They are not what we are looking for

663
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:49,425
Right

664
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:51,300
There's one person

665
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,450
you might be interested in

666
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,750
Who

667
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,150
Let's check

668
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,325
Account four zero nine

669
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:10,400
Within half a month

670
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,250
climb the ladder

671
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:12,650
win all the way

672
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,025
and ranked forth in the country

673
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,950
However

674
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,350
this man is mysterious

675
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,625
Everytime I send him messages

676
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,850
he won't reply

677
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,325
No one knows

678
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:23,475
who he is

679
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,075
He is online

680
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:26,850
Have a solo game with him

681
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,175
I have a try

682
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:30,900
Use your account

683
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,200
Every time

684
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,075
I invite him

685
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,300
he refuses me

686
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,075
Wait and see

687
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:39,900
He agrees

688
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:41,475
You are more attractive

689
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:50,025
Give him a try

690
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,800
His item builds

691
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,825
are quite thoughtful

692
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:57,250
He uses consumables

693
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,625
to exchange experience in the early stage

694
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,425
Great

695
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,675
Amazing

696
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:15,925
He's strong in laning

697
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,275
and has agile item builds

698
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,400
and his own pattern

699
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,250
He can brush experience stably

700
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,350
Very effective

701
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,650
So weak  you don't deserve Qiuying

702
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,398
Looks like he's your follower

703
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,525
Come  I talk with him

704
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:31,625
Come come come

705
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,775
Hello four zero nine

706
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,100
I am Qiuying

707
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:44,925
Wait

708
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,200
409 I am Qiuying

709
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,075
Do you have interest in meeting

710
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,675
No

711
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,075
He's not my follower either

712
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,525
If I have a chance to meet him

713
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,950
I won't be gentle

714
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:03,475
I think he's great

715
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,025
Do you have any way to contact him

716
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,600
I can ask about him

717
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
in Dream Traveler

718
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:09,700
Right

719
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,800
You can ask your brother

720
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,150
No reply

721
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,900
Hello

722
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:17,850
Yingzi

723
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:19,650
Do you have time

724
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,375
I want to talk with you about Xialing

725
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,875
What's wrong with Xialing

726
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,250
What's wrong with Xialing

727
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,275
Did something happen

728
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:33,500
to his legs

729
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,675
Here sit down

730
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,250
What's wrong with him

731
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,725
When he had a video with me yesterday

732
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,125
he said he's good

733
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,750
He lied

734
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:49,125
In the future

735
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:51,475
he can't play basketball any more

736
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:54,450
His nervus peroneus communis have been damaged

737
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,250
Can't have intense exercise

738
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,100
He is worried that you would feel guilty

739
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,725
and doesn't want me to tell you

740
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,925
Then

741
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,400
what about his walk in daily life

742
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,525
Daily work

743
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:12,775
might be okay

744
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,200
But now

745
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,500
he has to rely on the walking stick

746
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,625
Does he need to use walking stick the whole life

747
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,050
No

748
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,875
The doctor said

749
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,050
thanks to his youth

750
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,900
he will recover soon

751
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,500
The important thing is

752
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,300
his mentality has problems

753
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:43,750
Mental problems

754
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,100
He is like

755
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,150
another person completely

756
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,025
Stay in his roon every day

757
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,050
and doesn't go out

758
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,675
No more than three sentences

759
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,125
with us all day

760
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:54,600
His classmates came to find him

761
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,325
but he didn't meet them

762
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:58,975
I and your auntie Xia are so worried

763
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,325
We really have

764
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:01,500
no idea right now

765
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:05,350
He is so young

766
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,700
but being so depraved

767
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:07,975
What about his future

768
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,750
I think over and over again

769
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,150
I'm afaid that he might only

770
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,675
listen to you

771
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:19,925
Maybe  go to talk with him

772
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:22,425
I go right away

773
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,225
Not now

774
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:24,550
Auntie Xia is at home

775
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:29,075
Or tomorrow

776
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,300
I tell you Yingzi

777
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,525
If you leave the house

778
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,225
never come back again

779
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:50,600
Come

780
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,875
Come in

781
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,925
Does Xialing get up

782
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:05,275
In his room

783
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,000
Well

784
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:07,850
You

785
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,600
You talk with him first

786
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:10,900
I go out

787
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,725
I've told so many times

788
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,375
could you let me be alone

789
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Sister

790
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:42,475
Why  why are you coming

791
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:46,950
Can I go in and talk with you

792
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,625
Okay

793
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,800
My feet will be recovered soon

794
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:36,325
Could you stop pretending to be strong

795
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,900
Do you plan

796
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,725
stay in this room

797
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:44,275
for the whole life

798
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,775
Did dad

799
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,675
tell you something

800
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,875
Xialing

801
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:57,350
Aren't you going to

802
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,550
tell me the truth

803
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,650
Sister  don't think too much

804
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,925
I'm fine

805
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,250
I know

806
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,400
Even if I am blaming myself

807
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,225
feeling guilty

808
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,025
I can't change the reality

809
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:12,475
But I really hope

810
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:13,850
you can cheer up

811
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,000
and become

812
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,050
the sunny boy you used to be

813
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,575
I will

814
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:25,275
Take it easy

815
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,075
How can I be relieved when looking you like this

816
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:36,050
Right

817
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,025
Do you investigate

818
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,300
the leak of tactics clearly

819
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,025
The committee of Pinnacle

820
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,675
is still investigating

821
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,125
But I've already quitted

822
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,475
from JDV

823
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,875
I form a new team

824
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,700
with JiXiangkong

825
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,350
You are also playing the Pinnacle

826
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:06,375
Or

827
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:07,650
I take you to my new team

828
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,550
and have a look

829
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,125
JiXiangkong and Peixi are all there

830
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:11,450
If you have somthing that don't understand

831
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,400
you can ask them

832
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,475
Is it okay

833
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,300
No

834
00:45:26,775 --> 00:45:28,450
I'm disabled right now

835
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:30,975
I can't do anything except adding troubles

836
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,050
Xialing

837
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Come  hurry up

838
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,375
I was worried

839
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,750
If you come late

840
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,350
it will get cold

841
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,625
Pour some vinegar

842
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,925
Ordered the steamed dumplings you like best

843
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,825
Hurry up and eat

844
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,175
How's it going

845
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,425
Do you talk with him

846
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:08,200
He is still

847
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,375
closing himself

848
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,925
I wanted to take him for a walk

849
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,600
He didn't agree

850
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,650
Ha can talk with you

851
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,725
That's great

852
00:46:20,575 --> 00:46:22,275
But you needn't to be so worried

853
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,600
As long as I have time

854
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:25,725
I will come and see him

855
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:37,100
Did you quit

856
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,275
from JDV

857
00:46:40,025 --> 00:46:41,000
How do you know it

858
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,575
Your things

859
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:47,275
are popular online

860
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,100
After you quit

861
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,550
can't you be a commentator anymore

862
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:56,275
I am forming a team

863
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:57,400
with JiXiangkong

864
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,500
I will figure

865
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:01,600
the leak of tactics out

866
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,950
One day

867
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,625
I will be back to the stage

868
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:11,850
Well

869
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:14,325
Is JiXiangkong your boyfriend

870
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:23,175
Great

871
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:25,500
He looks reliable

872
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,275
different from what describe him online

873
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,550
You are at the age

874
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,000
of getting a boyfriend

875
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,550
Remember

876
00:47:37,075 --> 00:47:40,350
Observe more  quality is the most important

877
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,700
I know

878
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,775
I have to go to buy some food

879
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,375
Hurry up

880
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,425
Hurry up and eat more

881
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:54,525
I'm leaving
