00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,140
Episode 29

2
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,700
Xiang Kong.

3
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,370
Actually, I still don't really understand

4
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,610
why you wanted to reject Pei Xi.

5
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,250
You really don't understand?

6
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,990
Is it because you don't like the way

7
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,910
he plays solo?

8
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,430
It's not that I don't like it.

9
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,750
It's that it doesn't match.

10
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,910
But now, he

11
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,830
is the best player in all districts.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,990
So many teams would want to sign him.

13
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,990
Yet, he's so stubborn about competing with you.

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,270
How hard to come by that is.

15
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,270
Pei Xi's personal awareness is too strong.

16
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,470
When he was in Legends,

17
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,870
Coach Luo talked to him before.

18
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,750
But he's still not willing to change.

19
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,030
Then you can help him.

20
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,230
You've also helped Tong Wu and Lu Sheng.

21
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,470
You mentioned before.

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,150
Everyone has their own flaws.

23
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,900
So,

24
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,140
I want him to be able

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,380
to see his own flaws.

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,140
Be sincere about

27
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,260
wanting to change.

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,900
Without a perfect tactic,

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,260
you can only succeed with a team

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,640
where everyone trusts each other.

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,000
But,

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
what if you rejected him in this way

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
and he really give up.

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,760
What do we do?

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,120
He won't.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
With that personality of his,

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,440
once he made a decision,

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,160
no one can stop him.

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Okay, don't think about it anymore.

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go settle Sun ge's situation first.

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,670
Sun ge.

42
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,860
Ask yourself

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,980
do you really not want to return to competing?

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,940
Don't you want to work hard once more?

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,300
Afternoon, 1:40pm,

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,730
flight GF2839,

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,930
travelling towards Singapore.

48
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,370
Hello?

49
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,130
Why are you going to Singapore?

50
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,210
It's not me, it's Shu Wen.

51
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,410
Looks like she really doesn't intend

52
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,410
to tell you.

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,080
Did she tell you about the

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
situation between her and Li Gan?

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
No.

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,160
Then, right now, I'll

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
clearly tell you.

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
She already told Li Gan clearly.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
After leaving VNG,

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,190
she'll be going to Singapore

61
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,070
for a study exchange

62
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,990
She's going overseas to study?

63
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,070
That's pretty good.

64
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,550
Pretty good?

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,180
Bro, after she leaves,

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,780
we don't know when

67
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
she'll come back.

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,140
Boss, I'll take three computers.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,540
I have things to do here.

70
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,420
I'll hang up first.

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,620
Hello?

72
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,500
Gu Fang.

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
Is everyone here?

74
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,850
Right now, what

75
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,640
rights do I have to keep her?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Xiang Kong.

77
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,900
Wen jie.

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,820
You can't bear to part with me this bad?

79
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,980
That you must have breakfast

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
with me before I leave.

81
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,780
There's still three more hours

82
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,980
until your departure time.

83
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,260
After we finish this breakfast,

84
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,420
if you still insist on

85
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,340
going to Singapore,

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,700
I gurantee that I'll send you

87
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,860
to the airport on time.

88
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,340
So, there was another motive.

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,220
but that's a pity,

90
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,860
over here, I

91
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,580
have nothing that'll make me reluctant to leave.

92
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870
Take care,

93
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,980
have a safe trip.

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
What kind of boss are you?

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
Running out just like that.

96
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
You're not going to look after the store?

97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,520
I helped you greet

98
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,520
the customers.

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,430
Saying you had some family matters.

100
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,150
So I closed the store earlier.

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,550
You...

102
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,310
Aren't you in the plane?

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,860
You only messaged me

104
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,540
after the plane has departed.

105
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,780
Looks like you really

106
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,060
don't intend to keep me.

107
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,060
Sun Ze Yi.

108
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,970
That year when I first saw

109
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,410
you playing on the competition,

110
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,650
I started liking you.

111
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,770
Do you know that?

112
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,600
My family chased me out the house.

113
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
I was thick skinned and followed you.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,360
And you?

115
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,940
How could you

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,420
leave me and the team

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,060
just because of

118
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,100
Li Gan's RMB 300,000?!

119
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,300
This thing...

120
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,300
Let me explain.

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,300
Tell me.

122
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,940
I don't want to hear it now.

123
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,940
Follow me to a place now.

124
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,290
Hurry.

125
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,190
That year, after we won

126
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,190
the championship,

127
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,270
we bought this place

128
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,590
Although the team disbanded later,

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,590
but no one was willing to sell this place.

130
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,270
This place,

131
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,550
became like our home.

132
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,790
No matter how long you leave,

133
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,060
you'll always be the Founders's big bro.

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,900
Do you still remember?

135
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
You had the most fans.

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
After every competition,

137
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
your fans

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,840
placed boxes of

139
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
drinks for us.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,480
The drinks the fans sent back then,

141
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,040
were all secretly finished by Summer.

142
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,800
Let's go in and have a look.

143
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,860
Dear audience,

144
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,340
you can see that Sun Ze Yi

145
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
is making a prediction without a field of vision.

146
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,380
Making a prediction without a field of vision.

147
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,660
What a powerful move.

148
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,980
And he collected the opponent's kills.

149
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Too amazing.

150
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
Sun Ze Yi defeated three people alone.

151
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,180
Sun Ze Yi defeated three people alone.

152
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
This is a move similar to those in

153
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
professional educational books.

154
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,620
Sun Ze Yi killed many opponents.

155
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,420
He's currently escaping.

156
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,580
He's escaping from death.

157
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,250
Okay.

158
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,850
Sun Ze Yi turned and killed the opponents chasing him.

159
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,530
Sun Ze Yi killed many opponents.

160
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:10,970
Wait a minute.

161
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,730
Look at his position.

162
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,640
He's currently turning around.

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,040
Sun Ze Yi has entered.

164
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
The Founders's chance is here.

165
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Sun Ze Yi!

166
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Sun Ze Yi has started catching.

167
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,220
Start catching the kills.

168
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,980
Quintuple kill!

169
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
Sun Ze Yi got the quintuple kill!

170
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:41,620
Big bro!

171
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,380
Big bro, we're still here.

172
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,940
Big bro, where have you gone all these years?

173
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,940
Big bro, we're here to send drinks.

174
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,620
from Conquer's competitions.

175
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,620
Big bro, you've never been forgotten

176
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,700
Big bro.

177
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,530
All of us are here now.

178
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,010
Big bro.

179
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,890
You owe us a championship.

180
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,010
That's right.

181
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,650
You owe us a championship.

182
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,950
Why did you all come?

183
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,510
Thank you, thank you guys.

184
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,150
Big bro.

185
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,350
The one who should be thankful

186
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,030
should be us.

187
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,470
Big bro.

188
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,150
Without you,

189
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,910
there won't be the Founders.

190
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,110
Big bro.

191
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,260
stage five years ago.

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,260
You were missing from the champion

193
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,620
It's the biggest regret in all our hearts.

194
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,260
Sun Ze Yi.

195
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,240
Do you still remember our team's slogan?

196
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,800
Not scared of the rain and wind,

197
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,920
swords pointing to the king.

198
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
What are you hesitating for?

199
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,270
Fire of desire doesn't extinguish.

200
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,590
Rebirth after death.

201
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,910
This is what you used to encourage me.

202
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,470
I'm using these eight words,

203
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,420
as the slogan for Phoenix.

204
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Join us.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,660
Sun ge.

206
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,690
I, Sun Ze Yi,

207
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,560
I'll work hard once more

208
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
for you guys.

209
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,920
Amazing.

210
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,950
Fire of desire doesn't extinguish.

211
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,830
Rebirth after death.

212
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,020
Fire of desire doesn't extinguish.

213
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,620
Rebirth after death.

214
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,580
Fire of desire doesn't extinguish.

215
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,380
Rebirth after death.

216
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,180
Fire of desire doesn't extinguish.

217
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,340
Rebirth after death.

218
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,730
Thank you for today.

219
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,970
What's there to thank me for?

220
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,600
I heard Summer ge said,

221
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
you arranged everything today.

222
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
You were the one who looked for the fans.

223
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
He's such a blabbermouth.

224
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,220
Anyway,

225
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,100
I must thank you brothers.

226
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,540
Thank you guys.

227
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,860
For allowing me to find the first member of Phoenix.

228
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,180
I know you rejected me.

229
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,620
But I still want to join Phoenix.

230
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,380
This competition season

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,420
other than Phoenix,

232
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm not going anywhere.

233
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,820
What if Phoenix

234
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,940
is really unable to accept you?

235
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,090
No matter what position you give me,

236
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,850
I will do my best.

237
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,770
No matter what position?

238
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,890
Yes.

239
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,390
If it's training partner,

240
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,710
are you still willing?

241
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,790
Okay, it's decided.

242
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,150
I'll be Phoenix's training partner.

243
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,430
The five of us

244
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,990
have finally gathered today.

245
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,110
That's right.

246
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,110
Usually we're missing either you or you.

247
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,300
Shouldn't you guys thank me today?

248
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,620
Yes, thank you.

249
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
Should I introduce a girlfriend to you?

250
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,500
With your taste,

251
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,500
I don't trust you.

252
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,500
Summer, you really

253
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,180
have nothing nice to say don't you?

254
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Let me tell you.

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,640
Summer ge.

256
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,640
Let me toast to you.

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,560
Today's incident

258
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,680
is done too reliably.

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,040
No, from what you said,

260
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
am I not reliable previously?

261
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
No, you've always been reliable.

262
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,080
You know how to sweet talk.

263
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,400
Ge,

264
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,960
ge.

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,400
No.

266
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,390
What did you call me?

267
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,270
I'm calling you ge.

268
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,830
Don't.

269
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,590
Everytime you're this affectionate,

270
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,630
I feel that it's not something good.

271
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,660
I want to use Dream Journey

272
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,420
as Phoenix's training ground.

273
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,650
You haven't even joined the team.

274
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,410
Why are you helping them?

275
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,170
I am part of Phoenix now.

276
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,850
I am officially announcing now.

277
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,250
I am Phoenix team's

278
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,610
training partner.

279
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Ji Xiang Kong.

280
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,440
You're letting my brother be a training partner?

281
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
No, Summer ge.

282
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,920
Let me explain.

283
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
About this, he-

284
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,710
I'm willing to be a training partner.

285
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,390
As long as I can enter Phoenix.

286
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,310
You rascal.

287
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,950
Have you become dumb?

288
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,580
Did he hypnotise you with drugs?

289
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,460
Since when I have that ability?

290
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,340
Enough.

291
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,900
That's really enough.

292
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,060
Pei Xi already said he's willing.

293
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,340
Then just let him join.

294
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,900
That's right.

295
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,340
Phoenix

296
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,980
is lacking a training place now.

297
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,700
Why not we gift them

298
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,060
our training place?

299
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,370
Why not... Dream Journey...?

300
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,410
My god.

301
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,970
My brother is becoming a training partner.

302
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,050
Adding on Dream Journey...

303
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Everyone tricks their fathers.

304
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
This guy is tricking his brother.

305
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,360
Forget about Dream Journey.

306
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,600
Xiang Kong.

307
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,720
I want to represent the founders

308
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,920
and gift you guys

309
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,540
with our training ground.

310
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,540
How's that? Does anyone have opinions?

311
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,620
No, as long as it's not Dream Journey.

312
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,860
Of course, I have no opinions too.

313
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,660
I don't, I'm too happy.

314
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,740
Here.

315
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,060
This.

316
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,700
Is gifted to me.

317
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,940
For our Phoenix team

318
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
to win championship someday,

319
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,860
let's cheers using tea.

320
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
Come. Okay.

321
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,380
- Fighting leader!

322
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,380
Fighting.

323
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,660
Fighting.

324
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,620
- Fighting!

325
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Thank you leader.

326
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
- Fighting.

327
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,330
- Xiang Kong.

328
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,330
Ah Xuan.

329
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,210
Yi Xuan, you're here.

330
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,530
Yi Xuan, come.

331
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,970
Have a seat.

332
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,530
Hello leader.

333
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,850
Hello Sun ge.

334
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,890
Hello teacher Luo.

335
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,190
Hello Summer ge, hello Shu Wen jie.

336
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,830
I- I bought some fruits.

337
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,830
I don't know if it's enough for everyone.

338
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,510
You're pretty obedient.

339
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,750
Leave it here.

340
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,350
Kong ge.

341
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,510
You formed a new team?

342
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,830
Why didn't you tell me?

343
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
Why is Pei Xi here?

344
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,140
I am now a member of Phoenix.

345
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,880
You called him but not me?

346
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,800
Do you think that he's better than me?

347
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,640
Ah Xuan, you're mistaken.

348
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,920
We didn't tell you

349
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,920
because I know

350
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,680
you will definitely support us. Right?

351
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,680
Besides,

352
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,230
right now we still can't afford

353
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,750
your transfer fees.

354
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,950
The termination fee.

355
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,110
I paid for it myself.

356
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,060
Ah Xuan.

357
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,770
Stay at Legends.

358
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,490
You'll be able to enter the worldwide finals.

359
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,250
If you join my team,

360
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,730
is like starting over again.

361
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,010
Such a huge risk.

362
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,210
I don't want to bear that simply.

363
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,370
Then, Kong ge.

364
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,800
My

365
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,560
biggest dream in this lifetime

366
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
is to compete together with you.

367
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,510
And become champions together.

368
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,190
Termination fee.

369
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,470
I will think of a way too.

370
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
You guys don't have to worry.

371
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,020
Ah Xuan.

372
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,180
Ah Xuan.

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,900
Forget it.

374
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,140
You know about his temper too.

375
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,780
Let him calm down first.

376
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,980
We'll look for him again.

377
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
And discuss slowly.

378
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,290
Rascal, you really don't know how to speak nicely.

379
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm speaking the truth.

380
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,210
I wouldn't know if it's the truth?

381
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,880
You've all come down to send me off.

382
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't need to be so grand.

383
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,000
Shu Wen, don't leave.

384
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,800
Head up first.

385
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,520
And help big bro

386
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,640
clear the place.

387
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,520
You guys haven't met for so long.

388
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,360
The rest of you.

389
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,940
Be more obedient.

390
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,700
Leave quickly.

391
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,740
Leave.

392
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm leaving.

393
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,660
Return home quickly, bye bye.

394
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,580
Be careful of your safety.

395
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,820
If there's nothing else, I'll go too.

396
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,620
I'll go send master off.

397
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,500
Okay.

398
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,780
Master.

399
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,620
Travel slowly.

400
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,260
I've already watched this week's commentary.

401
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,220
Overall,

402
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,620
you've improved a lot compared to before.

403
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,460
Really?

404
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,260
I'm still worried that I

405
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,380
was too busy the past two days.

406
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,260
The commentary was a little rushed.

407
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,770
It's hard being captain right?

408
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,930
You have to learn a lot.

409
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,170
And still have to lead the whole team.

410
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,170
If you have anything you want to say,

411
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,570
you can ask me anytime.

412
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,710
Don't worry.

413
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,990
If the disciple has issues,

414
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,350
you, the master, can't run away.

415
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,030
Right.

416
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,390
The leakage incident.

417
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,430
I'm still investigating.

418
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,470
Once I have news,

419
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,190
I'll let you know firsthand.

420
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,590
Actually, whether or not it's investigated,

421
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,710
It doesn't matter anymore.

422
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,230
At least,

423
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,270
I got to meet such good friends.

424
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,550
The things I learnt at GDV,

425
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,190
will also be helpful for Xiang Kong and the team.

426
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,510
Okay.

427
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
Having a girlfriend like you,

428
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,580
Ji Xiang Kong is really blessed.

429
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,980
I'll leave first.

430
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,160
Sun ge.

431
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
It's getting late.

432
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,520
I'll leave first too.

433
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,600
Why are you laughing?

434
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,880
Wen jie, I'm leaving.

435
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,320
Sun ge, bye bye.

436
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,600
- Bye bye.

437
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Wen jie, bye bye.

438
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
Be careful of your safety.

439
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,950
Okay.

440
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,070
When you're home, let me know.

441
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,140
We're leaving.

442
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,410
Your group of bros.

443
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,050
All left one by one after eating.

444
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,850
I'll head upstairs and clear up for you.

445
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,950
Shu Wen.

446
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,550
Don't clean up anymore.

447
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,070
You're also tired now.

448
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,150
It's late.

449
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,220
I'll send you home.

450
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,460
What do you mean?

451
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,340
You're chasing me away?

452
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,340
No, I don't mean that.

453
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,940
In the afternoon,

454
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,580
didn't you say

455
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,780
you wanted to explain?

456
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,180
Then, tell me.

457
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,580
I want to listen now, speak.

458
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,010
I thought too simply back then.

459
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,610
I thought

460
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,130
after we were champions-

461
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,650
You still have the cheek to mention that?

462
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,200
Do you know

463
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,960
the night we became champions,

464
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
I cried for the whole night?

465
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,840
At that time, I was really upset deep down.

466
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,420
I was alone.

467
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,500
Alone outside.

468
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,380
Without you by my side,

469
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,140
what's the purpose of the championship?

470
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,380
Everyday that you were in Vancouver,

471
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,460
I know it all.

472
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,060
I asked someone to take care of you.

473
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,700
But until the end,

474
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,900
you're gone.

475
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,010
The moment I lost you,

476
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,130
I realised

477
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,530
I don't have a chance to find you again.

478
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,190
Shu Wen, sorry.

479
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,670
Do you still love me?

480
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,110
Throughout all these years,

481
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,510
other than you,

482
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,350
no one else has entered my heart again.

483
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,840
Sun Ze Yi.

484
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
You are a jerk.

485
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,460
Come.

486
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,340
Let's start.

487
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,250
Wait a minute.

488
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,850
What are all these?

489
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:03,970
It's very dirty here.

490
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,090
Thank you.

491
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,450
I don't need it.

492
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,160
Pei Xi.

493
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,800
Why not let's do this?

494
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
If you really think it's dirty here,

495
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
you can go to the yard outside.

496
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
And wait for us a little.

497
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,270
And once we're done cleaning,

498
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,990
then we'll call you in.

499
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,870
Okay?

500
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,710
No.

501
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,590
Okay.

502
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Xiang Kong.

503
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,180
Pei Xi is willing to be a training partner?

504
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,660
If not?

505
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Where would I get the ability?

506
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,260
But Pei Xi's ability

507
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,620
is highly anticipated.

508
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,220
In order to enter Phoenix,

509
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,620
he's even willing to be a training partner.

510
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,340
Yet, you don't want to accept him?

511
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,050
It's a pity that currently, he

512
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,970
isn't my best choice yet.

513
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,430
We're finally done.

514
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,390
I'm almost done here too.

515
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,550
Done cleaning up.

516
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,910
Food is ready.

517
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,030
Come down and eat.

518
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,390
I was wondering what smelt so nice.

519
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:20,990
I'm so hungry.

520
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,620
I feel like it's tasty.

521
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm excited.

522
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,900
Let's eat.

523
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,960
It smells good.

524
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,240
Delicious.

525
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,920
Thank you Xiang Kong.

526
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,840
For allowing me to return to this place.

527
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,270
Sun ge, why are you thanking me?

528
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,390
You belonged here originally.

529
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,750
Right, Sun ge.

530
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,990
Are you willing to room there for now?

531
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,420
Yes. I used to room there.

532
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,580
Okay.

533
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Then you'll still room there.

534
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,180
And then I'll stay

535
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,700
in the room beside the practice room.

536
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,460
Pei Xi, pick a room.

537
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,770
Where are you rooming?

538
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,370
Me?

539
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,730
I'm fine with anything.

540
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,050
I'll room beside Sun ge's room.

541
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,010
Okay.

542
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,970
Help me to shift a bed.

543
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,490
I'll room with him.

544
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,090
No.

545
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,090
Why are you rooming with me?

546
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,680
This way, Qiu Ying will be jealous.

547
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,160
That's right.

548
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,520
Okay.

549
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Then I'll move it myself.

550
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,680
I must stay with you.

551
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,520
Pei Xi.

552
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,230
I will be jealous that way.

553
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,870
This...

554
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,390
- Pei Xi.

555
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,390
Why's he rooming with me?

556
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,180
You're practicing?

557
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,420
Don't look at me.

558
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,740
I'll be nervous if you're watching.

559
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,380
Why are you doing that?

560
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
Ignited walking stick, how pretty.

561
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,330
It is pretty.

562
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,490
But it's useless.

563
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,050
It's more effective when multiplied.

564
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,450
You need at least three or more.

565
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,330
I don't care, what matter is that it's pretty.

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,280
Look, how pretty.

567
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,760
Like a firework.

568
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
You like fireworks?

569
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,060
Which girl wouldn't like that?

570
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,020
Everytime there's fireworks,

571
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,260
there's that feeling

572
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,300
as if the whole world is lighted for me.

573
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,420
Then right now,

574
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,540
don't you feel lighted?

575
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,310
Xia Ling,

576
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,390
when are we going to play Conquer together?

577
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,110
That's right.

578
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,030
You're a professional.

579
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,030
When will you carry us?

580
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,910
Son.

581
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,030
Are you hungry?

582
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,190
Come, eat something.

583
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,220
I'm not hungry.

584
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,940
How can you not be hungry?

585
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,700
You didn't eat much this afternoon.

586
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,820
Quick, be obedient.

587
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I want to be alone, is that okay?

588
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
What's wrong?

589
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,970
He still doesn't want to eat?

590
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,650
The transfer window

591
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,410
is left with less than a month

592
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,360
before it's closed.

593
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Let's find people quickly.

594
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,190
Actually, I feel that these few

595
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,390
are pretty good.

596
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,070
Why not

597
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,030
you guys reconsider them?

598
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,790
And they're all

599
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,550
the top few players in the country.

600
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,460
This.

601
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,260
Have already agreed to join us.

602
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
We'll reconsider.

603
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,900
Actually these people

604
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,340
aren't unique.

605
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,060
It's a suggestion, you don't have to listen.

606
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,580
But our current situation is

607
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,700
one,

608
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,130
we can't give them a satisfactory salary.

609
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,130
Two,

610
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,170
we're a new team.

611
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,930
Being able to attract the country's top players

612
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,010
is already pretty good.

613
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,480
If not,

614
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,680
call them and we'll try to match.

615
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,240
But I think what Pei Xi said is right.

616
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,800
These people aren't unique.

617
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,990
They're not the ones we're looking for.

618
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,620
That's right.

619
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,340
There's someone.

620
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,580
You might be interested in him.

621
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
Who?

622
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,140
Let's check.

623
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,420
ID 409.

624
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,490
In half a month, he rose quickly.

625
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,890
He's always winning.

626
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,290
Now he's 4th in China.

627
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,090
But,

628
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,370
this person is pretty mysterious.

629
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,610
Everytime I message him,

630
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,030
he doesn't answer me.

631
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,830
And no one knows his identity.

632
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,270
He's online.

633
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,270
Do a 1V1 with him.

634
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,710
Let me try.

635
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,150
Let's try with your account.

636
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,390
Anyway, everytime

637
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,270
I send him an invite,

638
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,390
he rejects me.

639
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,750
Let's wait and see.

640
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,150
He's willing to battle.

641
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,550
You're still more attractive.

642
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,430
Let's try playing a round with him.

643
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,340
He thought his outfit through.

644
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,020
exchange for experience.

645
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,020
At the start he used, draining items to

646
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,200
He's good.

647
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,320
Seems like he's something.

648
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,520
He's pretty good at 1V1.

649
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,760
And he's flexible in his dressing and weapons.

650
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,040
Has his own traps.

651
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,830
And he can steadily collect economy.

652
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,070
The results are good.

653
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,230
So easily defeated, you don't match Qiu Ying.

654
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,870
Looks like he's your fan.

655
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,220
Come,I'll talk to him.

656
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,540
Come.

657
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,620
Hello, 409.

658
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,010
I am Qiu Ying.

659
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,970
Let's wait and see.

660
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,170
409, I'm Qiu Ying.

661
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,050
Are you interested to meet up?

662
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,650
No.

663
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,250
He's not my fan too.

664
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,330
If I had the chance to meet him,

665
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,080
I definitely won't go easy.

666
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,400
I think he's pretty good.

667
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,120
Is there any way we can contact him?

668
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
I can try to find out at Dream Journey.

669
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,910
That's right, you can ask your brother.

670
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,350
He's not replying anymore.

671
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,190
Hello?

672
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,670
Ying Zi,

673
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,910
do you have time now?

674
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,420
I want to talk to you about Xia Ling.

675
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,740
What happened to Xia Ling?

676
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,540
What happened to Xia Ling?

677
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,580
Did something happen to his leg again?

678
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,820
Have a seat, let's talk.

679
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,450
What happened to him?

680
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,090
Yesterday, when we videocalled,

681
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,330
he said he was fine.

682
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,290
He was lying to you.

683
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,210
In future,

684
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,720
he can't play basketball anymore.

685
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,720
The main nerve on his calf is damaged.

686
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,560
He can not do any vigorous exercise anymore.

687
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
He's scared that you'll feel guilty.

688
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,960
So he didn't let me tell you.

689
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,540
Then,

690
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,740
how about walking on daily basis?

691
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,860
Walking on daily basis.

692
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,340
That shouldn't be a problem.

693
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,700
It's just that now,

694
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
he still has to use a crutch.

695
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,260
Does he have to use it for his entire life?

696
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,460
No.

697
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,500
The doctor already said

698
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,570
thankfully he's still young.

699
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,570
The recovery will be quick.

700
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,210
Now, what's most important is

701
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,990
there's issues with his attitude.

702
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,510
Issues with his attitude?

703
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,630
It's exactly like

704
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,870
he's completely changed.

705
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,630
He's hiding in his room everyday,

706
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,630
refusing to come out.

707
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,830
He talks less than three sentences with us daily.

708
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,390
His classmates came to look for him,

709
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,350
he refuses to meet them.

710
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,590
Me and your Auntie Xia are really worried.

711
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,350
We have no idea what to do now.

712
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,070
He's still so young.

713
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,510
He's suffering from the set back now

714
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,150
but what about in future?

715
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,900
I thought about it.

716
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,180
I'm afraid he'll only listen to

717
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,580
the things you say.

718
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,860
Why not you convince him?

719
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,160
I'll go now.

720
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,240
Don't go now.

721
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,400
Auntie Xia is at home.

722
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,160
Why not tomorrow?

723
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,280
Let me tell you, Ying Zi.

724
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,220
If you leave this house,

725
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,140
don't ever come back.

726
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,010
You're here.

727
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,090
Quickly come in.

728
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,910
Is Xia Ling awake?

729
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,390
He's at home.

730
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,110
How about this? You

731
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,630
can talk to him first.

732
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,950
I'll go out first.

733
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,180
How many times have I said

734
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,780
can you let me be alone-

735
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,860
Jie.

736
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,920
Why are you here?

737
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,600
Can I go in and have a talk with you?

738
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,200
Sure.

739
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,610
My leg is healing.

740
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,010
Can you stop acting strong?

741
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,760
Have you decided

742
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,080
to stay in this house forever?

743
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,640
Is it dad

744
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,600
who told you something again?

745
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,910
Xia Ling,

746
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,390
did you decide to keep it from me forever?

747
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,500
Jie, don't read too much into it.

748
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,940
I'm pretty good.

749
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,220
I know.

750
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,220
No matter how much I blame myself or feel guilty,

751
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,940
I can't change reality.

752
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,580
But I really hope

753
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,820
you can pull yourself together.

754
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,060
And change back to

755
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,980
the cheerful boy from before.

756
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:42,930
I will.

757
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,810
Don't worry.

758
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,210
How can I not worry when you're like this?

759
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,600
Right.

760
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,400
The tactic leakage incident,

761
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,480
has it been investigated?

762
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,260
The organising committee

763
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,740
is still investigating.

764
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,420
But I've already

765
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,700
resigned from GDV.

766
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,140
I formed a new team with Ji Xiang Kong.

767
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,620
You're playing Conquer too?

768
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,660
Why not

769
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
I bring you to see the new team.

770
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,650
Ji Xiang Kong and Pei Xi are all there.

771
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,810
If there's anything you don't know

772
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,970
you can ask them, okay?

773
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,470
No.

774
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,870
Someone with an injured leg like me,

775
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,630
can only cause more trouble.

776
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,150
Xia Ling.

777
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,150
Come, hurry.

778
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,220
I was still worried

779
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,060
it'll be cold if you came later.

780
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,380
I'll pour some vinegar for you.

781
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,700
I ordered your favourite Siew Mai.

782
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,840
Come let's eat.

783
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,320
How's it?

784
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,400
Have you talked to him?

785
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,280
He still shut himself in.

786
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,840
I wanted to bring him out.

787
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,440
But he's unwilling.

788
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
It's good enough that he even talks to you.

789
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,270
But don't be too worried.

790
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,790
Once I have time,

791
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:45,990
I will come and see him.

792
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,300
Did you resign from GDV?

793
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,170
How do you know?

794
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,650
The incident

795
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,370
was pretty popular online.

796
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,130
After you resign,

797
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,730
is it true you can't be a commentator anymore?

798
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,730
I'm forming a new team with Ji Xiang Kong now.

799
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,730
About the leakage incident.

800
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,800
I will definitely investigate it well.

801
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,120
Someday,

802
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,000
I will go back to commentating.

803
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,350
Then,

804
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,750
is Ji Xiang Kong your boyfriend?

805
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:43,940
Pretty good.

806
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,900
He feels pretty stable.

807
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,740
Different from what others say.

808
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,420
You're also at

809
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,700
an age where you should have a boyfriend.

810
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,980
In future, remember

811
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,850
observe more, personality is most important.

812
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,570
Got it.

813
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,400
I have to go get some vegetables.

814
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,920
Hurry, eat more.

815
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,400
I'm leaving.
