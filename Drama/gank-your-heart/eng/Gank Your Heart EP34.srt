00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,050
Leaving?

4
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,170
I'm leaving tomorrow.

5
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,730
The doctor said

6
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,050
Miya can discharge soon.

7
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,970
Go ahead with your competition.

8
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,030
I've promised Miya

9
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,870
if I were to enter the finals,

10
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,550
I will invite her to watch.

11
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,790
I will have to trouble you then.

12
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,790
Requested by Miya?

13
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,190
Tony?

14
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,470
Is that you?

15
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,230
I'll make a move first.

16
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,670
Take care of Miya.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Do you plan to..

18
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,110
cheat him forever?

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,430
You want me to hide the truth.

20
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,900
Alright then.

21
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,140
But have you achieved what you want?

22
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,780
I have got what I want.

23
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,420
Xiang Kong promised.

24
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,170
He will take care of me forever.

25
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,810
He chose to take care of you.

26
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,250
Not because he still loves you.

27
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,210
It was purely out of sympathy.

28
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,570
It's not sympathy!

29
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,850
I am left with nothing.

30
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,450
At least God returned Xiang Kong to me.

31
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,530
Stop lying to yourself,

32
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,210
can you?

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,570
If I knew your eyes have recovered,

34
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,050
he would have left you unhesitatingly.

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,080
He will not!

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Xiang Kong will never leave me.

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,760
You're not able to forget him.

38
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm able to understand.

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,600
You want to fight for your love.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,670
I will not stop you from doing that.

41
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,910
But do you know what are you doing right now?

42
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,670
You're trapping him selfishly.

43
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,820
If you can't win a championship,

44
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,460
don't ever look for me.

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,260
Heard that?

46
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,330
Do you know how strong are the North Americans this year?

47
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,250
Threaten me?

48
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,050
The competition has yet started.

49
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,170
Already feeling disheartened?

50
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,320
What a disgrace.

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,120
Who is disheartened?

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,480
I was just hoping you could

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
talk to me in a gentle tone.

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Gentle?

55
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,180
How to talk gently?

56
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,100
Gentle.. Just like how Qiu Ying talks.

57
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,460
Look at Qiu Ying.

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,380
Though she is strong and persistent,

59
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
but when Xiang Kong is around,

60
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,260
she was so gentle

61
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,100
and thoughtful.

62
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,820
What's the use of being gentle?

63
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
Say.

64
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,540
No matter how gentle Qiu Ying is,

65
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,420
she was still defeated by his ex-girlfriend.

66
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,610
Maybe they have seen too many idol dramas.

67
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,850
How beneficent.

68
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,850
They have not officially broke up.

69
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,890
Deep down, Xiang Kong is remorseful too.

70
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,250
He is remorseful?

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,390
I don't see that.

72
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,190
No sense of remorse.

73
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,670
He visited the hospital everyday.

74
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,830
How caring.

75
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,030
Ji Xiang Kong must be enjoying this.

76
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,830
Qiu Ying made the right choice.

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,910
Men are all a bunch of jerks!

78
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,910
In what way?

79
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,630
What do you mean by men are all jerks?

80
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,910
Yeah.

81
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,390
Men are not jerks.

82
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,350
Yeah right.

83
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,630
Lin Yi Xuan.

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,630
You.. You're a fool.

85
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,190
Lu Yi Yi..

86
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,780
You..

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,780
Why do you have such a strong prejudice against men?

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,100
Were you cheated by a jerk before?

89
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,400
You're the one who was cheated!

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,280
Did I just hit the jackpot?

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Lin Yi Xuan..

93
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,480
You can't drink better than me!

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah.

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I can't drink better than you.

96
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,750
This feels so good!

97
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,830
I'm so happy!

98
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,660
Uhm.. Qiu Ying said..

99
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,660
You have never dated a guy.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,740
Is that true?

101
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,010
Why? Looking down on me?

102
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,010
No..

103
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,850
Is it wrong to be single?

104
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,610
I'd never dare to look down on you.

105
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,650
I've never dated a girl.

106
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,600
We're on the same boat.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Equally pathetic.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Nope it's not that..

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,470
I have someone I like.

110
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,950
I.. I don't dare to confess.

111
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,470
Why don't you dare to confess?

112
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,740
I think I'm not good enough for her.

113
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,540
In what way?

114
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,020
I grew up in the countryside.

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,260
I've never attended university.

116
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,700
I..

117
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,820
She is better than me in every aspect.

118
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,620
Let your confession rot in your stomach then.

119
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,380
Don't ever confess.

120
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,610
But I want to confess..

121
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,010
Please don't.

122
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,690
If you confess your feelings,

123
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,210
she will be gone.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,120
She will block your contact number,

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,120
QQ, Weibo, Weixin account.

126
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,560
She will blacklist you.

127
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,740
Poof! Disappear and never found.

128
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,420
Disappear?

129
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,220
3 years..

130
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,740
I've been looking for him for 3 years.

131
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,500
I've been wanting to ask him.

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
If he doesn't like me,

133
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,100
why did he kiss me?

134
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,820
Since he kissed me,

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,500
why did he disappear?

136
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,340
Why did he disappear?!

137
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,130
Why?

138
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,570
He kissed you?

139
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,810
Yeah.

140
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,150
That was my first kiss.

141
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,310
He disappeared right after he kissed me.

142
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,710
Jerk.

143
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,190
Yes!

144
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,670
He is a jerk! Jerk!

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,110
I'm different from those guys.

146
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,190
If I kiss you,

147
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,270
I'll not hide away from you.

148
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,700
I don't believe!

149
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,680
Men are all the same.

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,000
All men are wolves.

151
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,760
I won't believe.

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
I don't believe in men!

153
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Do you not believe me?

154
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
I don't believe.

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,520
Lu Yiyi, I'm asking you again.

156
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Do you not believe me?

157
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,430
I've told you. I don't believe--

158
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,980
Lu Yiyi.

159
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,290
Lu Yiyi!

160
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,070
I can't do this..

161
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,020
[Block Lin Yi Xuan?]

162
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,300
Hi there.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,300
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

164
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,900
Why can't I get through?

165
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,780
Yiyi..

166
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,780
I've called you umpteen times.

167
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,220
Why aren't you picking up?

168
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,340
If you saw my missed calls,

169
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,850
return my call, okay?

170
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,210
She really blocked my Weixin?

171
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,110
She blocked my Weibo too?

172
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,270
It was just a kiss.

173
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,990
You really blocked me!

174
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,550
Are you still sleepy?

175
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,670
Talking in your dreams?

176
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,870
I woke up long ago.

177
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,870
Who did you kiss?

178
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,550
Was it Sister Yiyi?

179
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes.

180
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,060
I like her.

181
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,700
I wanted to confess after kissing her.

182
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,260
But my phone number

183
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,260
and all my social media accounts

184
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,260
were blocked by her.

185
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,640
She disappeared..

186
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,200
Ah Xuan. Being alive is

187
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
your greatest blessing after kissing her.

188
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,880
Let's go.

189
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,520
Let's go.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,760
Let's go..

191
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,370
Sister, how are you doing lately?

192
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,850
We're leaving soon.

193
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,290
See you at the hotel later.

194
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,070
If I kiss you,

195
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,910
I'll never hide away from you.

196
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,590
I don't believe--

197
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,780
Hello?

198
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,660
Hello? I know, he told me about it.

199
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,120
Yiyi, the materials you asked for.

200
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,200
Wait! Hang on, Xiao Liu!

201
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,800
Uh.. Let me ask you a question.

202
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,300
If someone blocks you,

203
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,260
can he still call you?

204
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
Blocks you?

205
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,860
You blocked me!

206
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,900
How am I supposed to call you?

207
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,340
- Yi Xuan? - Get lost!

208
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,700
Lu Yi Yi, you're heartless.

209
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
I said I won't disappear.

210
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Why did you block me?

211
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,420
It was my first kiss last night.

212
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,820
You.. Shut up!

213
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,220
I told you I'm not a jerk.

214
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,650
I'll be responsible of my actions.

215
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,290
Lin Yi Xuan, you're crazy!

216
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,170
It's just a kiss.

217
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,910
Do you have to announce it to the whole world?

218
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,470
I want to announce it to the whole world!

219
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,150
You kissed me.

220
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,830
You're my girlfriend.

221
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,230
If you are going avoid me--

222
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,710
I will give you her address.

223
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,350
Manager Shi said..

224
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,110
He will give me your address.

225
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,550
Manager Shi, you..

226
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,070
I didn't avoid you.

227
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,190
I simply just blocked you.

228
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,430
You..

229
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,870
Can't you just..

230
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:56,470
use someone else's phone and call me?

231
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,460
Makes sense.

232
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,340
Sense your head!

233
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,940
Some hitting me!

234
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,320
You're an idiot!

235
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,200
Stop fighting.

236
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,640
They're just bickering.

237
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,440
Don't intervere.

238
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,600
Take a photo with your phone.

239
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,560
Snap a photo proof.

240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Quick..

241
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
You did it on purpose.

242
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,640
I didn't.

243
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,160
You said it in front of everyone..

244
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,760
You're recording? Quick.. leave.

245
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,040
Leave!

246
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,760
- Leave.. - Don't look at us!

247
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,480
Quick! Move!

248
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
Stop hitting me!

249
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,390
What an adorable couple! I'm envious.

250
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,830
No matter how envious you get,

251
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,870
this isn't happening on you.

252
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,790
I think there should be a sequel.

253
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,590
Follow them.

254
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,030
Quick.. Take more photos.

255
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,460
We're depending on you!

256
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,540
- Quick! - Don't push me!

257
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
There were so many people watching us!

258
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,860
How can you say it?

259
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,930
There are just a few of them.

260
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,130
I'm leaving soon.

261
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,930
Not sad at all?

262
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,770
Oh right! You're leaving today!

263
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,570
They are waiting for me outside.

264
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,490
Why are you still here?

265
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,930
Get moving!

266
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,120
You won't disappear, right?

267
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,840
If you can't win the championship back--

268
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,710
Wait for me to back with the championship.

269
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,660
I'll wait for you to be back with the trophy!

270
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,700
♪ Time is passing slowly ♪

271
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,100
♪ A little more everyday ♪

272
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,940
♪ Romance ♪

273
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,240
Luo Tian. Qiu Ying.

274
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,360
No one is sitting here.

275
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,000
Sit here.

276
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,120
No.. I..

277
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,620
Xiao Wang is there!

278
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,860
I'm joining him.

279
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,180
Not gonna be a third wheel.

280
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,820
Dig in.

281
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,700
Right.

282
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,220
I've just got a news.

283
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,730
Phoenix members are on their way.

284
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,730
They should be reaching soon.

285
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:41,850
I know.

286
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,290
Xia Ling messaged me.

287
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,290
The script is more or less done.

288
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,470
Need a half-day leave?

289
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,710
Spend some time with the guys.

290
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,710
It's alright.

291
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm not done with the preparation.

292
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,390
Not much time left.

293
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,070
I'm done with my meal.

294
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,590
I'll be heading back to the hotel first.

295
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,150
Bye, Teacher Luo.

296
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,940
Qiu Ying?

297
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,920
Qiu Ying..

298
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,070
- Sister. - You have all arrived?

299
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,190
I've missed you, Sis.

300
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,430
I've missed all of you too.

301
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,780
You looked good.

302
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,380
Seems like things are going well.

303
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,490
Thanks, Sister Wen.

304
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,730
It's been tough on you all these while.

305
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,210
Not at all.

306
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,850
Uhm.. Qiu Ying..

307
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,930
All of us really missed you.

308
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,970
Especially Xiang Kong.

309
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,080
Oh yeah..

310
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
I.. I have a call to make.

311
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
I'll help you hold this first.

312
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,240
I'm off to make a call.

313
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,080
Everyone is tired.

314
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's head up to rest.

315
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,880
Let's go. We're heading up first.

316
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,790
Sis, I'm off.

317
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,740
I'll be off too.

318
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,500
Qiu Ying.

319
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,100
Are you doing well?

320
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
Pretty good.

321
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,300
Everyone treats me well.

322
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,010
Qiu Ying.. I..

323
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,290
I spoket to Coach Luo yesterday.

324
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,720
He says..

325
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
The opponent teams from North America are strong.

326
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,200
Legends might not even pass the preliminary round.

327
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
So.. The expectations

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
are solely dependent on Phoenix.

329
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
All the best.

330
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Qiu Ying..

331
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,380
I will never forget our promise.

332
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,980
Phoenix will definitely be the champion.

333
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
We will succeed internationally!

334
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,580
I'll wait for you at the finals.

335
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,060
I've got to prepare. Bye.

336
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,490
Bye.

337
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,560
Ladies and Gentlemen!

338
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Welcome to the 2019

339
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,630
International ICONQUER Championship!

340
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,790
I'm your host, Alan!

341
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,750
Hey! To all fans!

342
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,540
Do you still remember me?

343
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,580
I can feel their energy inside here tonight.

344
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,540
Ladies and Gentlemen! And it is electric!

345
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,250
There is a Chinese idiom called

346
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,050
"Elated to meet friends from a faraway place"

347
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,530
Being your host tonight,

348
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,690
Let's put our hands and welcome our fellow teams

349
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,610
and ICONQUER fans!

350
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,730
Welcome!

351
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,490
Yeah.

352
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,370
This is the first year where the International Championship

353
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,890
is being held in China

354
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,040
which is quite the honour.

355
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,320
That's right. Today's competition..

356
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,080
There are 16 teams from 24 different countries.

357
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,200
We have 2 teams from China namely the Phoenix and Legends.

358
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,630
This competition is

359
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,710
using the double elimination method

360
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,510
to find the ultimate champion.

361
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,470
I can't wait any longer.

362
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,940
Let's together witness this historical moment

363
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,900
Yeah!

364
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,260
I think that our teams are about ready to setup

365
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,260
on their final battles. Let's invite the first team out.

366
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,140
Can we please welcome with a big round of applause

367
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,980
Team Inception!

368
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,210
Let's welcome Inception!

369
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,490
Welcome on stage!

370
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,170
Welcome, Inception!

371
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,240
Next, let's welcome the team from China.

372
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,100
Legends!

373
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,660
Welcome Legends on the stage.

374
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,900
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

375
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,660
We're ready to start this thing off.

376
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,820
May the game officially begin!

377
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,660
The competition begins!

378
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,020
Both teams, please take your seats.

379
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,420
Gentlemen, please take your seats.

380
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,010
Legends and Inception are the first teams to kick the game started.

381
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,570
Both teams look stressed at the moment.

382
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,770
The winning team will challenge

383
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,450
the next winning team.

384
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,630
The defeated team will enter

385
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,190
the pre-eliminated category

386
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,990
to face another round of elimination.

387
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,350
Don't attack!

388
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,910
There are stamina left.

389
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,150
No worries. I can handle.

390
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,750
Congratulations to Inception!

391
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,150
Successfully advanced!

392
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,950
Inception is pretty strong.

393
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,940
Earlier,

394
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,020
Inception defeated the elite team, Tatan!

395
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,500
Unbelievable!

396
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,250
In the elimination round,

397
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,120
Legends and Tatan

398
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,640
are going through the tough battle.

399
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,950
Lin Yi Xuan!

400
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,310
It's okay.

401
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,470
It's only our first year.

402
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,230
Lin Yi Xuan!

403
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,790
We're good enough. Don't be depressed.

404
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,850
Sorry.

405
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,290
What is there to cry?

406
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,450
- Sorry. - What is there to cry?

407
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,880
I lost.

408
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,720
Are you not playing this anymore, Lu Feng?

409
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,360
Stand up! Buck up!

410
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,400
Not trying again next year?

411
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Given up in gaming?

412
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,070
What is there to cry? And you!

413
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,270
What is there to cry?

414
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,950
Xiang Kong.

415
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,270
I've really tried my best this time.

416
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,070
Next,

417
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,140
all depends on you guys.

418
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,500
Win the championship on our behalf.

419
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,140
Get up! Stand up!

420
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,660
Don't be embarrass! Stand up!

421
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,770
This grudge..

422
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,530
I'll definitely avenge this!

423
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,360
Count me in.

424
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Count me in too.

425
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,560
Me too.

426
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,360
Don't forget Legends' motto.

427
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,660
Legends! Never give up!

428
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,500
We can do it!

429
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,460
Attack!

430
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,820
Keep going, Phoenix!

431
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,210
Hang on. Wait for me.

432
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,210
Wait for me. Cooling time.

433
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,210
Attack now. Let's interchange.

434
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,490
Yes, attack!

435
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,410
Phoenix' performance is totally impressive!

436
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,470
Pei Xi and Xia Ling managed to kill the opponent.

437
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,270
We won!

438
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:04,150
Phoenix!

439
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,150
Xiang Kong won!

440
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,790
Really?

441
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,030
Look..

442
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,110
Attack!

443
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,990
Go go go!

444
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,790
Yes! That's the way!

445
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,430
Go go go!

446
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,110
Yes! Yes!

447
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,630
Won! Yes!

448
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm heading in front!

449
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,060
Control! Control!

450
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,540
Go go!

451
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,660
Pretty! Attack!

452
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,060
Push!

453
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,690
Lin Yi Xuan!

454
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Take care of your eyes.

455
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,120
Xiang Kong is winning this soon.

456
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Attack!

457
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,600
We're nearing!

458
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,680
Got it!

459
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Go!

460
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,040
Pretty!

461
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,880
Xia Ling! Go for it!

462
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Okay! Go go!

463
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,840
Nice shot!

464
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,780
Congratulations to Phoenix for being

465
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
the champion in the 'Winning' category!

466
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,940
Successfully eliminating to the finals!

467
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,410
Xiang Kong won again!

468
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,410
We can head there to watch the finals!

469
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,170
Are you sure about it?

470
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,290
Of course!

471
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,650
I've promised him.

472
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,450
I must see him win the championship in person.

473
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,330
Then tell him later.

474
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,890
Your eyes have recovered.

475
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,370
You will help me, right?

476
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Tony..

477
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,440
help me, will you?

478
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,990
Just once. I beg you.

479
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,270
Congrats to Phoenix for entering the finals!

480
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,780
They will be competing with the champion last year, Tatan!

481
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,860
Stay tuned to watch who will be the winner this year!

482
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,780
No way. Ji Xiang Kong..

483
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,500
I can't let them enter the finals easily.

484
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,900
What are you planning to do?

485
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,780
Get their reputation marred.

486
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,180
Distract their attention.

487
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,330
To get their mood affected.

488
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,850
To stop them from winning.

489
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,610
Are you crazy?

490
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,450
You're banned for a year.

491
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,210
If you were to make any mistake,

492
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,130
you might be blacklisted by ICONQUER.

493
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,520
I don't care.

494
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
I must stop them from winning!

495
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
Give me my handphone.

496
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,620
Qi Yue, let's not fight with them.

497
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,100
Have you gotten over it?

498
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,700
If it wasn't Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Yue,

499
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,100
we wouldn't have

500
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
ended up this way.

501
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,300
We can't blame anyone else.

502
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
Otherwise, who else?

503
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Blame ourselves.

504
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,380
I once thought

505
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,260
eliminating Qiu Ying, I'll be able to

506
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,420
achieve everything that I've wanted.

507
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,570
So I tried my best.

508
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,570
Through ruthless means.

509
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,970
Same for you.

510
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,810
For the sake of being the Captain,

511
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,030
you lost yourself.

512
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,910
In the past, status doesn't matter to me.

513
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,630
But only being the Captain

514
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,750
makes us a compatible pair.

515
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,590
Captain is just a status.

516
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,310
I'm in love with you, as a person.

517
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,710
All these while,

518
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,950
I've always wanted to be the first.

519
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,550
I just want to prove my capabilities.

520
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,190
I don't want to be look down.

521
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,460
Because I felt I wasn't a good fit for you if I weren't a Captain.

522
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,320
If there isn't me,

523
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,800
do you still want to be an e-gamer?

524
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,720
Gaming has always been my dream.

525
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,760
It wasn't for the sake of anything.

526
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,670
I just want to play the game right.

527
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,950
But I've nothing left now.

528
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,830
You still have me.

529
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,140
All these years,

530
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,860
the only thing that I've done it right

531
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,860
was being with you.

532
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,530
I have nothing now.

533
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,530
Are you really fine with that?

534
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,960
Qi Yue.

535
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,080
Let's start afresh.

536
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Shall we?

537
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,540
It's been ages since I've last seen you smiling this way.

538
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,220
Phoenix won.

539
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,700
Afterall, I used to be part of Phoenix.

540
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,940
It's been hard on Xiang Kong all these while.

541
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,890
Right. I'm meeting Shu Wen in awhile.

542
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,170
You.. Want to come along with me?

543
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,290
Show them some support.

544
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,560
I.. It's okay.

545
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,720
I don't want to disrupt them.

546
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,060
I... I will help you.

547
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,020
Sorry.

548
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,740
Hello?

549
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,620
Alright. Got it.

550
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,300
[Qiu Ying's internship pass]

551
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,060
Right.. Your internship pass.

552
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,210
When you ended your internship,

553
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,130
you left it on your desk.

554
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,890
I happened to see it so I kept it.

555
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,250
You can have it back.

556
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,730
Uhm.. Thank you.

557
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,350
How careless can I be.

558
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,070
Right! Luo Yang!

559
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,190
It's the International Finals tomorrow.

560
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,270
It's my first time hosting at such a grand stage.

561
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,510
I'd like more time to prepare.

562
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,510
You can head back first.

563
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,150
I'd like to head to the news centre in the afternoon.

564
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,950
To take a look at Phoenix's playback.

565
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,630
You don't have to.

566
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,510
You have prepared enough.

567
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,190
But Teacher Luo..

568
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,580
I'm still lacking alot.

569
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,140
Stop calling me Teacher.

570
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,580
You're my partner.

571
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,980
Since you are capable in coming this far,

572
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,640
don't let any irrelevant matters affect you.

573
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,120
But I..

574
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,040
Enough said.

575
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
Live narrators like us need a break too.

576
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,160
I'll treat you a meal tonight.

577
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,600
Just the both of us.

578
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,880
See you at the lobby an hour later.

579
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,960
I..

580
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,960
No rejections.

581
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,270
It's my birthday today.

582
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,510
Birthday?

583
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,710
Don't believe me?

584
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,470
No..

585
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,150
Alright then. I'll see you later.

586
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,340
I'm heading back first.

587
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,020
Let's go.

588
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,540
Do you think..

589
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,490
Luo Tian is going to confess to Qiu Ying tonight?

590
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,490
Most likely.

591
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,890
Luo Tian looked abnormal today.

592
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,490
Really?

593
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,930
They are indeed a compatible match.

594
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,370
Xiang Kong?

595
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,410
Are you here to look for Qiu Ying?

596
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,170
Just happen to pass by.

597
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
Wasn't it speculated on the Internet that

598
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,040
Fu Miya left the entertainment industry due to loss of sight,

599
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
Ji Xiang Kong took great care of her,

600
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
both parties have reconciled?

601
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,230
Why does it seems like

602
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,550
Ji Xiang Kong hasn't gotten over Qiu Ying?

603
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,990
I think Ji Xiang Kong still likes Qiu Ying.

604
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,300
Ji Xiang Kong broke up with Qiu Ying for the sake of his ex girlfriend.

605
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,340
Teacher Luo still stand a chance!

606
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,450
Enjoy your meal.

607
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,530
Thank you.

608
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,840
I hardly celebrate my birthday.

609
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,420
Especially,

610
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,420
celebrating my birthday with a girl.

611
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,740
Thank you for asking me to celebrate your birthday with you.

612
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,500
I know. You're trying to ease my tension

613
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,460
for tomorrow's competition.

614
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,220
Nope. I really..

615
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,900
want you to celebrate my birthday with me.

616
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,420
You're an extraordinary partner to me.

617
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,540
Right.

618
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,490
Happy birthday.

619
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,650
I thought you didn't know today is my birthday.

620
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,050
How did you get me a present?

621
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,330
I've prepared this a long time ago.

622
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,110
I didn't have a chance to give it to you.

623
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,910
Regarding the strategy leakage incident,

624
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,190
if it wasn't for you,

625
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,710
I wouldn't have cleared my name.

626
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,550
Today is a good oppurtunity to give this to you.

627
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,190
This is the first present I've received.

628
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,790
Thank you.

629
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,350
Because you don't celebrate your birthday.

630
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,710
That's why you don't receive presents.

631
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:28,220
I don't really like such things.

632
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,180
I don't like owing favours.

633
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,700
Rather than remembering the favours I owe,

634
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,100
it's better to think of

635
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,560
how should I get things done in a better way

636
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,080
and not seek help from others.

637
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,160
I.. should be someone

638
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,480
who is hard to get along with.

639
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,080
I'm strict and unappreciative.

640
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,520
Not at all. You're the best teacher to me.

641
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,320
Why are you calling me teacher again?

642
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,950
Of course!

643
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,550
Since 'The Next Big Thing',

644
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,710
to entering GTV,

645
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,550
you have taught me many things.

646
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,070
If it wasn't for you,

647
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,420
I wouldn't have improved so much.

648
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,940
Thank you, Teacher Luo.

649
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,010
But I..

650
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,370
I didn't want to be your teacher.

651
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,520
I want to take this opportunity to give you this present.

652
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,280
From tomorrow onwards,

653
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,750
I hope that you will not

654
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,430
see yourself as a student.

655
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,270
You are Qiu Ying.

656
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,990
ICONQUER's best female live narrator.

657
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,790
All the best.

658
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,940
I will do my best.

659
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,460
Do you think..

660
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,100
Luo Tian is going to confess to Qiu Ying tonight?

661
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,050
Most likely.

662
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,690
Luo Tian felt unusual today.

663
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,290
Really.

664
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,290
They are indeed a compatible match.

665
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,040
[Qiu Ying]

666
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,620
Free? Have a drink at the rooftop.

667
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,860
Happy birthday.

668
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,330
Birthdays are not meant for me.

669
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,670
Was Qiu Ying with you earlier?

670
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,150
Why do I sense jealousy?

671
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,750
It's just celebrating a Teacher's birthday.

672
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,470
What is there to be jealous of?

673
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,470
I can't seem to stop people

674
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,710
from calling me 'Teacher' today.

675
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,830
Honestly speaking,

676
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,350
I've wanted to woo Qiu Ying since a long time ago.

677
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,100
I've never expected that

678
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,020
you'd be a rival one day.

679
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,960
Right.

680
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,200
Because I've always believe that

681
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,600
you will make Qiu Ying happy.

682
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,520
Why?

683
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,310
Speechless?

684
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,340
Never did I expect

685
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,220
a teacher I have respected

686
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,420
would interfere in our relationship.

687
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,180
You're saying that..

688
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,410
your relationship with Qiu Ying can be easily interfered?

689
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,570
Qiu Ying has sacrificed so much for you.

690
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,690
But you?

691
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,730
You have hurt her endlessly because of Miya!

692
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,530
You have exposed her to all the gossips and rumours of public!

693
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,450
Ji Xiang Kong! Who do you love exactly?

694
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,290
It's none of your business.

695
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,650
If you're hurting Qiu Ying,

696
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,770
it concerns me!

697
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,120
Ji Xiang Kong.

698
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,720
Do you love Qiu Ying?

699
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,110
Of course, I love her.

700
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,630
I will always love her.

701
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,780
No matter who she chooses,

702
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,020
I will always love her.

703
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,020
Choice?

704
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,780
She has no one to choose.

705
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,170
You're her only choice.

706
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,570
You're right.

707
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,170
I've wanted to interfere your Qiu Ying's relationship with you.

708
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,480
Today..

709
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,080
I've wanted to confess to her.

710
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,920
But she never give me a chance to say it.

711
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,460
Don't be too glad about it.

712
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,780
I'm not letting it easy on you.

713
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,220
If you are hurting her with Miya,

714
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,700
even if I'll be rejected a million times,

715
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,140
I'm definitely going to make her mine.

716
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,660
Don't worry. I will clear things up with Miya.

717
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,740
I won't give you any chance.

718
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,620
No matter what,

719
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,770
I will never give up on Qiu Ying.

720
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,670
Do you know why did I bring you here?

721
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:49,830
Why?

722
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,230
To remind you about what happened

723
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,910
5 years ago.

724
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,270
5 years ago?

725
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,510
5 years ago!

726
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,230
We're here for a competition!

727
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,910
I was so stressed up.

728
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,310
You brought me here to calm me down.

729
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,660
We ended up sitting here for the entire night.

730
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,740
Have you forgotten?

731
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,460
I remember.

732
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,740
You don't remember!

733
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,260
Silly!

734
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,400
I remember everything I've done with you.

735
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,360
All these years,

736
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,120
I'm sorry.

737
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,780
From today onwards,

738
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,540
for what we have missed,

739
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,020
for what we have lost,

740
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,580
we must find them back.

741
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,730
The International Championship.

742
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,890
I will stay by your side till it gets to your hands.

743
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,480
That's our last chance.

744
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,640
We need to find a way around the shadow tactics

745
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,880
But the shadow tactics is unbeatable.

746
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,830
I don't give a shit!

747
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,510
We do it by tonight!

748
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,950
Otherwise, no one would get to sleep.

749
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,070
Understood? Huh?
