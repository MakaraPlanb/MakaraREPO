00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 6

2
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,300
When we practiced previously,

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,020
we always fought with Dragons.

4
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,220
How do we compete like this?

5
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,140
Yes.

6
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,700
Why are you freezing here? Go and ask.

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
I'll go find them.

8
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,570
No, there's no way we can win like this.

9
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,610
We already practiced the tactics.

10
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,410
Suddenly we're changing competitors.

11
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,570
we can't compete, we won't win.

12
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,410
Even if we compete, it'll be a waste.

13
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,290
Why did we come?

14
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,570
Manager Zhao, think of something.

15
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,290
I know.

16
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,190
Don't be nervous.

17
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,550
I told Wang Bin to arrange

18
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,470
and it became like this.

19
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,870
Don't be nervous.

20
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,270
I'll go and ask personally, okay?

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,190
Wait for my notification.

22
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,550
Manager Zhao, make the decision for us.

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,110
Okay.

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,630
We are relying on you.

25
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,430
We are trusting you.

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,750
You've worked hard, Manager Zhao.

27
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,950
Fighting.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,380
Hello everyone.

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,260
Welcome to everyone who has came.

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,500
Conquer's new advanced level

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,380
internal trial competition's site.

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,080
I am your host for today,

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
Luo Tian.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,120
I am Ah Can. Welcome everyone.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,240
Then, let's use our applause to welcome

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,600
the VNG team and Dragon team.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
Welcome.

38
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,030
Okay, then we shall announce

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,220
the commencement of the competition.

40
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,380
Let's welcome both teams' members to have a seat.

41
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,370
Lu Yi Yi, are you busy?

42
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,610
Nope, what happened Director?

43
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,650
Is there any urgent task?

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,770
If you're not busy,

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,570
then,

46
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,890
I'll let you handle the news of

47
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,970
Gu Fang quitting.

48
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,370
Really?

49
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,720
No problem, count on me.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,640
Don't be so excited.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,840
You don't need to go to the venue.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
You just need to contact the relevant staff

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
and those in the same industry.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
For this news report,

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,240
you just need to summarise the above,

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,230
and that'll be all.

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,030
Anyway,

58
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,310
we don't have a media invite.

59
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,870
We can't enter the venue too.

60
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,750
Just do this, it'll be okay.

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,180
The taste of this is not bad.

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
I'll take it away, thank you.

63
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,980
I didn't get it wrong right.

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,620
Gu Fang is holding a departure ceremony today.

65
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,540
You're telling me now.

66
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,170
Maybe, this is a good chance

67
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,690
heaven has given me and Qiu Ying.

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,820
How's the preparation over there now?

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,100
They're discussing tactics.

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,580
The past few days they've always

71
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,460
been researching how to battle the Dragon team.

72
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,020
Now I predict that even if they think till it's dusk,

73
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,020
they can't come up with a tactic.

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,500
I'll do it.

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,500
Let us see,

76
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,940
can Pei Xi's team get a quintuple kill.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,700
Quintuple kill, nice.

78
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,420
This is literally a miracle.

79
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,290
First wave, push up the crystal.

80
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,290
Nice, congratulations VNG for

81
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,770
winning the Dragon with a 2:1.

82
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,850
Taking down the first win.

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,270
Congratulations.

84
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,190
Deserving to be called "rising mid-solo star player".

85
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,790
These hands' speed doesn't lose to

86
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,550
Gu Fang at his peak.

87
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,070
Pei Xi will be my staff sooner or later.

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,430
That is for sure.

89
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,350
Manager Zhao, it's almost our turn soon.

90
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,070
You can just wait and see.

91
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,990
Now,

92
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,350
we can relax.

93
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,150
And prepare to face the next round well.

94
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Congratulations, Coach Shu Wen.

95
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,060
You guys won another round.

96
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
You're really the hero amongst women.

97
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,980
Fighting to you too.

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,880
Let's meet at Gu Fang's departure ceremony.

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,360
I won.

100
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,680
I know. And so?

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,680
So, you better not lose too.

102
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,870
I don't think you need to worry.

103
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,990
Okay.

104
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,270
Then let's meet at the finals.

105
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,590
I will persist until the end, see you at the finals.

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,100
Is he trying to challenge us?

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,490
Who cares about him? Let's go.

108
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,610
Let's go, fighting.

109
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,170
Fighting.

110
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,450
Next, let us welcome

111
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,490
the two teams,

112
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,890
Legends and New Land, please.

113
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay, we now announce

114
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,320
Conquer's new advanced level's

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,320
the second round of

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
internal trial competition

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,670
officially begins.

118
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,670
Let's invite both teams' members to have a seat.

119
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,950
Now we've entered

120
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,580
the route selection segment for both teams.

121
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,500
For this round, let's opt for speedy push.

122
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,900
Okay.

123
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,020
Okay.

124
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,580
Let's choose two heroes to push the towers.

125
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,020
Legends has chosen two-

126
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,540
Why did they choose two

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,780
two tower pushing heroes?

128
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,020
This is too risky.

129
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,420
Are they aiming for a speed push? Or?

130
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,700
You need to be quick for a speed push.

131
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,580
You should be more economical at the start.

132
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,010
New Land team is also good at development.

133
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,890
I don't know where Ji Xiang Kong

134
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,890
got his courage from.

135
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,090
Daring to challenge them at development.

136
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,770
Even if they're developed, so what?

137
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,450
Once they fail in pushing the tower,

138
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,960
the initiative will return to the opponent.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,680
This way, Ji Xiang Kong's

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,960
speed push tactic,

141
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,280
will completely go to waste.

142
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Li Nan, Lu Feng,

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,120
go to the wild area opposite,

144
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,920
let's do an ambush.

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,840
Okay.

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,620
I'll go over there now.

147
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,980
Ah Xuan,

148
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,020
take all of our gains,

149
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,580
Okay.

150
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,060
Yao Ge, be at the army line.

151
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,420
go to help at the wild area.

152
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,420
Once you're done there,

153
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,460
Okay, no problem.

154
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,020
Quickly develop everyone.

155
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,300
- Okay.

156
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,300
No problem.

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,580
Let's see, for Ji Xiang Kong's team

158
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,980
three members have come mid field

159
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,820
and preparing a surprise attack.

160
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
First blood, nice.

161
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,700
Legends did a nice job

162
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,820
at catching solo players.

163
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,820
And the new member, Li Nan,

164
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,500
cooperates with

165
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,020
great chemistry, in my opinion.

166
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,620
First blood and gains

167
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,900
have all been given to Lu Feng.

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,340
Lu Feng is also developing miraculously fast.

169
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,660
Yes.

170
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,500
Double kill, great.

171
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,650
Luck.

172
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,130
Don't say anymore.

173
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,290
This can be considered a dreamy starting right?

174
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,090
Yes.

175
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,290
Prepare to have a team battle.

176
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,210
This wave.

177
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,250
We definitely must keep the initiative.

178
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,090
Go.

179
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,130
My skills are trapped.

180
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,530
Evil, my best move is avoided

181
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,310
by Lu Feng.

182
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,270
Chase.

183
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:45,910
Press the tower.

184
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,030
Go.

185
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,190
Hold on.

186
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,710
- Hang on.

187
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,710
Retreat.

188
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,270
Okay.

189
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,270
Look.

190
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,070
Youngsters these days,

191
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,150
you have to give them a little pressure.

192
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,270
- That's right.

193
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,270
So they can 'run faster'.

194
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,470
Come.

195
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,510
Ji Xiang Kong guided the team well.

196
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,470
That's right.

197
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,260
At least, they started off well.

198
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
But according to what I know,

199
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,980
for this competition,

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,980
they have always thought

201
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,100
their opponent was Dragon.

202
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,580
Not being fearful on the spot,

203
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,420
only Ji Xiang Kong can do that.

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,880
No.

205
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
They amended the competition details,

206
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
and didn't inform everyone?

207
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,560
Is it because Zhao Yang

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
is too busy recently?

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,560
And he overlooked it.

210
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
I wish it was that case.

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Or else, the Legends team

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
will be in big trouble.

213
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
In that case,

214
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,470
I will personally ask him about this.

215
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,750
If he purposely did it,

216
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,910
I will definitely notify everyone.

217
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,780
Chairman Jin, I still think

218
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,260
Xiang Kong is the best choice

219
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
for the team leader position.

220
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
You're really affectionate

221
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
towards your disciple.

222
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,260
I understand this completely.

223
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,770
But everything

224
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,050
must be decided by the semi-finals.

225
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,090
Let's not talk about this.

226
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,250
It's your departure ceremony tonight.

227
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,930
You are the main lead.

228
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,490
I already followed your request,

229
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,210
and dismissed all the reporters.

230
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,370
Tonight,

231
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,930
there'll only be your industry friends.

232
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,760
After going through four teams'

233
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
intense battle,

234
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,120
let us congratulate

235
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,760
Legends and VNG,

236
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
the internal trial competition.

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
for being eligible to partake in

238
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Fox Zhao, bye bye.

239
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,270
At the same time,

240
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,350
I feel that today both teams,

241
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,590
did very well.

242
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,270
Be it Pei Xi's quintuple kill,

243
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,510
or Ji Shuai's tactics.

244
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,020
I feel that they both made the live audience,

245
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
really passionate.

246
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,020
Let me tell everyone another

247
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,900
good news.

248
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
That is Conquer's new heroes

249
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,780
will be meeting everyone

250
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,340
at the internal trial competition's

251
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,180
finals's competition site.

252
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,300
So, Ji handsome,

253
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,860
are you anticipating?

254
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,980
I already can't wait.

255
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,810
Then, let me ask Pei Xi too.

256
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,730
What about you?

257
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,610
I'm anticipating using the new heroes

258
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,170
to defeat Ji Xiang Kong on the finals.

259
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,880
Still that same sentence, I'll persist until the end.

260
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,320
The tension

261
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,060
is already strong from the start.

262
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,060
I believe that the finals

263
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,300
will be absolutely exciting.

264
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
So many people?

265
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,780
VNG is also here.

266
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,780
Security brother,

267
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,860
let us go in.

268
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Let us go in.

269
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Let us in.

270
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,210
Let us in.

271
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,490
Legends team.

272
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,530
The Legends team is here.

273
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,170
Ji handsome,

274
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,200
Ji handsome.

275
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,670
Lin Yi Xuan.

276
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,230
Ji handsome, Ji handsome.

277
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,910
So many people.

278
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,070
Let's go, have a look.

279
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,550
Go back.

280
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,790
We are not accepting interviews today.

281
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,870
What right do they have to not let us in?

282
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,870
This is a private gathering for Gu Fang.

283
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,310
You guys can't go in.

284
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,510
You brought me here,

285
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,630
because of Gu Fang's

286
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,550
departure ceremony?

287
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,630
The department handed Gu Fang's

288
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,950
departure ceremony's news to me.

289
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,830
I have to do well.

290
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,580
Besides, the people here today

291
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,700
are all famous people in the industry.

292
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,780
If you know a few,

293
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,060
it'll be beneficial, what do you think?

294
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Do you want to go in with me?

295
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
Isn't this bad?

296
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
What's bad about this?

297
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,640
You're scared that you'll meet

298
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Ji Xiang Kong, that cheater, right?

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,280
Why should I be scared of him?

300
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
Aren't we not supposed to not enter?

301
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,680
It's fine.

302
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm very familiar with this hotel.

303
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,280
I have solutions.

304
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,400
Follow me.

305
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,400
- Let us in.

306
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Where are we going?

307
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,160
Let us in.

308
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,150
Wait, have you acted before?

309
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,430
Acted once or twice.

310
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,590
Okay.

311
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,150
Heads up, chest out, don't be nervous.

312
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,860
Deep breaths.

313
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,900
Let's go.

314
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,660
What's with you?

315
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Gu Fang is already here, and you're only here now.

316
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,660
It's my first time handling such an important task.

317
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,420
It's your first day at work,

318
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
and you've already caused me so much trouble.

319
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,250
Sorry, boss. I'm wrong.

320
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,410
Did you bring the videos and details?

321
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,850
Yes, it's in my bag.

322
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,610
Hurry.

323
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,610
The screen is empty now.

324
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,850
What are you guys doing?

325
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,130
I already got scolded, did you not see?

326
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,930
Can you afford it if

327
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,570
the departure ceremony is delayed?

328
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,130
What kind of attitude are you giving?

329
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,690
Sorry brother.

330
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,570
There's really no time.

331
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,570
I'll educate her properly after this.

332
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,250
Can't you guys enter from the front door?

333
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:40,810
Let me tell you.

334
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,450
Your salary this month's gone.

335
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,490
Here.

336
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,440
Right.

337
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,440
Did you guys see

338
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
Fox Zhao's

339
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
expression earlier?

340
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,080
Xuan Ge, I didn't see it clearly just now.

341
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,350
Imitate it for us to see.

342
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,030
You didn't see?

343
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,270
- You're making me really angry.

344
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,270
Lu Feng.

345
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,270
Okay.

346
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,510
If Zhao Yang saw you,

347
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,630
I predict he'd definitely want a revenge.

348
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,150
I'm scared of him.

349
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,780
Kong Ge is going to support me.

350
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,100
Don't drag me in.

351
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,900
I don't want to

352
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,700
suffer his revenge with you.

353
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,780
We have different temperaments.

354
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:11,860
When did you

355
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,660
become so unloyal?

356
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,020
I can't be loyal when it comes to this.

357
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,180
So many people.

358
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,940
It's not time yet.

359
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,370
Let's wait outside for a while more.

360
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,250
Let's go walk around.

361
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,290
Let's go.

362
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,730
Come.

363
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,490
Let me tell you.

364
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,290
There's a mini kitchen here.

365
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,680
In a while, let's sneak in.

366
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,120
And then,

367
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,880
steal two uniforms out.

368
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,320
And sneak in.

369
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,200
I can gurantee no one will find out.

370
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,120
Can we?

371
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,000
Believe me.

372
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
When did I ever get you into trouble?

373
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Let's go.

374
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,260
Let me tell you.

375
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,500
Gu Fang's departure ceremony today

376
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,500
can't have any problems.

377
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,180
If you dare to make another mistake,

378
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,540
I'll ask you to go home.

379
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,300
And don't come back again.

380
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,020
You useless thing.

381
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,820
Okay, boss.

382
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,460
Let's go.

383
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,820
It's so pain.

384
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
I was acting.

385
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,020
Let's go.

386
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,370
You're good.

387
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,470
When did you learn that?

388
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,990
I'll tell you when we get back.

389
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,150
Do you see it? The uniform is there.

390
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,990
There should be no one now.

391
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,350
Let's go.

392
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,430
We're getting the clothes.

393
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,430
What are you two doing?

394
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,790
Stomachache.

395
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,870
- What are you two doing?

396
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,870
Stomachache.

397
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,950
We can't hold it anymore, stomachache.

398
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,710
We were looking for the washroom.

399
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,870
Stomachache.

400
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,630
You two ladies

401
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,390
were looking for the washroom in the kitchen?

402
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,070
We don't know the way.

403
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,830
Go upstairs to find it.

404
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,630
Leave quickly.

405
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,260
Thank you.

406
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,020
Let's go.

407
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,900
I can't hold it in anymore.

408
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,880
You, go take the clothes.

409
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Me?

410
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
Go.

411
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,120
Go.

412
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
Brother,

413
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,600
I really can't find the washroom.

414
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,960
Sister, why are you back again?

415
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,280
I let you go.

416
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,280
You know too,

417
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Out of ten girls, eight to nine of them

418
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,280
are bad at directions.

419
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,470
Okay.

420
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,870
Do you have pen and paper?

421
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,710
Yes.

422
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,670
Let's find a place with better lighting.

423
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,420
Come.

424
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,100
Do you see it?

425
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,860
What's the situation?

426
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,540
There seems to be mice here.

427
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,740
What's going on?

428
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,740
There's mice here?

429
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,540
No.

430
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,370
Finish the drawing.

431
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,170
I have to go have a look.

432
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,930
Once you finish drawing,

433
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,730
I'll help you catch.

434
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,490
Do you see it?

435
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,690
Go out, turn right, do you see it?

436
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,810
Go all the way to the end.

437
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,450
And then, turn right again.

438
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,130
Walk to the end and turn right again.

439
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,690
- That's not right.

440
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,690
And we're back?

441
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,320
You made me

442
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,080
confused.

443
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
I made you confused?

444
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Look.

445
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,720
I remember it now.

446
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,760
- Thank you, brother.

447
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,760
Go out and turn right.

448
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,350
I remember it now.

449
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,070
Sister, don't go.

450
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,270
I haven't finished telling you.

451
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,470
Go out, turn right and right again.

452
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,470
Okay.

453
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,710
Go.

454
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,900
This sister is really weird.

455
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,220
Scared me to death.

456
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,540
You still have the audacity to talk about me.

457
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,460
Your acting isn't that good either.

458
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,660
But didn't we succeed?

459
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Let's go, find the venue.

460
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,980
Let's go.

461
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,980
- Hurry.

462
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,980
So stylish.

463
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,610
Why's this so heavy?

464
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,130
Exert more force.

465
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,880
Go.

466
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,560
Go this way, be careful.

467
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
So many people.

468
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,820
It's so pretty.

469
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,940
Yes, I want to take a few pictures.

470
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,300
Be careful.

471
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:16,980
No problem.

472
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,380
Come.

473
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,820
Chairman Jin.

474
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,260
Chairman Jin.

475
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,340
Congratulations.

476
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,660
Congratulations.

477
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Okay, you guys continue talking.

478
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,740
I'll sit them down first.

479
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,460
Okay.

480
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,660
Here, this way please.

481
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,100
Ever since,

482
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,860
we won the championship,

483
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,340
I started doing commentary,

484
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,730
Summer opened Dream Journey internet cafe.

485
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,530
Li Gan and Shu Wen

486
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,530
have both become coaches.

487
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,810
They formed VNG.

488
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,290
Only you were still competing.

489
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,530
It's a pity that now...

490
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,270
Actually, I've always still wanted to see

491
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,630
your holy spirit princess

492
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,870
showing great power.

493
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,670
been constantly updating.

494
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,670
In the recent years, the games have

495
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,950
This hero

496
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,070
is already reduced to nothing.

497
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,590
This also means

498
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,070
I may never be able to

499
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,310
come back to Conquer forever.

500
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,030
Look over there, Gu Fang, Luo Tian.

501
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,830
I've seen them before.

502
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,910
Then look over here.

503
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,740
Shu Wen, Summer, Li Gan.

504
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,740
They're the top five players to found this.

505
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,220
They are all here today.

506
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,580
You're good.

507
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,500
Came to work for a few days,

508
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,160
you already know who started?

509
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,960
Of course.

510
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,920
But,

511
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You were only half right.

512
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,800
The original

513
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,400
ancient top five players

514
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,800
are Gu Fang, Luo Tian, Summer,

515
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
Shu Wen and Sun Ze Yi.

516
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,520
Wait a minute, who's Sun Ze Yi?

517
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
This Sun Ze Yi,

518
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,950
very little people know of him now.

519
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,430
He was one of the founders previously,

520
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,430
he was the team's commander.

521
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,950
Four years ago, which means,

522
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,070
The year they became champion.

523
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,470
Before the competition, he suddenly

524
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,900
quit without a reason.

525
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,740
They replaced him with Li Gan.

526
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,020
So,

527
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,540
and the world remembered Li Gan.

528
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,020
And forgot Sun Ze Yi.

529
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,490
There's actually such a thing...

530
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,210
Then do you think Sun Ze Yi

531
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:14,810
came?

532
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,570
Where is he?

533
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,850
He didn't and he won't.

534
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,130
He already disappeared

535
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,810
from the public's eye for a long time.

536
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,810
What are you guys doing? Serve the wine.

537
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,170
Okay.

538
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,360
Scared me to death.

539
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,200
It's okay.

540
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Yi Yi.

541
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
Everyone at that table knows me.

542
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,430
It's okay.

543
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,190
Lower your head and push, I'll serve.

544
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,150
Anyway, they don't know me.

545
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,310
Then, block me a little.

546
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,550
Stop looking.

547
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,140
Don't look.

548
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,620
- Leader.

549
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,740
Teacher Luo, leader.

550
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,980
Still calling me leader?

551
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,540
No matter when it is,

552
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
you're still our leader.

553
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,540
I heard that right now you

554
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,060
are the stand in leader for Legends.

555
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,660
Fighting, I think highly of you.

556
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,420
Thank you Teacher Luo.

557
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,660
Xiang Kong,

558
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,850
you guys fought well for today's round.

559
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,970
Since I already made the decision,

560
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,570
then I must persist till the end.

561
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,850
Ji Xiang Kong.

562
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,400
Ji- let's go.

563
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,280
When you guys have an event to celebrate,

564
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,680
I will help you guys out if necessary.

565
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
It's not cheap right?

566
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,680
Money is trivial matter.

567
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
But, why didn't you two

568
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
go to Dream Journey internet cafe to have a look?

569
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,980
Now, I feel that meeting you guys

570
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,460
are harder than meeting celebrities.

571
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,100
When the competition is over,

572
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,340
we will definitely visit your place.

573
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,180
Okay, I know you guys are busy.

574
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,300
Ever since we disbanded,

575
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,700
the both of you built VNG

576
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,060
empty handed.

577
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,660
Being able to get these type of results today,

578
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
It's really not easy, really.

579
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,140
Come, have a drink, come.

580
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,140
You're so happy.

581
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,140
What are you guys talking about?

582
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,930
It's so crowded today.

583
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,490
Why didn't I see Pei Xi?

584
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,930
My cousin firstly, doesn't fit in.

585
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,290
Manager Zhao.

586
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,510
You care so much for Pei Xi,

587
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,990
you're not trying to take our ace right?

588
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,990
Listen to what you've said, Shu Wen.

589
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,510
I'm the type to cherish talents.

590
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,310
I especially like

591
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,750
players like Pei Xi.

592
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,590
At first I was looking for opportunities

593
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,310
Am I right?

594
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,310
to understand and get to know Pei Xi.

595
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,110
Besides,

596
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,350
Coach Shu Wen, who dares to

597
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,510
recruit your ace?

598
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,630
I wouldn't dare.

599
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,030
Is that right?

600
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,670
You guys continue talking,

601
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,860
I'll go ahead and be busy.

602
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Chat.

603
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,860
Come.

604
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,640
Pei Xi is who we've

605
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,800
trained from the start.

606
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,560
How dare Old Zhao think of this?

607
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,760
This Zhao Yang.

608
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,760
Is becoming more and more obvious.

609
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,760
Whether or not Pei Xi joins Legends,

610
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,760
I can't make the decision.

611
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Kids these days,

612
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,350
aren't as obedient as us before.

613
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,350
Besides, I'm only a cousin.

614
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,710
It's useless.

615
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,950
This Zhao Yang,

616
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,470
is well known for doing things improperly.

617
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
You two ought to pay attention.

618
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,140
What do you guys think

619
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,660
the results will be

620
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
if Pei Xi pairs up with Ji Xiang Kong?

621
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,250
Should be pretty spectacular.

622
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,130
No, from the way you phrased it,

623
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,330
do you want to recruit Legends's ace?

624
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,010
What are you saying? Two years ago,

625
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,570
if you weren't so quick and a move first

626
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,210
Ji Xiang Kong

627
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,050
would be VNG's member.

628
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,930
Whether it's good or not,

629
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,050
he won't join you guys.

630
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,410
Okay.

631
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,290
You've already retired.

632
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,050
Okay.

633
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,570
Why do you still care so much?

634
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,050
Let's go to the table.

635
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,120
Come.

636
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,640
Scared me to death.

637
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,830
That Summer,

638
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,190
is still half your enemy.

639
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,950
I don't even know him.

640
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,190
What hatred do I have with him?

641
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,190
That Ti Qiao Xin,

642
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,900
is chasing your Pei Xi everywhere.

643
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,900
Is she your enemy?

644
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,740
He's Pei Xi's cousin.

645
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,820
You know quite a lot don't you?

646
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,940
Let me introduce, this is-

647
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,100
Oh my god, look.

648
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,930
What are you thinking of?

649
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,890
Thinking about Sun Ge.

650
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
Logical.

651
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,760
We're just missing him now.

652
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,960
Give him a call.

653
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,840
Ask him to come over.

654
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,560
Why not I give it a try?

655
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Call.

656
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,820
Water for you two.

657
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,260
Sun Ge, my computer is a little laggy.

658
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,100
Let me have a look.

659
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,100
[Ji Xiang Kong]

660
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,260
You switched on all the special effects.

661
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,780
Our computer can't support that.

662
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,060
Sun Ge,

663
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,580
are you coming to leader's departure ceremony?

664
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,460
We're just missing you.

665
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
It's still okay, hurry.

666
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,100
Yi Ge and the rest are all here.

667
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,180
We're just missing you.

668
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,890
I'll send the location to you. Hurry.

669
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,810
Sun Ge, come over for a while.

670
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,410
Okay.

671
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,710
Isn't this Legends who are second place?

672
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,350
Battleground's fake winner, right?

673
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,190
What's up?

674
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,350
Why did you guys organise it so extravagantly?

675
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,590
You really think you're the champion?

676
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,950
Yi Xuan.

677
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,310
What's wrong? We can have a talk outside.

678
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,430
Sit down.

679
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,910
As a support, you are pretty arrogant。

680
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,190
Look opposite.

681
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,310
Four supports.

682
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,390
Do you think you can win?

683
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,990
Bad hands.

684
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,870
My master is here.

685
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,750
I won't argue with you today.

686
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,390
Who's this?

687
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,990
A new assistant you guys found?

688
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
I've seen your VNG competition before.

689
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,100
Only Pei Xi is worth anticipating.

690
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,540
Repeat that one more time.

691
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,780
Don't need to mention Pei Xi.

692
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,820
When he's not here, I'm the senior.

693
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,860
If you have anything to say, tell me.

694
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Don't have to mention Pei Xi.

695
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,920
- Disrespectful.

696
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,920
This is?

697
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,520
Do you know why Legends lost?

698
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,280
Talking too much.

699
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,880
And this is?

700
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,000
Double moon team, have you never heard before?

701
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Remember well.

702
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,120
Shen Yue Yue, Qi Yue Yue

703
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
Double moon team.

704
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,400
Nobody can win them.

705
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,950
Double moon.

706
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,830
Okay.

707
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,830
I particularly hate people who only know how to talk.

708
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,230
If you have the skills, we'll meet on battleground.

709
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,870
Lin Yi Xuan, toast to you.

710
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,580
I remembered you.

711
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,300
Ladies and gentlemen.

712
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,420
Good evening everyone.

713
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,730
I am today's host, Luo Tian.

714
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,610
Welcome everyone

715
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,130
to my bestest bro,

716
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,730
Gu Fang's departure ceremony.

717
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,330
Four years ago,

718
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,890
because of Gu Fang's

719
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,410
holy spirit princess,

720
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,290
he saved us from a desperate situation

721
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,290
in Vancouver.

722
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,210
and allowed us, the founders,

723
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,290
to win the first champion that belongs to China.

724
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,040
Four years later, this last hero,

725
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,480
has also chosen to quit.

726
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,520
China's top gaming commentator.

727
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,830
This name is truly well deserved.

728
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,990
That's of course, he's too handsome.

729
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,350
We practiced together,

730
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,710
I want to go over there and take two photos.

731
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,670
I'll go over there alone first.

732
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,420
You be careful.

733
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,420
Okay, you be careful too.

734
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,260
Okay.

735
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,500
Today, the last warrior

736
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,060
is also choosing to quit.

737
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
As a good friend,

738
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,460
I sincerely feel happy for you.

739
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,940
But as a professional commentator,

740
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,740
I feel regretful.

741
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,860
Because from now on,

742
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,530
at Conquer's competitions,

743
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,010
we lost another top summoner.

744
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,330
I won't say too many mushy words.

745
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,770
Let's invite tonight's main lead,

746
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,240
Gu Fang.

747
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Okay.

748
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,400
Hurry and go.

749
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
Go. Hurry.

750
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
I wasn't prepared.

751
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,620
Good evening everyone.

752
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,220
I didn't expect so many people to come.

753
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
I also didn't expect Summer

754
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,980
departure ceremony.

755
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,980
to be able to organise such an extravagant

756
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,010
At first, I thought there'd be only three to five people.

757
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,290
Eat some melon seeds, talk and we're done.

758
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,530
Everyone knows

759
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,870
My first team was the founders.

760
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,110
We chose this name

761
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,350
because we're the founders with a gaming dream.

762
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,870
There's fans who sneaked in for pictures.

763
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,710
Go have a look.

764
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,230
Everyone thought that

765
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,710
we are a group of crazy kids who

766
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,710
hobbies as entertainment.

767
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,710
didn't do honest work and only had

768
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,150
But, we didn't give up.

769
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,790
Although we weren't sponsored or supported,

770
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,150
in order to save money, the few of us

771
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,270
shared a bowl of noodles.

772
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,860
We laid mats outside the venue

773
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,340
but I was still happy in the process.

774
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,980
Because deep down we know

775
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,020
the path we take,

776
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,040
is the path to our dreams.

777
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,440
You really know how to find places.

778
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
It's you?!

779
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
Us, this group of youngsters gathered together.

780
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Since we're familiar,

781
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
Hurry and give it to me.

782
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
let's not beat around the bush.

783
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
If not I'll call the security.

784
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,040
I remember you said you won't hit women right?

785
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
Why? Do you still want to hit me?

786
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,240
Quick, give it to me, hurry.

787
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,430
Hurry.

788
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,230
No, why would I want to hit you, right?

789
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,470
Gu Fang cried.

790
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,070
Actually, we didn't have our thoughts.

791
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,710
Wait.

792
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,260
We just weren't satisfied with losing.

793
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,180
We hoped that someday,

794
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,300
we could stand on a worldwide stage.

795
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,570
we are from China.

796
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,570
And say loudly and proudly,

797
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,850
Good.

798
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,810
I'm very honoured we did it.

799
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,170
Everyone who is sitted here today,

800
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,650
and those who aren't.

801
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,650
Those that aren't satisfied with losing.

802
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,600
I believe,

803
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
we will remember yesterday's dreams.

804
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,080
Helping our country to receive such high glory.

805
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,270
Don't forget your intentions, chase your dreams boldly.

806
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,310
Creating extremes continuously.

807
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,950
Stand at the top of the world,

808
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,430
this is our calling.

809
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,340
Come, lets raise our glasses.

810
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,820
Wishing today's version of you will be better.

811
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,220
Wishing for China's team to have a better future.

812
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,170
Okay. Cheers.

813
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,250
Finish it.

814
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,740
If you don't want to be embarassed,

815
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,700
follow me right now.

816
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,980
Stand there.

817
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,260
I have no energy anymore.

818
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,300
You're still running when you have no energy?

819
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,780
Don't run.

820
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,250
If you continue chasing me, I'll call the police.

821
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,290
No use calling the police.

822
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,590
Brother, do you need to go to this extent?

823
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,750
Even if I didn't hide in the female's toilet,

824
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,190
do you dare to search my body?

825
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,750
A girl's body?

826
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,510
Search. I definitely won't search you.

827
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,150
But if you don't give me the photos today,

828
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,350
I'll stay here and consume your time.

829
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,590
You.

830
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,590
Hooligan.

831
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,390
Excuse me.

832
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,470
You.

833
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,820
It's just a few pictures. Do you have to do this?

834
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,140
Do I have to do this?

835
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,340
My leader told me

836
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,340
he wanted to quit quietly.

837
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
He doesn't want outsiders to know.

838
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,000
What the.

839
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,360
If the pictures are out, I take the blame.

840
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,240
Tell me if I have to do this.

841
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,760
Brother. How about this?

842
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,080
Just treat it as you didn't see me today.

843
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,960
Look, if I don't say, no one knows, right?

844
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
Once it's done, I'll treat you to a meal.

845
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,080
So nice.

846
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,470
No.

847
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,670
Let go. I can walk by myself.

848
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,630
Let me go.

849
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,750
It seems like not only your acting is exaggerated,

850
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,150
you're also thick skinned.

851
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,460
Ji Xiang Kong, don't be too overboard.

852
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm overboard?

853
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,460
If you weren't caught by me,

854
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,700
your live stream tonight would top again.

855
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,530
you didn't know it's a private gathering today.

856
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,530
Don't tell me,

857
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,650
Give your phone to me.

858
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,810
I didn't take photos neither streamed.

859
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,010
Look at it yourself.

860
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,890
Do you think I'll believe you?

861
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Have you seen enough?

862
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,840
Do you still have anything?

863
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,230
Don't let me see you again.

864
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,590
Ji Xiang Kong, I'll prove it to you sooner or later.

865
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,980
So, you say, if I lose my job again,

866
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,660
then I'm too useless.

867
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,740
No, listen to me.

868
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,810
I have to go back to sending deliveries.

869
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,810
If the pictures are out,

870
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,810
Let's understand each other shall we?

871
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,570
I feel really bad now.

872
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,690
How about this,

873
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,320
let me quieten down alone.

874
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,920
Let's discuss after you're done okay?

875
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,520
I'll quieten down alone, I'm okay.

876
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
Are you okay alone?

877
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,920
Yes, don't worry.

878
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,220
I can handle alone.

879
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,580
So pitiful, I nearly cried.

880
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,740
Kong Ge, that-

881
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,540
I pity you.

882
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,660
But pass the pictures over.

883
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,180
You.

884
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,570
Shu Wen.

885
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,250
I'll go make a call first.

886
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,710
You.

887
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,830
Such a serious thing, you made it so simple.

888
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,670
I've already quit.

889
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,150
What's there to be serious?

890
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,390
No one understands Lao Gu's thoughts.

891
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,830
Do we not understand?

892
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,430
His heart is still heavier than everyone else.

893
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,700
it's already a beautiful ending.

894
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,700
To be able to persist till today,

895
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Right. Let's drink together.

896
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,880
Come, take a glass of wine for me.

897
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,800
Come, celebrate the founders.

898
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,160
Celebrating the glorious departure of our last warrior.

899
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,640
Come, congratulations.

900
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,240
Thanks everyone.

901
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,190
We're only missing Lao Sun today.

902
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,910
Did he reply you?

903
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,030
Replied.

904
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,350
What'd he say?

905
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,820
What can he say?

906
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,100
He's just busy.

907
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,580
He has no time.

908
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,260
I can understand.

909
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,970
He can't hire someone to work at the internet cafe,

910
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,970
so he's looking after it himself.

911
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,130
If he doesn't come, how about we go find him?

912
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,570
Good idea.

913
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,970
It's been so many years, we should go have a look.

914
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,010
Yes.

915
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,730
The team has things on, I'll go soon.

916
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,730
I can't make it today.

917
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Can we not miss anyone?

918
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,880
Don't mess around, the team has things on.

919
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,360
No energy.

920
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,950
- Wen Jie.

921
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,950
Wen Jie.

922
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,430
Xiang Kong. Take care of your leader.

923
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,190
I'll leave you first.

924
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,620
You all work hard.

925
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,020
Let's meet at the competition.

926
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,500
Wen Jie, let's meet at the competition.

927
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,260
Bye bye Wen Jie. Bye.

928
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,340
Why are you looking at me?

929
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,500
I said the wrong thing.

930
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,850
Obviously.

931
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,850
I-

932
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,130
Leader, why don't we leave too?

933
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,250
Okay.

934
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,560
can't forget the past,

935
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,560
Forget it. Seems like the one who

936
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,320
is not only Lao Sun alone.

937
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,840
Let's go to Dream Journey internet cafe.

938
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Go.
