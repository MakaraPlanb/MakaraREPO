[Episode 27]

3
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,290
Ji Xiang Kong.

4
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,130
Qiu Ying.

5
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,650
How... how are you?

6
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,350
Why did you faint suddenly?

7
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,950
Are you feeling better now?

8
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,670
Fainted? I didn't faint.

9
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,990
You see, I'm fine here.

10
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,910
Who did you hear from?

11
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,110
Qiao Xin.

12
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,230
Stupid.

13
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,830
You believed what she said?

14
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,710
It's good that you're fine.

15
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,870
I'll leave first.

16
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,940
Sorry.

17
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,900
Its all because of

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,180
that you're aggrieved

19
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
but don't leave me

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,180
and ignore me okay?

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,920
Don't say sorry to me already.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,280
We...

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
We shall not bother each other.

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
I don't believe.

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
I don't believe you can do it.

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,600
Why is it that

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,680
you're so anxious just now?

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,520
Ji Xiang Kong, let go of me.

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,520
Let go.

30
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,510
Qiu Ying.

31
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,310
Qiu Ying, listen to me.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,670
I like you.

33
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,670
I didn't take you

34
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,270
as anyone's replacement.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,380
I don't know

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,780
since when it started,

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,620
probably when

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,900
you're on the star's tomorrow's stage,

39
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,620
probably its that night

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,220
when you're drunk at the convenience store.

41
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,180
Didn't we agreed on

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,610
to rise to the top of the world together?

43
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,530
Don't leave me.

44
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,530
You know that I like you.

45
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,530
Long before,

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,010
I already like you

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,200
but

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,160
I don't know what am I now.

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,000
You and Mi Ya...

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Mi Ya and I is already over.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Believe me.

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,230
Give me some time,

53
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,350
I will settle it properly.

54
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,150
But now,

55
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,190
the whole world knows

56
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,350
that you guys are together.

57
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,710
How do you end it just like that?

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,150
What do you want me to do?

59
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,220
Ji Xiang Kong,

60
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,140
I cannot be compared to Mi Ya.

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,580
We have never started before,

62
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,770
just end it like this.

63
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,100
I have never seen

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,860
you so serious

65
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,020
to someone,

66
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,020
what's more its a

67
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,780
newcomer commentary.

68
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,700
Teacher Luo,

69
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,500
this is all my commentary,

70
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,700
please advise me.

71
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,500
Hurry and go back.

72
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,900
Thank you Teacher Luo.

73
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,190
Qiu Ying,

74
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,550
you have already absolutely gave up.

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
You already rejected him.

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,760
He is then a match with Mi Ya.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Don't be stupid already.

78
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,910
If you want to cry, just cry it out.

79
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,910
You'll be fine after crying.

80
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,140
Teacher Luo,

81
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,580
don't worry.

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,530
I will adjust my emotions properly,

83
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,850
I wouldn't affect my job.

84
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,530
Hope this is the last time

85
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,130
I'll see you cry.

86
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,440
Are you okay?

87
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm fine.

88
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,580
Let's start.

89
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,540
We'll wait awhile for Sister Wen.

90
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,460
No need.

91
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,860
Okay, let's start.

92
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,250
Tomorrow,

93
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,250
what's different about the Team Xiao Long

94
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,810
that we are competing is...

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Sister Wen.

96
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,680
Sorry, I came late.

97
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,100
Xiang Kong, start.

98
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay.

99
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,060
Tomorrow,

100
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,340
the difference between the team Xiao Long

101
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
that we are competing is,

102
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,740
their top play is very strong.

103
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Relying on the top

104
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,660
to have more damage in the earlier part of the game

105
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,900
so at the top

106
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,780
we have to choose some tank hero,

107
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,860
this way we can guard a little

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,100
to void getting killed,

109
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,100
causing it to snowball.

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Lu Sheng, under the condition

111
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,500
that you can fully develop in the early part,

112
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,930
try to catch the top.

113
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,970
Okay.

114
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,490
Until the back part,

115
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,170
we will try not have group attack,

116
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,530
go solo.

117
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,090
Mainly we will go top as priority.

118
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,150
Come.

119
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,230
Brother Yao.

120
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,590
Hurry up.

121
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,670
Wait for Pei Xi.

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,590
Don't care about him.

123
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,460
Come. Three, two, one.

124
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,820
Hey, Ji Xiang Kong.

125
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
I indeed admire you.

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
On one hand, you're dating the star.

127
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
On the other, you're having ambiguous relationship

128
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
with our commentary.

129
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,600
Not bad.

130
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
What do you guys want?

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
Better have some respect,

132
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
don't find trouble.

133
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,960
If you have the energy to argue,

134
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
why not research on the tactics?

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Be careful getting bashed by our substitute.

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,590
Your tone isn't small.

137
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,670
We were wondering previously

138
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,470
why is that when Qiu Ying is commenting,

139
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,590
she always speak good of you.

140
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,870
So it is because the both of you

141
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,950
are related.

142
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,940
You guys know

143
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,220
what's the situation with Qiu Ying?

144
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,260
Even this kind of girl, he wants.

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,220
You better keep your mouth clean.

146
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,180
Leader!

147
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,210
- Ji Xiang Kong. - Leader.

148
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,810
Pei Xi, are you fine?

149
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,810
Ji Xiang Kong beat someone up.

150
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,450
Pei Xi,

151
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,370
you can go to the main committee.

152
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,130
You're crazy.

153
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,970
Leader, he's agitating you.

154
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,610
You still don't want to leave?

155
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,730
What happen? Finding trouble?

156
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,930
Lin Yi Xuan will accompany.

157
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,650
What you doing?

158
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,530
Let's go.

159
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,210
Didn't you like to show off your tactics?

160
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,600
Prepare tissues,

161
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,760
don't cry too badly later.

162
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,680
Let's go.

163
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,880
What happened?

164
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,400
They find trouble,

165
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,150
Pei Xi helped Ji Xiang Kong to talk.

166
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,870
You still helped my Brother Kong to talk.

167
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,550
Finals,

168
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,140
I only want to compete with Wei Teng.

169
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,620
Thanks Pei Xi.

170
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,220
You fine?

171
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm fine.

172
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,460
Okay,

173
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,500
don't affect your state.

174
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,540
All the best.

175
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,820
We'll meet during finals.

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,780
All the best.

177
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,810
All the best.

178
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Morning.

179
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
Teacher Luo.

180
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Thanks.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Last night,

182
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,800
how was your rest?

183
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,580
I slept right after I reached home last night.

184
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,140
Then didn't I bought the coffee for nothing?

185
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,140
Why would that be?

186
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,100
Coffee in hand, double the fighting spirit.

187
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,740
Okay, match the script.

188
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,060
You're here.

189
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
What happen?

190
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,460
Sister Wen,

191
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
just now when we were outside,

192
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,500
people from Xiao Long actually provoked us.

193
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,930
Provoke us?

194
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,290
Provoke? That's not just provoke.

195
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,650
That attitude don't be too furious.

196
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,290
Still said something like

197
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,690
asking us to prepare tissue,

198
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,650
don't lose the competition

199
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,730
and cry too badly.

200
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,910
This whole competition season,

201
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,350
they have never won before.

202
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,230
I really don't know

203
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,750
where is their confidence from.

204
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,550
What's the situation, Xiang Kong?

205
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,270
Something happened.

206
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,470
What happened?

207
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,230
The difference with the other teams is

208
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,830
their top is very strong.

209
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,990
Relying on the top

210
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,510
to have more damage in the earlier part of the game

211
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,750
so at the top

212
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,740
we have to choose some tank hero,

213
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,980
this way we can guard a little.

214
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,940
This recording was posted 3 hours ago,

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,420
its already spreaded all over internet.

216
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,100
No wonder Xiao Long's leader

217
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,340
is so arrogant.

218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,000
Like this,

219
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll go report to the main committee first.

220
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,720
I've already reported.

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,880
What's important now is

222
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,280
how are we going to handle it.

223
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
The competition later,

224
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
don't panic.

225
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,000
We still have the second scheme.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,910
Xiang Kong...

227
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,630
No need.

228
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,150
Ji Xiang Kong,

229
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,860
you have violated the team's discipline,

230
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,340
disclose the team's strategy.

231
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,660
From now on,

232
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,780
you'll be on substitute.

233
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,580
Qi Yue, you're up on the next competition.

234
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,460
Okay, Master.

235
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,130
Li Gan, what do you mean?

236
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,890
Do you know what are you saying?

237
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,890
What do I mean?

238
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,210
Shouldn't you ask him

239
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,010
how did the recording

240
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,170
got disclosed?

241
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,930
Qi Yue saw Qiu Ying

242
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,490
entering our Wei Teng's

243
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,530
meeting room

244
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,650
before our strategy meeting.

245
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,050
Sister Wen,

246
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,850
this is 100 percent

247
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,250
purposely done by Qiu Ying

248
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
to revenge on Ji Xiang Kong.

249
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,880
Qi Yue, what nonsense are you saying?

250
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,720
Xiang Kong.

251
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,070
Yes.

252
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,590
Okay.

253
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,540
Teacher Luo, sorry to disturb.

254
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,620
Lu Xi,

255
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,500
why are you here?

256
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,300
You're Qiu Ying?

257
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,940
Yes.

258
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,340
Hello, I am Iconquer's competition's

259
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,460
main committee, Lu Xi.

260
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,940
Today competition,

261
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,180
you don't have to be the commentary.

262
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,420
There's something that needs you

263
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,660
to corporate with us in our investigation,

264
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
you have to make a trip with us.

265
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,610
Lu Xi,

266
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,610
the competition is starting,

267
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,770
can we speak about it

268
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,050
after the competition?

269
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,770
A few hours ago,

270
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,250
Wei Teng's strategic recording

271
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,720
was uploaded online.

272
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,240
This...

273
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,800
Wei Teng's strategic recording?

274
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,600
That's right.

275
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,560
We've investigated

276
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,560
the hotel's CCTV.

277
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,200
Other than Wei Teng's members,

278
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,420
only you

279
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,540
went into their meeting room.

280
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,140
No, I...

281
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,900
Yesterday, I... I just...

282
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,740
You don't have to explain to me now,

283
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,260
there will be a chance for you to explain later,

284
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,300
please corporate with our job.

285
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,580
Teacher Luo.

286
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,980
Don't worry.

287
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,100
Hand this over to me,

288
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,300
explain the situation

289
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,700
first and it'll be fine.

290
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,820
Okay.

291
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,860
Teacher Luo.

292
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,530
Get going.

293
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,590
Teacher Luo.

294
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,230
Hello, Director Guo.

295
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,430
I received the notice

296
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,430
from Iconquer's main committee.

297
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,030
Qiao Xin have already rushed over.

298
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,350
You will partner with her

299
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,780
for today's competition commentary.

300
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
She have arrived already.

301
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,320
Hello Teacher Luo,

302
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm very happy to work with you.

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,640
I will cherish this chance a lot.

304
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,640
If you said the speech wrong later,

305
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,680
just don't talk

306
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,720
and just sit there will do.

307
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Teacher Luo, don't worry.

308
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,800
This competition

309
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
I've prepared sufficiently.

310
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Didn't you always say,

311
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,110
the chance is left for those who have prepared.

312
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,190
You and Qiu Ying

313
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,870
have stayed in our meeting room

314
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,990
for 15 minutes.

315
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,300
Ji Xiang Kong,

316
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,260
as a leader,

317
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,980
you don't know

318
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,180
the team's discipline?

319
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Other than those from the team,

320
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,260
no one is allowed in the meeting room.

321
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,060
I know.

322
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,730
This is my responsibility,

323
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,130
I will bare it.

324
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,530
Xiang Kong.

325
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,610
Wait a moment.

326
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,600
Qiu Ying did come to the meeting room,

327
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,000
but its impossible for her to record

328
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,160
and disclose Wei Teng's strategy.

329
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,040
Where's the evidence?

330
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,120
I can testify for her,

331
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,520
its not easy for her

332
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,510
to go up the commentary stage.

333
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,710
She wouldn't ruin her own career.

334
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,190
You don't have to prove anything for me.

335
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,190
Something that I've never done,

336
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,950
it will naturally be investigated.

337
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,700
You focus on your competition.

338
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,620
Li Gan,

339
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,940
how its not the time to pursue,

340
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,740
the strategy have to disclosed.

341
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,460
We have to hurry

342
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,620
and re-customised our tactics.

343
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,820
Qi Yue and I have already thought of the new tactics

344
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,260
on our way here.

345
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,810
As the coach,

346
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,050
I have the right to keep

347
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,530
Ji Xiang Kong's chance to compete.

348
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,640
As the Manager,

349
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,600
I also have the rights

350
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
to remove you as the coach.

351
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
Okay, come here everyone.

352
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,920
Sit down.

353
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,840
Listen to me

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,540
talk about the tactics later.

355
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,980
Qi Yue will play mid.

356
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,900
Lu Sheng will return to playing the top.

357
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,620
Tong Wu, Lu Sheng,

358
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,340
did the both of you heard what I said?

359
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,900
Play well,

360
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,380
you have to take the competition down.

361
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,270
No wonder they are so arrogant.

362
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,390
Cheating like that,

363
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,470
still dare to show off.

364
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,470
This is all internal meeting,

365
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,390
why would there be someone that record and disclose it?

366
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,590
If they lost this competition,

367
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,430
Wei Teng will be disqualified.

368
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,470
Cannot be.

369
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,150
Brother Kong always have a plan B,

370
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,070
he can't lose.

371
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,990
Welcome everyone to the

372
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,070
2018 Iconquer playoff,

373
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,510
the live of losing team competition.

374
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,270
I am today's commentary, Luo Tian.

375
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,950
I am the commentary, Qiao Xin.

376
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,270
Where's Qiu Ying?

377
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,350
Today, the team competing

378
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,070
are Wei Teng vs. Xiao Long.

379
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,300
To the both teams,

380
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,140
this is a battle life and death.

381
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,020
The winning team

382
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,140
would be able to enter semi-finals.

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
The losing team

384
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,460
will be disqualified.

385
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,540
Today, Wei Teng team members

386
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,560
have some changes.

387
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Leader, Ji Xiang Kong,

388
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
have been change off

389
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
and Qi Yue wil return

390
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
and play back his original

391
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,000
mid position.

392
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
They changed my Brother Kong away.

393
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,680
Coach Shu Wen is not around too.

394
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,120
Li Gan became the coach.

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Wei Teng is doom.

396
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,910
This is you right?

397
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,670
That day,

398
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,990
I heard that Ji Xiang Kong fainted

399
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,590
after that I gave him a call,

400
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
but no one answered.

401
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,660
I was anxious,

402
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,420
I ran to

403
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,820
the team's meeting room to look for him.

404
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,740
In the end, he didn't faint.

405
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,370
Its all their nonsense.

406
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,370
Them?

407
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,810
Qiao Xin and my two other colleague.

408
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,890
Okay, what you have said

409
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,650
we will look for Qiao Xin to confirm.

410
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,370
Before the investigation is clear,

411
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,250
you have to stop

412
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,690
all your job on commentary.

413
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,130
I understand.

414
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,690
Then

415
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
I'll wait for the main committee's notice.

416
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,190
President Zhu.

417
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,550
Yes,

418
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,070
yes,

419
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,630
she was not feeling well

420
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,350
after days ago.

421
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,230
We will go according to the contract.

422
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,260
Okay, let'e work together next time.

423
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,940
Why isn't Xiang Kong on the competition?

424
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,490
Probably is

425
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,970
the problem of the disclosure of the tactics.

426
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,690
What's going on with the disclosure of the tactics?

427
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,170
Hurry up.

428
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,500
Why is Xiang Kong not answering?

429
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,700
Kai Lun,

430
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,020
prepare the car.

431
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,980
What are you doing?

432
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,940
I want to go and look for Xiang Kong.

433
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
You still have a recording later.

434
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,900
I have to accompany him by his side.

435
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,540
You really

436
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,740
don't know the propriety.

437
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,130
There's a chance.

438
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,250
There's a chance, okay.

439
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,550
Go and assist Liu Liao.

440
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,190
Sheng Yue go.

441
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,270
Wei Teng have been forced to open teams.

442
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,510
They strategy of playing is very messy.

443
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,510
The double moon team tacit

444
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,510
did not show at all.

445
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,950
If this continues,

446
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,190
this round Wei Teng is very dangerous.

447
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,710
Ji Xiang Kong.

448
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,030
I heard...

449
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,230
I heard its because of Mi Ya

450
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,950
and Qiu Ying affair

451
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,870
that he got changed down.

452
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,750
Right.

453
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,270
Qiu Ying isn't on the commentary stage too.

454
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,790
Definitely its because of this.

455
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,620
Hurry attack.

456
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,900
Brother Qi, he's following you behind,

457
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,780
protect the base.

458
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,820
Hurry attack.

459
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
All out, I don't care anymore.

460
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
Let us congratulate Xiao Long

461
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,320
for successfully entering the semi-finals.

462
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
and hope that Wei Teng

463
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
can make more persistent efforts

464
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,040
in the next competition season.

465
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,730
Can you drive faster?

466
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,130
Almost there already.

467
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,730
I think now

468
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,040
is not a right time

469
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
for you to rush over,

470
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,480
you can't help Ji Xiang Kong too.

471
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,160
Moreover,

472
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,680
your current popularity

473
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
just recovered a little.

474
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,360
This time if anyone made an article,

475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,270
your popularity will go down again.

476
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,790
I've never been by his side

477
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,310
through the hardship he been through these years.

478
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,150
This time,

479
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,230
I want him to know

480
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,270
no matter what happen,

481
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,550
I'll be by his side.

482
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,460
There's so many reporters,

483
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,740
we can't go already.

484
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,860
Xiao Zhang, u-turn.

485
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,740
No u-turning.

486
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,180
I must meet him today.

487
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,290
Detour over.

488
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,050
How is it?

489
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,240
Don't worry,

490
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,680
I've known Lu Xi

491
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,600
for many years.

492
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,800
She have always been fair

493
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
in handling such matters.

494
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,280
During this time,

495
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,960
just wait patiently,

496
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,700
it will definitely be investigated clearly.

497
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,060
Thank you Teacher Luo.

498
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,980
By the way,

499
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,980
how did the competition go?

500
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,700
Wei Teng lost.

501
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,940
How... how can that be possible?

502
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,260
Ji Xiang Kong

503
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,180
usually prepare 2 sets of tactics,

504
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,140
just in case.

505
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,980
How did

506
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,860
Wei Teng lose to Xiao Long?

507
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,250
Ji Xiang Kong

508
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,970
got changed off last minute.

509
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,850
Its because of me,

510
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,710
its because of the disclosure of the tactics.

511
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,790
Don't think too much.

512
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,430
This have nothing to do with you.

513
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,510
Hello,

514
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,230
the number you have dial have been switched off.

515
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,470
Why is it off?

516
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,710
Qiu Ying, don't be anxious.

517
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,510
Ji Xiang Kong is out.

518
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,670
Ji Xiang Kong.

519
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,670
Ji Xiang Kong.

520
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,510
Ji Xiang Kong.

521
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,390
You got changed down last minutes

522
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,540
is it because of the disclosure of the tactics?

523
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,900
Why did Qiu Ying appeared

524
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,980
at Wei Teng's meeting room?

525
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,220
Did she really do the recording?

526
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,940
The internet have raise a babel of criticism

527
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,460
that Qiu Ying have turn her love to hate against you

528
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,580
so you did a revenge.

529
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,200
Ji Xiang Kong, currently on the internet,

530
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
all the rumours

531
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,280
are pointing towards Qiu Ying,

532
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,960
what do you have to say

533
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,200
about this?

534
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,320
Ji Xiang Kong,

535
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,960
I think you

536
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
should not avoid it anymore.

537
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Reporters,

538
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,400
please separate the team's issue

539
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,040
with my personal relationship.

540
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
About the disclosure of the tactics,

541
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
the main committee is currently investigating,

542
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,790
I will also corperate.

543
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,030
I take my career

544
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,990
as guarantee,

545
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,310
this have nothing

546
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,310
to do with Qiu Ying.

547
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,750
There's no existence

548
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,620
to the netizen's guess of revenge.

549
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,140
Thank you.

550
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,420
Wait a moment,

551
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,780
The only reason

552
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,700
why the internet

553
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,860
have such a guess...

554
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,100
Qiu Ying where are you going?

555
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,660
Chasing the roots,

556
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,210
its because between you and Mi Ya

557
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,330
as well as Qiu Ying

558
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,890
have a complicated relationship status.

559
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,730
About this,

560
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,850
what do you have to say?

561
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,290
Mi Ya is indeed my first love

562
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,330
but now between the both of us,

563
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,610
we're just friends.

564
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,170
We did not patch back.

565
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,210
So having that said,

566
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,330
Qiu Ying did not

567
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,490
break the both of your relationship,

568
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,450
is that right?

569
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,640
Between Qiu Ying and I,

570
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
we're also just friends

571
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,480
but I want to become

572
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,560
her boyfriend.

573
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,800
I also earnestly request

574
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,950
Mi Ya's fans

575
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,030
to stop attcking Qiu Ying.

576
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,390
Everything is my fault.

577
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,070
Thank you.

578
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,670
Ji Xiang Kong.

579
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,300
Mi Ya.

580
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,340
Ms Mi Ya, why are you here?

581
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,700
Mi Ya.

582
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,220
What do you have to say

583
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,140
to Ji Xiang Kong?

584
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,260
Can everyone move aside?

585
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
I have something to tell Xiang Kong first.

586
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,290
Xiang Kong.

587
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,290
Can you give me

588
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,930
a definite answer?

589
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
Sorry.

590
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,050
Is he at the hotel?

591
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,370
Not yet.

592
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,410
Qiu Ying, now you

593
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,130
should care about

594
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,010
yourself,

595
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,130
not Ji Xiang Kong.

596
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,190
Qiu Ying.

597
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,710
Where are you going?

598
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,470
You can't leave.

599
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,110
I advise you

600
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,670
to better not

601
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,790
seduce other people's boyfriend.

602
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,830
Ji Xiang Kong

603
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,350
is a heartless rat，

604
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,390
just wait to get abandoned.

605
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,870
Exactly.

606
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,790
You're the third party,

607
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,550
you know?

608
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,350
Go and die.

609
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,830
Good splashing.

610
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,550
What are you guys doing?

611
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,590
Come, do it again.

612
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,430
What are you guys doing?

613
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,390
Do it again. Security.

614
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,830
You guys are Mi Ya's fans

615
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,630
right?

616
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,030
If you guys still have intellect,

617
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,670
if you guys really love her,

618
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,550
you guys should think about

619
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,310
why

620
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,270
she dont uprightly

621
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,470
date with others.

622
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,390
Why

623
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,100
she got forced to separate with her love one.

624
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,620
Spoiling people's relationship,

625
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,900
still so courageous with sufficient reasons?

626
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,860
Exactly.

627
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,340
Of course I'm courageous,

628
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,580
because

629
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,960
I respect Ji Xiang Kong and her

630
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,160
once relationship.

631
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,520
I also believe

632
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,200
Mi Ya respect

633
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,640
the relationship between us.

634
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,760
Ji Xiang Kong and I

635
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,080
are truly in love.

636
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
We did not

637
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
go against our humanity.

638
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
You guys don't have the rights

639
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,240
and competency to care about me.

640
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,840
Pleaase move away.

641
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
Not moving away.

642
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,160
Don't make an unreasonable scene here.

643
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,350
Don't make an unreasonable scene.

644
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,710
You are

645
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,670
the third party that destroy others.

646
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,430
Move away, what are you doing?

647
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,070
Are you guys crazy?

648
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,470
Who dare to scold another sentence, try.

649
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,540
Don't leave.

650
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,620
All of you keep quiet.

651
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,880
Thank you.

652
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,550
I'm at fault.

653
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm the one that let Wei Teng

654
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,390
become what is it now.

655
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,020
Knowing how to find the problem on yourself

656
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,260
is your virtue

657
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
but you're too strict with yourself.

658
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,300
But I promised Ji Xiang Kong,

659
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,260
I didn't do it either.

660
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,340
Now

661
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,900
you've already done good enough.

662
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,180
Don't give yourself too much stress.

663
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,730
Disclosure of the tactics,

664
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,650
adding on to

665
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,370
him getting changed down like this.

666
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,680
This will be Ji Xiang Kong's

667
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,960
biggest blemish

668
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
in his whole career.

669
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,620
From Legends

670
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
to Wei Teng,

671
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,620
he've been through too much.

672
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,660
I believe he

673
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,540
can face any rain and storms.

674
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,780
Don't worry.

675
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,780
What is it?

676
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,860
Brother Sun, Coach Shu,

677
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,060
did Ji Xiang Kong come before?

678
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,100
He's not here.

679
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,020
He's mobile phone is off.

680
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,140
Where can he go?

681
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,940
Its fine.

682
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,460
I chased the both of you half the day,

683
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,780
did you guys hear mr calling?

684
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,220
Who can care about you?

685
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,450
That...

686
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,530
Brother Sun, Sister Shu Wen,

687
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,930
is Brother Kong here?

688
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,770
He didn't come.

689
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:09,930
i thought

690
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,490
he will be together with the few of you?

691
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,410
No.

692
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,330
Where can he be

693
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,270
if he's not here?

694
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,750
Everyone, don't panic. Don't be anxious.

695
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,190
Maybe he just want to

696
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,190
be alone.

697
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,070
I think I know where he is already.

698
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,030
I will go look for him.

699
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,750
Qiu Ying.

700
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,550
No,

701
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,150
why are you going?

702
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,790
She's alone,

703
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,110
how can I not be worry?

704
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,310
Wait for me.

705
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,470
I'll get going too.

706
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,110
Bye bye Brother Sun, Sister Shu Wen.

707
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,190
Wait for me.

708
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,950
Like this,

709
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,110
I'll go take a look at the hostel.

710
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,380
Shu Wen,

711
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,020
everything will be fine.

712
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,260
Thank you.

713
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,140
About relationship,

714
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
it can't be forced.

715
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,780
I'll support you.

716
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,700
Thank you.

717
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,770
Previously, there was one night,

718
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,770
she was here waiting for you until midnight.

719
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,850
She really like you.

720
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,690
Give her a call.

721
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,160
Why don't you call?

722
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,600
Qiu Ying.

723
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,380
What happened?

724
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,820
Why are you like this?

725
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
Its Mi Ya's fans?

726
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,140
Just some juice only.

727
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,460
Sorry, because of me,

728
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,380
you became the enemy of the world.

729
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,170
So what?

730
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,330
Xiang Kong.

731
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,010
During this time,

732
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,690
your hard work at Wei Teng,

733
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,290
everyone witness it

734
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,010
but this matter

735
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,730
have a big negative impact.

736
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:08,610
The sponsors...

737
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,010
President Li, I know.

738
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:10,810
As a leader,

739
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,530
the disclosure of the tactics,

740
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,410
I should bare the responsibility.

741
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,330
Okay.

742
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,120
Xiang Kong,

743
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
if you need any help in future,

744
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
you can voice out.

745
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,440
I'll try my best to help you.

746
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,910
Thank you President Li.

747
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,710
If there's nothing else,

748
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,870
I'll leave first.

749
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,230
Okay.

750
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,980
Sister Wen.

751
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,280
Let's go, I'll send you off.

752
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,050
Xiang Kong,

753
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,610
this is for you.

754
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,710
Sister Wen,

755
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,950
looks like I still earned.

756
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,710
This is what I kept

757
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,670
the first time

758
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,790
I went to Vancouver for competition.

759
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,150
No wonder when I hold it,

760
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,190
its heavy.

761
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,230
Sorry,

762
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,070
I failed to protect you

763
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,710
and leave you behind.

764
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,270
Sister Wen,

765
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,910
I should be the one saying sorry.

766
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,190
I said I'll give you

767
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,070
a perfect team.

768
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,310
I didn't do it.

769
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,430
But a perfect team,

770
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,060
I believe I'll find it

771
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
one day.

772
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,860
I believe you.

773
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,340
Leader.

774
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,080
I heard you're leaving,

775
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,520
I came to send you off.

776
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,920
How is it?

777
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,120
Want to play a round with me?

778
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,360
The only person that

779
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,560
admire you in the whole Wei Teng

780
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,320
is him.

781
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Get going.

782
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
Let's go.

783
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,930
What you doing?

784
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,050
Brother Shen.

785
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,290
How is it?

786
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,930
Can't bear the thought of him leaving?

787
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,770
Why not you leave with him?

788
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:32,730
No Brother Qi.

789
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,330
I'm just casually taking a look.

790
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,600
Right, go get drinks.

791
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,720
How is it?

792
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Can't play the electric gram,

793
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,520
went to play basketball is it?

794
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,110
Oh yes,

795
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,430
you still can dance.

796
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,310
I'm not sending already.

797
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,740
Bye bye, see you.

798
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,900
Don't care about them.

799
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Actually in Wei Teng,

800
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,220
the person that can't bare you leaving is Tong Wu.

801
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,730
Before you came,

802
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:19,490
nobody realised his

803
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,730
advantages.

804
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,250
So he can

805
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,530
make a brother like you.

806
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,520
Xiang Kong,

807
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,200
in my entire life,

808
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,400
I don't admire much people.

809
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,720
You're considered one.

810
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,480
Do you think I'm very fake?

811
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:39,780
Just because

812
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,780
you have this energy in you,

813
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,900
I then admire you.

814
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,100
Its this real energy of yours,

815
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,700
nobody can beat you,

816
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,380
its pretty good.

817
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,100
Maybe

818
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,580
leaving Wei Teng is better for you.

819
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,540
I just don't know

820
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,180
when

821
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,660
can I play basketball with you again.

822
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,500
If you're willing,

823
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,180
any time is possible.

824
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,380
You said it,

825
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,660
its a deal.

826
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,740
Its a deal.

827
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,190
Why are you here?

828
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,590
I'm here to do my duty as a girlfriend.

829
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,550
I'll help you hold.

830
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,870
No need.

831
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,630
Why not you hold this for me?

832
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,110
Brother Sun

833
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,030
asked us to go eat at The King.

834
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,310
I told Brother Sun already,

835
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,350
we'll go other day.

836
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,340
Today, I want to bring you somewhere.

837
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,860
Where?

838
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,860
You'll know when you reach.

839
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,100
So secretive.

840
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,200
Shu Wen,

841
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
I have made an appointment with a sponsor,

842
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
let's go meet them.

843
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,830
You settle it yourself.

844
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,580
Shu Wen,

845
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,900
sorry,

846
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,740
I was too anxious that day.

847
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,130
Now its Wei Teng's

848
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,690
crucial moment,

849
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,210
I need you.

850
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,770
I want to resign.

851
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,610
What do you mean?

852
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,450
I'm tired.

853
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,170
Shu Wen,

854
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,130
you can't because of some small matters

855
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,770
and be emotional, you know?

856
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,240
Until now,

857
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,960
you still think

858
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,320
what happen between us is a small matter?

859
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,480
The biggest problem with us

860
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,600
is the different in views.

861
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,160
If you can solve it,

862
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,040
it wouldn't be

863
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,440
how it is like today.

864
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,390
You want to

865
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,750
leave Wei Teng

866
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,950
or leave me?

867
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,830
Li Gan,

868
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,620
I have operate Wei Teng

869
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,420
together with you for so long.

870
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,100
All your contribution,

871
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,540
I remember them in my heart.

872
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,020
Just that now,

873
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,260
I... I don't know

874
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,810
what I want.

875
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,050
Shu Wen, its been so many years

876
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,010
I've stick by your side.

877
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,450
Everything,

878
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,200
you say east,

879
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,240
I will never go west.

880
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,000
Everything

881
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,320
goes according to your plan,

882
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,120
according to your steps.

883
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,820
But in the end I realised,

884
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,740
you have never love me before.

885
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,260
Li Gan.

886
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,020
Can you please calm down?

887
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,660
How do you want me to calm down?

888
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,900
How?

889
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,100
Is it because of Sun Zhe Yi?

890
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,570
Enough.

891
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,370
Wei Teng

892
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,550
I return it to you.
