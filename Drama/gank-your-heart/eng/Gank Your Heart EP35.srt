[Episode 35]

3
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,010
Boss.

4
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,130
I'm at the venue.

5
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,610
Film your surroundings.

6
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,370
I want to see the venue.

7
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,730
Boss, look.

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,510
There are so many people.

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
Wow, looks crowded.

10
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,950
Lu Yi Yi, listen up.

11
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,350
Do a good interview.

12
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,590
Don't just focus on

13
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,710
cheering for your boyfriend.

14
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,630
Don't worry, Boss.

15
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,790
We will definitely have the best news!

16
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,230
Ladies and Gentlemen.

17
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,590
Welcome to the final match

18
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,390
of the ICONQUER Championships!

19
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,620
Quick! The match has began!

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,620
Coming..

21
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,660
I'm glad to be here

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,460
with you again.

23
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,780
I asked a friend I'm going to invite on stage.

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,040
She is from China.

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Please everybody give a big hand.

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
Qiuying!

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,960
This competition..

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Qiuying is the narrator

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,400
and host for this competition.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,960
Hi to all fans, nice to meet you!

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm the host tonight.

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,430
Qiuying!

33
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,350
Our daughter is the first female narrator

34
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,910
in history on the ICONQUER Championships.

35
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,030
Really?

36
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,370
Are you guys ready?

37
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,930
All ready!

38
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,010
Let's go.

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,160
Let's go!

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
Ladies and Gentlemen.

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Welcome onto stage, Team..

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,110
Tatan!

43
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,990
Welcome Team Tatan!

44
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,860
Being the champion team last year,

45
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,860
Team Tatan is totally invincible.

46
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,780
They have never been defeated before.

47
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,060
They have won numerous championships.

48
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,780
They are.. Tatan!

49
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,930
Next up on stage,

50
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,770
they are a team from China..

51
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,490
Team Phenix!

52
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,780
Phenix is a newly formed team.

53
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,620
Despite suspicions and mockings,

54
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,980
they have fearlessly battled their way

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,180
to the final match.

56
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,420
They are..

57
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,780
Team Phenix!

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,580
It's time to ask Tatan

59
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,690
how they are feeling in this moment.

60
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,210
Hey losers!

61
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,050
You guys are definitely going to lose this!

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,350
I'd like to ask the Captain, Ji Xiang Kong,

63
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,830
what do you have to say?

64
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,070
I have nothing more to say.

65
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,270
The champion goes to us.

66
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,710
China Number 1!

67
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:50,310
Never say die! Rebirth with burning passion!

68
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,230
Thank you, Ji Xiang Kong.

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,140
But..

70
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,980
The harsh reality of

71
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,340
there will only be one champion!

72
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Absolutely.

73
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,840
I think it's time now

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,160
to start the final match.

75
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,840
Ladies and Gentlemen, let the final game begins.

76
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,920
The competition officially starts.

77
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,630
Ready?

78
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,820
Don't be nervous.

79
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,570
Hi Ladies and Gentlemen.

80
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,570
I'm the Chinese narrator of 2019 ICONQUER Championship.

81
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,490
Your old pal, Luo Tian.

82
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,570
Hi everyone!

83
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,450
I'm the new narrator, Qiu Ying.

84
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,530
This time, we have invited

85
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,530
a special guest.

86
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,490
He is the ex-Captain of Legends.

87
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,930
King of E-gaming, Gu Fang.

88
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,570
Hi everyone!

89
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
This year, you're back to the stage you're familiar of.

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
Do you feel different from last year?

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,760
This is the first time I'm attending this competition as a narrator.

92
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,110
Compared to sitting in the see-through room there,

93
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,070
sitting outside,

94
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,550
I'm able to feel a stronger ambience.

95
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,270
Phenix is the continuation of my dream.

96
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,510
I hope

97
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,670
they are able to win the championship

98
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,300
to bring glory to China

99
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,620
and enhance the charm of e-gaming.

100
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,220
Xiang Kong, which players should we select?

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,860
Make your selections.

102
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,140
I'll be the last.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,860
To surprise them.

104
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Such an important competition..

105
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,820
Using Global Strike,

106
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,980
isn't this strategy too common?

107
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,700
Because this tactic is too common,

108
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,770
Tatans will not be able to predict Phenix's intentions.

109
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,890
Spiritual Princess.

110
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
Spiritual Princess?

111
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Gu Fang.

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
Isn't this your hero icon?

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,580
Seems like Phenix is trying to salute to their former Captain here.

114
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,780
Our former Captain..

115
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,180
should be tearing by now.

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,260
Spiritual Princess.

117
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,860
She used to bring honour to me.

118
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,460
I hope Spiritual Princess

119
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,780
will bring better luck to Phenix today.

120
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,420
The return of Spritual Princess!

121
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,420
Jeffery must be surprised to see us

122
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,340
using Spiritual Princess.

123
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,340
Spiritual Princess?

124
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,180
Ji Xiang Kong is a solo dub player.

125
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,060
Why is he picking a solo mid?

126
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,980
Is he trying to use shadow tactics in his lineup?

127
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,140
Shit! What are they thinking?

128
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,970
So what are we going to do?

129
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,690
We can beat him with our secret weapon.

130
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,930
Let's see what Ji Xiang Kong has first.

131
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,810
Come on guys!

132
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,250
Come on! We can do it!

133
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,310
C'mon!

134
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,190
Let's do this!

135
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,310
C'mon guys, know what to do right?

136
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm coming..

137
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,350
Retreat. It's time to retreat.

138
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,790
Nice shot!

139
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,550
Guys, go go go!

140
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,550
How is it, Ze Yi?

141
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,390
Can I come with you?

142
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,230
Come..

143
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,150
I've surrounded one.

144
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,470
Wait for me.

145
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,230
Ji Xiang Kong and Pei Xi are attacking solely.

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,230
This is effective during the early game.

147
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,350
Attacking solely?

148
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,350
I can't understand Phenix's strategy.

149
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,180
We can see that..

150
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,220
They don't seem nervous at all.

151
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,180
Pei Xi appeared out of the blue!

152
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,060
Steadily.

153
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,020
Ji Xiang Kong was nowhere to seen.

154
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,300
Tatan seem confused about their strategy.

155
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,520
Cyborg and Mogora attacked at the same time,

156
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,240
Trying to attack Ji Xiang Kong.

157
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Not an issue.

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,960
Don't forget.

159
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
Sun Ze Yi is nearby.

160
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,080
He is here!

161
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,520
Sun Ze Yi used his 2nd-degree attack,

162
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,240
Divine power.

163
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,520
He managed to protect Ji Xiang Kong

164
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,320
from Cyborg and Mogora's attack.

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
His swift reaction..

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
doesn't seem like a newbie.

167
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
Sun Ze Yi's reacted fast.

168
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,160
They are fighting back!

169
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Xiang Kong, praise me.

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,560
Ze Yi, you're still as good.

171
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,110
Sun Ze Yi blocked Cyborg and Mogora.

172
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,110
Ji Xiang Kong and Sun Ze Yi attack Cyborg together with their strongest skill.

173
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,990
Bravo!

174
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,350
Nice!

175
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,300
Nice shot!

176
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,860
Just keep going! Guys!

177
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,580
Come on!

178
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,020
Jeffery intercepts the tower

179
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,020
but was attacked by Ji Xiang Kong.

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,780
Awesome!

181
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,300
Jeffery wanted to escape

182
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,060
but it was too late

183
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,410
Xia Ling double-attacks!

184
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,090
You're dead, Jeffery.

185
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:06,930
Nice shot!

186
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,530
There is a price to pay for intercepting the tower.

187
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,130
Jeffrey has no idea what Phenix's tactic is.

188
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,650
But Phenix is simply using

189
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,050
the most common tactic, Global storm.

190
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,010
As the saying goes,

191
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,010
the onlooker sees a clearer picture.

192
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,840
Boys, I don't think we can win this one.

193
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
What do..

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
Alright.. This is what we're gonna do.

195
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,840
We're gonna pretend to lose to them.

196
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,350
What?

197
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,390
Just do it as I say!

198
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,710
Trust me.

199
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,910
Okay..

200
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,030
Trust me.

201
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,060
Retreat..

202
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,020
Pei Xi and Xia Ling defeated Jeffery effortlessly.

203
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,140
Phenix's vision has been set.

204
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,140
Is Ji Xiang Kong trying to lure the opponent?

205
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,860
But it is an obvious trap.

206
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,180
Will Jeffery fall into it?

207
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,500
I think Jeffrey is having a mental breakdown.

208
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,500
Jeffrey tried to kill Ji Xiang Kong in one attack,

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,940
But Ji Xiang Kong escaped.

210
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,650
Am I seeing things?

211
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,930
Did Ji Xiang Kong expect that move from Jeffrey?

212
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,170
What is Ji Xiang Kong doing?

213
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,170
If it was me, I'd have won.

214
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,480
Stop being a showoff.

215
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,720
Just as the Tatans gathered,

216
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
with Ji Xiang Kong's strongest attack

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,840
all of them were suppressed.

218
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,760
With another attack,

219
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
it controlled Musk, Jeffery

220
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,720
and killed Mogora!

221
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,100
The rest of Phenix appeared out of the blue.

222
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,060
Xia Ling attacked first

223
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,900
using his first and secondary attacks.

224
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,980
Jeffery was dragged away!

225
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,540
No Tatans remaining.

226
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,540
Phenix elevated up.

227
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,260
Nice shot!

228
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,300
Phenix took down the jewel!

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,860
Nice! Good shot!

230
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,300
Nice shot!

231
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,460
Xiang Kong won!

232
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,850
Pretend yeah.

233
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,650
Congratulations, Phenix!

234
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,390
For winning the first round!

235
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,350
It is 1 versus 0 now.

236
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,510
Come on.

237
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,830
Why are they acting this way?

238
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,630
What's going on?

239
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,710
No matter what are they up to,

240
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,030
we won the first round.

241
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,830
We're a step closer now.

242
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,990
Let's talk inside.

243
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,550
Well done guys!

244
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Awesome!

245
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
What's going on?

246
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,360
Phenix is a formidable team.

247
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
What's wrong, President Jin?

248
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Now..

249
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm regretting for what that has happened.

250
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,710
If Xiang Kong didn't leave us,

251
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,750
the team on stage today will be Legends.

252
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,340
It's alright, President Jin.

253
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,380
We will do well the next round.

254
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,130
Sister Wen.

255
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,210
What's the matter?

256
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,770
Despite winning the first round,

257
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,450
what are those gloomy faces for?

258
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,610
Sit down.

259
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,970
Though we have won the first round,

260
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,530
Tatan's tactics earlier

261
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,720
are what I've not seen before.

262
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,280
Despite our victory,

263
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,680
it was partly based on luck.

264
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,080
Xiang Kong,

265
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,430
next round..

266
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,910
Shall we use the shadow tactics?

267
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,150
Yeah.

268
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,790
Since you guys made your way to the finals with shadow tactics,

269
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,790
it will definitely work.

270
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,660
At this crucial moment,

271
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,500
don't let your guards down.

272
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,660
We're fighting against

273
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,900
the champion team last year.

274
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,540
No mistakes allowed.

275
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,180
Believe in us.

276
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
We will not make any mistakes.

277
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,100
Take it easy.

278
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,180
I...

279
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,530
I will avenge this for Legends.

280
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,810
Looking good, guys.

281
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey, Ji Xiang Kong!

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,800
Your team is left with the shadow tactics right?

283
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,320
We're really looking forward to it.

284
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,500
Alright, guys. Go!

285
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,460
Look at Jeffery's attitude.

286
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,820
What is up in his sleeves?

287
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,100
Could they have the solution to break the shadow tactics?

288
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,340
Shadow tactics

289
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,460
is not easy to deal with.

290
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,060
We're left with this match to go.

291
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,540
Come on, we can do this!

292
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,700
Welcome back to the competition.

293
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,420
Now,

294
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,460
the second round will begin.

295
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,940
In the first round,

296
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,090
Phenix defeated Tatan with 'Global Storm' tactic.

297
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,810
Phenix is leading.

298
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,890
Judging from the lineup,

299
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,010
seems like Phenix is planning

300
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,890
to use the shadow tactics.

301
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,390
Oh man! Losers!

302
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,590
I knew they got nothing else but stupid shadow.

303
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,950
Alright boys!

304
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,910
Stick to the original plan.

305
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,910
It's bulletproof.

306
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,230
They are using back the previous lineup.

307
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,910
Maybe they're too lazy to change.

308
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,230
I doubt so.

309
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,990
I don't know what are they up to either.

310
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,030
Play with caution.

311
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,670
Let's try not to attack during the early game.

312
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,310
Okay.

313
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,310
Alright.

314
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,030
Tatan chose the exact lineup

315
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,670
as the previous round.

316
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,310
They don't seem to have any breakthrough.

317
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,510
Or maybe..

318
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,180
is he overconfident with this lineup?

319
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,380
I think Tatan will change their gaming tactic.

320
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,460
In terms of vision,

321
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,380
this lineup is pretty strong

322
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,500
to control the shadow tactic.

323
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Top laner, vanish.

324
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,680
Bottom laner, vanish.

325
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,280
Careful, mid laner.

326
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm blocked here.

327
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,160
Can you retreat?

328
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Xia Ling, I'm coming to support you.

329
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Let's switch positions.

330
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,680
Retreat.

331
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,680
Don't attack first.

332
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,800
Tatan multipled their substitutes.

333
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
Whenever Phenix tried to attack,

334
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,560
Tatan managed to avoid it.

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
Tatan's defense is getting tight.

336
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,800
Tatan prevented Phenix's mid-laner

337
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,920
from moving.

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They are changing their positions too quickly.

339
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,760
Be careful.

340
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,390
They kept changing positions.

341
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,270
My shots were all missed.

342
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,110
That's too much.

343
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,750
Quad switch?

344
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,630
Since when did Tatan switch positions?

345
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,190
They have broke the shadow tactic.

346
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,430
Jeffrey has became the mid laner.

347
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,870
Besides that,

348
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,900
Tatan's support player has switched his position too.

349
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,580
Tatan isn't using the same shadow tactic.

350
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,260
Accurately speaking,

351
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,820
Tatan is using duo-shadow tactic.

352
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,500
Quad switching positions.

353
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,450
They are being fully surrounded.

354
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,890
Phenix has no way to attack.

355
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,570
I didn't expect them to use the duo-shadow tactic.

356
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,530
3 of them are attacking me.

357
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,890
I can't escape.

358
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,690
Oh! Nice.

359
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,130
Alright, let's go to the other one, guys!

360
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,090
This is gonna be easy.

361
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,050
He is waiting for us.

362
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,970
Second killed! Three killed!

363
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Nice! One tower down!

364
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
Oh yeah!

365
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,040
Five killed!

366
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,870
Phenix go!

367
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,870
Nice!

368
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,110
Tatan has defeated Phenix!

369
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,350
Jeffrey's economy shot up!

370
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,310
There is no way for Phenix to attack.

371
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,550
What's wrong, Ji Xiang Kong?

372
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,670
Unexpected, right?

373
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,740
Shadow tactic..

374
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
We have resolved it long ago.

375
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,620
Judging from the current situation,

376
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,820
shadow tactic is not going to work anymore.

377
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,940
The first round.

378
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,340
We lost it deliberately.

379
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,460
Xiang Kong,

380
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,260
what should we do?

381
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
Abandon the top lane.

382
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,700
Fight the dragon.

383
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,820
Kill the dragon! Quick.

384
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
Fighting the dragon is our last chance.

385
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,500
Come..

386
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,260
Everyone fight the dragon with me.

387
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,090
I'm coming..

388
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,410
Since the second round has begun,

389
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,170
Phenix has been on the losing end.

390
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,090
They're trying to look for a way to breakthrough.

391
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,210
Phenix is heading towards the dragon!

392
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,160
Tatan has planted vision at that area.

393
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
To get rid of the dragon,

394
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
be careful, Phenix!

395
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,280
Tatan is attacking our tower.

396
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,240
Ignore them.

397
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,840
Let them be.

398
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,960
Xiang Kong, what about our highland?

399
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,520
Ze Yi,

400
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,600
guard the top-lane.

401
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,400
- Pei Xi, you too. - Okay.

402
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Go! Go!

403
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,700
The dragon is left with..

404
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,460
One-third life span.

405
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,740
Lin Yi Xi saw two Tatans nearing the dungeon.

406
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,700
He tried to divert their attention

407
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,180
while his teammates fight the dragon.

408
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,460
But the Tatans avoided him

409
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,820
and dashed straight into the dungeon.

410
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,460
Ignore them.

411
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
Keep attacking the dragon!

412
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,220
Its life span is critically low.

413
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,260
I will attack the Tatans.

414
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,940
Xia Ling, what are you doing?

415
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,780
Come back. Fight the dragon!

416
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,700
It is almost dying.

417
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,620
The dragon is dying, Xia Ling!

418
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,780
Kill the dragon!

419
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,540
Lin Yi Xuan, what are you doing?

420
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,780
Kill the dragon! Come back!

421
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,660
No.. I can't go.

422
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,220
Retreat!

423
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,300
Go!

424
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,620
Blue, help me.

425
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,820
The Tatans dashed into the dungeon.

426
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,370
Ji Xiang Kong is critically injured!

427
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,970
Wow! Ji Xiang Kong was killed!

428
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,970
Xia Ling was killed!

429
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,650
Why didn't you listen to my orders?

430
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,390
Congratulations, Tatan.

431
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,710
For winning this round.

432
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,590
The current score is..

433
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,590
1 versus 1. Fair match.

434
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,830
After the 10 minutes break,

435
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,710
let's welcome the final crucial round.

436
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,190
Stay tuned!

437
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,670
Stay.

438
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,540
Give them some time to cool down.

439
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,220
There is still chance.

440
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm going to see Xiang Kong.

441
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,110
What tactic are we using for the final round?

442
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,630
From Tatan's playing tactic,

443
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,700
it's clear that they have studied us thoroughly.

444
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,340
If they're able to break the shadow tactic,

445
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,540
they're able to break all our tactics.

446
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,930
So..

447
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,250
What should we do?

448
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,090
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,410
I've no idea too.

450
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,290
Captain..

451
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,690
Xiang Kong.

452
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,330
Don't stress yourself too much.

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,120
I need a breather outside.

454
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,350
Sun, I..

455
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,930
Xiang Kong.

456
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,850
Miya.

457
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,760
Why are you here?

458
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,040
I'm here to see your game.

459
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,260
When I was watching you earlier,

460
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,900
while listening to Qiuying's narration,

461
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
I realised..

462
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,500
she knows you better.

463
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
She understands you better than I do.

464
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
We..

465
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,260
We have really lost too much time.

466
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,220
And my eyes..

467
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,610
You knew that my eyes have recovered, right?

468
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,130
The recovery of your eyes..

469
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,410
To me..

470
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,410
It's the best thing to hear.

471
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,710
Though it is a draw now,

472
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,590
this must have been quite a huge blow to Phenix.

473
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,270
If Phenix is keeping up with this dampened spirit,

474
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,430
it is a bad sign.

475
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,630
Perhaps,

476
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,830
it might do good

477
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,190
if someone could enlighten them.

478
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,350
Me?

479
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,390
With Sister Shu Wen around, I think..

480
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,390
Qiu Ying..

481
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,340
It's not just about Ji Xiang Kong and the rest.

482
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,940
It applies to you.

483
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,860
10 minutes break.

484
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,740
Be back before the final match starts.

485
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,100
Go.

486
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,680
Then..

487
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,880
Thanks, Teacher Luo.

488
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,080
Xiang Kong, I'm sorry.

489
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,510
I was too selfish.

490
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,030
To stop you from leaving me,

491
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,500
I've made used of you.

492
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,140
I must have hurt Qiu Ying too.

493
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Please apologise to her on my behalf.

494
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,170
I hope it's not too late.

495
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,450
I have never given up on Qiu Ying.

496
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,210
When the match ends,

497
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,930
I will make things clear with her.

498
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,880
I sincerely wish all the best to the both you.

499
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,300
Qiu Ying!

500
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
Xiang Kong!

501
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,460
Qiu Ying!

502
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,460
Leave this after the competition.

503
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,460
The game is starting.

504
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,300
Xiang Kong.

505
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,810
Are you ready?

506
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,410
Sorry, guys.

507
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,650
For the final round,

508
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,120
I can't think of any tactic.

509
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,240
This competition..

510
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,560
It isn't just about us.

511
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,540
But all e-gamers in China.

512
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,660
We must fulfil everyone's dream

513
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,180
on behalf of all of them.

514
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,020
This.

515
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,700
Guys.

516
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,900
It's time for us to show the best of us!

517
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,820
Welcome back!

518
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,580
Let's give a big hand

519
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,460
to welcome Phenix back on stage.

520
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
I'm 30 this year.

521
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,330
I've passed the prime period of an e-gamer.

522
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:24,810
I thought

523
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,450
I wouldn't be able to do crazy things anymore.

524
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,130
To be able to return to the stage I yearned,

525
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,810
to prove that I'm not a failure,

526
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,990
it's more than satisfaction.

527
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,590
I've said before..

528
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,230
My biggest dream in my life

529
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,310
is to compete the competition with you.

530
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,510
I have fulfilled my dream.

531
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,030
Captain.

532
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,990
It's only been 6 months as an e-gamer.

533
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,230
Yet I'm entering the International Championship.

534
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,950
I'm even competing with my idol!

535
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,710
There is nothing more left to regret.

536
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,310
My biggest dream is

537
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,620
having a united team to fight the game with.

538
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
My dream has been fulfilled today.

539
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,250
Let's enjoy it till the end.

540
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
I was doubted.

541
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,360
I wasn't a gifted e-gamer.

542
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,000
Thanks to you guys for believing me in this.

543
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,280
The match we have lost a year ago..

544
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,280
Captain left the team.

545
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,040
You guys have never left me when I was down.

546
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,630
This time, our opponent team is invincibly strong.

547
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,630
At this point of time,

548
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,630
countless attention are focused on this stage.

549
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,990
I don't want to lose this.

550
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,180
Our Champion dream.

551
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,860
Let's make our dreams come true!

552
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,340
Right now,

553
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,460
Phenix is standing on stage.

554
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,370
Why are they on stage? Phenix!

555
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,130
Hang on.

556
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,610
What are they doing?

557
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,560
What are they doing?

558
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,150
Blazers.

559
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,510
Legends.

560
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,220
VNG's badges.

561
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,420
They are pinning the teams' badges on their jackets.

562
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
I think..

563
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,340
They are not competing

564
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,140
for themselves.

565
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,970
Actually Phenix is formed by

566
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,610
a combination of VNG, Legends and Blazers.

567
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,770
They carried the dreams of 2 generations.

568
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,000
The best moment of China gaming history.

569
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,400
Stand up.

570
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,460
No matter what,

571
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,980
we still got to defeat them all.

572
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,420
Stay focus.

573
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,540
Let's choose our best individual players.

574
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,660
Alright guys. Are we ready for this?

575
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,450
Yes!

576
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,410
Do it!

577
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,930
Phenix, all the best!

578
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,750
We can hear the audience cheering for Phenix.

579
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,350
According to the statistics,

580
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,430
Stone beast.

581
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,270
Dictator.

582
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,870
Ah Xin.

583
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,710
Chariot.

584
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,270
Jin Can.

585
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,950
The heros Tatan won the most battles with.

586
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,710
But the heros Phenix chose

587
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,990
are comparatively weaker in stats.

588
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,630
If Tatan play like how they did earlier,

589
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,510
it is going to be a tough war for Phenix.

590
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,700
I believe..

591
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,940
This final round is going to be exciting.

592
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
Lin Yi Xuan, loiter outside.

593
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,420
Okay..

594
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,100
Be the spy.

595
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,820
I'll be the spy..

596
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,500
Gather.

597
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
Things don't seem good for Phenix.

598
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
Tatan are surrounding behind them.

599
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,480
Phenix attacked first

600
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,320
by controlling Jeffrey.

601
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,960
If they managed to get rid of Jeffrey,

602
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,480
it will be easier for them.

603
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,480
Oh dear!

604
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,200
Jeffrey and Knight's trio attack.

605
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,120
Phenix life span is running low.

606
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,640
Xiang Kong, should we retreat?

607
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,760
I will do the lead.

608
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000
Head to the wild.

609
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,150
Oh okay..

610
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,910
I'll take over the top.

611
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,630
Pei Xi, mid.

612
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,270
Xia Ling, bottom.

613
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,190
Without vision,

614
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,990
it is dangerous for Phenix to fight against Tatan.

615
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,230
Judging from the current situation,

616
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,590
defence is the only way for Phenix.

617
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,060
If Phenix can't think of a way to attack,

618
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,060
it is risky.

619
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,300
Tatan and Phenix's economy stats

620
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,940
differs by 5000 points.

621
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,820
Man count..

622
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,780
It is currently 5 versus 1.

623
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,890
One of Phenix's towers has already been crashed.

624
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,650
At this rate,

625
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,610
Tatan's economy is getting stronger.

626
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,050
Tatan is surrounding us!

627
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,650
I can't move!

628
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,650
Attack the dragon, Xiang Kong!

629
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,850
Tatan is attacking the dragon.

630
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,770
As long as they kill it,

631
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,730
there will probably win this.

632
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,370
Things are getting tougher for Phenix.

633
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,810
Why is Phenix not taking any action?

634
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,770
Is Phenix running out of tactics?

635
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,280
Pei Xi, Xiang Kong, Lin Yi Xuan

636
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,400
all 3 of them were killed.

637
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,080
They are acting too rashly.

638
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Tatan is moving together.

639
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
Phenix is lacking too far off.

640
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,360
It's best for Phenix to retreat and not attack.

641
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,910
Or things may go out of hand.

642
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,270
Something is wrong with Phenix.

643
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,670
Is anything wrong over there?

644
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,950
Don't give up!

645
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,750
Are you letting down those who trusted you?

646
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,910
Xiang Kong, can you think of a solution?

647
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,100
I want to win! I don't want to lose!

648
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,780
Keep quiet! Let me think!

649
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,940
Is Phenix giving up?

650
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,740
If Tatan were to kill the dragon,

651
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
Phenix is gonna lose this.

652
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,940
The dragon has been killed by Tatan.

653
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,300
Xiang Kong, what should we do?

654
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,060
Defend our territory.

655
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,900
Forget about the tower.

656
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,300
Phenix's tower has been demolished.

657
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,450
Tatan is getting ready for their last attack.

658
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,210
Give me five!

659
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,770
Oh! I wanna see their faces.

660
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,840
Phenix is not a team that gives up easily.

661
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Believe that Ji Xiang Kong will come up with a new tactic.

662
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,400
Ji Xiang Kong, you can do it!

663
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Phenix, you can do it!

664
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,100
Phenix, you can do it!

665
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,540
Why are you using this weapon?

666
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,100
The flaming rod. It looks stunning!

667
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,700
It is only effective during multiple attacks.

668
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,220
At least 3 consecutive times.

669
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,020
Ji Xiang Kong!

670
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,820
You will definitely get the

671
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,980
International Championship!

672
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,300
I've got an idea!

673
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,940
Xia Ling, Pei Xi. Sell all the weapons.

674
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,130
Use the flame rod.

675
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,090
What's the use of using that rod?

676
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,170
It has self-damaging effect.

677
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,670
Ze Yi,

678
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,030
are we really using the flaming rod?

679
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,030
Let's believe in Xiang Kong.

680
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,190
The flaming rod has effects of multiple damages.

681
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,510
We have no other way now.

682
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,390
Go ahead!

683
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,590
These guys never give up easily.

684
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,270
There should be a way.

685
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,390
Believe in them.

686
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,470
Hang on.. Pei Xi?

687
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,590
What is Pei Xi doing?

688
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,430
He..

689
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,550
Why is selling all his weapons?

690
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,470
Xia Ling too!

691
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,030
They are selling all their weapons.

692
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,380
Are they giving up?

693
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,220
Flaming rod?

694
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,380
Pei Xi and Xia Ling

695
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
are both using the flaming rod!

696
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,500
This is the lowest cost-performance weapon.

697
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,660
You like fireworks?

698
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,020
All girls love it.

699
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
Whenever I watch fireworks,

700
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,440
it feels like..

701
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,560
my world is lit up.

702
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,200
I will win the International Championship!

703
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm ready.

704
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,880
Change the highland to mid lane.

705
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,630
We can see that Tatan is surrounded by Phenix.

706
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,270
Sun Ze Yi hides at a secluded corner.

707
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,790
Jeffrey stood on highland.

708
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,630
Phenix's vision has been blocked.

709
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,270
Finding a chance..

710
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,510
Blind ditch.

711
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,710
Sun Ze Yi grabbed Jeffrey up to the highland.

712
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,060
Attack!

713
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,460
I caught hold of it! Attack!

714
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,100
Nice shot!

715
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,220
Nice shot! Sun Ze Yi!

716
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,460
The rest of them are here!

717
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,460
Hang on..

718
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,340
Don't attack first.

719
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,100
Hold it.

720
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,700
What should I do?

721
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,700
Their attacks are too strong.

722
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,890
Retreat for awhile.

723
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,250
I'm attacking first!

724
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,530
Peixi!

725
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,650
Jeffrey's stats is critically low.

726
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,610
Peixi lit up the first flaming rod.

727
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,370
PeiXi! Pei Xi appeared!

728
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,490
He blocked a crucial attack in front of Sun Ze Yi.

729
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,330
Pei Xi's life span is running low too.

730
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,090
1 protecting 4.

731
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,210
Pei Xi is sacrificing himself

732
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,010
to buy time for his team.

733
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,800
Jeffrey has collapsed.

734
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Before collapsing, Pei Xi lit up the first flaming rod attack.

735
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,320
Pei Xi! Well done!

736
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,160
What?

737
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Tatan's support has joined in as well.

738
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
Jeffrey wasn't knocked off yet.

739
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,440
Are they planning to avenge?

740
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,870
Xia Ling and Lin Yi Xuan

741
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,070
joined forces too.

742
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,230
Lin Yi Xuan is helping Xia Ling.

743
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,950
Xia Ling! The second flaming rod!

744
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,990
I'm about to!

745
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,750
God! Damn it! What just happened?

746
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,060
Flaming rod?

747
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,540
Xia Ling attacked with the second flaming rod!

748
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,460
It has brought down Jeffrey!

749
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,060
God of Axe dashed towards Ji Xiang Kong.

750
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,300
As he was going to attack him..

751
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,020
Sun Ze Yi dragged God of Axe towards him.

752
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,900
Sun Ze Yi held down God of Axe!

753
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,660
Ji Xiang Kong attacked along the way

754
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,380
towards the fountain..

755
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,540
He.. He is selling off his weapons!

756
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,780
Flaming rod!

757
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,170
Ji Xiang Kong has purchased a flaming rod too!

758
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,370
I can't handle this anymore.

759
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,810
Xiang Kong! Quick! Attack!

760
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,290
Time's up! Attack!

761
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,090
Lighting up the third flaming rod..

762
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,480
Ji Xiang Kong attacked!

763
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
It was indeed a fatal blow!

764
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
No one can handle that blow!

765
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,440
Awesome! Xiang Kong! Good job!

766
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,640
Three killed! Nice!

767
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,560
C'mon guys!

768
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,400
Ji Xiang Kong

769
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,980
killed three Tatans in one attack!

770
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,140
Three killed!

771
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,100
Before Tatan's support blacked out,

772
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,780
in a leap,

773
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
he killed Ji Xiang Kong!

774
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,100
Lin Yi Xuan has been killed too!

775
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,620
Sun Ze Yi has killed God of Axe!

776
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,340
Phenix is left with one player.

777
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,620
Smash the jewel! Quick!

778
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,340
Phenix's army isn't looking good.

779
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,580
Sun Ze Yi decided to attack Tatan's army.

780
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Attack at one blow!

781
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,700
I can do it!

782
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,860
Sun Ze Yi crushed Tatan's highland.

783
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,620
Tatan couldn't purchase any weapons now.

784
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,500
Attack! One shot!

785
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,300
Attack them!

786
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,660
Phenix is an unbelievable team!

787
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,380
If they lack in chemistry,

788
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,020
how can they be able to accomplish this?

789
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,850
Sun Ze Yi is getting nearer to Tatan's jewel.

790
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,250
But Tatan's army is in the midst of cracking Phenix's jewel.

791
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,490
Quick! Crack the jewel!

792
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,690
Push! Push it!

793
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,450
I'm pushing it!

794
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,010
Sun Ze Yi!

795
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,610
No...

796
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,550
Nice shot! Crush the tower!

797
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,150
Crush it!

798
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:36,910
Crush it through!

799
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,230
Will Tatan's army or Sun Ze Yi crush the jewel faster?

800
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,990
Crush it!

801
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,430
Tatan's jewel stats balance is 75.

802
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,150
Phenix's jewel stats balance is 35.

803
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,750
No!

804
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,910
Crush it!

805
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,230
Phenix, go for it!

806
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,750
No!!

807
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Champion!

808
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,590
Phenix!

809
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,790
See you next year.

810
00:36:51,220 --> 00:37:01,970
Never say die! Rebirth with burning passion!

811
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,610
Victory!

812
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,610
What a bunch of amazing guys!

813
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,050
Congratulations!

814
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,610
Everybody! They are 2019 Champion team.

815
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,440
Phenix!

816
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,200
I've grew along with Phenix.

817
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,960
From being unknown,

818
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,150
to criticsms,

819
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,990
through ups and downs,

820
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,230
they revived.

821
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,830
How tough has it been of them.

822
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,150
They are the only ones who know.

823
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,380
Phenix is a perfect team.

824
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,540
They proved themselves with their capabilities.

825
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,540
In honour to China!

826
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,300
They made us proud!

827
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,980
They brought honour to the world!

828
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,140
They are ICONQUER's pride!

829
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,980
China's pride!

830
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:10,080
Never say die! Rebirth with burning passion!

831
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,100
Congratulations!

832
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,580
Ji Xiang Kong,

833
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,460
as a Captain of Phenix,

834
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,500
what you would like to say?

835
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,420
I want to say..

836
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,810
This trophy doesn't solely belong to the 5 of us.

837
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,370
I want to thank

838
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,010
all those who stayed with us

839
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,010
during our toughest times.

840
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,770
Without their support,

841
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,610
we wouldn't have come this far.

842
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,190
They are here today.

843
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,590
I'd like to invite them on stage

844
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,910
to receive the trophy with us!

845
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,430
They are Team Blazers!

846
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,910
Welcome them!

847
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,390
Congratulations to champions!

848
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,910
Allow them to enjoy this moment!

849
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,470
Besides that,

850
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,300
there is one person I'd like to thank.

851
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,220
Without her,

852
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,500
I wouldn't have make it here.

853
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,740
I've promised her.

854
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,400
I'd bring her to ICONQUER finals.

855
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,990
Oh my god!

856
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,620
What a moment on stage here!

857
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,580
What a special moment!

858
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,260
Absolutely amazing!

859
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,500
Everybody!

860
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,180
The champions!

861
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,570
Feels awkward when everyone is on holiday.

862
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,690
Yeah.

863
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,210
It feels like a dream.

864
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,810
I still remember when I gave you the key,

865
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,570
it felt like yesterday.

866
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,470
Captain, thank you.

867
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,510
This ring..

868
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,430
shall return back to its owner.

869
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,870
This ring..

870
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,150
is to thank you for your support to Phenix.

871
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,870
Captain.

872
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,270
I promised you.

873
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,510
To win the 2nd Championship ring.

874
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,260
I've finally did it.

875
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,960
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

876
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,000
But your old self.

877
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,680
Be thankful to your old self

878
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,320
for not giving up.

879
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,790
These two rings

880
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,990
neither belong to you

881
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,870
nor me,

882
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,470
they signify China's glory in ICONQUER

883
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,990
this isn't the end,

884
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,510
but a continuation.

885
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,620
We should leave the rings here

886
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,220
for the future teams to continue this glory.

887
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,520
Be careful.

888
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
It's so high up here!

889
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,670
Is this where you want to bring me?

890
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,300
But..

891
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,180
Besides its unique height here,

892
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,740
what else is unique?

893
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,980
Close your eyes. You will find out.

894
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,060
Why?

895
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,820
Just close your eyes!

896
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,340
3, 2, 1!

897
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:39,930
Open your eyes!
