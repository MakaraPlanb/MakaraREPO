1
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Why are you looking at me?

2
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,980
I’m not.

3
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,050
This isn’t bad, right?

4
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,810
Yeah.

5
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,370
Conquer the top 100. Declare war.

6
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,410
I’m going to be defeated so badly.

7
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,230
Don’t worry. I’m here.

8
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,550
I don’t think we ordered drinks.

9
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,030
They’re complimentary.

10
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,070
Complimentary?

11
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,470
When did the Dream Traveller become so generous?

12
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,340
It has always been generous.

13
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,780
Thanks. Thank you.

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Accept the invitation.

15
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
You’re teaching her to use the escalade.

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Why are you still here?

17
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
You’re wasting time.

18
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,990
I have nothing but time.

19
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,790
Choose your hero.

20
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,740
Do you still have the strawberries?

21
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,060
Yes. They’re here.

22
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,400
It’s for this customer.

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,470
I’m going to the members’ room first.

24
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,790
I’ll make you another one later. It’ll taste better.

25
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,830
Okay.

26
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,030
Sorry.

27
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,740
Brother Xia Tian.

28
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Is anyone in the members’ room?

29
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,660
Ji Xiang Kong is here.

30
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,180
Ji Xiang Kong?

31
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,900
And Qiu Ying who’s here everyday trying to beat the top one player.

32
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,620
You’ve been memorising the order. It won’t work.

33
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,810
Be flexible.

34
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,370
You don’t beat the Creator this way. You can absorb him now.

35
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,490
But I’m already on residual blood. Are you sure?

36
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,440
Listen to me. Absorb him now.

37
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,000
The E skill can control him for a while.

38
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,080
W to injure. Move. A key.

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,380
He’s teleporting away.

40
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Teleport to follow him! Use your biggest skill!

41
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,620
Don’t let your hands leave the keyboard. Continue.

42
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,260
Keep pushing. Hit the crystals.

43
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,740
Xiang Kong. I’ve conquered #65!

44
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,580
You’re the best.

45
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,060
Not bad. Be more confident in yourself.

46
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,690
Pei Xi. Did you know? I’m number 65 now.

47
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,830
It’s a new flavour. Try it on the house.

48
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,630
Thank you.

49
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,630
Is this also free?

50
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,510
I’m going to dig in. Thanks. Thank you.

51
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,910
There are so many strawberries.

52
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,910
It looks different from what I saw on the menu.

53
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,270
Thank your cousin for me.

54
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,660
Have you found a new team?

55
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,100
Why are you still here?

56
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,520
Besides, why does the team I go to matter to you?

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Is this because you’re unwanted by the teams?

58
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
Aren’t you a little out of line?

59
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,320
I’m worried that the next season

60
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
won’t have good rivals for me.

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,670
Thanks for putting me on a pedestal,

62
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,910
but shouldn’t you be training with my brothers

63
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,630
instead of stalking about here?

64
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,950
Shouldn’t you be looking for your next team

65
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,940
instead of going on a date here?

66
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,450
Alright. Don’t fight anymore. Don’t be angry.

67
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,650
Pei Xi. Let me give you a little advice.

68
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,250
Don’t look so stoic in front of a girl. You’ll scare them.

69
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,730
I don’t have so much free time like you do.

70
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,510
Sorry to keep you waiting. What I made is so much tastier.

71
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,390
Thank you.

72
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,630
Don’t ask.

73
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,380
I haven’t asked yet.

74
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,300
What happened?

75
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,770
I really owe it to you today.

76
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,600
I got to use the members’ room, and ate complimentary food.

77
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Why do you owe the complimentary food to me?

78
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,040
I feel that Pei Xi keeps on barging in

79
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,800
because he thinks I’m in the way.

80
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,260
In the way? What do you mean?

81
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,980
He’s clearly into you.

82
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,620
Should I keep my distance from you?

83
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,060
I might be obstructing your love life.

84
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,340
Teacher Ji. Ever since the tabloids between us happened,

85
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,220
I have no love life left.

86
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,820
Does it mean that I will be responsible for you for life?

87
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,020
No way.

88
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,130
Actually, I really want to know which team you’ll go to.

89
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,490
Do you want the truth?

90
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,850
Actually, up until today,

91
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,030
not a single team has approached me.

92
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,030
Isn’t it strange?

93
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,430
I’m good at pretending in front of other people.

94
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,830
When I’m with you, I spill the whole truth.

95
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,950
This is why we’re sincere friends.

96
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,430
Hi, Leo.

97
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,540
Well, hi, Ji Xiang Kong. This is Inception’s manager.

98
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,300
I heard that you’ve left Legends.

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,300
I’d like to ask you: would you like to join us

100
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,960
and fight for next year’s world championships?

101
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,560
Thank you for inviting me.

102
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,480
I know Inception is one of the best teams.

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,760
But my dream is to be a Chinese player.

104
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,040
Thank you. Bye.

105
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
Inception?

106
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,870
Who just called you? What happened?

107
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,150
Inception is inviting me to join their team.

108
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,710
But I turned them down.

109
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,710
Why?

110
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,060
This -

111
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,100
Isn’t Inception the third best team in the world?

112
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,900
This is going to be a long story.

113
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,490
Tell me. I’m your most loyal listener.

114
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,770
When I was a junior in university,

115
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,170
I joined a domestic exchange tournament.

116
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,810
I heard the foreign teams laughing at China’s team.

117
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,690
I got angry and asked for a match.

118
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,730
Wanna play with my Thorny Queen, stupid boy?

119
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,040
The Hellcaster bought the Soul Tears.

120
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,440
He saw through Thorny Queen’s strategy.

121
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,800
Instead of receiving damage,

122
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,190
he healed himself through her powers.

123
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,830
This is something even

124
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,230
most professional players wouldn’t know.

125
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,700
Don’t go up. Back off.

126
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,420
Wait. Don’t go there. He set up a trap ahead.

127
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,180
No.

128
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,940
Victory!

129
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,540
Ji Xiang Kong, you’re amazing!

130
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,860
You’ve made us Chinese people proud.

131
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,570
Hello. Would you like to join a professional team?

132
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,050
And you joined a professional team?

133
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,690
After my graduation, I officially joined a professional team.

134
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,880
My favorite team back then,

135
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,400
the pioneers of the Chinese teams, had long been disbanded.

136
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,640
After them, China hasn’t clinched another world championship.

137
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,340
Foreign media mocked our teams for lacking strategy.

138
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,460
I had just graduated, and I joined a club, kickstarting my career.

139
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,500
That’s why you’ve been rejecting foreign teams’ invitations?

140
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,900
If I’m lucky enough to win the world championships,

141
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,620
I would win it as part of a Chinese team.

142
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,860
This was my original intention when I became a professional player,

143
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,820
and a promise I made to Gu Fang.

144
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,810
I, Qiu Ying, admire people with dreams the most.

145
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,630
Ji Xiang Kong. I believe that you’ll stand on the peak of the world.

146
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,830
I hope that it would be you on the

147
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,710
commentary stand, to announce to the world

148
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,550
that the Chinese team has won the championship.

149
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,110
It’s a promise.

150
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,750
It’s a promise.

151
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,390
Let us congratulate Team Chuan Qi

152
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,460
as they clinch the world championships this year!

153
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,340
Thank you for your support.

154
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,920
Congratulations, Ji Xiang Kong!

155
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,570
You’ve scared me to death.

156
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,330
What are you doing this early in the morning?

157
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,090
I’m scaring you? Tell me.

158
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,530
What nice dream were you having?

159
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,050
You were grinning like a smitten fool.

160
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,290
It must have been you having that nice dream.

161
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,010
Why do you have a face mask on in the morning?

162
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,840
You gave this to me the specially formulated mud mask!

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Of course I have to use it.

164
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,550
I am going to become a delicate, feminine girl.

165
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,910
How does it look? Does my skin look bouncy and moist after the mask?

166
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,550
Are you jealous?

167
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,030
Alright. You’re a delicate, feminine girl. I’m so jealous.

168
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,740
Let’s not talk about pointless things.

169
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,460
Tell me. What time did you come home last night?

170
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,980
11PM.

171
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,700
Really?

172
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,100
12AM.

173
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,890
You came home so late. Tell me. What were you doing?

174
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,130
I’m going to put on a face mask.

175
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,010
You -

176
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,360
Come back! You can’t put it on yet. Tell me clearly.

177
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
Don’t tell me you were at Dream Traveller.

178
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
I looked for you there.

179
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,420
Alright. I’ll tell you the truth. I was with Ji Xiang Kong.

180
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,260
Him again? I knew it.

181
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,380
He was teaching me how to play the escalade.

182
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,980
Did you know? I’m now number 65 on the list. Aren’t I great?

183
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,980
Most importantly, Ji Xiang Kong turned down

184
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,740
the team ranked third in the world: Inception.

185
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,340
Excuse me. Sister Qiu. Can you please control yourself?

186
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,570
You used to have tens of thousands of fans. Goddess Qiu.

187
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,530
Why are you behaving like one of Ji Xiang Kong’s

188
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,010
stupid, brainwashed fans?

189
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,770
I can’t stand you. It’s useless talking to you.

190
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,190
I’m heading to work. Put on your mask.

191
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,270
Captain. Thank you for taking care of us during this time.

192
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,630
Even if you aren’t here in the future, I’ll be sure to work hard.

193
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,950
Hi, Captain. That’s strange. It’s Chuan Qi’s captain.

194
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,110
There’s cake. Who bought this?

195
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,780
Is this a farewell party for our captain who’s suddenly disappeared?

196
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,780
It’s my treat.

197
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,260
Today -

198
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Our stoic ex-captain is actually treating everyone to cake.

199
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,440
I’m so shocked. My hand trembled.

200
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
We’ll be meeting as rivals next.

201
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,440
Don’t be so polite. It’s unnecessary.

202
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,640
Qi Yue. What are you doing?

203
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,390
Let’s be straight. Pei Xi, when you were here at Wei Teng,

204
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,780
Shu Wen and I groomed you to the best of our abilities.

205
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,580
All of our strategies and plays revolved around you.

206
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,300
We groomed you to be the best mid-single.

207
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,300
The new season is about to begin, and you’re leaving?

208
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,890
Have you considered our feelings?

209
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,890
This selfish scum isn’t going to consider our feelings.

210
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,650
We were just discussing the other night

211
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,290
how to protect one with four in this new season

212
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,490
for you to win Best Player in the match,

213
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,730
and to give Wei Teng a shot at being champion.

214
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,610
The very next day, you’re leaving us for Chuan Qi.

215
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,250
You’ve played well this time.

216
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
You and I both want to win the championship.

217
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
With our current play, however, it will be impossible.

218
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,680
If we keep playing this way,

219
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,350
we’ll be getting in the way of each other’s careers.

220
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,590
Do you understand what he’s saying?

221
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,390
All the strategies and protection for you were devised by you.

222
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,300
Since you couldn’t do it, you decided to become a traitor

223
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,180
and betray all of our blood, sweat, and tears.

224
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,700
You turn around and become Captain in our opponents’ team.

225
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,660
Is this how it is?

226
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,420
Without our sacrifices, could you enjoy the fame you have today?

227
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,020
What happened?

228
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,260
Nothing.

229
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,810
Besides, Sister Shu Wen is so good to you. Is this how you repay her?

230
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,850
Ingrate.

231
00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:00,120
That’s enough. Pei Xi. I respect your decision.

232
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,640
We’re grateful for your contributions towards Wei Teng.

233
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,790
All the best in the future.

234
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,220
Thank you, Coach. I’ll never forget you. You’re my teacher.

235
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,580
Ah Xuan. Where are you going?

236
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,620
Leave me alone.

237
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,940
Brother. I really do understand how you feel.

238
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,980
I’m sadder than you are.

239
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,800
I want to punch Zhao Yang more than you do.

240
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,200
But what good would that do? Ji is gone.

241
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,320
Pei Xi has signed the contract. No one can change reality.

242
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,000
If you keep causing trouble, Zhao Yang won’t leave you alone.

243
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,640
When Ji left, he told us to train hard, and fight hard.

244
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,670
If you stay this way, even I wouldn’t be able to hold it in.

245
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,150
Captain is gone. Brother Kong is gone.

246
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,070
What will I fight for? What will I train for?

247
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,020
We still have a two-year contract with Chuan Qi.

248
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,980
You’re ruining the rest of us too.

249
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
Alright. I understand.

250
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,970
-Brother Xuan. -Yes?

251
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,330
Zhao Yang is here with Pei Xi.

252
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,290
President Jin.

253
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,530
Pei Xi.

254
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,770
Welcome, Pei Xi.

255
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
That’s alright. We’ll be family very soon.

256
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,240
We don’t have to be so formal.

257
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,320
Yeah.

258
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,950
Let me know if anyone on the team is uncooperative.

259
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,190
President Jin. Did you know that when

260
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,780
the news of Pei Xi signing a contract with us went out,

261
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,620
two of Wei Teng’s sponsors called me immediately?

262
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,980
They wanted to work together for the next two seasons.

263
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,380
They’ll give us all their support.

264
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,540
Look. Once Pei Xi has joined us, the sponsors have followed.

265
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,580
Looks like the champion title is within our reach.

266
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,060
Did Ji Xiang Kong leave because of me?

267
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,050
Ji Xiang Kong’s departure has nothing to do with you.

268
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,850
Don’t feel guilty or concerned.

269
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,720
Have you been given a tour of the company yet?

270
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,480
Let me show you around.

271
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
Who could it have been but me?

272
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,440
This -

273
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,780
What’s he doing, Coach Luo?

274
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,420
What are you doing?

275
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Hey! Are you causing trouble again?

276
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,620
Lin Yi Xuan. What are you up to?

277
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,140
Why are you here with your gymming equipment?

278
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,260
Isn’t this the new captain? I’m here to say hello to him.

279
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,220
Right, Manager Zhao?

280
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
We’re going to be brothers.

281
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,700
We’ll prepare for the new season together. Alright?

282
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,060
Coach Luo.

283
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,490
Let’s work together to bring glory and victory as Pei Xi

284
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,890
joins us, and reach for the peak.

285
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,010
Welcome.

286
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,550
Wait and see, punk.

287
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,350
He’s young. He’s still young.

288
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,230
You’re still strangers.

289
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,150
Once you’ve warmed up to one another, it’ll be fine.

290
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,390
Right, Coach Luo?

291
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,270
Pei Xi. Hey, Pei Xi.

292
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,430
What happened?

293
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,180
He’s a genius. All geniuses are like this. They’re lone wolves.

294
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,860
This is too much.

295
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
Coach Luo. It’s embarrassing how you trained these kids.

296
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Discipline them.

297
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
I’ll check on Pei Xi.

298
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
This is my strategy analysis on team Xin Tu.

299
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,230
Take a look.

300
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,830
They’ve won 26 times in the last season.

301
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,390
20 wins were thanks to a defensive, delaying strategy.

302
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,910
If they could achieve some breakthrough

303
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,900
on the strategies, they have a shot

304
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
in the new season to fight in Vancouver.

305
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,900
Xiang Kong. Let’s not discuss strategy today.

306
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,490
Look at the contract.

307
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,290
If it’s acceptable, we’ll sign it right away.

308
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,290
Gu Fang called me personally.

309
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,240
Xin Tu has always had our eye on you.

310
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,840
But every team has different strategic dynamics.

311
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,760
You’re new. If you want the team

312
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,390
to carry out your moves immediately, it won’t be appropriate.

313
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,470
But if you perform well in the next few seasons,

314
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,630
the board will consider letting you lead the team.

315
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,740
President Chen. I don’t mind the position I play.

316
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,180
But I hope to be able to unleash my strengths.

317
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,060
If my strategies are worthless to your team,

318
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,220
my entrance will be meaningless.

319
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,090
Xiang Kong. As a friend and your mentor,

320
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,130
let me give you some advice. Don’t be so idealistic.

321
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,760
But I’m willing to bet on my ideals.

322
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,680
Thank you for the coffee. I’ll take my leave.

323
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Everything’s been served.

324
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,500
This is sumptuous, Brother Sun!

325
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,300
Have you already guessed that

326
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,860
my meeting with Xin Tu would end badly?

327
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,020
Xin Tu’s dreams are too small for your big ambitions.

328
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,660
Don’t praise me like that, Brother Sun. I’ll be embarrassed.

329
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,020
You? Embarrassed?

330
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,420
You’re free-loading off of me every day,

331
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,420
but I’ve never seen you feeling guilty.

332
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,180
What about this? I’ll work for you from tomorrow on.

333
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,170
You’re a national champion. I can’t afford you.

334
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,570
But I’ve given it serious thought.

335
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,230
Since Xin Tu doesn’t want your strategies,

336
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,510
there is a team that might suit you perfectly.

337
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,710
Which team?

338
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,630
Wei Teng.

339
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,550
Sister Wen’s team?

340
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,870
Brother Sun. I’ve known you for so long.

341
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,830
This is the first time you’ve brought up Sister Shu Wen.

342
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,190
Don’t fool around with me at this crucial juncture.

343
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,550
Keep going.

344
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,670
What do you think of Shu Wen?

345
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,940
Sister Wen is a role model among women.

346
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,980
Apart from you and Captain, the person I admire most

347
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,820
in the e-sports industry is Sister Wen.

348
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,320
She’s the only one apart from Gu Fang

349
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,560
who is willing to take risks in the e-sports industry.

350
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,600
That’s true.

351
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,920
The only good team I haven’t contacted is Wei Teng.

352
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,360
Their sponsors have their sights locked on Pei Xi.

353
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,680
After Pei Xi left, they’ve been through some hard times.

354
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,830
I’m afraid that my reputation will drag Sister Wen down.

355
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,350
Whether you drag her down

356
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,510
is not something for you to worry about.

357
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,310
Take Pei Xi for example.

358
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,750
Perhaps he’s better at maneuvering.

359
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,420
But you’re better at reading people.

360
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,300
The championships are always about psychological warfare.

361
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,020
If you go to Wei Teng, you’ll lift them up another rank.

362
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,330
If Sister Wen needed me, she would’ve contacted me by now.

363
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,970
Forget it.

364
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,210
If you’re done with it, come back and manage this small website.

365
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,280
If you still want to give it a go, give Shu Wen a call.

366
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,840
Tell her that you can give her a whole new Wei Teng.

367
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,780
Please enjoy.

368
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Thank you.

369
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,740
President Yuan called me yesterday.

370
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,850
I know. He went to Chuan Qi with Pei Xi.

371
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,170
The sponsors are just so practical.

372
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,410
They’ll follow whomever has the most commercial value.

373
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Your stomach is hurting. You were drinking with President Yuan, right?

374
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,220
I’m fine. If our team can perform well,

375
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,260
even the sponsors who had left will come back.

376
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,540
Don’t worry. I’m doing my best.

377
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,460
It’s been tough on us recently. Thank you.

378
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,060
Oh yes.

379
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,220
There’s a kid in the youth training camp with a lot of potential.

380
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,130
I believe that we can groom him.

381
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,850
He may very well become the next Pei Xi.

382
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,290
But I don’t want the next Pei Xi.

383
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,470
Ever since Pei Xi came to Wei Teng,

384
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,950
our strategy hasn’t evolved or changed.

385
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,270
It’s always been four protecting one.

386
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,310
I was thinking that Pei Xi’s

387
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,350
departure may be a blessing in disguise.

388
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,870
But we’ve been doing well with this strategy.

389
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,750
That is why Pei Xi’s departure

390
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,070
had such drastic consequences.

391
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,910
This is not my ideal team.

392
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,350
Ideals and reality often have their differences.

393
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,830
I have a simple plan.

394
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,060
We’ll pick a kid from the youth training camp to fill in the gap.

395
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,980
We’ll then promote Qi Yue to be captain.

396
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,220
Li Gan. Qi Yue does have solid capabilities.

397
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,260
But his personality is not suitable for the role of Captain.

398
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,040
But we don’t have any other suitable candidates.

399
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Let me think about it.

400
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,120
Do you have some time tomorrow, Sister Wen?

401
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,320
I’d like to have a chat.

402
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,020
What good does this training do?

403
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,860
It’s the same move over and over again.

404
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,260
I’m done.

405
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,570
Yi Xuan. Stop talking.

406
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,770
Am I wrong?

407
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,650
Lin Yi Xuan.

408
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,410
The training match is about to begin. Have a break.

409
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,610
Pei Xi.

410
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,490
President Jin.

411
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,400
Pei Xi. You’re my lucky star.

412
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,240
Just now, President Yuan, Wei Teng’s sponsor,

413
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,760
has come over to sponsor us because of you.

414
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,470
I didn’t tell him to come.

415
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,310
It doesn’t matter. The sponsorships are in place.

416
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,830
Three days later, we’ll upgrade all of the facilities

417
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,790
in the training room.

418
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,300
These have been brought to you by your new captain.

419
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,820
Do thank him well.

420
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,100
Thank you, President Jin. Thanks, Captain.

421
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,340
Alright. I’ll leave you to it.

422
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,260
The training match will begin soon. Do cooperate with your new captain.

423
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,860
Work hard together.

424
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,940
-Understood. -Let’s work hard.

425
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,850
I’m leaving.

426
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,010
See you, President. See you, President.

427
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Our Brother Kong didn’t care about

428
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,600
pleasing sponsors and begging for upgrades every day.

429
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,500
Our new captain is great. He doesn’t think about strategy,

430
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
only about pleasing sponsors. How brilliant.

431
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,420
I told you. I didn’t tell President Yuan to come here.

432
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,060
Don’t think that your small acts of benefit can win us over.

433
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,460
Who’s trying to win you over? Do you want to play?

434
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,930
Plenty of people can play support characters.

435
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,130
Are you looking down on support characters?

436
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,130
Lin Yi Xuan. It’s 5 minutes to the match.

437
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,370
Let’s calm down.

438
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,710
Aren’t you amazing? I’m not playing. Go ahead and play.

439
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,790
Lin Yi Xuan. Lin Yi Xuan.

440
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,510
Where are you going?

441
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,750
Don’t stop him.

442
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,950
No, Captain. Without a support, how

443
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,230
will we fight against a team of 5?

444
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,310
We can win even with a team of 4.

445
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,750
Come over, everyone. Come here.

446
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,060
Come.

447
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,580
What’s up, Director?

448
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,340
You’re all here. This morning, President Li of Wei Teng

449
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,980
gave me a call. He hoped that we would

450
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,120
interview Qi Yue from their team.

451
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
I couldn’t reject his request.

452
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
Who’s willing to take this up?

453
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,040
Me.

454
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,160
Anyone else?

455
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
Director. Yi Yi wants to go.

456
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,400
Alright, Yi Yi. It’s all yours.

457
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,430
-Me? -Go ahead.

458
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,590
Thank you, Director.

459
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,070
Let’s go. I haven’t finished my tea.

460
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,660
-Li Nan. -I’m here.

461
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,780
There are eyes.

462
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,210
I’m convinced.

463
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,610
We won with four people against five.

464
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,390
You must have very high EQ to fend off these mean-spirited comments.

465
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,660
What can I do for him?

466
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:45,840
Actually, he has supporters. I’ll screenshot them all.

467
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,080
I’m back. I’m so exhausted. What are you doing?

468
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,020
Nothing.

469
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,900
What are you sneakily up to?

470
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,820
I’m busy with something.

471
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,700
Why are you so tired?

472
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,420
Isn’t your Buddhist magazine company quite relaxed?

473
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,660
They’re relaxed. I’m doomed.

474
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,900
Let me give you a back rub.

475
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,140
A massage for you. Here. Be gentle.

476
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,580
Tell me about the unhappy stories so I can feel happy.

477
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,210
Are you really my friend?

478
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,690
I have to interview Qi Yue at Wei Teng tomorrow.

479
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,110
Isn’t that great?

480
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,590
But I don’t know him.

481
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,070
I had to do last-minute research on him the whole day.

482
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,710
I’m so angry about this.

483
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,950
Tell me. Didn’t they ask us for an interview?

484
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,670
But they’ve changed the timing three times.

485
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,590
I want to see what genius this Qi Yue is.

486
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,830
Be gentle! It hurts!

487
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,750
My bad.

488
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,980
On a serious note, Qi Yue

489
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,340
is Wei Teng’s captain, the pioneer member, and the boss’ disciple.

490
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,660
It’s natural for him to put on airs.

491
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,220
He’s Shu Wen’s disciple?

492
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
Li Gan’s disciple.

493
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,760
You know so much.

494
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,840
Since you know him so well, why don’t you come

495
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
with me to the interview tomorrow?

496
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,120
You can be my photography assistant.

497
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,480
I’ll show you some things tomorrow,

498
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,990
and let you see what truly makes up a team.

499
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,750
This way, it’ll be beneficial

500
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,870
for you as you join the competition.

501
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,550
What about it? Aren’t I good to you?

502
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,540
You treat me the best.

503
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,340
I think so, too.

504
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,260
You’re just scared to go alone.

505
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,260
Why would I be scared?

506
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,940
You’re scared.

507
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,490
You haven’t told me what you were sneaking about for just now.

508
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,450
Enough. I’ll go with you tomorrow, alright?

509
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,610
I’ll be your assistant. Are you happy now?

510
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,650
I’m busy. Bye.

511
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:08,930
You -

512
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,330
You’re so sneaky! Something must be up!
