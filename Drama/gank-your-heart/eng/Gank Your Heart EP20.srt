1
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 20

2
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,710
If you shoot this way,

3
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,270
your next shot still wont be accurate.

4
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,030
You are still the same you in the past.

5
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,150
Once you feel stressed,

6
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,750
you'll come here for archery.

7
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,070
Tomorow is VNG's survival battle round.

8
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,430
If we lose,

9
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,710
we're destined to not be qualified.

10
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,100
Although I support Xiang Kong's tactic,

11
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,540
but I don't feel steady deep down.

12
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,500
You're not made of iron,

13
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,380
don't give yourself so much pressure.

14
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,120
Relax.

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
If you shoot the red area with one shot.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,280
you guys will definitely win tomorrow.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
Aim properly.

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
Relax.

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
I'll definitely hit bull's eye this time.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't boast.

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
So, for tomorrow's competition

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,750
if I say we'll win,

23
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,710
we'll definitely win.

24
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,230
Look.

25
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,390
If we really win tomorrow,

26
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,700
what do you want to eat for this month?

27
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,860
I'll buy it.

28
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,940
Who wants you to provide food?

29
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,260
Then, what do you want?

30
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,290
Be my boyfriend.

31
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,210
Thank you.

32
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,940
Don't be nervous.

33
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,820
Relax while we're playing against him.

34
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,220
Kong ge.

35
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,820
You're really handsome today.

36
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,820
Ji handsome.

37
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,660
Why am I scared when I see you?

38
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,220
Pei Xi.

39
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,850
your members already said so.

40
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,810
I've already won half the battle.

41
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,010
Then show what you have.

42
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:27,930
Pei Xi.

43
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,210
Then you better watch them properly.

44
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,370
Don't let me win easily.

45
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,280
I know them like the back of my hand.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
Don't blame me for being heartless.

47
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Ji handsome, you've already said it like that.

48
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
Then all the more we shouldn't go easy.

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,320
Right.

50
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,320
Kong ge.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,360
Let's meet later.

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,400
Oh.

53
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,900
I've waited for this day for very long.

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,980
Hope that you guys don't lose too quickly.

55
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,820
See if you guys have the abilities.

56
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,060
I'll take your first blood later.

57
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,620
Do you hear me?

58
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,260
Okay, little ones.

59
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,740
How is the preparation coming along?

60
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,540
We're prepared.

61
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,100
Very good.

62
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,340
Relax.

63
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,740
Tonight's stage

64
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,300
is yours.

65
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,580
Okay.

66
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,380
Fighting.

67
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,460
Fighting.

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,500
Welcome all summoners

69
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,850
to our Spring season's

70
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,450
conventional competition venue.

71
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,690
Today's competition is highly anticipated.

72
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,370
For VNG,

73
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,090
this is a

74
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,170
survival battle.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:20,970
Then, coming up next,

76
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,650
let us see

77
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,110
the current accumulated points

78
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,710
for all 16 teams in the competition.

79
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,510
Currently placing first,

80
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,470
Legends.

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,190
VNG is at the end.

82
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,590
According to the competition's point system,

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,830
if VNG loses yet

84
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,750
another round,

85
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,750
they will not be fated to partake in

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,750
the after season competition.

87
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,110
It's like this...

88
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,470
If we just purely look at the points,

89
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,830
the difference between the two teams

90
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,590
are pretty special.

91
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,150
On conquer's competition site,

92
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,990
there'll always be a miracle happening

93
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,510
at any moment.

94
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,990
There's never a forever champion.

95
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,070
But everyone

96
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,870
is charging towards

97
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
the route of being champions.

98
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,830
But actually today,

99
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,460
there's also another highlight.

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,780
It's Pei Xi and Ji Xiang Kong.

101
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,980
The two ace players'

102
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,020
first battle after switching teams.

103
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,900
Next, let's invite

104
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
these two teams

105
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,700
on stage.

106
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,040
Welcome.

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
Too passionate.

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Since everyone's so passionate,

109
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
let's see.

110
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,510
Where are VNG's fans?

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,190
Legends fans.

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,590
Let me hear you guys.

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,310
Okay?

114
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,860
Actually,

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,780
based on the current statistics,

116
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
I'm really nervous for VNG.

117
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,370
But,

118
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,610
today, I suddenly saw

119
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,650
their main coaches,

120
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,250
both Shu Wen and Li Gan

121
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,250
appear to be at ease.

122
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,370
I've also discovered that.

123
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,410
Exactly what's the reason for acting so?

124
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,130
Do they have a trump card?

125
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,770
Let us anticipate today.

126
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,450
VNG and Legends'

127
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,250
exciting performance.

128
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,040
has officially begin.

129
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,040
Now, we declare the competition

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay, let's invite the members to have a seat.

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,380
When saying the statistics later,

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,620
remember not to say it wrongly.

133
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,740
Relax, no problem.

134
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Why did VNG switch positions?

135
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,900
Why is Lu Sheng playing mid solo?

136
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,410
Is Ji Xiang Kong

137
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,490
trying to joke with VNG?

138
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,250
If they lose another round,

139
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,490
his reputation is going to be gone.

140
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,370
It's okay if his reputation is gone.

141
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,730
Anyway his reputation isn't good.

142
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,120
It's a pity for VNG.

143
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,880
Ji Xiang Kong is going to ruin them.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,640
VNG made such changes

145
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,680
for doing so.

146
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,680
Ji Xiang kong definitely has reasons

147
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,020
And he knows Legends the best.

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,540
I feel that VNG will definitely win this time.

149
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,900
Then based on what you said,

150
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,900
Pei Xi knows VNG better.

151
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,540
Sis,

152
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,500
Pei Xi has been taking pretty good care of you.

153
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,780
Why do you wish for him to lose?

154
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes.

155
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,140
Don't start anything.

156
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm not.

157
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,620
Summer ge.

158
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,940
Let me ask you something.

159
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,220
Pei Xi and Ji Xiang Kong,

160
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,500
who do you wish would win?

161
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,940
My cousin,

162
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,660
he looks very cold.

163
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,890
Actually, he's a warm guy.

164
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,810
Ji Xiang Kong is not bad too.

165
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,050
But,

166
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,010
he attracts a lot of women.

167
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,650
It's a little dangerous don't you think so?

168
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,370
Summer ge.

169
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,830
Actually,

170
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,310
whoever wins, whoever loses,

171
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,230
it doesn't really matter to me.

172
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,990
to be given to me.

173
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,990
The money they win isn't going

174
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,870
Yes.

175
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,510
That goody goody.

176
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,470
This-

177
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,030
Elder brother is here.

178
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,190
Look after this place here.

179
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,270
Let's see.

180
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,350
Here, VNG has bravely

181
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,710
made changes to members' positions.

182
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,460
But I feel that

183
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,820
Lu Sheng still looks like he hasn't

184
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,780
gotten accustomed to

185
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,980
the position and moves of mid solo.

186
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,140
So,

187
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
let me predict a little.

188
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,200
maybe VNG's chance of turning things around

189
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,320
is not high.

190
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,320
That might not be true.

191
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,320
Don't forget

192
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,680
Ji Xiang Kong's nickname

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,280
is battleground fraudster.

194
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,080
Really?

195
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,240
Since he made such an adjustment,

196
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,920
I believe that

197
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,240
he came prepared.

198
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Besides,

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,520
Three years ago, in New Lands, Lu Sheng

200
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
played the mid solo position.

201
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,680
I believe that as long as his team mate

202
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
can create a good

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
environment for him,

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,630
he can create a miracle.

205
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:45,870
So,

206
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,030
we hope that Lu Sheng

207
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,030
can bring to us

208
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,030
a good play.

209
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,230
Put on a good condition

210
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,630
and show us a very exciting

211
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,550
first round.

212
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,500
Okay, let's see the routes.

213
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,620
Lin Yi Xuan

214
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,940
he hit his previous leader

215
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,900
at the start.

216
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,540
This guy is a little playful.

217
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,980
Lin Yi Xuan, this guy

218
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,020
is still strolling in front of me.

219
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,090
Just now, I

220
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,290
greeted Kong ge.

221
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,290
Let's go over together.

222
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,290
Okay, let's go.

223
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,370
Let's surround him.

224
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,890
This-

225
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,410
Did you guys discover?

226
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,770
Lu Sheng seems to be playing VNG's mid solo.

227
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,960
They switched positions.

228
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,520
Don't be nervous.

229
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,840
Ji handsome is adjusting his tactics.

230
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
We must ensure economy at the start.

231
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
Shen Yue, follow me.

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't be nervous.

233
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,030
One skill, shadow.

234
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,030
Hit.

235
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,030
Nice.

236
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,470
He managed to guess this.

237
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,870
It seems like Lu Sheng's prediction is accurate.

238
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,590
The leader got caught once he started.

239
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,030
What's the situation?

240
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,060
I injured him.

241
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,940
Someone come and catch him.

242
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,660
Qi Yue.

243
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,260
Go and help at the mid field.

244
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,660
His levels now is already very low.

245
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,180
Why are you so nervous?

246
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Broke my momentum to save you.

247
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,260
Lu Sheng can't hold on any longer.

248
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,900
Quickly go and help.

249
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,740
This momentum... he wants to reverse the killing.

250
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,580
This momentum.

251
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,860
Pei Xi used flying double waves.

252
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,260
He broke the ice.

253
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,580
And got the first blood.

254
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,100
Nice.

255
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Brilliant.

256
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,250
Nice.

257
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,970
Qi Yue already rushed over.

258
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,890
But it seems like he was too late.

259
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,770
What's wrong with Qi Yue?

260
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,730
If Qi Yue could have reached earlier,

261
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,090
by even just a little bit...

262
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,680
What is he thinking really?

263
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
And catch Pei Xi-

264
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
Yes, it's a pity.

265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,480
This move-

266
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,840
Pei Xi's move is really exciting.

267
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
Awesome. Really awesome.

268
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,800
Leader, it's my fault.

269
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:26,900
It's okay.

270
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,980
First, aid him with the army.

271
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,020
Don't go and fight.

272
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,820
Lu Sheng, if you can't don't do it.

273
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,380
It's because you got injured badly.

274
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,180
Everyone develop,

275
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,780
don't fight.

276
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,660
Have a good field of vision.

277
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,340
Tong Wu.

278
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,140
Go and help in the mid route.

279
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,820
- Look.

280
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,820
Okay.

281
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,580
Auxiliary Tong Wu,

282
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,340
has now secretly

283
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,740
reached Lu Sheng's side.

284
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,820
They've already released the fog.

285
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,300
make a move on Pei Xi.

286
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,300
Seems like they're going to

287
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,700
in the wild area?

288
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,700
Did you guys do a field of vision

289
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,380
Not yet.

290
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,100
Don't go and capture others.

291
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
By the time you're done arranging,

292
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,740
we wouldn't know where Pei Xi has gone?

293
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,980
Shen Yue, let's go.

294
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,980
Leader.

295
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,290
We see that Qi Yue and Shen Yue,

296
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,250
have released fog at the wild area.

297
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,130
Lu Feng, Li Nan, protect me.

298
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,170
Don't go and catch others.

299
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,330
Put a field of vision first before doing that.

300
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,090
This is Ji Xiang Kong's tactic.

301
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,730
Always hiding under the tower.

302
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,070
Shen Yue, go.

303
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,110
Okay, I go first.

304
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,350
First mid solo...

305
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,550
Sorry.

306
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,510
Go.

307
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,750
There's a trap.

308
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,670
Qi ge what do we do?

309
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,510
We are caught now.

310
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,150
Tong Wu.

311
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,030
Help.

312
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,670
They only have three people.

313
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,670
Tong Wu, don't go.

314
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,390
You're setting yourself up for death.

315
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,590
So you're just going to let me die?

316
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,470
Now, you guys are already injured.

317
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,430
Even if Tong Wu goes, it's useless.

318
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,860
Don't you trust us?

319
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,700
Tong Wu, hurry.

320
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,000
Triple kill, nice.

321
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,400
Pei Xi's tactic this time

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
is really good.

323
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,160
No wonder he's the rising mid solo.

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,120
And we see

325
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,760
the fans below...

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,560
are very crazy now.

327
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,480
Yes, I can already hear their screams.

328
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Yes, it feels

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
as if they already won.

330
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,000
Lu Sheng,

331
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
can't withstand

332
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Pei Xi such worldwide level's mid solo.

333
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,520
And next, he chose the hell's messenger,

334
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,870
he can't handle it well.

335
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,510
The economy difference is so wide.

336
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,070
We can't win.

337
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,140
Mid solo Lu Sheng is fine.

338
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,850
I know, it's Qi Yue's problem.

339
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,690
Sorry.

340
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,770
VNG's going to lose

341
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,130
why's your spirit still floating?

342
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,290
It's okay. It's only the first round.

343
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,650
Hold on.

344
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,360
At this time,

345
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
I should probably not disturb him.

346
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,470
Nice!

347
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
Delay their time.

348
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,590
It's okay, I'll clear the armies first.

349
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,030
Lu Sheng.

350
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,670
Let's clear the army quickly.

351
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,590
Okay.

352
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,870
Go back, protect the tower.

353
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,750
Meet in the mid route.

354
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,020
Let's push the crystal.

355
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,620
They're here.

356
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,380
I defeated Kong ge just now.

357
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,700
Push the tower first.

358
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,780
Shitty tactic.

359
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,730
It's okay.

360
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,970
Let's win the next round.

361
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,490
Let's go back and rest first.

362
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,040
Qi ge, don't be angry.

363
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,220
Be a little more confident in yourself.

364
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,820
Next round,

365
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,820
everyone return to their original positions.

366
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,740
Lu Sheng is okay as mid solo.

367
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,340
I am ordering you.

368
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Not discussing with you.

369
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,100
CEO Li,

370
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,570
you and Wen jie chose me to be leader

371
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,370
then, you should trust me.

372
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,090
Ji Xiang Kong.

373
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,410
The next round is the last round.

374
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,490
Affects our life or death.

375
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,370
conventional competition before.

376
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,370
VNG has never lost at the

377
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,690
You know it concerns our survival too.

378
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:25,890
Let me ask you.

379
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,390
Who let you attack Pei Xi?

380
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,150
Pei Xi is strong at the start.

381
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,870
If at the start, we-

382
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,550
So you made your own decisions.

383
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,430
By doing this,

384
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,830
isn't it setting yourself up for death?

385
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,230
And Tong Wu.

386
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,750
If you know you can't fight,

387
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,750
why did you charge?

388
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,790
The next round.

389
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,990
No one acts on their own.

390
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
If you don't listen to instructions,

391
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,980
you'll become a substitute.

392
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,260
I know everyone wants to win really bad,

393
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,440
so you're too anxious.

394
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,120
Let's adjust our moods for the next round.

395
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,520
Be a little more steady.

396
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
There's a chance of winning.

397
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Let's treat the first round as

398
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,040
an appetiser.

399
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
Next, we're starting our second round.

400
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,280
Its the deciding call.

401
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Will the Legends

402
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,200
continue playing their mid solo fairytale?

403
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Or will VNG turn the situation around?

404
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,470
Next, we'll start the second round's

405
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,430
selection round.

406
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,870
Okay, let's see.

407
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,510
VNG snatched Ah Xin after coming on.

408
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,910
Everyone witnessed

409
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Pei Xi's tactic just now.

410
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,190
This hero

411
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,140
usually appears in a four protecting one situation.

412
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,700
So you mean that

413
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,380
this time round, VNG might be

414
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
using this tactic?

415
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,940
This is hard to tell.

416
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,980
Since Ji Xiang Kong's nickname is

417
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,410
battleground fraudster.

418
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,530
So, any tactic

419
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,530
is possible.

420
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,170
That's right too.

421
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,410
Come, let's continue observing

422
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,650
the hero selection situation.

423
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,170
Did you see?

424
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,890
Pei Xi took his life hero,

425
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,770
Hell's messenger.

426
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,450
This round,

427
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,890
VNG is going to lose really badly.

428
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:01,930
Right.

429
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,730
Look at this situation.

430
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,290
It's obvious they're giving up on themselves.

431
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,970
That might not be true.

432
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,680
Ji Xiang Kong is the battleground fraudster.

433
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,200
Sis,

434
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,520
this Pei Xi

435
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
takes pretty good care of you.

436
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,800
Why are you not supporting him?

437
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,920
I-

438
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,950
You don't know this right?

439
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,630
Qiu Ying is seperating personal and work matters.

440
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,070
Helping only the one she likes.

441
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,270
What do you know?

442
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,020
I'm saying the truth.

443
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,180
four protecting one strategy at most.

444
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,180
Legends is going to choose the

445
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,460
Do you dare to bet?

446
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,580
Why not?

447
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
If VNG wins,

448
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,140
you have to treat everyone here to milk tea.

449
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,980
Who's scared?

450
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,140
Yes.

451
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,020
Let's see.

452
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,410
You didn't let me know that you're watching.

453
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,520
Move in.

454
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,840
Why are you here?

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I want to ask you that too.

456
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Being able to see you here,

457
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,420
really.

458
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,940
It's harder than winning the lottery.

459
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,820
Are you here to watch the competition?

460
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,500
Or are you here to see others?

461
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,180
I'm here to watch Xiang Kong compete.

462
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,420
What's the matter?

463
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,380
Nothing.

464
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,660
The view here isn't good.

465
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,540
If you reallly want to watch them compete,

466
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,900
I'll bring you to the coach's seats.

467
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,180
Go.

468
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,860
You really

469
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,860
want to start trouble right?

470
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,490
Summer.

471
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,570
Summer ge.

472
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,450
It's really you. Hello.

473
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,570
I didn't expect to be able to see you here.

474
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,830
Can I have a picture with you?

475
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,830
Sure.

476
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,590
Brother, move away for a bit.

477
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,870
Brother, move away for a bit.

478
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,990
Sorry.

479
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,430
Come, Summer ge.

480
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,270
Three, two, one.

481
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,830
Okay, okay thank you Summer ge.

482
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,150
Watch the competition, okay.

483
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,030
Okay, now, both parties are done choosing.

484
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,630
Next, let us begin our

485
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,820
second round.

486
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Competition begins.

487
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,380
This entertainment round...

488
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,100
No problem.

489
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,260
You two be a little bit more steady.

490
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,900
Don't stroll.

491
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,700
Okay, relax.

492
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,300
Don't worry.

493
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,200
Be careful.

494
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,120
I'll go steal a tally from them.

495
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,400
At the 2 minute mark,

496
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,800
Lin Yi Xuan will definitely go to the river to ambush.

497
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,760
Qi Yue, Shen Yue.

498
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,560
Do a good field of vision.

499
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,560
Go there and wait for him.

500
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Understood.

501
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Double moon team released fog after starting.

502
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,400
Wait at the tally.

503
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,120
No, they-

504
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
How can they predict so accurately?

505
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Lin Yi Xuan is here.

506
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
Lu Feng come and save me.

507
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
Save me.

508
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,560
They immediately went up with two skills,

509
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
and controlled Lin Yi Xuan.

510
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,280
Qi Yue did a powerful move and

511
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,280
took down the opponent.

512
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,550
Nice.

513
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,190
VNG's waiting strategy

514
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,190
is good. Nice.

515
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,270
They waited till Lin Yi Xuan is here.

516
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,390
Such a fat rabbit.

517
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,110
Exactly.

518
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,390
Double moon team's control of their timing

519
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,310
is too accurate.

520
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,510
I asked you not to stroll.

521
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,220
What's happening on the bottom route?

522
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,620
It's definitely my Kong ge.

523
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,780
Only he knows

524
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,580
that I'm willing to come here.

525
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,820
They're doing a four protect one strategy.

526
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,860
Huo Yao and Lu Feng

527
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
in the bottom route.

528
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
will definitely stroll and catch others

529
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,330
Double moon, go and do a field of vision.

530
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,010
Wait for them and reverse the situation.

531
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,290
Understood.

532
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,450
Shen Yue, let's go.

533
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,290
Let's meet them.

534
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,370
Come, let's continue watching the competition.

535
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,330
I'm controlled, you be careful.

536
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,690
Lu Sheng, finish him!

537
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,610
Prepare to jump the tower and kill them.

538
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,490
Double moon team go!

539
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,450
I'll come help you.

540
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,250
Yao ge, hurry.

541
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,410
I'm also controlled.

542
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,570
- Yes.

543
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,570
Good.

544
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,210
Nice.

545
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,130
Double kill.

546
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,680
Huo Yao didn't manage to escape too.

547
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,160
Double moon team's momentum

548
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,360
is perfect.

549
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,230
I can't cross the bottom route.

550
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,270
It's too far.

551
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,150
Li Nan.

552
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,030
Help me at the mid route.

553
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,950
Okay, I'm coming over now.

554
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,990
Yao ge.

555
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,630
This round is a little shaky.

556
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,260
Chong Hou, this hero

557
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,300
is not often used for this position.

558
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,940
Why is Qi Yue so fierce today?

559
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,140
How is Qi Yue good?

560
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,140
It's my Kong ge that's good?

561
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,180
That's true too.

562
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,860
Where did I see this tactic before?

563
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,420
Double moon team.

564
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,780
Double moon team?

565
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,940
Double moon team...

566
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,860
Impossible.

567
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,420
No one can beat the Double moon team.

568
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,100
If my bro is really using the Double moon team,

569
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,020
then he's really too daring.

570
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:11,890
Lu Sheng.

571
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,690
Reverse a little.

572
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,370
I can follow.

573
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,850
They're coming to mid field, be careful.

574
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,130
Prepare.

575
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,320
Ok, go. Hit them.

576
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,400
Qi Yue go.

577
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,200
Okay.

578
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,120
They're here at mid field.

579
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
Behind the tower...

580
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,680
- Okay.

581
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,680
Be careful, hit them wretchedly.

582
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
Go behind, quick.

583
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,360
Follow them.

584
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,880
Hit them.

585
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
Push, continue pushing. Mid route.

586
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
They're pushing.

587
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,700
There's too many people in the mid route.

588
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,500
It's okay.

589
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,340
Support him a while.

590
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,340
Hold on.

591
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,700
Hold on, Li Nan.

592
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,860
He didn't develop.

593
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,820
Control him.

594
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,780
You can hit them.

595
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,660
They've already hit one wave.

596
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,380
Be careful.

597
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,100
Qi Yue, prepare to open the group.

598
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,820
Okay.

599
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,810
Do you see this?

600
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,450
I know that Ji Xiang-

601
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,010
I knew that VNG would win.

602
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,790
That-

603
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,230
Aren't they just even now?

604
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,710
It's not decided who'll buy the milk tea.

605
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,590
Exactly.

606
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,870
Okay, let's see.

607
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,070
who's exactly is the best

608
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,990
in this round.

609
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,670
Qi Yue.

610
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,470
Congratulations Qi Yue.

611
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,710
Well-deserved.

612
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,830
Congratulations Qi Yue.

613
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,670
The Double moon team's attack

614
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,830
and strolling can be said as

615
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,670
really strong.

616
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,110
Matches up to the economy.

617
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,190
And helped provide a competitive edge to VNG.

618
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,300
Okay, let's rest for a while.

619
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,220
Let's anticipate the next exciting competition.

620
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,180
Let's meet in a bit.

621
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,520
Everyone,

622
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,560
well done.

623
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,200
It's normal.

624
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,240
Qi Yue.

625
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,360
You're the best in this round.

626
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,600
This is the condition you should have.

627
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,840
I predict that Legends

628
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,160
is confused by us, Double moon team.

629
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,640
They probably don't even know what happened.

630
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,800
Next up...

631
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,440
Everyone just

632
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,120
maintain this good condition.

633
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,920
Next round,

634
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
let's react steadily.

635
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,720
The next round is the deciding round.

636
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,990
We must win.

637
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,910
Be fearless.

638
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,630
Don't look back.

639
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,750
Fighting.

640
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,510
Fighting.

641
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,410
Drink some water.

642
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,570
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

643
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,320
Try predicting a little.

644
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,880
Ji Xiang Kong.

645
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,280
How will he play later?

646
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Save it.

647
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,440
If I knew how he would play,

648
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,070
what a joke that would be.

649
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,670
VNG

650
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,230
has tasted slight success of the Double moon team.

651
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,630
They'll definitely continue using

652
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,710
this strategy.

653
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,740
Then how should we deal with it?

654
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,900
How to deal with it?

655
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,580
Other than four protecting one,

656
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,460
what other strategies do you know?

657
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
Xiang Kong once analysed you guys.

658
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,180
He analysed Double moons tactic.

659
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,380
And concluded with a tactic.

660
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,650
At the start, choose a

661
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,170
support with more controlling skills.

662
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,850
Paired with a hero that has high

663
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,410
explosiveness and output.

664
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,570
Combine the two.

665
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,690
And kill via strolling.

666
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,810
Break their momentum.

667
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,720
Increasing our competitive edge.

668
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,000
Coach.

669
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,480
What you mean is

670
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,880
using Ji Xiang Kong's method to beat him?

671
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,800
That's right.

672
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,960
Will that work?

673
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,140
Do you have a better method?

674
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,220
We'll play like that.

675
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,620
Legends chose a

676
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,140
world-wrecking demon bull

677
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,980
and Ah Xin.

678
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,700
No.

679
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,740
What is this combination?

680
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,700
I can't understand.

681
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,460
Leader, how do we fight?

682
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,820
This round

683
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,580
let's not use Double moon team.

684
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,140
What joke are you cracking?

685
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,700
How badly did we beat them just now?

686
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,460
It's not as if you didn't see.

687
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:17,980
If they chose

688
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,420
world-wrecking demon bull and Ah Xin,

689
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,330
It's obvious that they're targeting us.

690
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,970
We can't use Double moon team this round.

691
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,570
How do you know?

692
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,170
I taught them this method.

693
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,350
For this round,

694
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,230
let's use four protect one.

695
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,990
Lu Sheng

696
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,830
Choose creator.

697
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,990
We'll protect you.

698
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,830
Four protect one...

699
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,630
So creative.

700
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,510
The creator is so hard to control.

701
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,870
Not everyone can do it.

702
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,190
He's okay.

703
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,630
Okay.

704
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,150
Locked it in.

705
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,630
Luo Tian,

706
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,260
has girls surrounding him everyday.

707
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,660
Calling Teacher Luo here and there.

708
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,100
He wasn't like that in the past.

709
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,420
When Luo Tian first came,

710
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,620
he was really weak.

711
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,660
He wasn't thick skinned.

712
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,980
At that time, everyday,

713
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,840
He's stuck in the practice room playing.

714
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,280
Let's look at VNG.

715
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,240
chose the mid solo hero, Creator.

716
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,120
Lu Sheng just switched to the mid solo position.

717
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
And for the previous two rounds,

718
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,760
they were so cautious.

719
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,160
Do you think he can handle

720
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,720
such hero with high difficulty?

721
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,840
Big bro.

722
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,190
The creator.

723
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,390
Was our Pei Xi's

724
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,470
life hero.

725
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,630
If they lose,

726
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,870
I'll treat you to a drink.

727
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,270
Come, let's continue looking at everyone's

728
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,180
selection situation.

729
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,770
Lu Sheng choosing creator to fight Pei Xi.

730
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,370
It's a joke right?

731
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,010
Let me tell you

732
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,610
as long as Pei Xi plays normally,

733
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,410
and steadily.

734
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,010
Legends will definitely win.

735
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,530
I feel so too.

736
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,210
Someone needs to treat milk tea soon.

737
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,120
Not right...

738
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,240
How come their tactic

739
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,280
is different this round?

740
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
Ji Xiang Kong is playing four protect one.

741
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,110
Who are they protecting with this?

742
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,310
Protecting Lu Sheng.

743
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,430
Lu Sheng's creator.

744
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,510
Why are they protecting Lu Sheng?

745
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,310
The previous two rounds, he

746
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,430
played like he was terrified.

747
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,870
Catch Lu Sheng.

748
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,190
Lu Sheng is the break out point.

749
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,340
Catch Lu Sheng.

750
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,420
Impossible.

751
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,900
My Kong ge can't possibly let

752
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,220
the terrified guy play mid solo.

753
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,580
Ah Xuan,

754
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,340
Leader Ji just went to VNG

755
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,300
he can't understand Lu Sheng better than Pei Xi.

756
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,380
Li Nan, Lin Yi Xuan.

757
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,740
Investigate and protect properly.

758
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,420
After one minute, we'll arrange again.

759
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,140
After third level,

760
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,100
come here and make Lu Sheng stroll away.

761
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
Okay, understood.

762
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,340
Okay.

763
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,090
Ah Xin is controlled by

764
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,490
rising mid solo player, Pei Xi.

765
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,410
Going against

766
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,850
Lu Sheng who's using the creator.

767
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,450
See.

768
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,370
Thankfully, we didn't use the double moon team.

769
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,090
I feel that it's not surprising

770
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,610
that Lu Sheng will be beaten badly.

771
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,680
Currently, Lu Sheng definitely has the lower hand.

772
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,200
Pei Xi's main point is to break the ice.

773
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,560
Continuously using up

774
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,680
Lu Sheng's levels at the same time.

775
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
And surpressed Lu Sheng's army.

776
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,620
So, Lu Sheng can you handle it or not?

777
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,020
Lu Sheng, mend your blade.

778
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,060
Don't be terrified.

779
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,980
Why are you hiding under the tower?

780
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,900
Yes.

781
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,820
But this way, his fireball-

782
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,780
Lu Sheng can you handle this or not?

783
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,660
This way it's highly possible-

784
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,740
Get more army.

785
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,620
Qi Yue.

786
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,940
Go to the mid route to support.

787
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,180
I overestimated you.

788
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,660
Do you really think

789
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,780
I can't win you?

790
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,410
Leader, be careful.

791
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,450
Leader, be careful. Move back.

792
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,650
Retreat.

793
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:46,810
Retreat.

794
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,410
Sheng ge, don't cross the tower.

795
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,530
He can.

796
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,810
Tong Wu follow him and go.

797
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,570
I don't care anymore, I'm giving my all.

798
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:52,510
Protect him.

799
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,510
Nice, okay.

800
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,830
Come to the mid route, group battle.

801
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,670
Go.

802
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,630
I'll resist the damage first.

803
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,830
Retreat for one wave.

804
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,910
Double moon team prepare to turn behind.

805
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,830
Open the group in mid route.

806
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,870
Let me capture.

807
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,190
Hit them.

808
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,830
I'll go firsthand.

809
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,870
Firsthand open the group.

810
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,790
Come, go.

811
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,350
Don't be terrified.

812
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,230
I'll go first and support you all.

813
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,190
I'm behind.

814
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,030
Li Nan continue using your skills.

815
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,670
Go up.

816
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,590
- Nice.

817
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,590
Quick.

818
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,270
They still have it.

819
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,870
Continue chasing.

820
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,950
Lu Feng, Li Nan, retreat.

821
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,790
Retreat.

822
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,310
I can't come back.

823
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,150
- This round-

824
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,150
I can't come back.

825
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,670
Nice.

826
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,710
Okay.

827
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,470
Double moon team continue chasing and killing.

828
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,750
Li Nan, you retreat too.

829
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,190
Yao ge, be careful.

830
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,990
Yao ge, go home and protect it.

831
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,590
Yao ge, go home.

832
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,590
Get a quintuple kill.

833
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,260
- Nice.

834
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,260
Go!

835
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,540
Nice.

836
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,660
Quintuple kill.

837
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,720
We can do one more wave.

838
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
Mid route, push.

839
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,120
Shen Yue, continue pushing.

840
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,960
Continue pushing, I'm following you.

841
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
Shen Yue.

842
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
- Coming.

843
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,600
We see VNG is pushing right now.

844
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
- It's over.

845
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
The last crystal.

846
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,720
Looks like they're taking

847
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,600
down this competition.

848
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,520
I didn't expect that Lu Sheng won't be terrified.

849
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,190
They've pushed it.

850
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,510
Congratulations VNG.

851
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,630
Winning the competition

852
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,550
with one player blocking the opponents.

853
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,710
VNG!

854
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,910
- Letting one chase two members.

855
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,910
VNG!

856
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,510
Victory.

857
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,470
Legends!

858
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,270
Through them, we saw

859
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,100
pure and passionate youth spirit.

860
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,380
Fearlessness.

861
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,220
No turning back.

862
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,860
This is esports' spirit.

863
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,770
Come.

864
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,210
Let me hold the winner's hand.

865
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,610
How did you play just now?

866
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,530
You could have escaped.

867
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,130
There are many changes in competitions.

868
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,530
You still have time to care about him?

869
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,290
Congratulations.

870
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,290
You don't need to be at the bottom anymore.

871
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,490
Congratulations Ji handsome.

872
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,890
Today's round

873
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,330
we finally brough out our vigor.

874
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,530
The one that surprised me most was Lu Sheng.

875
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,560
The anger from the previous rounds

876
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
were released in a moment.

877
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
If it was in the past,

878
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,760
Lu Sheng definitely wouldn't cross the tower and kill.

879
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,990
It's Ji Xiang Kong who changed him.

880
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,350
Congratulations to VNG for turning things around.

881
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,310
And also let us congratulate

882
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,070
Qi Yue again.

883
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,830
For receiving this round's

884
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,950
MVP too.

885
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,660
Qi Yue, good job!

886
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,540
This time round, Qi Yue

887
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,420
is finally smiling.

888
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,180
He not only received a quintuple kill

889
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,020
in the last round.

890
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,340
In the second round,

891
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,860
the double moons strolling,

892
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,980
was also very good.

893
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,900
And don't you think

894
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,420
Qi Yue finally rid of Pei Xi's

895
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,140
supression towards him for very long?

896
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,380
You were right about him.

897
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,180
You were also right.

898
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,930
And I feel that Double moon's

899
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,330
was grasped to their benefit.

900
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,530
At the most important moment,

901
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,930
they gave a deadly attack.

902
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,810
I'll leave first.

903
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,730
Don't.

904
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,760
It was hard for everyone to gather.

905
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
Wait for Luo Tian to come down later.

906
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Let's gather.

907
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,920
And eat some thing, okay?

908
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,840
Let's not gather now, next time we shall.

909
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
You have no energy?

910
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
Someone has to treat milk tea now.

911
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Anyway, it's not me.

912
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,820
You said it.

913
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,860
Is the small cup okay?

914
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,180
No.

915
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,700
Xiang Kong is too awesome.

916
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,180
Hello everyone.

917
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,380
I am Dynamism esports

918
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,660
magazine's reporter, Lu Yi Yi.

919
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,780
Now, everyone can see that

920
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,700
there's a lot of people

921
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,980
at the live venue.

922
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,740
Right now, we-

923
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,500
Ji Xiang Kong is out!

924
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,700
Ji Xiang Kong.

925
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,370
Ji handsome.

926
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,450
VNG experiences four losses,

927
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,410
and finally turned things around today.

928
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,130
What's the main reason for today's turn of events?

929
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,370
Abilities and cooperation.

930
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,950
And a bit of occasional luck.

931
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,870
Ji handsome is a little humble today.

932
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,270
Am I not humble previously?

933
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,670
Our VNG leader

934
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,590
has always kept a low profile.

935
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,470
Qi Yue.

936
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,430
How do you feel about

937
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,030
getting the competition's MVP?

938
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,270
What kind of chemistry allowed you guys

939
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,150
to reboot the double moon team?

940
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,630
Hello, Qi Yue.

941
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,310
VNG lost four consecutive rounds

942
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,390
and finally turned things around today.

943
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,990
How would you comment on VNG's performance today?

944
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,390
Results determine everything.

945
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,710
The double moon team can't be defeated.

946
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,270
Yes, if we could grade

947
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,950
our performance this time.

948
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,270
I feel it should be 99 points.

949
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,390
Then, how many points are you giving?

950
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,500
I'm the MVP.

951
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,420
How many points do you think I am?

952
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,420
The remaining one point is for room for improvement.

953
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,900
Thank you for your interview.

954
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,500
Do you still have questions?

955
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,620
No more.

956
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,780
- Pei Xi!

957
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,780
No more.

958
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,240
- But I-

959
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,240
Pei Xi!

960
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,160
I still have some things to say.

961
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,120
Excuse me.

962
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:00,960
Pei Xi.

963
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
This time round Legends lost to VNG.

964
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,040
What do you have to say?

965
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,160
No.

966
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,880
Pei Xi.

967
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,120
Move a little.

968
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,160
Pei Xi.

969
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,040
You-

970
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,190
what trouble are you creating?

971
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,430
I was going to interview Pei Xi.

972
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,870
He won't say a thing even for half a day.

973
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,550
Why are you interviewing him?

974
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,710
Interview me. I'm ready.

975
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,540
Okay...

976
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,180
Tell us

977
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Should I look at you or him?

978
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,660
- Oh, look at you.

979
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,660
Look at me.

980
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,780
That Ji Xiang Kong's

981
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,700
performances for this round

982
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
is really too amazing.

983
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,740
He knows where I'll go

984
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,730
at the start for benefits.

985
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,170
So, he came to wait for me.

986
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,330
And successfully killed me.

987
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,090
And got the first blood.

988
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,930
And their double moon team.

989
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,170
This idea should be his.

990
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:40,930
My Kong ge- Sorry.

991
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,650
Ji Xiang Kong thought of it.

992
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,770
So his performance was amazing.

993
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,050
Don't laugh.

994
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,290
It's an interview.

995
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,330
No.

996
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,850
Are you VNG's or

997
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,970
Legends's member?

998
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,170
Competitions should be like this.

999
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:51,850
Share the honour and embarrassment.

1000
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,850
Everyone work hard together.

1001
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,930
To get the final victory.

1002
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,040
Are you dumb?

1003
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,000
Sorry.

1004
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,720
Reporter friend,

1005
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,600
we have a meeting to start.

1006
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,600
We're going first.

1007
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,840
I still have two more sentences to say.

1008
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,520
For this competition, my Kong ge-

1009
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,520
Do you think you're not embarrassing enough?

1010
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,400
Let's go.

1011
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,280
Let's talk on WeChat.

1012
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,230
Go for your meeting.

1013
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,230
Bye bye.

1014
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,910
Pei Xi.

1015
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,220
What are your opinions on today's battle?

1016
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,940
Although VNG won today,

1017
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,820
but

1018
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,740
we'll still work hard.

1019
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,140
I believe Legends will win VNG in the end.

1020
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,940
Wen jie.

1021
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,700
If every round we win,

1022
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,740
we get treated like this,

1023
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,620
we will make VNG poor from our meals.

1024
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,650
Don't worry.

1025
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,290
As long as you can win,

1026
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,890
I will do anything.

1027
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,250
With me here,

1028
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,000
will I allow you to do that?

1029
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,720
Sorry everyone.

1030
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,360
Our MVP is here.

1031
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,720
Come, master.

1032
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,680
Wen jie.

1033
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,720
I will toast to you guys first.

1034
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,860
In future, for competitions

1035
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,900
with the double moon team

1036
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,980
we're steady.

1037
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,900
- Cheers.

1038
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,900
Okay.

1039
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,660
Now outsiders are saying

1040
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,980
after Pei Xi left,

1041
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,020
VNG lost their core.

1042
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,260
But today, this competition

1043
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,180
showed them that

1044
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,700
we can still win

1045
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,100
even if we don't use four protect one.

1046
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,620
And we can get the championship.

1047
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,140
Xiang Kong.

1048
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,780
Previously, you said

1049
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,620
you will give me a brand new VNG.

1050
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,530
You did that today.

1051
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,410
The double moon team can appear again.

1052
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,290
Xiang Kong did quite a lot.

1053
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,430
Of course.

1054
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,190
The reason why we won today,

1055
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,390
the biggest successor,

1056
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,630
is Qi Yue.

1057
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,830
Secondly,

1058
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,750
it's Lu Sheng.

1059
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,830
Of course.

1060
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,310
No, Wen jie

1061
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,510
and CEO Li's trust

1062
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,230
and everyone's cooperation.

1063
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,630
I, Ji Xiang Kong, am nothing.

1064
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,350
I shall toast to everyone.

1065
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,790
Toast to leader.

1066
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,950
Thank you.

1067
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,910
Xiang Kong is right.

1068
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,230
Don't forget.

1069
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,230
We are a team.

1070
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,190
Our target is

1071
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,350
the world champion.

1072
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,590
Come, cheers.

1073
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,220
Congratulations. Today I bet that you'd win.

1074
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,100
And I won a cup of milk tea.

1075
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
You won a milk tea because of me.

1076
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,920
Shouldn't I receive one too?

1077
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,160
You should be having a congratulatory party now.

1078
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
You still have time to con my milk tea?

1079
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,550
As my number 1 fan,

1080
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,030
and cheer for me?

1081
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,030
shouldn't you be holding a support board,

1082
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,180
One hour later, let's meet at the same place.

1083
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,560
You're back?

1084
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,230
How's it?

1085
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,270
Do I look good today?

1086
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,630
You...

1087
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,980
there's lipstick on your teeth.

1088
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,420
Going for a date with Ji Xiang Kong?

1089
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,340
Yes.

1090
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,660
Pei Xi.

1091
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,850
You played well today too.

1092
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,770
Thank you.

1093
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
No, I mean it truly.

1094
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,760
I really think you did well.

1095
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,520
Then...

1096
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,780
I'll go first. Bye bye.

1097
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,220
[Unknown number]

1098
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,730
Hello?

1099
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,130
Hello?

1100
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,170
Who are you looking for?

1101
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,990
Xiang Kong.

1102
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,830
It's me.

1103
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,150
I'm back.

1104
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,590
Mi Ya.

1105
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,510
I want to meet you.

1106
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,870
Do you have time?

1107
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,210
This is our store's signature.

1108
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,290
RMB 13.60.

1109
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,020
Strawberry milk tea.

1110
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,860
Thank you.

1111
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,900
I must not forget my original intention,

1112
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,900
and accompany you to shine.

1113
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,300
When your boyfriend sees it,

1114
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,620
he'll definitely be really touched.

1115
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,180
I already said.

1116
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,900
He's not my boyfriend.

1117
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,540
Then, it should be more than friends.

1118
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,060
And such a handsome guy.

1119
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,820
You should watch him closely.

1120
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,730
Don't touch.

1121
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,490
Go and do your things.

1122
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,890
Hello.

1123
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,050
May I ask what you need?

1124
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:43,030
Qiu Ying.

1125
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:43,030
[I'm already here, I'll wait for you.]

1126
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,990
[Sorry, something held me back. Wait a while more.]

1127
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,990
Ji Xiang Kong.

1128
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,720
Xiang Kong.

1129
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
I really miss you.

1130
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,600
What's wrong?

1131
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,880
Did I scare you?

1132
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,510
No.

1133
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,990
It's just that-

1134
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,110
Long time no see.

1135
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,980
It's the 1,820th day.

1136
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,700
I remember every day that we're apart.

1137
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,100
I really hope that this number

1138
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,740
will stop at today.

1139
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,690
And stop increasing.

1140
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,330
Your career developed really well overseas.

1141
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,930
let you come back to develop your career?

1142
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,930
Why did Tony suddenly

1143
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,970
I was the one who decided to come back.

1144
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,890
Xiang Kong.

1145
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,080
I want to return to your side.

1146
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,670
What are you doing here?

1147
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,790
Tony, I-

1148
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,430
Long time no see, Tony.

1149
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,390
Sorry.

1150
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,860
We'll talk next time.

1151
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Mi Ya.

1152
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,780
Go back.

1153
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,500
I still have things to talk to Xiang Kong about.

1154
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,820
Mi Ya.

1155
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,180
Do you know how many fans are here?

1156
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,460
What if you got caught by paparazzi?

1157
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,050
Go back.

1158
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,050
Yes, Mi Ya.

1159
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,370
There are too many fans here.

1160
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,810
Quickly go back.

1161
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,890
Just nice, I also have to meet someone.

1162
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,960
I'll go first.

1163
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,640
Xiang Kong.

1164
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,100
Xiang Kong.

1165
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,090
Don't take it down.

1166
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,130
You're so popular now.

1167
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,490
People will recognize you.

1168
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:45,830
Sorry.

1169
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,870
My schedules are a little packed lately.

1170
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,030
Maybe in the next few months,

1171
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,670
we won't be able to meet.

1172
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,510
It's okay.

1173
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,430
I'm already really happy that you can meet today.

1174
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,950
Come.

1175
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,670
Let's go watch a movie.

1176
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,030
Xiang Kong.

1177
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,180
I...

1178
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,020
I can't be in public with you in future.

1179
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,960
You know too...

1180
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,240
Tony thinks highly of me.

1181
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,680
The artistes he carries

1182
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,920
have very successful career developments.

1183
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,800
He said he will nurture me wholeheartedly.

1184
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,150
But he said...

1185
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,830
But he said...

1186
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,460
He wants me to break up with you.

1187
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,050
Xiang Kong...

1188
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,250
what should I do?

1189
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,600
What's the purpose for doing all this?

1190
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,270
When you were young,

1191
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,630
you told me.

1192
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,070
You wanted to be a singer.

1193
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,620
Now,

1194
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,260
your dreams are coming true.

1195
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,060
I can't affect you.

1196
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,700
You definitely will stand on your dream stage.

1197
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,780
You definitely will succeed.

1198
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,730
Xiang Kong, I don't mean it like this.

1199
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,410
No.

1200
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,370
The decisions you can't make.

1201
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,680
I'll help you.

1202
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,600
Xiang Kong.

1203
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,560
Xiang Kong.

1204
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,720
Xiang Kong.

1205
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,280
Xiang Kong, don't go.

1206
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,440
Xiang Kong.

1207
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,160
Xiang Kong.

1208
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,740
I'll call you again.
