How can i go back home?

19
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,524
I,I,I.

20
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,985
I can go home by myself.

21
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,532
Are you ok? Come on.Let's go.

22
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,885
Don't touch me.I am so poor.

Let me down.

24
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,935
You are so drunk.How can I put you down?

25
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,825
You asshole.Why are you carrying me?

26
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,297
Get down.

27
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,055
You want me get down?

28
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,359
It's you.

29
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:29,559
I will bite you 

30
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,263
if you don't let me down.

31
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:31,479
Don't do it.

32
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,800
Hurt,hurt,hurt.

33
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,835
Come on.Slow it down.

34
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:10,430
Mom.

35
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,462
I've been trying so hard.

36
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,174
Why?

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,175
Why is it still the same?

38
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,862
Well,OK,good night.

39
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,542
I really don't wanna let you down.

40
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:30,600
I know it.

41
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,408
Mom,can you see that?

42
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:19,285
Why are you so noisy in the morning?

43
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:25,775
You,you,you.

44
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,773
So fast?

45
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,013
You wake up?

46
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:30,421
I,

47
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,365
Why I am here?

48
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,053
What do you say?

49
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:44,501
Did I

50
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,165
get drunk?

51
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,494
Thanks god that you can remember this.

52
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:55,957
How did you come back?

53
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:57,749
I carried her back.

54
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:58,709
Where is your motorcycle？

55
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,245
I parked it on the street.

56
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,653
I will ride it back.

57
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,325
You carried her

58
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:07,989
Cool.

59
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:09,781
Get back to your room to sleep.

60
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,142
Do not bother you.

61
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,749
Do not bother you.

62
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,373
Morning,sister-in-law.

63
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:22,773
Don't worry.

64
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,873
I am not interested with a drunkard.

65
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:28,821
Your phone was powered off yesterday.

66
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,197
So I cannot contact your friends.

67
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:31,413
Thank you.

68
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,901
It's so sorry

69
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,629
to borther you.

70
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:38,837
Then

71
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,165

72
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:44,853
I gonna go.

73
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:47,669
Wait.

74
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,557
Tell you lawyer.Let's meet at 10:00 AM.

75
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,829
OK.

76
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:01,685
See you later.

77
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,119
Kong,kong,kong.

78
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,887
Why do you come in?

79
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:21,350
Get out of here.

80
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,296
I heard it last night.

81
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,256
What did you hear?

82
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,109
Go,go,go.

83
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,326
 Long time no see.

84
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,741
 Long time no see.Sit down,please.

85
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:42,766
Are you ok?

86
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,693
Yes.

87
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:47,788
I shall represent the parties in full power

88
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,900
about the issue that

89
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,413
QiuYing invaded JiXiangkong's privacy

90
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,077
and personal reputation

91
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:54,101
to negotiate.

92
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,321
We are willing to

93
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,581
 accept reasonable compensation.

94
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,997
How much money do you think is appropriate?

95
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:08,565
Just say it.

96
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:12,085
Not too much,just 1 million.

97
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,197
One million?

98
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,893
Isn't my reputation 

99
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,250
worth a million yuan?

100
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:22,965
One million?

101
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,370
You are totally blackmailing.

102
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,223
Watch your words.

103
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,173
Here are two lawyers.

104
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:30,901
It's OK.Calm down.

105
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:36,021
Well,

106
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:37,813
Could we negotiate it again?

107
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,685
Considering QiuYing's financial situation,

108
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,221
We've already made 

109
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,693
the utmost concession.

110
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,600
The compensation fee is reduced to 0 yuan.

111
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,400
JiXiangkong.

112
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,067
Thank you.

113
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,499
How do you want to thank me?

114
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,632
Never say be my girlfriend.

115
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,323
Otherwise I'd really say yes.

116
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,051
Hey,hey,hey.

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,368
The lawyer Chen is still nearby.

118
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,507
You're flirting.Do you know that?

119
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,579
No matter why,

120
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,138
I still want to thank you.

121
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,187
It's ok.

122
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,619
I'm just making life easier for myself.

123
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:43,219
Well,

124
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,675
I want to give you a piece of advice.

125
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,143
Drink less in the future.

126
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,131
It's really scary when you drink too much.

127
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:51,795
You are such a chatterbox.

128
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,315
What did I say?

129
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,175
You've said all the things

130
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,603
 you shouldn't have said.

131
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,163
Take your time.I gonna go.

132
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,675
All the things I've said.

133
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,531
What oon earth did I say?

134
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,411
I don't care what you say.

135
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,150
But have you forgotten

136
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,611
 what you told me?

137
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,619
Don't play dumb with me.

138
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:24,819
You were drinking with him last night.

139
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,867
And you lied about drinking with your friends.

140
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,297
Isn't he my friend?

141
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:30,195
You.

142
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,603
Right?

143
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,710
You tricked me.

144
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,525
Stop.QiuYing.Don;t go.

145
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:37,487
Yiyi,

146
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,062
I know the snacks in this shop are really good.

147
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:39,700
Let's go.

148
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,160
Let me take you to buy some snacks.

149
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:42,120
Don't be angry.

150
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,900
Welcome.

151
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,327
We can buy all our snacks here in the future.

152
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,066
You tell me the truth.

153
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,347
What on earth did you do yesterday?

154
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,267
Don't lie to me.

155
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,084
Don't worry.

156
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,723
We really didn't do anything.

157
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,067
You didn't do anything.

158
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:02,948
Then why did he 

159
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:04,371
bury the hatchet so easily today?

160
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:05,011
You lie to me.

161
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:06,995
I don't understand,too.

162
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:08,787
Why is he suddenly helping me like this?

163
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:09,700
But,

164
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:11,987
we really didn't do anything.

165
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,587
I was just drunk.

166
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,827
How dare you drink so much?

167
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,323
You,you,you.

168
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:19,603
Yiyi.

169
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,296
This scallop looks delicious.

170
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,064
Don't change the subject.

171
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:23,379
Tell me.

172
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:25,619
Did he force you to drink?

173
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,603
No, that's not true.

174
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,139
 So why do you drink so much？

175
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,250
Don't you know how much you can drink?

176
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,705
In case you get drunk,

177
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:34,067
What do you do when something happens?

178
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,627
I was just not in a good mood.

179
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,227
That's why I drank.

180
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,787
I didn't expect to drink too much.

181
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:42,579
Even if you're in a bad mood,

182
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,622
you can't ask him to drink with you.

183
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,291
You can ask me to drink with you.

184
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,019
You really pissed me off.

185
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,845
OK.

186
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,359
I'll buy you some more delicious food.

187
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,459
Don't be mad.

188
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,357
I begged Jeffery 

189
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,735
to set the record straight

190
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,443
But he

191
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:03,950
 immediately made up with the hostess.

192
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,116
The sponsor asked me for an explanation.

193
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,500
How do I explain that?

194
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,716
How can I explain that?

195
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,363
I can't be a manager anymore.

196
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,532
I really don't want to be.

197
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:12,256
What's the matter,Boss Jin?

198
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,010
Do you know

199
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,600
have JiXiangkong and QiuYing reconciled?

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,304
What?

201
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:17,425
When did it happen?

202
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,124
What do you say?

203
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,663
It happened yesterday.

204
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,199
If you don't believe me, you can ask lawyer Zhou.

205
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:22,565
Where is JiXiangkong?

206
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:23,077
Call him over.

207
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,165
I'm breaking up with him.

208
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:24,716
Boss Jin.

209
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,025
Calm down first.

210
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,133
He had his reasons 

211
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,150
for doing so.

212
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:29,925
I told you

213
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,116
 to stop defending him.

214
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:34,380
 Boss Bai was already very angry.

215
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,338
There's no way out of this 

216
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,259
if we don't get rid of Ji.

217
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
If this thing doesn't work out,

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,740
the image of our team is irreparable.

219
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:42,898
Push the team members out

220
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:43,895
 when something goes wrong.

221
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,708
That's not how we do things.

222
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,325
It was clear that

223
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,164
there was a cover-up.

224
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,404
Someone's trying to hurt the Legends and Ji.

225
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,860
Break the contract without evidence.

226
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,164
Aren't you afraid of the other players?

227
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,031
Boss Jin.

228
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,348
If we don't break up with Ji,

229
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,334
what do we tell the sponsors?

230
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:06,572
Which side is more important?

231
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,866
Zhao Yang.

232
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:10,988
Did you get in touch with Jeffery or not?

233
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,740
Of course I did.

234
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,444
But Jeffery

235
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:15,669
ignored me.

236
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,425
What should I do?

237
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,370
The most important thing now

238
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,778
is to contact Jeffery immediately.

239
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,025
If he's willing to clarify,

240
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,404
then the problem will be solved.

241
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:24,492
ZhaoYang.

242
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,412
If you really care about the team,

243
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,012
you should contact him right away.

244
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,550
Rather than sit in the office

245
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:31,650
and sow discord.

246
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,924
What do you say?

247
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:33,815
Just told you.

248
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:34,800
Who is sowing discord here?

249
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,440
Enough.

250
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,425
A press conference will be held on Monday.

251
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,820
If the problem is not solved,

252
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,060
we will break off with Ji at the press conference.

253
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:53,375
Did you get through to him?

254
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:54,325
No,no,no.

255
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,212
Hello.

256
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,324
Kong.You.

257
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,284
Have you seen Jeffery?

258
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,725
Not yet.

259
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,804
The message may be wrong.

260
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,724
He may not stay at this hotel.

261
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:16,300
ZhaoYang complained in front of Boss Jin.

262
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,228
Give it to me.

263
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,600
Coach Luo wants to talk to you.

264
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,366
Why don't you discuss such a big thing with me?

265
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,122
You should have made up with her by yourself.

266
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:26,750
Coach.

267
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,425
QiuYing didn't post that video.

268
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,220
Do you have any proof?

269
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,575
I don't have proof yet.

270
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:33,420
But,

271
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,218
Since there is no evidence,

272
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,742
Why take it upon yourself to make peace with her?

273
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,367
You are acquiescing in your affair with her.

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,908
ZhaoYang can get you off the team 

275
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,075
for that one reason.

276
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:42,956
Do you know that?

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,492
Coach,

278
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,156
QiuYing is innocent.

279
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,140
She has lost her job and sold her house.

280
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,428
She will be ruined by his means.

281
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,131
I can't sacrifice innocent people 

282
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,460
for my own good.

283
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,801
Looks like you've figured it all out

284
00:14:58,801 --> 00:14:59,788
 before you settle.

285
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,649
So nothing else I say is going to work.

286
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:02,350
No,no,no.

287
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,000
Kong,

288
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,212
Boss Jin was going to fire you today.

289
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,364
Coach Luo

290
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:09,708
had a big quarrel with Boss Jin.

291
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,628
Boss Jin  just promised you two days more.

292
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:12,972
Don't you talk like that.

293
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,388
Sorry, coach.

294
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,924
I've caused you so much trouble.

295
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,036
If he can clarify 

296
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,276
at the press conference on Monday

297
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,850
things may change.

298
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Coach, I hung up first.

299
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:28,750
Jeffery.

300
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,252
Can I have a word with you?

301
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,820
I know why you're here.

302
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,380
I saw the video on the Internet.

303
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,084
That is fake.

304
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,324
I hope that you could clarify that.

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,069
I heard if it's taken as true

306
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,108
you are likely to be expelled from the club.

307
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,044
Your attitude to me the other day

308
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,452
really pissed me off.

309
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,300
So you should pay a price.

310
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,876
In this case,

311
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,798
I don't want to help one of my underlings.

312
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,812
If you don't clarify,

313
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,244
do you want people to think I beat you up?

314
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,012
QiuYing,stop looking at the computer.

315
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:41,292
Close it up.Ready for dinner.

316
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,316
Right away immediately.

317
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,468
Come on.

318
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,604
Here is a hot and spicy hot pot.

319
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,756
Put your computer away.

320
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:48,908
Come on.

321
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,628
You're in front of the computer every day,

322
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,804
When will you be ready for dinner?

323
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:02,476
Thanks to  I'm here.

324
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,884
Here you are.

325
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,356
Thank you,sweetheart.

326
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,044
Whoever marries you in the future

327
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,900
will be the luckiest person in the world.

328
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,884
You are so sweet.

329
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:13,804
Don't eat alone.

330
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,349
I also want to eat.

331
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:17,836
You are so selfish.

332
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,316
Look at this,Yiyi.

333
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:23,468
What is this?

334
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,629
A poll that

335
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:30,892
 agrees Ji gets out of the Legend.

336
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,244
That's 70 percent in agreement.

337
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,722
We just made up yesterday.

338
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:39,276
It was posted online today.

339
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,244
And you know what

340
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
The key is

341
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,426
everyone  has heard our gossip.

342
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,668
You two are having an affair.

343
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,948
You're still smiling.

344
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:53,484
I am not laugh.

345
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,252
You are laughing.

346
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:55,212
I am not.

347
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,628
I think

348
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,932
JiXiangkong couldn't turn over this time.

349
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,975
I heard that their sponsors

350
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,156
was very angry when they knew this thing.

351
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,076
They are clamouring to terminate the sponsorship.

352
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,340
The Legends and Ji

353
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,804
are likely to break off

354
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,673
at tomorrow's press conference.

355
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,340
So what do we do?

356
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:21,900
How about we help him?

357
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,180
Help him.

358
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:24,780
That's easy for you to say.

359
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,892
We are nobody.

360
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:28,556
Noone knows us.

361
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,284
You tell me how to help.

362
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:32,725
I don't know.

363
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:35,212
Ji helped me before.

364
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:36,812
I can't sit here and do nothing.

365
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:38,924
The point is

366
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,204
that this happened because of me.

367
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:41,292
Girl,

368
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:43,596
You're having an affair.

369
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,028
You speak out in public

370
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:47,948
he is innocent.

371
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,548
Do you think anyone believes it?

372
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,020
This will only deepen the misunderstanding.

373
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,275
What if I just send 

374
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:55,738
the full video that I shot?

375
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,356
How dare you say that?

376
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,532
Look at the video you shot.

377
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,188
You only got a picture

378
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:03,052
of two people fighting.

379
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,804
Then the process of  coach separated them.

380
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,532
Did you shot that?

381
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,324
You upload this video  

382
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,156
in the Internet now.

383
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:11,628
You don't have any persuasion.

384
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,252
So what do we do?

385
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:15,200
You say.

386
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,524
FIne.

387
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:21,612
You eat first.

388
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,293
Let me think.

389
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:34,988
Wait,QiuYing.

390
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,939
Look,look at this person.

391
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:40,172
What's wrong with this guy?

392
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,092
She's on set, too.

393
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:43,500
Maybe

394
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,356
she filmed the whole thing.

395
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,148
We just have to find this guy.

396
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,900
Then get a full video of the scene.

397
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,965
This will prove his innocence.

398
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,050
The guy is abroad.

399
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,644
Where are you going to find her?

400
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:58,732
Go to Canada?

401
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:00,780
You are so stupid.

402
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:01,932
Look.

403
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,494
Is it a tour group?

404
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,436
Surely they will return to China.

405
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,404
All we have to do is

406
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:12,748
to find the tour group to find this guy.

407
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:15,220
When we find this guy

408
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,292
and we get this video

409
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,236
Then we can find evidence.

410
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,860
Even if she comes back.

411
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,046
There are so many tour groups in China.

412
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:25,164
Where are you going to find her?

413
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,340
Don't forget it.

414
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,989
I'm a journalist.

415
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,205
This little thing

416
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:31,244
 

417
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:33,676
won't daunt a big reporter like me.

418
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:36,044
Don't worry.Leave it to me.

419
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:38,469
I'll take care of it.You eat.

420
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:43,276
Seek truth.Seek justice.

421
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,004
That's my mission.

422
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,196
Funny.

423
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:01,825
Hello,Yiyi.

424
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,012
I found the travel agency.

425
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,956
But their leader took the group out.

426
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,555
They'll be back on an afternoon flight.

427
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,860
I'm glad you found it.

428
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:12,725
Just pray for flight

429
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:14,124
 is not late right now.

430
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,156
You're right.

431
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,332
Widespread flights have delayed.

432
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,964
JiXIangkong is so unlucky.

433
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:27,829
God wouldn't even help him.

434
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,597
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

435
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:30,380
The Legends

436
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:32,300
have sent a notice to the media.

437
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,452
There will be a press conference 

438
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:34,604
tomorrow morning

439
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,332
to break up with Ji.

440
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,100
I'll wait.

441
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,124
Bye.

442
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:01,740
Kong.

443
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,289
Why didn't you see the WeChat I sent you?

444
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:08,652
Coach Luo just told me

445
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,425
Jeffery is flying off

446
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,852
and won't be coming to the press conference.

447
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:14,476
I know it.

448
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:15,500
You can go back first.

449
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:17,292
No.

450
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:18,316
Jeffery is flying off.

451
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:19,148
He's getting on the plane.

452
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,852
I know it.

453
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:20,748
Don't worry about me.

454
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,604
You go back to training first.

455
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,524
Whether I solve or not,

456
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:25,959
we are going to win the game.

457
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,302
Are you ok?

458
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:30,860
Then I'm leaving.

459
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:32,780
Jeffery is leaving,too.

460
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,524
Why hasn't the plane arrived yet?

461
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:52,044
Haven't fly yet.

462
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:56,076
It's OK.

463
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:58,444
As long as the plane is not cancelled,

464
00:22:58,828 --> 00:22:59,916
we still have a glimmer of hope.

465
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:03,756
Fine.

466
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:05,420
Then I'll keep waiting with you.

467
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,596
You are the best,Yiyi.

468
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,228
Well,

469
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:16,044
Have a drink to refresh yourself.

470
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,000
It may be a long wait.

471
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:18,092
Thank you.

472
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,188
I'm sleepy.

473
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:05,132
Get up,get up,get up.

474
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:07,564
Slow down.

475
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,556
What time is it now?

476
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,338
Look at your face.

477
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:20,300
If you still wait like this,

478
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,324
you'll soon be ginger.

479
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:25,625
Yiyi,you can go back first.

480
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,207
I'll wait a little longer.

481
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:28,620
Don't wait.

482
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,284
It's three o 'clock in the morning.

483
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,460
The press conference starts in a few hours.

484
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:33,420
What's more?

485
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,404
Even if you find the leader,

486
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,260
 it's been a long time.

487
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:38,412
They might 

488
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:39,372
 have deleted the video.

489
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:43,980
Even there is only a glimmer of hope,

490
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,476
I'll wait.

491
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:50,764
Have you got a fever?

492
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,172
Or fall in love with Ji?

493
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:53,324
Is it worth it for him to do this?

494
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:54,412
Neither.

495
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,380
I always thought I should do something for him.

496
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:01,175
Or I'll be sorry in my heart.

497
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,268
Yiyi,

498
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:05,228
You can go back first.

499
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:06,828
You have toattend the press conference tomorrow.

500
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:09,708
Well,

501
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:10,924
Then I'll go back

502
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:11,820
and prepare.

503
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,740
I'll be in touch with you any time.

504
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,492
Then keep safe by yourself.

505
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,260
Bye.

506
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,252
Be safe on the road.

507
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:22,956
Bye.

508
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,356
Hello everyone in front of the screen.

509
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:47,148
I am Lu Yiyi,

510
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:48,050
 a reporter from the dynamic e-sports magazine.

511
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,388
We're here

512
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:50,412
at the press conference

513
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:51,820
of Legends team.

514
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,100
Manager Zhao said

515
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:53,932
today

516
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,404
he will give us a result.

517
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,620
Now

518
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:57,900
please follow my steps

519
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,052
to the scene 

520
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,012
for the latest situation.

521
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:00,844
Thank you.

522
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:04,616
Welcome,please.

523
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:10,700
Welcome.

524
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:11,587
Manager Zhao.

525
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,580
Here.What's going on?

526
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,075
How are things today?

527
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:18,350
Good,good.

528
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:19,916
You really did a good job.

529
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,372
Thanks to your leadership.

530
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,676
I've spread the word today

531
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,485
that the Legends and JiXiangkong 

532
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,748
will formally break off the contract.

533
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,156
That's right.

534
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:31,825
We need to make this

535
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:33,036
 as big a deal as possible.

536
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,788
Do you know what boss Jin likes?

537
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:37,388
His face.

538
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:40,844
When the termination is successful,

539
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,260
even if Ji is innocent,

540
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:46,540
he can't come back, can he?

541
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,404
To tell you the truth,

542
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,964
I've got the denunciation ready today.

543
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:58,636
Then what are you still doing here?

544
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:00,236
Get him to sign it.

545
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,988
All right, I'll go right now.

546
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:04,908
Welcome.

547
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:19,564
Hey,Kong.

548
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:27,308
The press conference

549
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:28,844
is about to begin.

550
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:31,404
There are a lot of reporters outside now.

551
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:32,620
What should we do?

552
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:33,751
I don't know

553
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,732
why this press conference is being held?

554
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:37,676
Fine,

555
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:38,700
here comes another annoying guy.

556
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:42,988
Everyone is here.

557
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,140
This is

558
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:45,996
our termination contract.

559
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:47,788
You could sign it ,

560
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:48,876
if there's no problem.

561
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,425
Sign what?

562
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:51,513
The press conference hasn't even started yet.

563
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,228
Why are you in such a hurry?

564
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:55,660
Well,

565
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,644
If nothing's wrong, I'm gonna go.

566
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:02,956
Tell ZhaoYang,

567
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:04,107
I'll sign it.

568
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:05,925
But anyway,

569
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:07,628
I'll wait for him to finish the scene.

570
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:09,868
Sign in his presence.

571
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,908
Hello,Yiyi.

572
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:41,932
QiuYing,

573
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,404
what's going on?

574
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:44,620
Look,

575
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:46,156
Nearly everyone is here.

576
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,204
The press conference is about to begin.

577
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,750
The flight has landed.

578
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:53,900
No one I'm waiting for is coming out yet.

579
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,036
It can't be too late.

580
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,916
So what do we do?

581
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,260
Well,

582
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:02,860
I'll wait for your news.

583
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:12,844
The bus is coming at the gate.Come on.

584
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:21,164
Everybody gets on the bus.

585
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,868
Follow me.

586
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:41,772
Wait.

587
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:48,108
Manager Zhao is coming.

588
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:06,284
Welcome to our press conference

589
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,325
in your convenience.

590
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,572
There are six items 

591
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,916
in our conference today.

592
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:12,876
 

593
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,796
Manager Zhao,it's said that

594
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:15,375
JiXiangkong and QiuYing

595
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,100
 reached a settlement yesterday

596
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,060
Is that true?

597
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,084
Yes,manager Zhao.

598
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,492
Whether we can understand it this way,

599
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:21,644
the video QiuYing posted 

600
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,924
is real or not.

601
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:23,948
Ji did beat Jeffery up

602
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:25,200
in Vancouver.

603
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:26,700
Here.

604
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:27,468
Manager Zhao.

605
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:28,691
If he's terminated,

606
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:29,523
I mean if

607
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,244
So whether the team

608
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:32,524
will have new members to join?

609
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,124
This is something we are very concerned about.

610
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:35,020
Right?

611
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,364
Yes,yes,manager Zhao.

612
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:38,412
Please answer,manager Zhao.

613
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:39,692
Calm down, everyone.

614
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:41,484
Please sit down.

615
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:49,164
First of all, 

616
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,500
on behalf of the company and Ji, 

617
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,624
I would like to apologize.

618
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:06,316
Wait,wait.

619
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:10,156
Where is your tour leader, please?

620
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:12,524
She's in that car.

621
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,188
Thanks.

622
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:26,092
Excuse me.

623
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,372
Be careful.

624
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,100
Are you ok?

625
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:43,564
I finally found you.

626
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,166
We apologize

627
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,086
for this mistake.

628
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,366
Hurry up.

629
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,158
So the company solemnly announced

630
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,206
We will terminate the contract with

631
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:56,126
Manager Zhao.

632
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,742
I have a video here.

633
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,302
It can prove Ji's innocence.

634
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:07,838
Do you want to see it?

635
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:10,206
Is it?

636
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:11,870
Would you like to see it?

637
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,022
What video?

638
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,177
Let me have a look.

639
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:16,094
Come on.

640
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,398
Who is this?

641
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:19,870
Who?

642
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,726
What?

643
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,454
Yes.Look.

644
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:24,915
JiXiangkong.

645
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:26,462
Ji didn't hit anyone.

646
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,342
He didn't hit anyone.

647
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:30,174
Yes.

648
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,070
What's gping on?

649
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,414
Manager Zhao, please explain.

650
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,142
This video is a little unclear,

651
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,998
but you can see Ji didn't hit anyone.

652
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:37,150
Manager Zhao.

653
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:38,942
Have you seen this video before?

654
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,670
DId you see it?

655
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,142
Have you seen this video before?

656
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,271
Please answer.

657
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:44,575
How's that?Manager Zhao.

658
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:45,471
Have a look.

659
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,710
Ji didn't hit anyone.

660
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:48,606
Yes.

661
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,654
Have you seen this video before?

662
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:51,422
Please answer.

663
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:52,775
Manager Zhao.

664
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:53,965
Talk about it.

665
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,462
The company and I

666
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,126
really haven't seen the video.

667
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:03,825
But this kind of unofficial content

668
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,822
clarity is so poor.

669
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,190
We haven't confirmed it.

670
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,086
So the authenticity of this video

671
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:11,902
is uncertain.

672
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,054
And

673
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:14,450
We're not going to take this bizarre video

674
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,742
as a reason

675
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:19,500
to deny our company's decisions

676
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,374
and defend our players.

677
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:22,590
Manager Zhao.

678
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,741
Do you represent your team's opinion?

679
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:30,014
Now there is proof that Ji is innocent.

680
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,675
You don't check it, you just let it go.

681
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:35,838
Is it you or your team

682
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,750
that doesn't care about its player's innocence.

683
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:41,470
Yes,yes,Right?

684
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:43,815
What I say and do 

685
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:44,839
fully represent our company.

686
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,590
We cherish our players.

687
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,558
But we will not condone such violent event.

688
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,798
Our company bases its decisions

689
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:55,230
on hard facts.

690
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:00,606
This

691
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:02,654
cute little journalist

692
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,200
If you really have the evidence,

693
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:09,500
Instead of this blurry video.

694
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:10,846
We can consider about it.

695
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:11,550
Really.

696
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:13,470
Even more,

697
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,582
Jeffery is no longer in the country.

698
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:17,694
Manager Zhao is right.

699
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,790
Ji Xiangkong.

700
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:24,158
Ji Xiangkong.

701
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,750
The video is said to be synthetic.

702
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,806
Did you hit Jeffery or not?

703
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,726
Please anwser,Ji.

704
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:30,750
Did you hit Jeffery or not?

705
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,158
Ji Xiangkong.

706
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,822
Please be quiet.

707
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:35,422
This video was suddenly sent out.

708
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:38,814
We can't be so quick to believe it.

709
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,886
Who sent you here?

710
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,678
Your presence

711
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,726
 will only make it more and more difficult.

712
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,500
You will cause more problems for the team.

713
00:34:47,756 --> 00:34:48,524
Do you know?

714
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:52,830
How it happened

715
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,390
Who knows better than I do?

716
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:58,078
I'm sure the press here

717
00:34:58,718 --> 00:34:59,806
would like to hear from me

718
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,470
 first hand information.

719
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:02,814
What happened that day?

720
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:03,966
Yes,yes.

721
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:06,200
What happened that day?

722
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,750
Please be quiet.

723
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,582
What I want to say

724
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,270
You just saw that in the video.

725
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,254
If you don't believe me.

726
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:17,406
just ask Jeffery.

727
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:20,542
Jeffery has returned to his country.

728
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,270
How can he confront you face to face?

729
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:26,424
What era is  in now,manager Zhao?

730
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:28,158
Communication is so advanced,

731
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,975
Must the party be in order to speak clearly?

732
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,494
What is this?

733
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:44,670
I have a video here.

734
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,654
You can watch.

735
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,166
The online video is fake.

736
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:57,662
How did I get hit by Ji?

737
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:00,262
This is ridiculous.

738
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:02,206
JiXIangkong.

739
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:05,662
I admit your tactics are strong.

740
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,124
Next season's global finals

741
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:12,638
I wait for you.

742
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,622
So the previous video was a composite.

743
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:15,710
Ji was wronged.

744
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:17,374
RIght.

745
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,782
Ji was wronged.

746
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:19,678
Ji.

747
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,662
What is the relationship between you and QiuYing?

748
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:23,198
What the hell is going on?

749
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,910
I'm sure you're all well aware of the incident.

750
00:36:35,678 --> 00:36:37,214
As for concerns about 

751
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,070
my relationship with a female host.

752
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:41,926
There's no story between us.

753
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:44,382
She didn't post the composite video.

754
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,200
She and I are both victims.

755
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:48,670
As for the guy who made the fake video

756
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,142
that vilified me

757
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:54,200
Legends and I will definitely find him.

758
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:55,777
Turn him over to the law.

759
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:56,670
Manager Zhao.

760
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:59,102
Legends was due to announce his termination from Ji today

761
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,470
But now he is proved innocent.

762
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:07,230
Well.

763
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,110
I just said that.

764
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,798
If he is innocent,

765
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,830
our company will not terminate the contract with him.

766
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:19,454
Thank you for your understanding.

767
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:20,606
Meanwhile,

768
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:23,358
I hope all the media present here 

769
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:25,342
can help us find out who is behind

770
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,710
for our Legends.

771
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:30,398
Then there is the time for mass media interviews

772
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:33,342
There any questions you can directly ask manager Zhao.

773
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,942
I'll go first.

774
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:35,750
I can't explain anything.

775
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,310
Please answer.

776
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,047
Continue.

777
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:49,119
QiuYIng,

778
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,399
I told you it was over

779
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:54,943
It was over.

780
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,311
Ji has some conscience.

781
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,500
Didn't waste your night at the airport

782
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,239
I'm tired.

783
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,200
I have to get some sleep here.

784
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,655
You can't sleep at the airport if you want to.

785
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:07,698
Don't hang up.Wait for me.

786
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,796
I am coming.
