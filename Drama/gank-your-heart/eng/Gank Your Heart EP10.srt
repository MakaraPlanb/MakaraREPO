1
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,340
Where are you going? Slow down!

2
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,700
Can you please slow down?

3
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,140
I can’t grab hold of everything.

4
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,890
Come. Get up. I’ll send you home, okay?

5
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,010
Don’t touch me. It hurts. It really hurts, you know?

6
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,010
It wasn’t me.

7
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,410
It was you.

8
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,880
Sorry. Come. Get up.

9
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,030
-Get up. -No!

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,030
Let’s go home.

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,070
I won’t get up. I have no home. What home is there?

12
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,710
I’ll -

13
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,590
I’ll go home myself!

14
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,750
Can you do it? Let’s go.

15
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,750
Don’t touch me. I’m sad. Put me down. Put me down.

16
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,990
You’ve drunk too much. How could I put you down?

17
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,390
Scum. Why are you carrying me? Let me down!

18
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,190
Let you down? Shouldn’t you get down by yourself?

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,580
If you don’t put me down, I’m going to bite you.

20
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,580
Don’t bite. Ouch!

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,880
Slowly.

22
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,900
Mom. I’ve really tried my best.

23
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,660
Why -

24
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,250
Why did it turn out this way?

25
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,970
Be good and go to sleep.

26
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,050
I didn’t want to let you down.

27
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,570
I know.

28
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,370
Can you see it, Mom?

29
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,370
Who’s making noise in the morning?

30
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,070
You two -

31
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,230
So soon?

32
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,350
You’re awake.

33
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,070
I -

34
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,070
Why am I here?

35
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,430
What do you think?

36
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,150
I -

37
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,470
drank too much?

38
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,070
Good that you remember.

39
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,460
How did you get back?

40
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,140
I carried her back.

41
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,340
What about your motorcycle?

42
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,720
It’s on the street. I’ll ride it back here later.

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,040
You abandoned your ride just to carry her back.

44
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,080
Great.

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
Go back to sleep in your room.

46
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,240
Understood. I won’t disturb you. I won’t disturb you. Hi, sister-in-law.

47
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,110
Relax. I’m not interested in drunkards.

48
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,980
Your battery went flat. I couldn’t contact your friend.

49
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,060
Thank you.

50
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,300
I’m really very sorry to have caused you trouble.

51
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,860
Do -

52
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,130
I go down from there?

53
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,010
I’m leaving.

54
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,570
Wait. We’re meeting your lawyer at 10AM.

55
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,600
Okay. I’ll see you there.

56
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,990
Brother Kong!

57
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,540
What are you doing in here? Get out!

58
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,420
I heard everything last night.

59
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,060
-Don’t tell me - -Heard what? Get out!

60
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
-No - -Get out!

61
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
It’s been a while. It’s been a while. Have a seat.

62
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,450
Have you thought it through?

63
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,250
Of course.

64
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,250
I will fully represent the involved parties,

65
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,000
regarding Ms Qiu Ying’s violation of Mr Ji Xiang Kong’s personal privacy

66
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,640
and personal reputation, to facilitate discussion.

67
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,200
My client is willing to accept reasonable compensation terms.

68
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,700
How much do you think is acceptable?

69
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,220
Name it.

70
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,860
One million. Not too much, right?

71
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,300
One million?

72
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,100
Is my reputation not worth a million dollars?

73
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,980
A million dollars? This is called a scam.

74
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,540
Watch what you say in front of the two lawyers.

75
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,290
Calm down. It’s okay.

76
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,010
Is there any room for negotiation?

77
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,670
Considering Ms Qiu Ying’s financial situation,

78
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,750
my client is willing to take the biggest step back.

79
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,550
Ji Xiang Kong.

80
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,460
Thank you.

81
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,720
How will you thank me? Please don’t say you’ll marry me.

82
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
I might really agree to it.

83
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,800
Excuse me. Lawyer Chen has barely left.

84
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,600
This is called teasing. Understood?

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Regardless of your motive, thank you.

86
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,750
You’re welcome. I’m just saving myself some trouble.

87
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,870
Oh yes.

88
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,310
Let me give you some advice. Drink less in the future.

89
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,820
You’re so scary when you’re drunk. You talk too much.

90
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,820
What did I say?

91
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,340
Things that should’ve been said, things that shouldn’t have -

92
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,690
you said them all. Think about it. I’m leaving.

93
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,850
Things that should’ve been said, things that shouldn’t have -

94
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,610
What did I say?

95
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,610
I don’t care about what you said.

96
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,890
Have you forgotten to tell me something?

97
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,800
Don’t pretend to be innocent or stupid.

98
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,080
You were drinking with Ji Xiang Kong last night?!

99
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,080
You lied to me and said you were with your friend!

100
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Isn’t he one of my friends?

101
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,750
You -

102
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,790
Right?

103
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,230
You played me! Stand there, Qiu Ying! I’m not done with you!

104
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,390
Yi Yi. The snacks here are the best. Let’s go.

105
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,700
Let me get you some delicious food. Don’t be angry.

106
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,500
Welcome to Premium Snacks Liang Pin.

107
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,180
We won’t have to worry about snacks ever again.

108
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,500
Tell me the truth. What did you do yesterday?

109
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,940
Be honest or be punished!

110
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,130
Relax. We really didn’t do anything.

111
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,370
You didn’t do anything?

112
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,850
If you didn’t, why was he so willing to do the settlement today?

113
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,650
Who are you lying to?

114
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,370
I thought it strange too. Why was he suddenly willing to help me?

115
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,520
But nothing happened between us.

116
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,920
I had too much to drink.

117
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,440
You dared to drink too much?

118
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,800
You -

119
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,980
Yi Yi, this shrimp cracker is delicious.

120
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,460
Don’t change the subject. Tell me.

121
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Did Ji Xiang Kong force you to drink?

122
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,980
No. He really didn’t.

123
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,380
Why did you drink so much then?

124
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,060
Don’t you know your own limit?

125
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,660
What if you drank too much and something had happened to you?

126
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,420
I was in a bad mood, so I drank a little.

127
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,780
I accidentally drank too much.

128
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Even if you were in a bad mood, you shouldn’t have looked

129
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,540
for Ji Xiang Kong for a drink.

130
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,140
You could’ve had drinks with me! I’m so angry.

131
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,090
Alright. I’ll buy you more snacks. Don’t be angry.

132
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,330
I swallowed my pride to ask Jeffrey to step up.

133
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,690
What about him?

134
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,670
He turned around and reconciled with the female hosts.

135
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,190
The sponsors are asking for an explanation.

136
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,670
What explanation do I have? What explanation could I give?

137
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,350
I can’t be the manager anymore. I really can’t do it.

138
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,470
What happened, President Jin?

139
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,590
Did you know about the settlement between Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying?

140
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,830
Settlement? When did this happen?

141
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,750
What do you mean when? It was yesterday!

142
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,670
Ask Lawyer Zhou about it.

143
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,350
Where is Ji Xiang Kong? Call him over.

144
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,350
I’m cancelling his contract.

145
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,190
President Jin. Calm down.

146
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,430
Ji Xiang Kong must have had his reasons for doing this.

147
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,500
Let me tell you. Don’t speak up for him.

148
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,620
President Bai is angry beyond belief.

149
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,780
If you don’t cancel Ji Xiang Kong’s

150
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,540
contract, this matter won’t blow over.

151
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,020
If this matter doesn’t blow over,

152
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,160
our team’s reputation cannot be salvaged.

153
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Is pushing your teammate out once something bad happens

154
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
the working style of our team?

155
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
This matter was clearly orchestrated by someone

156
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,920
to harm Ji Xiang Kong and Chuan Qi.

157
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
Cancelling Ji Xiang Kong’s

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,280
contract without rhyme or reason -

159
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,880
aren’t you afraid the other teammates would feel let down?

160
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,070
President Jin. If we don’t cancel the contract,

161
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,590
how do we explain ourselves to our sponsors? Which is more important?

162
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,300
Zhao Yang. Have you managed to contact Jeffrey?

163
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,660
How have I not contacted him?

164
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,180
I have,but Jeffrey is ignoring me. What should I do?

165
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,660
What’s most important right now is to contact Jeffrey.

166
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,570
If Jeffrey could step up to clarify in person,

167
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,970
the problem will resolve itself.

168
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,850
Zhao Yang. If you truly have the team’s well-being at heart,

169
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,490
you will contact Jeffrey right away,

170
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,290
instead of sitting here and sowing discord between us.

171
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,410
What are you talking about?

172
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,330
You!

173
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,450
Who’s sowing discord?

174
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,730
-You! -Enough!

175
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
We’ll have a press conference on Monday.

176
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,360
If the problem isn’t solved by then,

177
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,000
we’ll cancel Ji Xiang Kong’s contract during the conference.

178
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,430
Has it gone through?

179
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,550
No.

180
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,180
Hello?

181
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,660
Brother Kong, have you met Jeffrey?

182
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Not yet. The information might be wrong.

183
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,940
He might not be staying in this hotel.

184
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,500
Zhao Yang tattled on you in front of President Jin.

185
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,380
Hand it over.

186
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,980
Wait. Coach Luo will speak to you.

187
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,570
How could you not have discussed such a big thing with me,

188
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,450
and gone ahead secretly to settle with that lady?

189
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,690
Coach. Qiu Ying didn’t upload that video.

190
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,480
Do you have proof?

191
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,480
Not yet, but -

192
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,400
If you don’t have proof, why did you decide

193
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,240
to settle with Qiu Ying on your own?

194
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
You’re silently admitting to the rumors of your relationship.

195
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,180
If Zhao Yang bites on this point,

196
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
he can force the cancellation of your contract. Did you know that?

197
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,340
Coach, Qiu Ying is innocent.

198
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,180
She’s lost her job and sold her house.

199
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,020
With Zhao Yang’s methods, she would go bankrupt.

200
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,860
I cannot sacrifice innocent people to protect my own interests.

201
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,020
Looks like you’ve thought it through before the settlement.

202
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,980
Nothing I say will matter now.

203
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,220
No. No. Brother Kong.

204
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,740
President Jin wanted to cancel your contract today.

205
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,740
Coach Luo had a big fight with President Jin

206
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,050
before he compromised and gave you two more days.

207
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,890
Don’t talk like this.

208
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,810
Sorry, Coach.

209
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,250
I’ve caused you so much trouble.

210
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,630
The press conference is on Monday.

211
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,710
If Jeffrey could clarify things in person, things might just turn around.

212
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,310
I’m hanging up, Coach.

213
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:46,070
Jeffrey. Can I have a word with you alone?

214
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,470
I know why you’re looking for me.

215
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,910
I’ve seen the video online. It’s fake.

216
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,150
I hope you could step out to clarify that.

217
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,020
I heard that if this matter was seen as real,

218
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,300
you may be fired by your company.

219
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,120
Your attitude towards me that day made me very upset.

220
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,440
You paying a small price is acceptable.

221
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,760
If this is what it is, I don’t want to help a loser.

222
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,990
If you don’t clarify, do you want everyone to think

223
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,350
that you got beaten up by me?

224
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,780
Stop looking at the computer, Qiu Ying.

225
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,170
Put it away. Let’s eat.

226
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,130
Soon. Five minutes.

227
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,570
Our homemade spicy hotpot is here! Put away your laptop.

228
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,450
Come.

229
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,650
If you stare at the screen every day,

230
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,850
when will you eat on time?

231
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,120
Thank goodness for me. I’m an angel. Here.

232
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Thank you, angel.

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,040
The man who marries you in the future will be so incredibly lucky.

234
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,430
Your tongue is so sweet.

235
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,670
Don’t eat it all by yourself.

236
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,590
-I want some too. -Mine fell.

237
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,070
You’re so selfish.

238
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,660
Look here, Yi Yi.

239
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,980
What’s that?

240
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,620
Ji Xiang Kong has released an audience survey on the Chuan Qi team.

241
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,700
A 70% support rate!

242
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,220
We’ve only made our settlement yesterday.

243
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,100
This went online today.

244
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,690
Did you know?

245
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,050
The key thing is our relationship rumors are being spread far and wide.

246
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,480
You have tabloids and you’re still laughing?

247
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,480
I’m not laughing.

248
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,240
-You are! -I’m not.

249
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,300
I don’t think Ji Xiang Kong

250
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,540
will be able to turn things around this time.

251
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,820
I heard that Chuan Qi’s sponsors

252
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,940
were beyond angry when they heard about this,

253
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,020
and threatened to kill the sponsorships.

254
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,980
At tomorrow’s press conference,

255
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,620
Chuan Qi may cancel Ji Xiang Kong’s contract.

256
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,220
What should we do? Can we help him?

257
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,700
It’s easier said than done.

258
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,500
Who are we? Who would listen to us?

259
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,290
How could we help him?

260
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,690
I don’t know.

261
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Ji Xiang Kong helped me. I can’t stay out of this.

262
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,810
Most importantly, this started because of me.

263
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,750
Sister. You two have tabloids going on.

264
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,950
If you stepped up to say that

265
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,990
Ji Xiang Kong was innocent, who would believe you?

266
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,190
It’ll only get more complicated.

267
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,070
I could just put up the original video that I took.

268
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,790
Won’t that work?

269
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,510
How could you think of that? Look at the video you recorded.

270
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,750
You only managed to record the scuffle between the two of them.

271
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,630
Did you capture the

272
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,870
process in which Coach broke them apart?

273
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,990
Was it in there?

274
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,660
If you upload this video now, it will have no persuasiveness.

275
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,580
What should I do? Tell me.

276
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,600
Forget it. Eat up and we’ll think of something.

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,000
Hang on, Qiu Ying.

278
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,440
Look at that person. What about her?

279
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,150
She was filming this live too.

280
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,270
Maybe she captured the whole process.

281
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,390
If we could find this person,

282
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,150
and retrieve the complete video footage,

283
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,620
we can then prove Ji Xiang Kong’s innocence.

284
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,820
This person is overseas. How will we find her?

285
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,740
Are you going to Canada?

286
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,770
You’re so silly. Look. Isn’t this a tour group?

287
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,930
If it’s a tour group, they’ll have to come back.

288
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,890
If we find the tour group, we’ll be able to find this person.

289
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,890
If we find this person, and recover this footage,

290
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,200
we’ll have concrete proof!

291
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,440
Even if she came back,

292
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,840
there are so many tour groups in China. How will you find her?

293
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,600
Don’t forget that I’m a professional news reporter.

294
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,390
How could this little task confuddle me as Ms Reporter?

295
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,270
Don’t worry. Leave this to me. Hurry and eat up.

296
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,580
Look for the truth. Seek justice.

297
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,580
This is my true calling.

298
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,100
Silly girl.

299
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,010
Hello, Yi Yi. I found the tour company.

300
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,890
Their tour leader has brought a tour overseas

301
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,610
and will come back on an afternoon flight.

302
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,010
As long as you’ve found them.

303
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,320
Let’s pray that the flight isn’t delayed.

304
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,620
You predicted it. The flights are widely delayed.

305
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,900
Ji Xiang Kong is really unlucky. Even god isn’t helping him out.

306
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,100
There isn’t anything we can do.

307
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,180
Chuan Qi has notified the media.

308
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,580
The press conference will take place tomorrow morning

309
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,660
to announce Ji Xiang Kong’s contract cancellation.

310
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,500
I’ll wait a little more. Bye.

311
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,910
Brother Kong! You didn’t see my text messages?

312
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,430
Coach Luo just told me that Jeffrey has replied

313
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,510
and isn’t going to the conference. He’s leaving on a flight now.

314
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,110
Got it. Go back first.

315
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,230
No. Jeffrey is leaving. He’s on a plane.

316
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,150
Got it. Don’t worry. Head back to train first.

317
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,830
Whether my contract gets cancelled, we have to win this competition.

318
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,030
Are you okay?

319
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,660
I’m leaving. Jeffrey is leaving too.

320
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Why isn’t the plane here yet?

321
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
It hasn’t departed.

322
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,240
It’s okay.

323
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,640
As long as the flight isn’t cancelled, we’ll still have hope.

324
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,470
Alright. I’ll wait here with you.

325
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,590
My Yi Yi is the best.

326
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,140
Come. Have some Jian Jiao to boost your energy.

327
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,380
Thank you.

328
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,890
I’m so sleepy.

329
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,900
Get up.

330
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,860
Take it easy.

331
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:29,140
What time is it? Look at your complexion.

332
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,010
If you keep waiting, you’ll look like raw ginger.

333
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,410
Go back first, Yi Yi. I’ll wait a little more.

334
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,840
Don’t wait anymore. It’s 3AM.

335
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
The press conference will start in a few hours.

336
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,360
Besides, even if you found the tour leader, it’s been so long.

337
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,160
She might have deleted the video.

338
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,020
As long as there’s a ray  of hope, I’ll wait.

339
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,900
Are you running a fever or did Ji Xiang Kong drug you?

340
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,020
Is he worth it?

341
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,500
It’s neither.

342
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,100
I feel like I should do something, or my heart will feel guilty.

343
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,740
Go back first, Yi Yi.

344
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,740
You still have to attend the conference.

345
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,530
Alright. I’ll head back first to prepare ahead of time.

346
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,530
I’ll be contactable anytime.

347
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,250
Take care of yourself. Bye.

348
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,990
Take care on the road. Bye.

349
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,270
Hello to everyone in front of their screens.

350
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,910
I am Lu Yi Yi, a reporter from Dong Gan E-Sports Magazine.

351
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,660
Now, we’re at Chuan Qi’s press conference venue.

352
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,580
Manager Zhao has said that today,

353
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,460
everyone will have an answer.

354
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,700
Now, please follow me to the live venue

355
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,120
to understand the latest happenings. Thank you.

356
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,760
Come in.

357
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,720
Manager Zhao.

358
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,240
-Come in. -Manager Zhao.

359
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,000
Here. How is it?

360
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,360
Here are the people today.

361
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
Not bad.

362
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,240
Not too shabby.

363
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,510
You’re more capable than I am.

364
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,750
Manager Zhao has led well.

365
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,670
I’ve spread some rumors that

366
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,390
Chuan Qi and Ji Xiang Kong are cancelling the contract.

367
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,940
That’s how it should be.

368
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,580
We have to really blow this matter up.

369
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,220
Do you know what President Jin likes?

370
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
Face!

371
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,290
After the contract cancellation,

372
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,050
even if Ji Xiang Kong was innocent,

373
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,210
he wouldn’t be able to come back. Right?

374
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,650
To be honest, Manager Zhao,

375
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,490
I’ve already prepared the contract cancellation letters.

376
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,800
Why are you still standing here? Ask him to sign them!

377
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,480
Got it! I’ll do that right now.

378
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,040
Please come in.

379
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,590
-Brother Kong. -Ji.

380
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,900
The press conference is about to begin.

381
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,660
There are many reporters outside. What should we do?

382
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,740
I don’t know why this press conference is necessary.

383
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,500
Great. Another pest.

384
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,610
You’re all here. This is the contract cancellation document.

385
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,810
If there are no issues, please sign here.

386
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,280
We’re not signing. Has the conference begun? What’s the rush?

387
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,360
That -   If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.

388
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
Please go ahead.

389
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,740
Tell Zhao Yang that I’ll sign, but it will have to be after his entire act.

390
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,420
I’ll sign it right in front of him.

391
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,310
Hello, Yi Yi.

392
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,550
Qiu Ying. How is it going over there?

393
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,470
Look. Everyone is nearly here. The conference is about to start.

394
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,710
The plane has landed, but she hasn’t come out yet.

395
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,830
Will it really be too late?

396
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,430
What should we do?

397
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,310
Alright. I’ll wait for your news.

398
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,460
The bus is outside. Come.

399
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,240
Get up the bus here.. Follow me.

400
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,630
Wait!

401
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,910
Manager Zhao is here.

402
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,850
Welcome, everyone, and thank you for taking time

403
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,290
out of your busy schedules to come for the conference.

404
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,890
Our conference today will have -

405
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,410
Manager Zhao. According to reliable sources,

406
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,890
Ji Xiang Kong settled with Qiu Ying of his free will yesterday.

407
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,850
Is this true? Yes, Manager Zhao.

408
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,520
Can we say with certainty that the video

409
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Qiu Ying had uploaded is completely real?

410
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,360
Ji Xiang Kong did indeed attack Jeffrey in Vancouver?

411
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,720
Also, Manager Zhao.

412
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,000
If Ji Xiang Kong’s contract is cancelled,

413
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,230
I mean if, will there be a new

414
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,790
team member joining Chuan Qi?

415
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,070
We’re concerned about this as well. Right, everyone?

416
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,550
Yes, Manager Zhao. Please answer, Manager Zhao.

417
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,860
Please remain quiet. Please have a seat.

418
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,980
Firstly, I hereby represent the company and

419
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,940
Ji Xiang Kong to give everyone an apology.

420
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,770
Wait! Wait!

421
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,840
May I know where your tour leader is?

422
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,640
In that car.

423
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Thank you!

424
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,340
Excuse me, wait!

425
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Watch out!

426
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,980
Are you alright?

427
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,060
I finally found you!

428
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,780
We’re deeply apologetic about this messy situation.

429
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,850
Hurry.

430
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,850
Therefore, the company will announce

431
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,610
the cancellation of Ji Xiang Kong’s -

432
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,090
Manager Zhao.

433
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,990
I have a video in my hands that can prove Ji Xiang Kong’s innocence.

434
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,710
Do you want to see it?

435
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,910
Really?

436
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,110
Do you want to see it?

437
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,270
What video? Let me see!

438
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,510
Hurry, look!

439
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,510
Who is that? Who’s that in the video?

440
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,230
That’s all? Hurry. Take a look.

441
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,670
Ji Xiang Kong -

442
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,350
didn’t assault anyone.

443
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,590
He didn’t assault anyone.

444
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,900
What’s happening here? Please explain, Manager Zhao.

445
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,900
Despite the blurriness of this video,

446
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,140
you can clearly see that Ji Xiang Kong did not assault anyone.

447
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,540
Manager Zhao. Have you seen this video before?

448
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,160
Have you seen it before? Have you seen this video before?

449
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,400
Please answer, Manager Zhao.

450
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,400
What is it, Manager Zhao?

451
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,400
Take a look. Ji Xiang Kong didn’t assault anyone.

452
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,800
Yeah. Have you seen this video before?

453
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,800
Please answer, Manager Zhao.

454
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
What about it, Manager Zhao? Tell us more.

455
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,350
Neither I nor the company had seen this video before.

456
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,950
However, this piece of unofficial content

457
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,310
with extreme blurriness and without official confirmation

458
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,140
cannot be taken to be 100% real information.

459
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,420
Also, we will not negate the decisions

460
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,660
taken by the company because of this strange video,

461
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,730
or to needlessly protect our own team members.

462
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,930
Manager Zhao. Do your words represent the views of your entire team?

463
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,570
Now that we have evidence that could prove Ji Xiang Kong’s innocence,

464
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,130
you’ve denied it without confirmation.

465
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,050
Is it you or your team

466
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,330
that couldn't care less about the innocence

467
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,250
of your own team member?

468
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,440
Yeah!

469
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Every word from me represents the entire company.

470
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,120
We treasure our team members,

471
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,190
but we will not forgive or accept these terrible acts of assault.

472
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,910
The decisions taken by our company were built on solid evidence.

473
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,220
To our dear reporter friend here -

474
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,980
if you really had

475
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,060
the powerful evidence of the involved parties,

476
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,700
and didn’t simply take out this

477
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,340
blurry video footage, we would consider it. Really.

478
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,180
-You - -Furthermore,

479
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,140
Jeffrey himself is no longer in the country, right?

480
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,700
Manager Zhao is right.

481
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,490
Ji Xiang Kong.

482
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,770
Ji Xiang Kong. They’re saying that the video

483
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,610
just now was fake.

484
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,690
Did you hit anyone? Ji Xiang Kong.

485
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,890
Please answer, Ji Xiang Kong.

486
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,080
Did you assault anyone? Ji Xiang Kong.

487
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,320
Please stay quiet.

488
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,280
The sudden surfacing of this video cannot be taken

489
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,680
as concrete evidence, due to precautions.

490
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,780
Who told you to come?

491
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,420
Your appearance will only make matters worse,

492
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,780
and cause more trouble for the team. Did you know that?

493
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,980
No one knows the details of the incident

494
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,580
better than I, the involved party, do.

495
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,180
I believe that everyone here in this room today

496
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,460
will hope to get some direct information from me.

497
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,940
Ji Xiang Kong. What actually happened that day?

498
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,380
Yeah. What happened?

499
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,530
Please calm down.

500
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,370
What I want to say has been viewed by you in the video just now.

501
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,130
If you still don’t believe it, you can ask Jeffrey himself.

502
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,630
Jeffrey has gone back home.

503
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,190
How will he corroborate with your story? Right?

504
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,550
Manager Zhao. What era are we living in now?

505
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,110
With our evolved telecommunication,

506
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,150
do we have to have them present before we can clarify matters?

507
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,990
What’s that? What’s that?

508
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,270
I have a video footage. Please take a look.

509
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,540
The footage online is fake.

510
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,100
How could I have been assaulted by Ji Xiang Kong?

511
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,570
That’s incredulous.

512
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,160
Ji Xiang Kong. I’ll admit that your strategy is strong.

513
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,960
I’ll wait for you in the next season’s global finals competition.

514
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
That means that the assault video footage was falsified?

515
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,200
Ji Xiang Kong was wrongly accused!

516
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,960
That’s right! Ji Xiang Kong was wrongly accused!

517
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,000
Ji Xiang Kong!

518
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,070
What’s the relationship between you and Qiu Ying?

519
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,590
Why did she have to do this?

520
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,030
What happened?

521
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,620
I trust that you are all clear about the assault incident.

522
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,420
As for the relationship between me and a

523
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,780
certain female host that you all care about,

524
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,530
there isn’t really a story to tell here.

525
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,970
She didn’t upload the falsified video.

526
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,130
Qiu Ying and I are both victims.

527
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,530
As for the person who falsified

528
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,010
the video and tried to frame me,

529
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,530
Chuan Qi and I will definitely find him and punish him by law.

530
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,930
Manager Zhao. Chuan Qi was intending to announce

531
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,170
the cancellation of Ji Xiang Kong’s contract.

532
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,280
However, now that his innocence has been proven...

533
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,360
That -

534
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,910
As I’ve said just now, if Ji Xiang Kong was innocent,

535
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,110
our company would definitely not cancel his contract.

536
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,190
Thank you, Manager Zhao, for your understanding.

537
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,380
Also, I hope that everyone present will help our

538
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,740
Chuan Qi team to capture the mastermind.

539
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,180
Alright.

540
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
After this, it’ll be the media interviews.

541
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,340
If you have any questions, please ask Manager Zhao.

542
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,340
I’ll head off first.

543
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,140
What will I explain? I can’t explain anything.

544
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,020
Please answer, Manager Zhao.

545
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,410
Please explain.

546
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,210
Who is this mastermind?

547
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,130
Nothing. Please continue.

548
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,520
Let me tell you, Qiu Ying. It’s been resolved.

549
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,160
It’s been resolved.

550
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,440
Ji Xiang Kong had some conscience.

551
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,200
It was worth the overnight stay in the airport.

552
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,580
I can’t do it anymore. I’m going to take a nap here.

553
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,700
You can’t sleep in the airport!

554
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,340
Don’t hang up. Wait for me. I’ll look for you!
