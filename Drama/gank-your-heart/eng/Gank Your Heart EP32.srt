[Episode 32]

3
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,060
This Xia Ling

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,820
hasn't talk to us

5
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,610
since yesterday.

6
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,650
Not sure how did his

7
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,610
rehabilitation go.

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,250
We should think of

9
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,570
a solution to cheer him up.

10
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,470
I hate these bunch of people

11
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,110
scolding Brother Kong

12
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,230
and Xia Ling online.

13
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,750
Take a look at Pei Xi's Weibo.

14
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,310
Xia Ling is a rookie

15
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
and also a brave person.

16
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,430
We're at where we're now,

17
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,670
we won't back away.

18
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,870
The five of us

19
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,990
are inseparable.

20
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,270
but we'll never yield

21
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,750
during competition.

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,830
This Pei Xi

23
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,630
usually pulls a long face

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,550
but at crucial moment, he's pretty nice.

25
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,390
Indeed.

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,190
Yes.

27
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,470
He don't even use on Weibo.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,790
He specially opened

29
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,100
an account for Xia Ling.

30
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,540
Have to make a response.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,540
Repost,

32
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,300
Changing of position is agreed by

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,380
all members after discussion,

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,620
everyone please respect

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,860
Phoenix's tactic choice.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Everyone, please

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,960
give us some more time.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
Xia Ling,

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
stop right there.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Are you

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,480
defeat just because of a match?

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,840
No need for you to care.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
All of us believe in you,

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,350
why can't you

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,750
believe in yourself?

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,350
I don't want to be a burden.

47
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,550
From the day you entered the team,

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,030
you're already a burden to us.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,220
How did you play when I gave the

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,740
middle position to you?

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
Is this how you treat me?

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,660
Is this how you treat the whole team?

53
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,730
Pei Xi...

54
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,450
Trash!

55
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,290
Pei Xi, are you insane?

56
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,690
What are you doing?

57
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,130
Don't you help him.

58
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,850
-He's just a trash.          -Get up.

59
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,010
A trash that

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,250
doesn't dare to even stand.

61
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,490
Shut up.

62
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,770
What are you blabbering about?

63
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,290
And you Qiu Ying,

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
you understand Iconquer?

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
You don't even know what Iconquer is.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,200
I really don't know

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,520
how you become a commentator.

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
You're nothing to your name today

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
if it's not for Ji Xiang Kong.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,790
You're trash. He's a trash.

71
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,750
Trash.

72
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,790
Pei Xi, you're too much.

73
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,950
Pei Xi, shut up!

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,900
Xia Ling, you're

75
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,140
standing now.

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,460
We're back.

77
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,370
Leg... you don't need the clutches anymore.

78
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,090
No, Pei Xi...

79
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,450
He's leg is okay.

80
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,770
What happened to your face?

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Kid doesn't know well.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,760
I saw all the Weibo

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,480
post you guys posted.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,320
I can't be defeated

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,400
so easily.

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,620
Nice one, lad.

87
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
You get back pretty quickly.

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,260
Ah Xuan, let's play for a round.

89
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,660
Call Brother Xuan.

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,140
With you being like that,

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,900
you're not even any mature.

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,220
Still ask him to call you Brother.

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,180
You guys are bullies.

94
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,700
Okay, shalln't play with you.

95
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,180
-Who's this?         -Brother Xia Tian.

96
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,060
Pei Xi.

97
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,580
Captain, what brings you here?

98
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,780
Thanks, Brother.

99
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,570
Don't say thank you anymore,

100
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,730
I'll be scared if you say it again.

101
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,450
Xiang Kong, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,210
Why did you say sorry suddenly?

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,830
We shouldn't have asked you to give up

104
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,350
on Shadow just because of that match

105
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,150
and even question your own teammates.

106
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,710
I know,

107
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,230
you did it with us

108
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,230
in consideration.

109
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,390
Okay, enough said.

110
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,390
Let's start quickly.

111
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,790
Let me feel

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,910
your tactic, Shadow.

113
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,910
Anyhow, we took the

114
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,670
championship before.

115
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,470
Although you guys are young,

116
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,270
but we

117
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,470
will not show mercy.

118
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,070
Haven't been practicing in a while,

119
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,350
I don't know if I'm rusty now.

120
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,190
You definitely are.

121
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,990
Fellow Masters,

122
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,180
are you going to practice with us?

123
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,740
Let me tell you, it's all Pei Xi's fault.

124
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,740
You lad,

125
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,780
said you will treat me to a meal.

126
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,060
He asked me to come for training

127
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,220
on the first meal he treat.

128
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,380
Nice.

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,240
Able to gather the 5 Masters here,

130
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
steady.

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
It's just a matter of a meal.

132
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,640
Okay,

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,520
let's see if these bunch of old people

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
are still as good as before.

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
Saying if you aren't old.

136
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
You... Aren't you

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,040
lack of one person?

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
It can be settled with adding the computer.

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
Add the computer?

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
We play despite 4 vs 5.

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
Let Qiu Ying to go over.

142
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,270
Come.

143
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,740
Who's that?

144
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,380
Who is that?

145
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,980
Oh god, Li Shao Feng.

146
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,940
Xiang Kong, he's

147
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,140
the first man of China for E-sports.

148
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,130
That Li Shao Feng?

149
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,930
He's the first man

150
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,970
from China to stand at the

151
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,170
top of the world with the China flag

152
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,290
for consecutive 2 years.

153
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,610
The first man from China to win

154
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,370
the championship for E-sports,

155
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,170
-Li Shao Feng.          -Oh god.

156
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,170
Afraid now?

157
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,850
Am I dreaming?

158
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,850
Pinch me.

159
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,840
An introduction.

160
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Li Shao Feng, my good friend of many years.

161
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
Recently, setting up a business

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
specialising in E-sports equipments.

163
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
It's not easy to ask him out.

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,070
I specially asked him out to

165
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,310
give you special trainings.

166
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,670
No, captain.

167
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,270
Why did you not

168
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,190
tell me before?

169
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,830
I can't possibly

170
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,030
tell you everything.

171
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,510
Why?

172
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,060
Seems like I'm not invited,

173
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,220
I'll get going first.

174
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,060
No.

175
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,900
No.

176
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,220
Xiang Kong quick, introduce yourself.

177
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,260
Hello, Brother Shao Feng.

178
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm Ji Xiang Kong,

179
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,180
captain of Phoenix.

180
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,740
We're just too shock,

181
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,740
didn't expect you to be here.

182
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,900
Ji Xiang Kong,

183
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,380
Gu Fang mentioned you to me before.

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,300
The legendary Master of Deception.

185
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,260
I came today

186
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,330
to see how good

187
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,730
you really is.

188
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,010
Don't,

189
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,090
you're too flattering.

190
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,970
You're then our senior,

191
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,010
we should be learning from you.

192
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,520
Then...

193
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Brother Shao Feng...

194
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,440
Another handshake.

195
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm blessed now.

196
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,620
We... We all watched you

197
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,380
since we're young...

198
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,700
grew up watching you compete, then...

199
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,620
You're the idol of

200
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,700
every E-sports player.

201
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,060
It's really my pleasure to be able to train with you,

202
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm really agitated now.

203
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,740
Lin Yi Xuan.

204
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,020
You know me?

205
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,820
Yes, I know you're the

206
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,140
support with this look of yours.

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
Look, my idol knows me.

208
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,380
Of course, not just you.

209
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,380
There's

210
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,020
Pei Xi, Xia Ling and Lao Sun.

211
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,340
You guys are the dark horse

212
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,660
that came out of nowhere this year.

213
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,780
It's difficult to not know you guys.

214
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,490
It was then when I saw you getting

215
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,450
the championship

216
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,490
when I decided

217
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,850
to do this as my career.

218
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,290
I... I'm also a fan of you.

219
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,590
Xia Ling, you're my fan.

220
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,670
Is your phone with you?

221
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,870
Enough, go.

222
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,630
Okay.

223
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,990
Talk about signatures

224
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,630
and photos later.

225
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,350
Now, use your time for the competition.

226
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,110
Come, training.

227
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,590
Let's start.

228
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,190
Welcome!

229
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,590
Can you even do it since you

230
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,550
only do commentary now?

231
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,270
What if you're rusty...

232
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,030
Better than you okay?

233
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,990
Be careful, go.

234
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,470
Xia Tian, you don't have to come over.

235
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,110
Ji Xiang Kong and I

236
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,500
don't have a problem here.

237
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Be careful of Luo Tian.

238
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,340
Teacher Luo still blocked me.

239
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,140
Teacher Luo,

240
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,060
your guess is pretty accurate.

241
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,060
How did you know I'm here?

242
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,740
How can I be a commentator if I don't understand you?

243
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,860
Okay, no problem.

244
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
I see Xia Tian.

245
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
Can you chase him?

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,880
I've waited long enough.

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,880
Xia Tian, don't go after him.

248
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
Look, look at the who.

249
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Xia Tian is here again.

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Save me.

251
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,880
You're an embarassment.

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,280
Young kid, not bad.

253
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
Are they...

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
Are they starting a group fight? Quick.

255
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,820
Come, we're here to take revenge.

256
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Still as childish.

257
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,940
Enough of talking, let's start.

258
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Congratulations to Phoenix for winning twice in a row,

259
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
successfully leaving the losing group!

260
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,750
They will be up against Wei Teng

261
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,990
next for the championship.

262
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,990
-I let you.            -Not bad.

263
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,870
We're leaving

264
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,310
but really,

265
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,390
thank you all.

266
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,510
If it'snot for your special training,

267
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,780
we wouldn't have

268
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,540
such improvement

269
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
in such a shortspan.

270
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,660
We aren't that important.

271
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,700
The greatest statesman

272
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,300
is still yourselves.

273
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,300
Yes, looking at you guys now

274
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,820
reminds me of us then.

275
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,220
Our training evironment then was

276
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,060
worse compared to you,

277
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,700
without sponsers

278
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
and encouragement.

279
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,860
It's all based on our passion and faith

280
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,500
for games that

281
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,210
pull us through the matches.

282
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,530
Brother Shao Feng,

283
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,690
do you have any tips

284
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,970
to get the champion?

285
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,090
Better still, get two of it.

286
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,250
Tips?

287
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,570
Actually, training is still the most important.

288
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
Target your weakness

289
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,960
and practice continuously.

290
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
Practice till you exceed others,

291
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,160
turning your weakness

292
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
to your strength.

293
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,320
Other than that,

294
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
your understanding and

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,520
attitude towards E-sports balance out

296
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,180
every one of your strength

297
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
and the teamwork among all of you,

298
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,780
this is a very

299
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,660
important point for your

300
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,860
competition this time,

301
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,660
Indeed.

302
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
When we practice back then,

303
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,060
it was really not interesting,

304
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,900
thought of giving up.

305
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,060
Xia Tian and I even

306
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,500
tried escaping once.

307
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,700
So many kids around.

308
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,900
Was it only once?

309
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,020
It was numerous times okay?

310
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,740
Every time I have

311
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,300
catch the both of you back, still have to

312
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,540
give you psychological treatment.

313
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
-That's because...           -All his fault.

314
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
-No, it's because...          -He's burdensome.

315
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,660
What, I'm burdensome?

316
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,020
You look honesty but you're so evil.

317
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,100
Do you know?

318
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,210
I really envy you guys

319
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,810
to have such

320
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,090
like-minded brothers

321
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,330
to go forward together.

322
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,170
Iconquer is a game for brothers.

323
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,370
As longas the five of you

324
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,730
work hard together,

325
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,150
you guys will be invincible.

326
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,550
Don't worry,

327
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,790
we'll definitely not

328
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,830
let your hopes down.

329
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,110
Allowing China E-sports

330
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,950
to get to the top of the world.

331
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,870
I believe you guys can do it.

332
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,990
The finals is tomorrow,

333
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,350
we'll be waiting to celebrate for you all.

334
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,350
All the best!

335
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,430
All the best!

336
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,030
What are you all doing?

337
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,310
Brother Qi, don't go over yet.

338
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,230
Top your head.

339
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,590
Push in the middle.

340
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,230
Don't abandon me okay?

341
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,660
Top.

342
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
What top? Middle.

343
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,700
Tong Wu come and help me.

344
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,380
Brother Qi, do't go over.

345
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,060
Brother Qi.

346
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,620
Just follow me

347
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,900
wherever I go okay?

348
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,160
And you, don't play anymore.

349
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,880
What are you all doing?

350
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,280
The bunch of you are useless.

351
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,280
Especially you, Tong Wu.

352
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Why didn't you come and help me?

353
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Aren't I asking for death if I were

354
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
to just go over?

355
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,630
I'm the captain,

356
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,790
you come when I ask you to.

357
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm sorry.

358
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,870
I'm sorry.

359
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,940
Qi Yue, can you not get physical

360
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,460
even if you're the captain.

361
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,540
What's wrong with scolding him?

362
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,780
Leave if you don't agree.

363
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,460
You're not worthy to be the captain.

364
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,490
What did you say?

365
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,330
What did you say?

366
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,610
I asked you to be careful.

367
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,610
Wei Teng is doom

368
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:32,970
to have a captain like you.

369
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,970
-Lu Sheng.          -You can't fight, Lu Sheng.

370
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,130
Stop fighting.

371
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,570
I'll expose you if you comtinue fighting.

372
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,410
What are you exposing?

373
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,080
What are you exposing?

374
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,440
What are you exposing?

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,080
Let me tell you, don't think that nobody

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
knows what happened in the meeting room.

377
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,280
I saw it,

378
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
I saw everything.

379
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,550
Tong Wu!

380
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,510
Tong Wu, don't you run.

381
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
Borther Sheng, thank you for just now.

382
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Are you okay?

383
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,060
I knew you'll be hiding here again.

384
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,340
Qi Yue is looking everywhere for you.

385
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,100
What do you mean just now?

386
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,740
Why is Qi Yue so anxious?

387
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,140
What did you see?

388
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,820
Nothing.

389
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,060
Is it regarding leakage of tactic?

390
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,930
I long suspect that he was the one behind it.

391
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,450
He just wants to chase Ji Xiang Kong out.

392
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,690
I saw him record

393
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,570
with my own eyes

394
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,450
at the meeting room

395
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,510
that day.

396
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,910
After the meeting,

397
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,230
he went to meet Qiao Xin.

398
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,950
Why didn't you speak up then?

399
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,070
I don't dare to.

400
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,030
Also, Ji Xiang Kong and Sister Wen has already

401
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,030
left when I wanted to say it out.

402
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,110
Although Ji Xiang Kong has left

403
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,070
but if this incident

404
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,390
is not explained properly,

405
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,510
it will forever be a stain

406
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,830
for his career.

407
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,430
Also Qiu Ying,

408
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,030
she got fired from

409
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,550
Ji Guang because of this.

410
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,180
Tong Wu,

411
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,900
if you still treat Ji Xiang Kong

412
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,820
as a brother,

413
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,900
I think you should step up.

414
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,560
Why are you still hestitating?

415
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
You're afraid that Qi Yue will chase you out?

416
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
How far do you think the

417
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,400
Wei Teng now is able to go?

418
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm not afraid that Qi Yue will chase me out

419
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,880
and I'm also not scared of Qi Yue

420
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,360
but do you know?

421
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
I don't have evidence.

422
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
Do you think the committee

423
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,960
will believe me even if I step up?

424
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,720
How about

425
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
we look for Luo Tian?

426
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,470
He's investigating on this matter.

427
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,870
Why are you hestitating?

428
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,830
I'll go with you.

429
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,380
At most, we'll leave Wei Teng together.

430
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,290
Teacher Luo.

431
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,570
Are the both of you speaking the truth?

432
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,970
Qi Yue really did record

433
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,450
and passed it to Qiao Xin?

434
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,850
I saw it with my own eyes,

435
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,690
at the entrance of the hotel gym.

436
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,080
Let's go to the hotel

437
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,560
and ask for their CCTV,

438
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
see if we can get evidence.

439
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,080
Let's go, take my car.

440
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,350
Teacher Luo, you're so busy

441
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,070
yet help us with our special training.

442
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,750
We haven't play

443
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,220
a match in a long time.

444
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,860
This reminds me of

445
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,500
hose days where

446
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,700
we strive here together.

447
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,580
Oh,

448
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,380
there's progression for the

449
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,620
issue of tactic leakage,

450
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,580
the committee

451
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,940
should release the results soon.

452
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,650
Thank you

453
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,490
for always helping me.

454
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,930
I promised you before

455
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,530
that I'll bring you justice,

456
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
After the tactic leakage incident

457
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,040
is over,

458
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,200
are you still willing to return to be commentator?

459
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,580
Of course

460
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,820
but now,

461
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,940
Phoenix needs me.

462
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,740
[2019 Spring Tournament Finals]

463
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,690
Return me Pei Xi!

464
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,810
Return me Middle!

465
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,850
Change Xia Ling away.

466
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,650
Return me Pei Xi!

467
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,550
Return me Pei Xi!

468
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,110
Change Xia Ling away.

469
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,070
Return me Pei Xi!

470
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,100
Fellow summoners,

471
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,620
welcome to the venue of 2019

472
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,660
final Iconquer

473
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,940
Spring tournament.

474
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm the host for today, Luo Tian.

475
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm Ah Can.

476
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
Welcome everyone here.

477
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
The new dark horse,

478
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,640
Phoenix will be up against

479
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
Wei Teng in the Iconquer

480
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,840
final match today.

481
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,400
The winner between

482
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,360
them

483
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,920
is able to get the only ticket

484
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,480
to

485
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,280
the global final competition.

486
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,120
Yes,

487
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,790
Iconquer is finally organizing

488
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,230
a global competition here in China

489
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,350
so I hope

490
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,310
that our China team

491
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,910
is able to gain glory on our own land.

492
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,470
Next, we'll

493
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,780
use our loudest applause

494
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,420
to welcome both teams,

495
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,860
Phoenix and Wei Teng!

496
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,970
Welcome everyone.

497
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,880
Everyone,

498
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,950
I announce the competiiton

499
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,670
officially begins!

500
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,030
Both teams, please have a seat.

501
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,270
Okay,

502
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,990
attack.

503
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,830
Take a look.

504
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,700
The jungle can't go out yet.

505
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,740
Don't be afraid of him,

506
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,780
Ji Xiang Kong only has these two tricks.

507
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,420
This Lu Sheng

508
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,420
can't get a single economy.

509
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,140
-We'll continue to presurize him.          -Okay.

510
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Middle is pretty steady.

511
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,140
Xia Ling, is Xia Ling.

512
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,380
He's operation in the middle

513
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,380
has triple kill instantly.

514
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,820
Xia Ling isn't the rookie

515
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,020
Xia Ling we knew then.

516
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,460
Shen Yue, go.

517
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,740
Take down the overconfident Xia Ling.

518
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,170
-Okay, got it.         -Quick.

519
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:09,970
I don't know

520
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,930
Where Pei Xi is now.

521
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,650
You guys be careful.

522
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,610
Attack.

523
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,370
Attack.

524
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,290
Give it to you.

525
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:14,730
Give it to you.

526
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,690
Chase him quickly.

527
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,650
Let us see,

528
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,130
Xia Ling's assist came on time,

529
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,090
Based on his economy now...

530
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
Xia Ling, do your kill.

531
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
Xia Ling, start your show.

532
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
Push, another wave.

533
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Another wave.

534
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,240
I'll tank the turret, don't wait for the minions.

535
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,080
Group fight, Shen Yue attack, quick.

536
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,020
Let us congratulate Phoenix

537
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,780
in winning on the first match!

538
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,060
Congratulations Phoenix!

539
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,180
Young lad,

540
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
my Son is competing in there.

541
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,020
Can I enter?

542
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,100
Do you have a ticket?

543
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,500
Bought the tickets?

544
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,260
No, it was sold out long ago.

545
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,700
I gave Ying ZI a call,

546
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
she's coming out to fetch us.

547
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,610
Ying Zi!

548
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,170
Here's my working pass.

549
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:06,890
Dad,

550
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,010
why did you come

551
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,810
come suddenly?

552
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,150
We don't understand while watching it at home

553
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,110
and she's worried about Xia Ling.

554
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,790
Let's go in.

555
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,430
Auntie and Dad,

556
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,950
come in quickly.

557
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,390
Let's go.

558
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,750
-Sorry for troubling you.         -No problem.

559
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,950
That's Xia Ling.

560
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,790
Look,

561
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,310
Xia Ling.

562
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,190
I see him.

563
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,070
Auntie, come over quickly.

564
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,630
Thank you.

565
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,020
Dad, sit.

566
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,940
Thank you.

567
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,020
Both sides of the team are

568
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,940
1 to 1 now.

569
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,260
1 to 1?

570
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes, it's the match point now.

571
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,920
Which is Xia Ling?

572
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
That, middle, Zhi Heng.

573
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Which?

574
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,200
The one in purple hair,

575
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,400
do you see it?

576
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,640
The one wearing red?

577
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,280
Yes.

578
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,360
That, the one in the middle.

579
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm looking.

580
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
Don't talk too much,

581
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,520
the competition is about to start.

582
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,390
Be the eyes.

583
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,190
Okay, I'll go now.

584
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,830
You be careful.

585
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,590
Okay.

586
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,710
Top, I'm at the top now.

587
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,710
He has his skill now.

588
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,390
He has his skill now.

589
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:15,950
This wave is okay.

590
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,550
There's only 4 of them, go.

591
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,470
Group fight.

592
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,830
Auntie, don't worry.

593
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,870
Xia Ling is only

594
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,820
lacking of 300 coins,

595
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,220
as long as he buy

596
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,980
all his  equipments,

597
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,780
he can fight others.

598
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,620
How much is needed?

599
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,420
It's fake, auntie.

600
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,730
Attack, can push.

601
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,050
I can attack.

602
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,930
Attack.

603
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,530
I'll go first.

604
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,530
Attack, I see Xia Ling.

605
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,930
Qi Yue and Shen Yue

606
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,730
are in our jungle.

607
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,370
Do we catch them?

608
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,210
No,

609
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,090
let's put on an act.

610
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,050
Okay.

611
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:41,930
Xia Ling, bait them.

612
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,570
Let us have a look,

613
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,890
Xia Ling position is a little dangerous.

614
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,050
Xia Ling is trying

615
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,010
to be a bait?

616
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,250
But Double Moon

617
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:48,930
will not let

618
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,970
such an opportunity slide.

619
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,000
-They're baited.        -Nince.

620
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,480
Xia Ling, I'm here to help you.

621
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,920
Pei Xi came, entering from the back.

622
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,400
Attacking the opponents unprepared.

623
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Nice one.

624
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,070
This tactic

625
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,630
of baiting the opponent is not bad.

626
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,870
Pei Xi, just you wait.

627
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,230
We can't attack.

628
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,110
It's just the both of them,

629
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,990
mana isn't enough.

630
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,510
Double Moon escaped death.

631
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,700
Ji Xiang Kong...

632
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,420
Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan are coming.

633
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,140
Seems like

634
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
Wei Teng is losing a turret.

635
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,100
Phoenix is at an

636
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,700
advantage for this operation.

637
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,620
What does that mean?

638
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
He took a detour,

639
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,020
they'll win as long as

640
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,140
they destroy the crystal.

641
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,300
Pull back a little.

642
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,940
Pull back a little.

643
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,460
I'll retreat first.

644
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,100
I'll retreat first.

645
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,060
Develop first,

646
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,980
don't fight.

647
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,620
Develop first.

648
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,220
Enough.

649
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,970
This wave is too painful.

650
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,730
Xia Ling, you and Pei Xi

651
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,890
change positions. We push from the middle.

652
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:34,730
Understood.

653
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,570
Okay.

654
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,690
Push middle, I'm coming.

655
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,370
Let me see,

656
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,050
it's getting to Wei Teng's head

657
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,210
and they don't intend to give up.

658
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Shen Yue and Tong Wu are

659
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
chasing after the escaped Pei Xi.

660
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,360
Phoenix assist after seeing the situation.

661
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,360
I think good teams

662
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,480
assist very quickly.

663
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
Yes, Lin Yi Xuan and Sun Ze Yi

664
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,640
cooperate with Ji Xiang Kong,

665
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,900
reaching almost instantly

666
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,540
besde Pei Xi,

667
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Wei Teng better run.

668
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,940
If not, they'll be in trouble.

669
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,300
They'll be doomed.

670
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,820
It's a win.

671
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,540
Not yet,

672
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,580
they're destroying the turret.

673
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
They win as long as they

674
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,580
down they crystal.

675
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,500
Can attack.

676
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,220
Still can attack.

677
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,780
Attack.

678
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,100
I'll charge.

679
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,540
You Phoenix know how to support,

680
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,900
we Wei Teng are not easily dealt with.

681
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,140
It's coming,

682
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,340
Wei Teng's remaining 3 members are delivering.

683
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,420
5 of them gather,

684
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,460
are they starting a group fight soon?

685
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,780
They can't start a group fight,

686
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,660
mana isn't enough.

687
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,020
but they didn't realised that

688
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,060
the one in the middle

689
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,540
now is Pei Xi.

690
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,530
Isn't Pei Xi

691
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,690
jungling just now?

692
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,890
This is the Shadow tactic,

693
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,810
changing positions flexibly,

694
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,570
catching the opponents off guard.

695
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,650
Also, take a closer look,

696
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,570
Xia Ling is at a

697
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,730
disadvantage if opponents were

698
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,070
to start a group fight.

699
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,110
They only have 4 poeple now,

700
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,230
let's start a group fight. go!

701
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,830
Hurry.

702
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,150
They're all coming up.

703
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,550
Stay back if you can't follow up with the damage.

704
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,350
Wait for me.

705
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,590
They're starting a group fight.

706
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,670
Fight with them.

707
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,470
Shen Yue...

708
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,750
Shen Yue started a group fight here.

709
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,870
I controlled one.

710
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,630
I controlled one.

711
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,070
She Yue, you're too front.

712
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,270
Pei Xi is very direct,

713
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,550
casted a skill

714
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,430
and slain Shen Yue.

715
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,510
At the same time, retreated

716
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,430
to behind Lin Yi Xuan.

717
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,910
Be ready for another wave before entering.

718
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,190
Slowly.

719
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,470
Shen Yue, steady.

720
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,830
Xia Ling, come and do your kill.

721
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,870
Slain the four of them.

722
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,070
Start your show, Brother.

723
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,300
Starting up the lawn mower.

724
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,860
No,

725
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,540
you... Xia Ling...

726
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Where did Xia Ling come from?

727
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,380
How did he

728
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
appear behind Wei Teng?

729
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,780
Wei Teng is in danger.

730
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,700
Cool, double Kill. Nice one.

731
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,120
Triple kill, quadra kill.

732
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,840
Not yet,

733
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,840
Almost winning.

734
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,480
Wei Teng wiped out.

735
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,960
Xia Ling did well for this wave,

736
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,720
very ghostly.

737
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,240
Also, I think

738
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,440
that it's really unexpected.

739
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Phoenix push forward aggressively

740
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,040
destryoing second turret and after the base.

741
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,080
The wave is simply...

742
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,710
simply as if half a hand is already

743
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,590
touching the ticket to the global finals.

744
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,230
Don't...

745
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,710
Wait for a while.

746
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,950
Take a look at Wei Teng,

747
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,790
the fastest to resurrect has 8 more seconds.

748
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,710
Let's see if there's any chance

749
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,550
for another group fight.

750
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:40,790
Queen of Thorns

751
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,820
has 3 seconds more to resurrect.

752
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,900
Let us look at Xia Ling,

753
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,220
what is he doing?

754
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,500
He pulled an arrow,

755
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,460
firing out the arrow of fire

756
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,300
wanting to stun

757
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,060
the Qi Yue who just resurrect from the fountain?

758
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,420
This Xia Ling is trying to kill me beyond the fountain!

759
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,490
What is he doing?

760
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,170
He jumped out

761
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,250
of the fountain after

762
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,050
he slain Qi Yue.

763
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,450
This operation is brilliant!

764
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,730
Xia Ling single-handedly

765
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,650
blocked Wei Teng

766
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,730
of their resurrection.

767
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,370
Who still dare to say Xia Ling

768
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,530
is a crippled middle?

769
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,250
Xia Ling, all the best!

770
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,330
On this side, Pheonix

771
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,930
destroyed the their last base,

772
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,570
not giving Wei Teng

773
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,770
a chance to breathe.

774
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,360
Nice one!

775
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,640
Are you guys a bunch of trash?

776
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,310
What are you all even playing? Stupid.

777
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,230
Champion! Pheonix!

778
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,350
Congratulations Phoenix

779
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,230
for being the champion for

780
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,180
this Spring tournament.

781
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,740
Congratulations Phoenix!

782
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,140
for being the champion for this Spring

783
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,140
tournament.

784
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,860
Also, they gotten

785
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,540
themselves the ticket to the global

786
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
competition!

787
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I believe Phoenix has

788
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,580
suffered many doubts

789
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,820
along the way,

790
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,180
especially on their tactics

791
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,980
so I'd like to ask their captain,

792
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,820
Ji Xiang Kong,

793
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,610
what made you insist on using

794
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,610
Shadow tactic?

795
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,090
Because I always believe in

796
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,970
my teammates.

797
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,050
Believe in his teammates

798
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,910
is the biggest Lethality towards their opponents.

799
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,190
That's awesome!

800
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,990
Yes, so Brother Yi

801
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,510
I believe you suffered

802
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,270
a lot of stress and

803
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,710
doubts after your

804
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,750
re-emergence.

805
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,070
Actually, it's not easy for me

806
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,630
to return to the competition.

807
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,710
Brother Yi, I support you. All the best!

808
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,710
Thank you everyone.

809
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,710
I only enjoy

810
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,350
the process of the competition.

811
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,230
Thank you everyone!

812
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,630
I believe Phoenix

813
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,030
has a long way ahead of them,

814
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,470
enjoy the match that

815
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,590
belongs to you it to the fullest.

816
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,220
The MVP for this round goes to

817
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,700
Xia Ling!

818
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,180
Xia Ling!

819
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,980
He got himself the MVP

820
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
in just one round.

821
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,740
So Xia Ling,

822
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,660
do you have anything

823
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,840
you'd like to tell everyone?

824
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,520
I, actually...

825
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Xia Ling, you're the best!

826
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,840
I...

827
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,360
I wish to tell my Mum and Dad

828
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,560
and also my Sister that

829
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,120
I got the champion.

830
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,800
I've proved myself!

831
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,720
Xia Ling used his own actions

832
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,550
to tell us

833
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,070
fans who likes Iconquer that

834
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,390
life can let your body down

835
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,270
but

836
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,670
it can't let your will down.

837
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,870
Congratulations, Xia Ling!

838
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,340
Previous members of Kai Tuo Zhe,

839
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,220

840
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,060

843
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,730
Let us accompany Phoenix

845
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,210
hope that they will help China

846
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,810
take down the champion.

847
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,610
We go to the top together!

848
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,720
What's their slogan?

849
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,120
Our passion doesn't die, Nirvana reborn.

850
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,840
Our passion doesn't die, Nirvana reborn.

851
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,190
Our passion doesn't die, Nirvana reborn.

852
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,830
Cheers!

853
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
This is ice cold.

854
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,620
That...

855
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,540
I have something to say.

856
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,540
Since everyone is here

857
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,500
is so happy today,

858
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,820
as a reporter myself,

859
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,820
I have some questions

860
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,180
to interview you guys.

861
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,540
Cooperate please.

862
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
So I'll start now.

863
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,780
We start from...

864
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,490
Ji Xiang Kong.

865
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,970
Okay.

866
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,170
As the captain,

867
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,290
do you have anything to say

868
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,410
seeing where Pheonix

869
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,530
is at today?

870
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,370
Let me ask,

871
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,530
is this official

872
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,760
or non-official?

873
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,200
Be serious, you're being interviewed.

874
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,560
I want to say,

875
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,500
Phoenix went from nothing to something.

876
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,260
Till now,

877
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,140
I've been wanting

878
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,260
to thank my Brothers.

879
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,460
How official.

880
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Brother Xia Ling,

881
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,500
as the youngest

882
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,340
player among them,

883
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,540
what do you have to say?

884
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
I dream earlier

885
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,420
was to be

886
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,540
the hero on the basketball court.

887
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,340
But now, there's everyone.

888
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,570
There's Phoenix.

889
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,930
I'm still able to be a hero.

890
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,690
Nice.

891
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,490
You see

892
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,990
your Sister, Qiu Ying, is about to cry.

893
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,590
Don't cry.

894
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,350
Let's continue.

895
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,910
Pei Xi,

896
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,470
many said you've changed.

897
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,710
Unlike the past,

898
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,590
you only cared for yourself.

899
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,830
So comparing to the past,

900
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,390
which of yourself do you prefer?

901
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,630
Of course, it's the me now.

902
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,190
Then can you tell us

903
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,070
why?

904
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,350
Enough,

905
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,150
where did all the whys come form?

906
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,790
I'm all ready.

907
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,470
Come, ask me.

908
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,110
Don't be anxious, I'm still not done.

909
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,270
Oh, Pei Xi.

910
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,270
I've always been wanting to ask you,

911
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,300
why do you like

912
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,580
working as a waiter at Meng Lu Ren

913
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,460
and even cook coffee for us?

914
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,580
Right.

915
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,460
It's because

916
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,700
I like to be with everyone.

917
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I like the feeling

918
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,320
of being needed.

919
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,240
The me now

920
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,440
has something more important

921
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
than winning in competitions.

922
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,230
I have a group

923
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,230
of true

924
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,990
brothers

925
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,540
that I can compete with.

926
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,700
Thank you all.

927
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,100
Brother,

928
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,180
seeing you change so much,

929
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,380
and befriended

930
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,500
so many true friends,

931
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,290
I'm really happy for you.

932
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,210
Notify me when you need to

933
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,170
open up your shield.

934
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,050
You're a hero in my heart.

935
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,730
Don't worry,

936
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,610
with bad friends like us,

937
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,650
you'll never be lonely again.

938
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,370
I'll say something

939
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,650
since it's emotional.

940
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,280
Thank you, Brother Kong

941
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,560
for cultivating me into

942
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,480
a professional player

943
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,230
from a delivery boy

944
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,590
to be able to enter the global final.

945
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,070
Thank you to all of you here

946
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,860
for putting up with me, Lin Yi Xuan,

947
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,100
a body of faults.

948
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,260
Thank you Phoenix.

949
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,220
I only have confidence

950
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,980
to get to the top

951
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,100
because of Phoenix.

952
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,100
Phoenix isn't just a team,

953
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,940
it's also a home.

954
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,170
I'm thankful to everyone for allowing

955
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,090
the oldest player to participate

956
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,370
in the competition again.

957
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,810
I hope we're able to walk down this path,

958
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,680
step by step, towards the top.

959
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,040
Phoenix has fulfilled everything

960
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,120
you want to in the past.

961
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,060
Xiang Kong, congratulations

962
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,180
for finding

963
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,180
the perfect team for yourself.

964
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,660
Okay, don't be emotional anymore.

965
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,460
I'm so hungry.

966
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,700
Hurry, it's all in the drink.

967
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,820
Xiang Kong, say something.

968
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,300
Okay, I'll keep it short and simple,

969
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,860
see you guys in the global finals!

970
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,340
Bottoms up!

971
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,330
What are you thinking?

972
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,210
I'm thinking

973
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,990
how you'll look when you stand

974
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,230
on the global final stage,

975
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,870
must be really handsome.

976
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,710
I'm sorry.

977
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,270
Why are you sorry for?

978
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,790
I didn't help you

979
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,030
fulfil your dream.

980
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,790
Tong Wu and Lu Sheng

981
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,910
came to look for me yesterday

982
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,230
saying that Qi Yue and Qiao Xin

983
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,270
came up with the

984
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,590
idea of tactic leak.

985
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,780
I implicated you

986
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,060
causing you to not able to be a commentator.

987
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,820
How can I blame you?

988
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,180
If there's no Qiao Xin,

989
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,340
Qi Yue can't

990
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,080
accomplish the matter alone.

991
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,120
But if

992
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
this didn't happen,

993
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,200
you might've really

994
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,680
be able to stand on the global final stage

995
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,680
commenting on every match of Phoenix.

996
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,000
It's it good that I'm going as

997
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,800
the leader of Phoenix?

998
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,040
But your stage is being a commentator.

999
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
-It's your dream.          -It's okay.

1000
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,550
I'll be able to be a commentator again

1001
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,510
once the committee

1002
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,990
are done with their investigation.

1003
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,540
[Fu Mi Ya]

1004
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,410
It's okay, answer it.

1005
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,890
I'm not so petty.

1006
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,690
Ji Xiang Kong,

1007
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,730
it's me.

1008
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,010
Something happened to Mi Ya.

1009
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,530
What?

1010
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,130
She fell from the

1011
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,130
hanging wire during rehearsal.

1012
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,410
She's being sent to the hospital now.

1013
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,830
Nurse, hello.

1014
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,870
How do I get to room 1709?

1015
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,910
Thank you.

1016
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,020
How is Mi Ya now?

1017
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,700
Talk outside, go.

1018
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,090
How is she now?

1019
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,970
She just fell asleep

1020
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,130
but

1021
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,450
there's blood clot in her brain

1022
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,170
pressing against her nerve.

1023
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,730
we need the results

1024
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,840
from the doctor for more specific details.

1025
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,400
What actually happened?

1026
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,760
She value the concert a lot

1027
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,080
and did a lot preparations.

1028
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,420
Actually, there's no need for hanging wire

1029
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,740
for this rehearsal

1030
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,740
but

1031
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,660
she doesn't want any details to go wrong.

1032
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,020
In the end, never thought that

1033
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,700
the staff made amistake while operating.

1034
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,100
This happened too quickly.

1035
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,540
Mi Ya doesn't have any relatives

1036
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,580
so

1037
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,900
I could only contact you.

1038
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,540
I hope you'd understand.

1039
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,090
We'll go over to the doctor in a while

1040
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,290
to ask about her situation.

1041
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,310
The situation isn't ideal.

1042
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,590
Look,

1043
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,470
the patient's blood clot in her brain

1044
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,990
is pressing against her visual nerve.

1045
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,710
She might go blind.

1046
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,750
What? Blind?

1047
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,550
How did it happen?

1048
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,230
Is it temporary?

1049
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,430
If she's really to go blind,

1050
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,390
it's hard to say if she's able to recover.

1051
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,110
There's an old injury on her head.

1052
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,110
What I worry most now is

1053
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,630
the degree of damage for her nerve

1054
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,300
caused by both injury on the head.

1055
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,300
You have to be

1056
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,820
prepared that she might go blind forever.

1057
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,500
Xiang Kong,

1058
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,580
Mi Ya's injury is an accident.

1059
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,410
Don't be like this, okay?

1060
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,290
We can think of a solution together.

1061
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,410
She'll definitely get better.

1062
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,290
Really, it's not your fault.

1063
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,810
No, I'm to blame.

1064
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
If it's not for me back then,

1065
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,200
she wouldn't have gotten her old injury.

1066
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,350
So you be a substitute actress

1067
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,430
just so that you could gift me a computer?

1068
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,830
Sit.

1069
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,580
You want to be a professional player.

1070
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,060
Of course

1071
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,420
you need a professinal computer.

1072
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,140
With the computer,

1073
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,580
you can practice well.

1074
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,740
Next time, you'll definitely

1075
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,140
be a professional player.

1076
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,500
Go to the global finals

1077
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,940
and get the champion.

1078
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Thank you.

1079
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,730
Promise me then

1080
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,250
that you'll not do such

1081
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,610
dangerous act again.

1082
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:22,930
Okay?

1083
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,610
Yes.

1084
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,180
It's not early now,

1085
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,540
you and Xiang Kong

1086
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,820
should head back and rest.

1087
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,260
I'll go get him.

1088
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,900
Xiang Kong,

1089
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,060
you guys should head back and rest.

1090
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,980
I'll contact you

1091
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,170
when she's awake.

1092
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:11,850
It's fine,

1093
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,690
I wish to be with her.

1094
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,880
Master, you look for me?

1095
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,360
Qi Yue,

1096
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,120
this is the staffs from the committee.

1097
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,480
They are here to talk to you regarding

1098
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,800
the leakage of tactic.

1099
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,160
What's there to talk about?

1100
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Isn't it done by Qiu Ying?

1101
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,560
I still want to ask

1102
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,480
you people

1103
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:14,920
how did this

1104
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
kind of people get in the semi-finals?

1105
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,710
We're not investigating on

1106
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,390
Qiu Ying this time

1107
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,390
but you.

1108
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,770
If this matter

1109
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,850
is really related to him,

1110
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,210
I'll support you

1111
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,290
in however way you handle him.

1112
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,120
You worked hard.

1113
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:08,880
You worked hard.

1114
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,870
You worked hard.

1115
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:14,750
Teacher Ah Can,

1116
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,350
this is the analyze I did for

1117
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,950
the global competiton, take a look.

1118
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:18,950
Leave it.

1119
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,020
Okay.

1120
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,580
I'll help you organize.

1121
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,620
Tacher Ah Can,

1122
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,820
I heard

1123
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,500
Teacher Luo has yet to confirm the

1124
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,340
namelist for

1125
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,380
the global finals.

1126
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,420
You know how Luo Tian

1127
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,220
does his work,

1128
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,660
if there isn't any one suitable,

1129
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,140
he'd rather leave it empty than choosing randomly.

1130
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,530
We worked together for so long,

1131
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,170
can you help me ask him?

1132
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,330
I have something on, shalln't talk anymore.

1133
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,770
Teacher Ah Can.

1134
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,130
Teacher Ah Can, wait up.

1135
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,520
Did I do something wrong?

1136
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,640
Why are you giving

1137
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,720
me such an attitude?

1138
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,180
Teacher Luo.

1139
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,780
Qiao Xin, this is Lucy from

1140
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,700

1149
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,300

1150
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,580

1151
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,180
Teacher Luo,

1152
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,700

1158
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,510
I bought you a bouquet of lilies,

1159
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,790
does it smell good?

1160
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,060
Yes.

1161
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,640
What time is it now?

1162
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,360

1163
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,480
4:30pm...

1164
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,640
Only 4:30pm?

1165
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Why is the time passing so slowly.

1166
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,990
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

1167
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,950
Okay.

1168
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Xiang Kong,

1169
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,820
my eyes

1170
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,140
should be unable

1171
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,650
to see for real this time.

1172
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,090
I won't be able to

1173
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,610
beon stage again.

1174
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,050
Mi Ya,

1175
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:12,490
your eyes will recover.

1176
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,170
But i'm really scared.

1177
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,280
My surroundings are dark,

1178
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,520
it's a endless darkness.

1179
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,920
I'm really tired.

1180
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,710
I don't know what I should do.

1181
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,870
Take a nap,

1182
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,740

1183
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,060
I can't sleep.

1184
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,100
Be good, take a nap.
