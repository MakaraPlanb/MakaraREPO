00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:34,740
GANK YOUR HEAR

00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,325
Episode 23

3
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,325
Qiuying

4
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:49,575
Axuan

5
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,825
Pei Peixi

6
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,100
Qiuying

7
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,500
My brother wants me to tell you

8
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:55,600
Go back to see him when you have time

9
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,675
It suprises me that

10
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,725
Peixi has been cheated for so long

11
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,150
Qiaoxin is so excessive

12
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,925
Why

13
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,725
are you staring at me like this

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,425
No nothing nothing

15
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,175
I have to go first  byebye

16
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,000
Peixi has a game to play today

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,150
Don't look  go

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,575
Should I tell him

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,525
I tell you

20
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,275
That's my brother Kong's girl

21
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,075
Don't ever think about her

22
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,050
Forget it

23
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,375
It has nothing to do with me

24
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,575
But Peixi is my friend

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,250
Besides

26
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,450
He helped me a lot

27
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,775
No

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,950
I should be in charge of this matter

29
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:50,775
Peixi Peixi

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,325
What's up

31
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,475
I have something to tell you

32
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,550
Right

33
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,200
I also have something to tell you

34
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,475
So aggressive

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,875
Brother Kong  brother Kong

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,300
Your girl is going to be taken away

37
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,800
You speak first

38
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:27,575
Peixi

39
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,975
Actually I want to tell you

40
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,375
there's no wrong and right in love

41
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:35,575
Sometimes

42
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,075
When you find out you're in a wrong road

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,725
you have to turn around in time

44
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,700
When you fall in love with the wrong person

45
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,600
you have to take your love back

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,675
It's just

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,075
some things

48
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,950
no matter how much you like them

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,500
they won't belong to you

50
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,675
even if you miss

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,225
some people so much

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,350
you have to learn to give up

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,850
Are you sure

54
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,750
you want to be a professional commentator

55
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,821
not a host of the emotional show

56
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,075
Be straightforward

57
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,200
Well I say it then

58
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,500
It's that

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
your girlfriend

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,475
My girlfriend

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,153
It's your girlfriend

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Well

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,775
You get it

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,008
I don't have girlfriend

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,125
You don't have girlfriend

66
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,150
So have you broken up with Qiaoxin

67
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,225
I say it again

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,950
I don't have girlfriend

69
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,525
Are you and JiXiangkong

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,275
having a relationship

71
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,550
No

72
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:57,925
We are not

73
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:00,275
That's good

74
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,425
If something happens to you later

75
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:03,675
stop looking for him

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,725
You can come to me straight

77
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:09,725
What do you mean

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,350
Are you still ignoring it

79
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,750
Xiang  Xiangkong

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,825
You heard

81
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,300
what I said just now

82
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,550
I heard

83
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,150
what I should and should not hear

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,875
But listen to me

85
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,775
You'd better put your heart into the contest

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,600
You Legend team

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,875
is almost caught up by Weiteng

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,575
That's interesting

89
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:36,950
Right

90
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,625
Remind you

91
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,750
Be careful with Qiyue

92
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,250
He is easy to be over-confident

93
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,800
Thanks for reminding

94
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,600
You're welcome

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,225
Are my brother Kong handsome when he gets jealous

96
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,800
LinYixuan  look at yourself

97
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,175
What's going on to you recently

98
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,100
Do you still want to play the game

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,700
Gently

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,875
Can't keep up with Tongwu

101
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:04,925
and can't support Qiyue

102
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,800
JiXiangkong  are you really jealous

103
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,275
Son  Mom

104
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,150
Are you feeling better today

105
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,825
Why on earth she brought

106
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:22,500
lots of things

107
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,675
Does she show them to her father

108
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,750
Mom

109
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,625
Stop talking my sister in this way

110
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,425
These are all sent by her

111
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,350
with good will

112
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,325
Good will

113
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,775
If she has good will

114
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:32,600
she won't make your leg broken

115
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,600
After so many years

116
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,425
Has she been kind to me

117
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,500
Let alone calling me mother

118
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,650
She even doesn't call me auntie

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,800
Mom

120
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,475
These things have past

121
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:43,850
Don't always mention it

122
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
Don't talking my sister in this way

123
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,225
Also

124
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,350
I accidentally broke my leg

125
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,725
It has nothing to do with my sister

126
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:52,350
Mom

127
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,725
The school basketball league starts next month

128
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:56,975
When can I 

129
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:57,950
leave the hospital

130
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:00,700
Son

131
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,125
It's always about rest when you get injured

132
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,650
so have a good rest

133
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,800
I went to school to help you ask for leave

134
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,225
The coach said

135
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,150
you can go back when you recover

136
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,350
My classmates are about to get in the national team

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,450
while I'm here to rest

138
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,550
When is the end

139
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,700
Don't worry  have a rest

140
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,550
Xialing's relative

141
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,425
Doctor Zhang is calling you

142
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,050
Coming coming

143
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,575
Mom goes to check

144
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:43,250
Here 

145
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,125
Okay thank you

146
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,400
Compare these two pictures

147
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,750
This place is raised obviously

148
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:51,325
Laoqiu

149
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:55,400
Hello

150
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,525
The reason why I invite you today

151
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:57,700
is to talk about

152
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,500
the condition of Xialing

153
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,350
After observation, his damage in the brain

154
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:02,600
has no sequelea left

155
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,650
However

156
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,475
His leg is not just about

157
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:07,775
tibia fracture

158
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:08,950
Look

159
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:10,975
His nervus peroneus communis

160
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,000
has been damaged

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,450
Well

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,175
Can this be cured

163
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,475
Sure, it can be cured

164
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:21,650
But afterwards

165
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,550
The activities of his ankles

166
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,675
might be controlled

167
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,475
Doctor

168
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
The activities of his ankles are controlled

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,750
What does it mean

170
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,350
It might influence

171
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,050
his walking

172
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,475
or working

173
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:32,600
Well

174
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:33,650
Doctor

175
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,525
Will I be able to play basketball in the future

176
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,025
Doctor

177
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,300
I just want to know

178
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,125
Will I be ablt to

179
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,275
play basketball afterwards

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,975
I'm afraid not

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
The nervus is fragile

182
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,450
Even though it's repaired

183
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,925
it might cause drop foot

184
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,675
You're not allowed to have intense exercise

185
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:03,325
Thank you doctor

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
So funny  so funny

187
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,775
Qiuying

188
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Come here

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,650
Show you something funny

190
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,300
Qiuying

191
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,775
What are you doing

192
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,100
Qiuying

193
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,600
You scared me

194
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,575
You ignored me first

195
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:20,825
Call you a few times

196
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,800
Are you dazing  don't answer me

197
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm wearing the earphones

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,975
can't hear you

199
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,325
What are you looking at

200
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,775
Commentary

201
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,650
It's two o'clock  Why are you cooking

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,075
I go to close it

203
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:35,875
Stop stop stop

204
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,775
Don't touch  don't touch

205
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,550
Don't close  don't close  Yiyi

206
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,450
The pigeon soup can be nutritious

207
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,675
if it tastes delicious

208
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,450
Xialing is so blessed

209
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,625
If I have

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,475
such a good sister

211
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,200
that'd be good

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
Having a brother like Xialing

213
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,650
is also great

214
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,150
You're cooking

215
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,725
while watching the games' videos

216
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,975
So hard-working

217
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,750
That Luotian

218
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,200
even doesn't allow you to go to the analysis table

219
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:06,875
Why are you still so hard-working

220
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:10,400
Actually

221
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,675
That he doesn't allow me to the analysis table 

222
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,400
is great

223
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:13,925
The storage of my knowledge right now

224
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:14,625
is not enough

225
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,175
So I have to learn more

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,075
It's not a bad thing

227
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,150
Am I right

228
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,200
Yes

229
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,100
Xialing

230
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,475
Sister

231
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,275
I bring pigeon soup to you

232
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,925
Why do you have time and come today

233
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,925
There's no game today

234
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:57,575
What about you

235
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,025
How's your recovery

236
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,575
Not bad

237
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,500
I will go to the rehabilitation room later

238
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,200
I can be with you

239
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,025
No

240
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:08,750
Sister

241
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,175
You stayed up late again

242
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,700
Your dark pouches are so deep

243
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm fine

244
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,050
You should drink the soup before it gets cold

245
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,225
It won't taste good when it's cold

246
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:19,750
Sister

247
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:20,875
You're also busy

248
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,150
Afterwards

249
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,200
You don't have to visit me very often

250
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,525
Xialing

251
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:34,825
Are you worried about something

252
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:35,825
today

253
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,525
You're so weird

254
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,950
No

255
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,450
I'm just tired

256
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,925
You should leave

257
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:46,125
I want to have some sleep

258
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:49,025
I help you

259
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,275
Watch out  your legs

260
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,175
Have a good rest

261
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,925
I will come to see you some other day

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,325
Remember to have the soup

263
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:05,425
Captain

264
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:06,600
Are you not leaving

265
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,425
You're looking at

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,650
Jishuai's notebook

267
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:22,650
During the Autumn Season

268
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,450
the performance of the bimonthly group in Weiteng

269
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,375
is so strong

270
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm looking at his notebook

271
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,250
to see if I can

272
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,100
get inspired

273
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,175
Do you remember

274
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,450
when we fought against Weiteng last time

275
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,725
Coach Luo used JiXiangkong's way

276
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:36,675
to cope with Weiteng

277
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:37,450
At last

278
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,575
We were beaten 

279
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,675
by him

280
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,025
He knows too much about us

281
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,800
On the other hand

282
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
You know much about him as well

283
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,400
What do you mean

284
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,675
Do the same thing

285
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,900
that he does to us

286
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:02,975
The understandting towards him

287
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,600
is our best weapon

288
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,550
I won't come back today

289
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,650
You help me deal with it

290
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,700
Where's Qiyue

291
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,450
His mother came to see him from Taipei

292
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,975
He is with his mom

293
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,675
And let me ask you for leave 

294
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,950
Why doesn't he tell me in person

295
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,150
He might be too busy

296
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,075
to tell you

297
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,125
Four of us

298
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,075
do exercise in pairs first

299
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,825
Qiyue and Qiaoxin

300
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:12,350
I don't know  a few days later

301
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,000
Tell me where you are at any time

302
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:17,275
Your turn

303
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,025
Hurry up  we'll be witnessed

304
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,125
Hurry

305
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:24,725
Be good

306
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:25,550
Byeybye

307
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,025
Let's have a 

308
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,075
short meeting

309
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,125
The fight against Xintu

310
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,375
You guys

311
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,150
have to win

312
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,050
this game

313
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,475
If we win the game

314
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:58,650
we'll enter the playoff

315
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,600
in the first place

316
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:00,925
Therefore, we'll have

317
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,050
the priority of choose side

318
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,000
and take an advantage

319
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,125
in selection

320
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:06,150
More importantly

321
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,275
If we win the game

322
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,200
we'll break the record

323
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,025
that Legend team won ten games in series last year

324
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,750
Master

325
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,650
Sister Wen

326
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,700
Don't worry with me here

327
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,625
I will definitely break the record tonight

328
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,000
From now on

329
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,450
I will make the Legend

330
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,800
call us big brother

331
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,425
What's up Qiyue

332
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,650
Didn't you have enough sleep yeterday

333
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,025
No  my mom came to

334
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,500
see me from Taipei  and then

335
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,175
I picked her up and kept her company for a day

336
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,275
So I'm a bit tired

337
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,325
You haven't come home for a long time

338
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,025
If you have time

339
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,550
be with your family

340
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:47,550
Master

341
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,625
The game later

342
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,650
won't be affected

343
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,625
There's a break before the playoff

344
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,100
You can go back home then

345
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
to be with your family

346
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,350
Thank you sister Wen

347
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:00,725
Qiyue

348
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,200
You didn't show up to practice yesterday

349
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,300
We made some slight adjustments

350
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,075
on tactics

351
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,350
The key in Xintu  Chengchen

352
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:07,850
In there few games

353
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,800
he has a huge output

354
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:09,725
So

355
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:10,900
Chengchen  Chengchen

356
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,625
I have fought against him for many times

357
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,450
He doesn't have many skills

358
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,425
You don't have to tell me

359
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,725
I will beat him later

360
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,800
Okay

361
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,125
One more thing

362
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,525
You won't forget

363
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,200
what day it is today

364
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:27,875
Remember

365
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,200
It's sister Wen's birthday

366
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,050
Glad you remember that

367
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:35,475
It's too busy recently

368
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:36,800
After the game

369
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,175
we'll celebrate it

370
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Master's gift is prepared

371
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,800
Alright

372
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,475
Winning the game

373
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,975
is the best gift for me

374
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:48,800
Do you have faith

375
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes

376
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,075
What are you taking

377
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,000
I write down

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,950
the important points

379
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,075
that Weiteng fights against Xintu

380
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,200
What's the point

381
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,625
Tell us

382
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:12,050
Actually

383
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,125
Every team

384
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,434
has its own style

385
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,225
and fighting tactics

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
When to open the group

387
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,975
On what condition will they open the group

388
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,650
When to beat the dragon

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
If they can beat the dragon under bad circumstances

390
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,025
After I know

391
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,025
these points

392
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,425
It will help

393
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,550
my commentary afterwards

394
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:31,950
I remember

395
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,500
the habit of Xintu

396
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,850
is to grab the dragon from the beginning

397
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,500
gain early advantage

398
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:38,900
But Weiteng

399
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,525
They have severl tactics

400
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,250
which is easy for enemies

401
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,650
to expose shortcomings at first

402
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,725
God

403
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,325
Qiyue fought so fiercely

404
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,425
that they are completely messed up

405
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,525
Fortunately  JiXiangkong arrived in time

406
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,925
It depends on this group fight

407
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,125
Although it's too risky

408
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,750
it's worthwhile

409
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,675
Even though it's just to grab the dragon

410
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,800
for Xintu, a conservative team

411
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,600
it's a big hit

412
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,550
Let me have a look at your notebook

413
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,050
Sure

414
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,225
So full

415
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,400
You've taken every note of each game

416
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:29,375
Qiuying

417
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,050
I thought you were just

418
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,800
pretending to do it in front of us

419
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,550
I didn't realize

420
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,325
you are so hard-working

421
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,475
It looks like

422
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,550
you are more qualified than Qiaoxin

423
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:37,875
to go to the podium

424
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,200
Weiteng wins

425
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,075
Excellent

426
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,175
How to go  how to go

427
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,425
Open group in the mid  open group in the mid

428
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,700
Hold it  hold it

429
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,125
Skill skill

430
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,350
Now push

431
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,575
keep pushing him  pushing him

432
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:02,750
Okay  push now

433
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,300
Good job

434
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,825
Control line  line  line

435
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:07,250
Today

436
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,150
Weiteng sets a new record

437
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,900
in the regular season

438
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,525
with an eleventh win in series

439
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,375
which can be called a myth

440
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,375
Let's hava a look

441
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,200
Who is the MVP in this game

442
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:19,025
Qiyue

443
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,125
Win eleven games in series

444
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,725
the MVP in twenty rounds

445
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,050
He has surpassed Peixi

446
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,700
to become the 

447
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,775
best MVP in this season

448
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,150
with no doubt

449
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,750
Congratulations

450
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:30,375
Well

451
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:32,550
Good job Qiyue

452
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,725
That's my good apprentice

453
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,725
No big deal

454
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,075
It's no problem to win thirty games in series

455
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,600
Xiangkong

456
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:39,800
Hard work for you

457
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,100
No sister Wen

458
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,250
This is the result

459
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,000
that everyone fights for

460
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,075
Okay okay

461
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,000
I've arranged

462
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,925
the place to eat

463
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,375
You take sister Wen to there first

464
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,325
Aren't you coming

465
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:49,300
Sure

466
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,150
We go to prepare first

467
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,568
Go go go

468
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,725
Okay let's go first

469
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,175
Hurry hurry hurry

470
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Happy birthday

471
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:19,575
Brother Yi

472
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,200
Ligan

473
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,025
Why are you coming here

474
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:27,325
Congratulations

475
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:28,550
Right

476
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:30,425
It's Shuwen's birthday today

477
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:31,850
Do you still remember

478
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:34,975
Good day

479
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:35,975
So I hold a party

480
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,475
to celebrate

481
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,000
I want to

482
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,525
invite you to come

483
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,075
I'm too busy

484
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,275
to leave

485
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:47,925
Summer and Luotian also come

486
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,875
I know you might not

487
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,550
like to go to this crowded place

488
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,375
as usual

489
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,075
So

490
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,450
I invite you in person

491
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,425
I'm the only one here

492
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,225
I really can't leave

493
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,175
Brother Yi

494
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,975
Shuwen has always wanted to

495
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,475
find a chance

496
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:05,725
to reunite

497
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:06,675
our trail blazers

498
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,725
I want to fulfill

499
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:08,675
her dream

500
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,475
on her birthday

501
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:11,725
Right

502
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:12,550
She also said

503
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,475
that we can get

504
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,875
this result today

505
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,075
is because of you as well

506
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,650
Brother Yi  come with me

507
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,150
Have a good time

508
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,700
I really can't go

509
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,200
Brother Yi

510
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,700
After so many years

511
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,239
haven't you still got over it

512
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,350
Happy birthday

513
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,002
Happy birthday

514
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:01,325
I'm texting you two

515
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,425
Here

516
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,425
Here  have a seat

517
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,960
It's special for the birthday girl

518
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,225
The birthday girl is so young

519
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:11,200
I don't see you like this usually

520
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,764
Good talk

521
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:14,575
We don't have to introduce ourselves

522
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:16,200
Hi teachers

523
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,375
Hello hello hello

524
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,425
You did a good job today

525
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,800
Very brilliant

526
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,675
It's because of captain's good tactics

527
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,750
It has nothing to do with the captain

528
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,800
I think the coach is better

529
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,875
You have to cherish

530
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,975
these two teachers

531
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,075
won't praise others easilt

532
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
It's really great

533
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,950
Almost catch up with us at that time

534
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,325
More wines  hurry

535
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:39,975
Okay

536
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,425
Xiangkong  help me

537
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:42,950
Where's Ligan

538
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,975
He called us to come here

539
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:44,800
Where is he

540
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,425
He might be preparing gifts for sister Wen

541
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,825
Don't give me too much

542
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:49,600
I know your capacity for liquor

543
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,368
Come I'll give you more wine next time

544
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,800
Come

545
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,875
Brother Sun

546
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,050
Happy birthday

547
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,125
Thank you

548
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,950
Okay don't stay still

549
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,850
Sit down  sit down

550
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,150
Come here  come here

551
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,000
Long time no see  brother Yi

552
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,050
It's so hard to invite you

553
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,675
Hurry

554
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,025
Have a seat  sit down

555
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,325
Great

556
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:21,500
Ligan

557
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,425
Have a seat too

558
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,725
I'm going to prepare

559
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,775
How's your store

560
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,000
Is the business good

561
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,700
Same as usual

562
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,825
Gufang is not here today

563
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:40,725
If he comes

564
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:41,650
five of us will

565
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:42,975
be reunited

566
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,050
Okay

567
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,700
Drink drink drink

568
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:45,675
Here Xiangkong

569
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,650
Cheer

570
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,233
Like you

571
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,275
Like you

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,375
Happy birthday to you

573
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,775
Happy birthday to you

574
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:14,575
Happy birthday to you

575
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:19,100
Happy birthday to you

576
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,875
I wish

577
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,975
everyone here

578
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,300
can achieve your dream

579
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,225
Happy birthday

580
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:49,925
Say yes  say yes

581
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,871
say yes  say yes

582
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,475

583
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Shuwen

584
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,025
Say yes to me

585
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:15,900
Ligan

586
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,175
You give such an expensive gift to me

587
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,275
I really can't accept it

588
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,175
Now we should

589
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,675
focus all our energy

590
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,225
on games next

591
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,775
Don't we have a deal

592
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,375
We have to win the world championship together

593
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:44,275
Today

594
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:46,075
I really like

595
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,350
what you've done for me

596
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:48,775
Thank you

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,650
Sister Wen

598
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:52,125
It won't have a conflict

599
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:00,075
Okay

600
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,275
After we win the world championship

601
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,150
I will put this ring

602
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,200
on your hand in person

603
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,750
Come  drink

604
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,450
Come come come

605
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,725
Hurry hurry hurry

606
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:16,875
Come drink

607
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:19,400
Here  brother Yi

608
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,500
You see you

609
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:43,775
Why are you being so unmerciful

610
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,650
Don't you know

611
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,900
what Shuwen looks like

612
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,425
I'm curious

613
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,850
I'm curious that

614
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:56,575
what I am

615
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,675
in her heart

616
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:01,850
If you want to prove

617
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,350
what you are in her heart

618
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,975
There are so many ways

619
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,400
Why did you invite

620
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,550
her ex-boyfriend

621
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,325
She can't forget brother Yi

622
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,075
Okay okay

623
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,400
The reason why Shuwen refused you

624
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:19,450
not all beacause of brother Yi

625
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,925
They have broken up for many years

626
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:25,675
If JiXiangkong didn't go to Weiteng

627
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,675
they wouldn't have a chance to meet

628
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,175
You think too much  bro

629
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,250
After so many years

630
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,750
You all know

631
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,450
what I've done to Shuwen

632
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,550
Clear

633
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,900
We are all clear

634
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,600
Shuwen knows it as well

635
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:45,425
Does she know

636
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,525
No no no

637
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,850
She doesn't understand

638
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,275
Enough enough

639
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,375
A few years ago

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I turned down the invitation

641
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:04,775
from American team

642
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:05,725
for her

643
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,650
I stayed here

644
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,050
Without

645
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,325
any foundation

646
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,650
I established Weiteng with her

647
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,300
In Weiteng

648
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,325
She has the choice

649
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,425
To tell you the truth

650
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,425
I'm not afriad of being laughed at

651
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,375
I, Ligan

652
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,625
the boss of Weiteng

653
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:23,975
In our team

654
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,825
I have no position

655
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,825
No

656
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:31,112
Shuwen wanted JiXiangkong

657
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,275
to be the captain

658
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:34,975
Do you know

659
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,225
the sponser

660
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:37,900
gave me  no

661
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,875
gave us

662
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,375
how much pressure

663
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,075
Who takes it

664
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,925
I take it

665
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:55,275
How I treat Shuwen

666
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,500
How much have I paied

667
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,525
How much have I paied for Weiteng

668
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,250
All of these can't be compared with brother Yi

669
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,800
Here here here

670
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,750
I drink with you

671
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,225
Brother Sun

672
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,200
It suprised me that

673
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:27,950
sister Wen would refuse him

674
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,275
Brother Sun

675
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:35,100
Actually

676
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,525
I don't believe

677
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,525
you were the lamster at that time

678
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,900
Why you left the Pioneers

679
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:43,425
Why you left sister Wen

680
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,000
I think

681
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,100
you must have

682
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,175
something difficult to talk

683
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,300
It's all past

684
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:54,575
Don't mention it

685
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:05,450
But I think

686
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,975
sister Wen is still thinking about you

687
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,775
Impossible

688
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,575
Why impossible

689
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,500
Anyway I think

690
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:15,925
sister Wen doesn't like Ligan

691
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:17,350
Besides

692
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,675
Don't you want to be together with her again

693
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,575
Remember I told you

694
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,200
Time

695
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,300
can change everything

696
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:29,650
I and Shuwen

697
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,600
are not who we were

698
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:35,650
Don't talk about me

699
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,425
How's you and Mia

700
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,450
You just mentioned

701
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,675
Time changes everything

702
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,175
Mia has been left for many years

703
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,275
You always think about her

704
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,825
Now she's back in China

705
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,825
While you...

706
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,350
Do you really fall in love

707
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,150
with the girl called Qiuying

708
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,050
It looks like you admit it

709
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,250
Then go to chase after her

710
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,370
Don't escape

711
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,750
Don't let Summer's

712
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,550
cousion take her away

713
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,125
No

714
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,475
How do you know this

715
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,500
Is Summer

716
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,325
talking something to you

717
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,150
Is Peixi really serious

718
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,150
Yixuan talked to me a little

719
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,850
I have no idea

720
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,700
whether Peixi is serious

721
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,850
However

722
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,200
it's obvious that you're serious

723
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,700
LinYixuan

724
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:45,925
What's up

725
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,950
have been playing the regular game for three monthes

726
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,475
now we have ten days' off

727
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:50,475
But in the end

728
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:52,250
we have more exercise

729
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,600
I've promised my friend

730
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,275
but I came here in the morning

731
00:33:59,025 --> 00:33:59,750
Where are they

732
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,150
It's just you and me today

733
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,825
Just us

734
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,775
Why

735
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,275
Are they on purpose

736
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:11,075
I'll leave

737
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,525
It's me and sister Wen

738
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,575
that have you exercise more

739
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,550
Not Lusheng and Tongwu

740
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,525
For brother Qi

741
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,550
he can also leave

742
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,650
He has the most mistakes

743
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,500
MVP every round

744
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,650
Where is the mistake

745
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,300
In the last round

746
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,450
when grabing the dragon at the eighth minutes

747
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,700
if Shenyue didn't protect you in time

748
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,050
you would have been killed

749
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,225
At twelfth minutes

750
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,200
why didn't you follow my instruction

751
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,050
and take action alone

752
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,875
When opening group at fifteenth minutes

753
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,425
if you got there in time

754
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:41,300
we could

755
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,250
finish the game at that time

756
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,675
Just a few mistakes

757
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:46,775
Besides

758
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,525
yesterday

759
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,750
brother Qi's mother

760
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,925
came to see him from Taipei

761
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:52,100
even if he had a few mistakes

762
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,400
we can forgive him

763
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,400
Did you be with your mom or dating

764
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,275
You know it

765
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,600
What  what date

766
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,200
JiXiangkong

767
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,375
I warn you

768
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,775
Don't ask for trouble

769
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,125
You will regret it

770
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:09,950
If you really want to charge me

771
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,600
Go

772
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,500
I don't care

773
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,550
The bimonthly group

774
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,750
is our key tactics

775
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,225
The status of you and Shenyue

776
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:21,375
is very important

777
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,125
Qiyue

778
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:23,650
You play games in the mainland

779
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,750
which is far away from  your home

780
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,400
I believe your persistence towards your dream

781
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,625
Now it's your highlight

782
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,500
in your career

783
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:30,875
Whether you can be more successful

784
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:31,925
depends on these two years

785
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:35,425
You think about it

786
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,925
Xialing

787
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,225
You leave the hospital

788
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:54,450
What are you doing  Mom

789
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,475
Mom get in the car

790
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,925
I have something to talk to my sister

791
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,450
You have nothing to talk to her

792
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,675
Dad  go go go

793
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:02,325
You just let them

794
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,900
What are you doing

795
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,675
There's nothing to talk

796
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:05,850
Okay  get in get in

797
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:07,300

Xialing

799
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:09,850
Why don't you tell me

800
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,350
that you leave the hospital

801
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,525
There is rehabilitation training afterwards

802
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:15,500
I come with you

803
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,625
No

804
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,150
Sister

805
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,175
You see

806
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,775
My mom has a bad attitutie to you

807
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,444
If we keep in touch

808
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,200
there will be so much contradictory

809
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,750
In the future

810
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:28,825
we should meet less

811
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,425
Xialing

812
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,725
Is it your idea

813
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:33,425
It's my idea

814
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,075
I don't want to live

815
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:37,875
in the middle of you and my mom

816
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:39,675
Besides

817
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,250
You're busy with your work

818
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:42,800
There's no need to think about me

819
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,950
That's it  I go now

820
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,300
Yingzi

821
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,525
Don't be sad

822
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,400
You can go back

823
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,925
We are with your brother

824
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,000
Go

825
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:20,325

Sorry

827
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,750
I don't want to escape from you

828
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,575
I'm just worried that

829
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:27,175
you will know what happened to my foot

830
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:28,725
and you will be sad

831
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,150
Thanks to

832
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,400
the thoughtful instructions from Mr. Acan

833
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,675
which make me today

834
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,900

835
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,475

836
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,775

892
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,300

00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,725
Well if you don't come

895
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,700
Brother Xuan

896
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,875
Why are you leaving

897
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:04,850
I've booked the room  yeah

898
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,575
So soon

899
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,125
Before we sing

900
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:07,975
shall we go to have dinner first

901
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:08,700
Go go

902
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:09,225
Well

903
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:10,675
Let's change to another day

904
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,500
No

905
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,550
It has to be today

906
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,400
Today

907
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,375
Go go go

908
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,325
The room is booked

909
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,325
I'm here for LuYiyi

910
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,675
Go

911
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,625
Go hurry

912
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,100
You

913
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,428
like milk tea so much

914
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:37,875
Don't you say you will come home

915
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,249
Why are you here

916
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,075
Do you want to come cross me

917
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,075
I

918
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,150
I

919
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,625
walked half the way

920
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,000
ang then

921
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,225
It suddenly occurred to me that after leaving Dream Traveler

922
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:49,875
for so long

923
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,150
I haven't been able to see them

924
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,000
Miss them a lot

925
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,825
So just drop by

926
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:56,400
and buy some drinks for them

927
00:40:58,725 --> 00:40:59,500
Our Qiuying

928
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,425
is such an emotional girl

929
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:04,725
Right

930
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:05,950
at this time

931
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:07,475
Peixi should be in Dream Traveler

932
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,125
Don't you want to meet him

933
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,350
Right

934
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:12,525
What happened to you

935
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:17,025
What

936
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,325
Don't you really think

937
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,125
he committed love to me last time

938
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,450
It's obvious

939
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,475
No

940
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:26,775
Well

941
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,900
I just think

942
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,150
It might because

943
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:31,100
he experienced sadness from love

944
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,300
and had a bad mood

945
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,450
Hurt from love

946
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,200
Do you know Qiaoxin and

947
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:42,500
Leave it

948
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:44,225
Anyway he didn't commit love to me

949
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,500
Are you saying

950
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:49,750
after Peixi knew the relationship

951
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,200
between Qiaoxin and Qiyue

952
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,800
So

953
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:55,550
You also know their

954
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,750
underground love

955
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,050
I also know that during that pair game

956
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,525
the person who tried to kill you

957
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:03,500
is not Peixi

958
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,625
is Qiyue

959
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,050
Qiyue

960
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,700
Qiyue stole Peixi's account

961
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,600
and the realationship between Peixi and Qiaoxin

962
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:12,750
is exactly

963
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,325
designed by Qiaoxin

964
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:15,525
So Peixi

965
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:16,925
hasn't been hurt by love

966
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:18,550
He was really committing love to you

967
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:20,525
Rubbish

968
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,425
I told you

969
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:23,100
No committing  no committing

970
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,350
He

971
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:23,950
He

972
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,550
It's can't be viewed as committing love

973
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,750
Nothing happened

974
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,175
Why are you getting anxious

975
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:29,775
Are you guilty

976
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:32,125
What am i guilty for

977
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,725
Even if he said love to me

978
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,100
I wouldn't like

979
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,725
his cold face

980
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,525
A big fool

981
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:46,900
Right

982
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,025
Is the attitude Mr. Luo towards you

983
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,175
getting better

984
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:54,600
Same as usual

985
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,125
But it's okay

986
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,750
I'm new in this industry

987
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,125
There are so many things

988
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,200
I need to learn

989
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:01,700
I wish

990
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,053
I can go up step by step

991
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,188
Would you mind

992
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:07,338
showing me

993
00:43:07,338 --> 00:43:08,013
your commentary video

994
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:08,696
Sure

995
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,475
I have a lot that don't understand

996
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,675
Otherwise

997
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,300
We go to Dream Traveler

998
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,475
Dream Travel again

999
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:16,325
Why you like it

1000
00:43:16,325 --> 00:43:16,872
so much

1001
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:17,825
Or because

1002
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:19,075
someone is there

1003
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:22,650
You tell me

1004
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,700
You take me there

1005
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:40,775
Say it

1006
00:43:41,425 --> 00:43:42,700
Why calling us

1007
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,875
I want to have

1008
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:45,400
a meeting about tactics today

1009
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,450
The theme is

1010
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,250
JiXiangkong

1011
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:51,425
Brother Kong

1012
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,675
I'm enlighented

1013
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:56,995
For the first time, the theme of a meeting about tactics

1014
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,450
is a person

1015
00:43:59,175 --> 00:43:59,650
Yes

1016
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,400
What do you mean

1017
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,500
I don't understand

1018
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:03,050
Well

1019
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,000
Let's listen

1020
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,050
to the captain

1021
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,975
According to the status of Weiteng

1022
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,500
it's likely that we will fight against them

1023
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,625
in the playoff

1024
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:12,050
Before

1025
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,125
JiXiangkong relied on

1026
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:13,825
his understanding towards us

1027
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:14,950
and won

1028
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,050
At this time

1029
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,500
Why don't we

1030
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,475
win him

1031
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,900
according to our understanding towards him

1032
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:23,925
It sounds

1033
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,000
right

1034
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:26,847
Make sense

1035
00:44:28,475 --> 00:44:29,400
Accept it

1036
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,275
isn't it

1037
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,275
I'll go first

1038
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,150
My brother Kong

1039
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:36,836
Name  JiXiangkong

1040
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,628
Constellation  Lion

1041
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,700
Loves strawberry best

1042
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:40,700
The best brother

1043
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:41,675
is me

1044
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,150
It's a tactics meeting

1045
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,200
or a tea party

1046
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,825
Yes

1047
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:49,050
You ate things that he bought

1048
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,000
Can you be serious

1049
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:51,925
Captain

1050
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:58,800
Excuse me

1051
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,350
Well

1052
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,125
Seriously

1053
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,000
According to my understanding of him

1054
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,775
If he gain a huge advantage

1055
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:06,275
at the first stage

1056
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:07,950
then in the late period

1057
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,675
he must expand his advantage

1058
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,175
You turn brother Yao

1059
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,025
The biggest merit of JiXiangkong

1060
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,475
is his imagination

1061
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,550
Don't think that

1062
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,375
we have an advantage in the early stage

1063
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:25,350
and take it lightly

1064
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:27,150
It might be his trap

1065
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,150
Have to keep focused

1066
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,625
JiXiangkong

1067
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,675
This person

1068
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,325
he is especially

1069
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:40,700
strong

1070
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,775
Stop joking

1071
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,400
An important point occurred to me

1072
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,150
and you haven't thought about it

1073
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,175
He likes motorcycles best

1074
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,600
Do you find out

1075
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,375
that Peixi is not as cold as before

1076
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,800
Lufeng

1077
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,700
Tell me more

1078
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,625
Why asking me again
