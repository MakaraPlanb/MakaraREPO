00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,475
I got off the subway after two stops

51
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,600

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,825
I'm trying to catch a taxi now

53
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:31,550

You're making me nervous

74
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,600

76
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,937

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,950

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,067
The traffic is so bad

82
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,080
You are crazy

83
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,850
Our boss said 

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,800
If my lifestyle program

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,750
couldn't switch to

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,625
game show

87
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,625
I would be fired

88
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:16,975
I was so lucky to

89
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,000
get this chance

90
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:19,250
I must go to Vancouver

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,150
I can't quit from here

92
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,275
But you don't know anything

93
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:21,875
about professional gaming 

94
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,400

00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:25,750
Don't you take that from me

97
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:26,900
If you buy this ticket

98
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,275
You can't even pay you mortgage

99
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,925
If my boss knows that I didn't catch that plane

100
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,275
He is definitely gonna fire me

101
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:31,975
Then

102
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,100
I will never catch up on the mortgage

103
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,350

00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:36,475

00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:36,475

Tatan debut at this year's championship

But they defeat so many

128
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,725
strong teams

129
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,125

Legends

134
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,725
Welcome to the stage to Legends

135
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,975

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,650
they enter into the final round

137
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,250

around the world

145
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,750
He was one of tke key members

00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,325
that won the first championship 

147
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,050

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,675

of Legends

155
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,400
Do you have anything to say to our audiences

156
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,925
Tatan did show great performances this year

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,625
I'd admit

158
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,650
They have great potential

159
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,400
But we have been through battles like this

160
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:22,900
And we will make all the unexpectations

161
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,475

Jeffery Triplekill

All members of Legends have been killed now

177
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,725
And yet no one is resurrected

178
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,689
However Tatan

179
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,700
has taken over the high land

180
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:31,775
and started to attack the crystal

181
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,625
Legends are not in a good situation

182
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,200

197
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,000
Even the back of his head

198
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,150
is so formidable

199
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,600
Point your camera at the stage

200
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,525
and at the team members

201
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,750
The captain Gu Fang

202
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,700
is the first one

203
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,700
to leave the game room

204
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,650
What happened there

205
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,525
Qiu Ying You are screwed

206
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,450
You missed the first round of game

207
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,400
Our boss said

208
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,325
You don't have to do anything 

209
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,125
for the rest of the game now

210
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:48,875
What should you do

211
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,575
I don't want that myself

212
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,375
Who knows

213
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,525
I would get stuck in traffic

214
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,075
You have no idea how long I ran

215
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,200
to get to the arena

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
But I still missed it

217
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:56,700
I suggest you should

218
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,275
do anything you can

219
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,275
to make up for

220
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,450
the mistake now

221
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,375
I remembered our boss

222
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,475
always wanted an interview with Gu Fang

223
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,800
and get an exclusive news report

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,275
It's halftime now

225
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,350
They're taking a break

226
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,050
I think I should try to interview him

227
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,850
Gu Fang is so low-key

228
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:10,950
He has never accepted 

229
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,150
any interviews before

230
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,200
I will just pretend I'm a fan

231
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,700
So I can have some first-hand information

232
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,125
How will you get in there

233
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,925
You can't go into 

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,075
their lounge

235
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,750
even if you're a fan

236
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,200
Yiyi

237
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,375
I'm going to hang up now

238
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,375
I know how to do it

239
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,150
Fighting for championship for four years

240
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,650
Gu Fang

241
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,425
Are you confident about 

242
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,125
winning this year

243
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:58,925
Yes of course

244
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Rumor has it

245
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,050
You are not as good as you used to be prefessionally

246
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,700
And you are going to retire from your position

247
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Is that true

248
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,400
We are in a rush

249
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,900
We have a competition coming

250
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,725
Thanks for coming

251
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,500
Excuse me Thank you

252
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,650
Excuse me

253
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,350
Please

254
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,875
Captain 

255
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,850
I'm alright

256
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,525
Does you thumb hurt again because of tenosynovitis  

257
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,600
Captain I've always been looking up to you

258
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,275
When I was at the lowest of my life

259
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,425
You offered me an opportunity

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,850
I still remember

261
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,150
You always says

262
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,200
Kid Don't try be a hero all the time

263
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,100
I've got you

264
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,700
Don't put too much pressure on yourself

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,550
Don't make me emotional

266
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,575
I'm your captain

267
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,350
and also your older brother

268
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,100
Don't worry about anything when I'm here

269
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,525
Let's get back to the lounge

270
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,250
Our brothers are waiting for us

271
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,350
Oh crap

272
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,325
Will I be caught

273
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,675
Wait

274
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:19,475
Oh mo god

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,425
I'm so screwed

276
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,275
Is it too late for me to apologize

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,925
Sorry sorry

278
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,050
What

279
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,800
Take care of your dress

280
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,375
How is Gu Fang doing right now

281
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,125
His hands are trembling badly

282
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm afraid we're gonna lose the game

283
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,475
So you mean

284
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:05,500
we should change our tactics

285
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,450
I think we should switch the positions between Captain and Yao

286
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:09,550
Jeffery is sticking to

287
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,225
the captain

288
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,600
and wouldn't let him do anything

289
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,500
So I suggest making Yao do the Mid

290
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,400
That's the only possibility of winning the game

291
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,350
Ji Xiangkong

292
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,200
What a crappy idea you're having here

293
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,975
Gu Fang is our world-class idol

294
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,275
The best Mid player

295
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,325
You are making him to play Jungle

296
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,825
What are you thinking

297
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,050
Manager Zhao

298
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,225
Gu Fang is not in a good state now

299
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,050
I can assure you that

300
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you know how many fans are expecting to see 

301
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Jeffery and Gu Fang confront each other

302
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,643
If Gu Fang changes his position

303
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,150
What will the fans think

304
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,600
They'll think Gu Fang is a coward

305
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,275
Legends are a bunch of cowards

306
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,800
It will affect the reputation of the whole team

307
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,300
and our company

308
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,150
Do you have any idea

309
00:15:59,175 --> 00:15:59,775
Zhao Yang

310
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,225
If you really want what's best for

311
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:01,975
the team

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,975
You should support my decision

313
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:03,400
Ji Xiangkong

314
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:04,703
Watch you attitude

315
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,450
This is world championship

316
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,325
It's not only about ranking

317
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:10,875
What a child 

318
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,100
you're being here

319
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,825
Ji Xiangkong You have to understand

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,725
Gu Fang 

321
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,275
is not just a mere game player

322
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,450
Our whole team and even our entire company

323
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,100
are counting on him

324
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,175
Do you know that

325
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,000
You are in command now

326
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,200
But your job 

327
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,750
is not changing tactics

328
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,600
but doing what's been planned out

329
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,975
and taking that championship

330
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,125
Okay

331
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,325
I only want to change the tactics

332
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,750
for the sake of winning the championship

333
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,500
Xiangkong What you're saying here

334
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:35,625
does make sense

335
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,850
But have you considered the consequences

336
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,925
What if we still lose the game

337
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,950
What will other people think of you

338
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,975
I don't care about how will they question me

339
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,511
if it's the best

340
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,675
for my captain and my team

341
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,825
Whatever you say You won't have my consent

342
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
Forget about it Xiangkong

343
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,175
Ladies and gentlemen

344
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,575
Get ready to

345
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,100
make some noise

346
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,475
Because the second round

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,575
is about to begin

348
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,825
Hello everyone

349
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,175
This is Qiu Ying again

350
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:15,925
Unluckily 

351
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,500
Legends lost the first round

352
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,625
Let's see if they can 

353
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,950
win the next around

354
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,750
As we can see

355
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,125
In the last round

356
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,225
Legends made a great many of mistakes

357
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,550
None of the five members could

358
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,300
fight against Jeffery

359
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,375
Yes

360
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,975
So at the very beginning of this round

361
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,225
Legends took the Bunny hero

362
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,300
which is most favored by Jeffery

363
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,075
On the other hand Legends have a lot of heroes 

364
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,475
at their disposal

365
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,700
Especially Ji Xiangkong

366
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:35,850
who is good at 

367
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,650
deluding the enemies

368
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
He can play all of the 

369
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,650
one hundred and one heroes 

370
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,150
in IConquer

371
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,700
But in the last round

372
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,950
Ji Xiangkong was caught for seven times

373
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Some have said

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,750
If they do not

375
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
replace Ji Xiangkong 

376
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:48,700
Yao

377
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:49,675
I choose you Batulu

378
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,050
Yeah no problem

379
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,475
Gu Fang was a member of

380
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:54,743
the Chinese national team

381
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,300
to win the very first championship

382
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,550
He has skills that are sensatinal

383
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,650
Capatin What do you want 

384
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,975
So what you are thinking is 

385
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:05,075
changing the tactics

386
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,825
I think we should switch the positions between Captain and Yao

387
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,150
Gu Fang is our world-class idol

388
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:10,825
The best Mid player

389
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,050
You are making him to play Jungle

390
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,675
Captain Hey

391
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,400
I'll take

392
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
I'll choose you the Creator

393
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:25,775
Ok

394
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,925
I can't beliebe Gu Fang chooses the Creator

395
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:28,725
The Creator is probably 

396
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,250
the most difficult Mid hero 

397
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,700
to play with in IConquer

398
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:32,875
The Creator

399
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,375
What are we gonna do

400
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,375
Ok Listen this I'm gonna be the Worm Queen

401
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,200
Miki

402
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,825
You are gonna get the Dictator Okay

403
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:40,450
Ok

404
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,400
Then we can counter act his attacks

405
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:43,475
Alright everyone ready

406
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:44,175
Ready

407
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,125
Let's do it

408
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,825
What would you say about 

409
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,000
Gu Fang right now

410
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,725
Gu Fang is a senior player

411
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,350
He knows exactly 

412
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,250
what he is going to face

413
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,125
Ok The heroes are set and ready

414
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:56,525
The second round

415
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,250
is about to begin

416
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,650
Steady Don't get caught

417
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:04,750
Got it

418
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,900
No problem

419
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,250
I'll be the eye

420
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,475
Lu Geng Be careful when you are calling the backup

421
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,350
Don't panick

422
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,075
Downroad Miss

423
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:12,575
Downroad Miss 

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,675
Take a look everyone

425
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,175
Ji Xiangkong is over there

426
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,439
He is the head of Legends

427
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,675
He is in command of the team

428
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,400
He is said to be never playing by the rules

429
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,825
His tactics are plentiful

430
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,100
He is especially good at

431
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,700
deluding the enemies

432
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,100
Oh right

433
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,125
He is definetely

434
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,200
the most good-looking guy in the team

435
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,800
He has a large population of fans

436
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:34,900
Girls only care about their appearaces

437
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,650
And that's why you like players like them

438
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,675
He is actually useless

439
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,400
Why does he look so familiar

440
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,375
Let's take a look at Ji Xiangkong over here

441
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,375
He has made it out of the first tower

442
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,075
and start attacking the warriors

443
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,675
Solo Top

444
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:52,475
Has he insane

445
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,775
Blue come with me

446
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,725
Let's gank him on top

447
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:55,775
What is he doing there

448
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,000
Will he be the first blood

449
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,525
Amazing Xiangkong

450
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:00,650
They took the hook

451
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,300
Xiangkong

452
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,707
They followed you there

453
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:07,375
Hit your face Ji Xiangkong

454
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,975
Look

455
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,250
He gave away the first blood

456
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,425
He is such a burden

457
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,375
Ji Xiangkong has given away

458
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
the first blood already

459
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:15,975
Captain come to the mid

460
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:16,800
Sure Coming

461
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:17,447
Yao and Yixuan 

462
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,072
Go anti-squat at the mid

463
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:18,725
Coming

464
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:19,550
Follow up

465
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,650
Come here 

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,378
So now we see Jeffery and Gu Fang

467
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,658
are confronting each other at the mid

468
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:24,558
The Dictator got to the back

469
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,733
Here comes to the first attack

470
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,525
which froze Gu Fang

471
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,725
Then Jeffery made another move

472
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,575
Three two one Go

473
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:35,550
Hit him

474
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,375
We didn't see that coming 

475
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,350
Yixuan and Yao got something to hold

476
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,125
He is coming

477
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,425
Lin Yixuan is holding

478
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,175
Jeffery back

479
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,125
Huo Yao has made 

480
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,225
another amazing attack

481
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,150
Nice Great

482
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,825
The final kill

483
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,425
Gu Fang calls his attack

484
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,125
and Li Yixuan makes his attack together with Gu Fang

485
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,400
Doublekill Brilliant

486
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,275
Damn it

487
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,950
Let's see

488
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:53,875
Mars over there

489
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,100
is going back again

490
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,025
Triplekill

491
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,625
It's like he 

492
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,600
wanted to be killed

493
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,700
Why is he there

494
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,896
Gu Fang just finished Triplekill

495
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:06,900
The audiences are lit now

496
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,775
I'm so sorry

497
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,625
Legends Legends

498
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
It is spectacular

499
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,150
This round has just begun

500
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:15,850
But Gu Fang has already made a Triplekill

501
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
The teamwork is awesome

502
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,625
No wonder Legends is

503
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,700
one of the best

504
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,900
They had it all planned out

505
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,275
and waiting for Tatan to fall for the trap

506
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,000
Captain That was so cool

507
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,050
It will definitely go down to the history

508
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:24,700
That is because

509
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,500
You all did so well

510
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,400
Three of them are down It's worthy of the first blood

511
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,100
Xiangkong You are the king of first blood

512
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,050
No

513
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,550
It's called tactics

514
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,900
But Jeffery is not so easy

515
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,625
to handle with

516
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,525
We should still be very careful

517
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:36,175
And remember to protect our captain

518
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,825
Don't worry about it

519
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,500
They are coming

520
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,300
It doesn't matter

521
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,050
We are responding

522
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,538
Come on Keep going

523
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:41,550
Keep going

524
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:42,550
We can see now 

525
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,375
that Legends are taking advantage of 

526
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,825
their resurrection period

527
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,250
and moving on

528
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,575
Legends has already been in the lead economically

529
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,475
for one thousand and five hundred points

530
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,525
It's a great lead

531
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,400
If Tatn couldn't do anything 

532
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,000
to respond quickly

533
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,300
Hi there

534
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,900
Why are they saying it's an advantage to 

535
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,325
be in the lead economically

536
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,825
If they have more money

537
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,675
They can buy better gear

538
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,525
So there is gear

539
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,225
You don't know anything

540
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,725
Why are you here

541
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,675
Gu Fang just did an incredible

542
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,525
back attack

543
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,750
It's just too much

544
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,075
If not for Ji Xiangkong

545
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,175
Legends could be better off

546
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,238
Ji Xiangkong is always giving away the first blood

547
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:22,825
It's okay Although he is useless

548
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:23,725
We still have Gu Fang

549
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,625
I think Legends

550
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,575
will definitely win this round

551
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,100
I think Legends will definitely win this round

552
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,375
Lu Feng still fights for the economic lead

553
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:35,700
Harrass them even if we can't hurt them

554
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,075
Lin Yixuan

555
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:36,825
Go to Jungle with me

556
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:37,700
Coming

557
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,550
We can see that Legends are 

558
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:39,650
taking over enemy's jungle

559
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,925
It's because the sentinel

560
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:41,425
detected a player 

561
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:42,425
in their Jungle

562
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,150
Captain I'm in control of this

563
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:44,000
Go ahead

564
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:44,925
I've got a big one coming

565
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,200
Captain Captain

566
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,475
Captain

567
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,775
That attack was in vain

568
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:53,550
No

569
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,100
What happened to Gu Fang

570
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,150
This is world championship

571
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,875
This kind of mistake

572
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,750
is definitely not allowed here

573
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,300
Oh my god

574
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,150
This is terrible

575
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:02,725
If he didn't let 

576
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,775
that one go

577
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,150
An enemy would be killed already

578
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:07,575
Don't go all the way up there Go take the high land

579
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,250
I'll lead them away

580
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,075
Protect the captain

581
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:09,650
Jeffery from Tatan 

582
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,775
seem to be too carried away

583
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:12,850
Huo Yao went for it

584
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:13,600
And Jeffery

585
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,175
I got it

586
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,075
I said I got it Goddamn it

587
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,325
Legends are risking their lives

588
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,650
Come on

589
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,425
Stop him

590
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:22,275
Come on

591
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,150
Yes

592
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Gu Fang use another two attacks

593
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,250
to the fullest 

594
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,700
and kill Jeffery right there

595
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,450
All the other members of Tatan 

596
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,275
are currently frozen

597
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:29,875
It's not a good thing for Tatan

598
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:30,875
It's the best time for Legends

599
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,000
to take the game

600
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,000
This is the second chance for Legends

601
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:35,700
Come on Legends

602
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,150
This may be the last chance for us to win

603
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,800
Hold back Captain

604
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:38,475
I'm gonna be at the front

605
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,275
I got this Let me do it

606
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,325
Trust me

607
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:44,575
I got this

608
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,575
I said I got it

609
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:46,325
Support from Tatan

610
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,575
starts to attack Gu Fang

611
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,525
But how could Gu Fang

612
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,475
let another one go

613
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:50,925
This is not what Gu Fang used to be

614
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:51,650
Protect the captain

615
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:51,875
He has been taken

616
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,375
What's wrong with Gu Fang today

617
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,750
Is he concentrating at all

618
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,900
Ji Xiangkong Here he comes

619
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:57,775
He makes a huge attack

620
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:58,625
trying to protect the captain

621
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,550
Jeffery is resurrected

622
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,625
He gets back to the game

623
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,600
and joins the team

624
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,550
Pull out

625
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,675
Let me do it

626
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,400
Because of Jeffery's attack

627
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Huo Yao and Lin Yixuan are both killed

628
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,625
Pull out

629
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,525
Let them in

630
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,425
Protect the captain

631
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:14,375
Our resource is not enough

632
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:15,525
It's not enough

633
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:18,775
Ji Xiangkong jumps into the battle circle again

634
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:19,500
and uses his second skill

635
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,550
to cover Gu Fang

636
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,525
Gu Fang escaped

637
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,550
But Ji Xiangkong and Lu Feng

638
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,350
can barely take the 

639
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:24,726
endless attacks from Tatan

640
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,800
They die on the way back

641
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,200
What was that What was that

642
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:31,050
I said I got it

643
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:31,875
Didn't I

644
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,925
Jeffery is so 

645
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:33,925
unstoppable

646
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,675
He would do anything to 

647
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,350
kill the Creator

648
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,200
Although Legends are in a 

649
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,600
extremely bad situation now

650
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,650
But they refuse to give up

651
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,850
Gu Fang steps to 

652
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,825
the front alone

653
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,325
trying to stop enemies from moving

654
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,525
I can't defend any more

655
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,125
Tatan is too powerful

656
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,050
Gu Fang is killed

657
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,900
just beneath the crystal

658
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,350
He can't even fight back

659
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,000
At this time

660
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,025
Although we are reluctant

661
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,475
to admit that

662
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:57,175
but I'm afraid Legends 

663
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,625
have little chance to win

664
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,275
Captain 

665
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:57,800
Let's get out of here

666
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,550
Shake hands with them

667
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,225
Let's do this Let's do this 

668
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,625
Nah Not you

669
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,975
Just keep going

670
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,850
Well done Well done Come on Good job

671
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,975
Legends

672
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,375
Legends did their best

673
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,425
At a world-class 

674
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:23,775
stage like this

675
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,075
Their performance is 

676
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,225
enough to make us proud

677
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:30,075
Let's cheer for them

678
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,425
Legends Keep fighting

679
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,200
I feel so sorry

680
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,250
It's all my bad

681
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,650
Don't be Captain

682
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,866
We will definitely win 

683
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:05,925
the game next year

684
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,125
Let's get out of here

685
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,425
Yes boss

686
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,300
Qiu Ying 

687
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:35,025
I just heard the news

688
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:36,300
Gu Fang is likely to retire

689
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,575
Find a way to do a 

690
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:38,200
live interview with Gu Fang

691
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:39,250
Boss

692
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,950
They just lost the game

693
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:43,800
I don't think it's a good idea

694
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,675
to interview him right now

695
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,075
and it's about him retiring

696
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:49,300
Qiu Ying

697
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,850
It's a great time for our game show

698
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,600
to expand the audience

699
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,350
The result of the game is already there

700
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
What you should do now is to make the most of it

701
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,350
You are a host

702
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,200
This is the least you can do professionally

703
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,025
Besides

704
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,075
Their company is organizing a 

705
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:02,150
meeting event with Gu Fang

706
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,375
We already said 

707
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,425
we will do a live show

708
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,825
So Listen don't mess up

709
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:06,775
this time

710
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,350
Yes of course Boss

711
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,200
I understand

712
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,125
I'm sorry guys

713
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,200
We disappointed you again

714
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,600
Gu Fang

715
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,725
Never so never

716
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:37,400
You're Legends Never give up 

717
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,725
If you're about to cry

718
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,075
Just cry hard

719
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:12,825
Look at them Our fans

720
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,600
They followed us from home to Vancouver

721
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,874
Just hoping to see us win

722
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,825
Remember their tears

723
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,725
When we are back at home

724
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:25,100
We can only pay them back by working ten times harder

725
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,200
We will not quit until we win that championship

726
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes We will not quit until we win that championship

727
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,325
Just drive

728
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,200
Too much fans

729
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,100
I can't move

730
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,800
Well

731
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,850
Let me give them some comfort

732
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,375
How will you go back then

733
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,850
There's another car

734
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:07,675
I'll find you later

735
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,475
Alright Be safe

736
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,775
I'll come with you

737
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:23,125
You're Legends Never give up 

738
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,125
Everybody Please be quiet 

739
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,725
Listen to me

740
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,925
It's raining outside Let's move to another place

741
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:28,175
If you have anything to say Say it to me

742
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah Okay 

743
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,700
Ji Xiangkong

744
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,925
We like you very much Xiangkong

745
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,300
Ji Xiangkong


746
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,732
We will always support you

747
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,359
We will always support Legends

748
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,475
Thanks Thank you very much

749
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,375
It's alright Please don't cry

750
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,025
Captain will be sad to see you cry

751
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,125
We will keep praticing

752
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,750
Maybe next year will be our year

753
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:53,850
Xiangkong

754
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,975
I really like you

755
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,150
Oh You're my fan

756
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,850
Yep

757
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:57,900
I came to see you intentionally

758
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,500
How intentionally

759
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:01,500
I only watched you during the game

760
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,525
Can I take a picture with you

761
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,850
What is he doing over there

762
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,575
Where is Gu Fang

763
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Come here

764
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,050
Take another one

765
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,875
He is so sweet with the fans

766
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,725
Looks like someone easy to get along with

767
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:14,600
If I follow him 

768
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,375
maybe I will find Gu Fang

769
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you Xiangkong You are so nice

770
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,850
Keep going 

771
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,325
Bye Bye

772
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,125
We will always support Legends

773
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:25,173
Bye Bye  

774
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,725
Three

775
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,850
Two

776
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,225
One
