Qiu Ying!

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,410
Why are you only here now?

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,570
The flight has already departed.

6
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,410
What do we do?

7
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,370
You're really the death of me.

8
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,930
The driver booked by the company

9
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,170
sent me to the train station.

10
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,930
What?

11
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,880
Hello.

12

Hello.

13
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,590
Is there still tickets

for the earliest flight

15
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,150
to Vancouver?

16
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,150
There's still one last ticket for business class.

17
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,990
How much is it?

18
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,150
31,500RMB.

19
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,990
I'll get it.

20
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,990

the Chinese translator for the show tonight.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,510
I'm Luo Tian.

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,980
I wonder what President Liu is thinking,

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
is Qiu Ying even up for the job?

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,260
Yi Yi,

43
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,340
how is Qiu Ying over there?

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,820
I don't know.

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,780
I'm waiting for her news too.

46
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,820
Hurry on and contact her!

47
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,930
Hello Yi Yi.

48
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,530
Qiu Ying,

49
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,530
are you at the venue yet?

50
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,650
The competition is about to begin.

51
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,090
I couldn't hail a cab at the airport

52
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,970
so I travelled 2 stations by train

53
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,090
and I don't even know where I am now.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,730
I'm trying to hail a cab on the streets.

55
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,290
If I'm lucky enough,

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,010
I should be able to make it.

57
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,610
You're not even on the way?

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,250
I've already

59
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,290
prepared everything.

60
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,930
President Liu is really pissed.

61
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,930
He said if you were to screw up

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,610
this live broadcast,

63
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,170
he's definitely...

64
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,080
I can't talk now,

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,920
the cab is here.

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Sorry Sir.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,760
Sorry.

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
It's my Boyfriend's car.

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,270
This is your boyfriend?

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,910
Where would you like to go?

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,940

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,700
Okay, Rogers Arena.

73
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,220
Let's go.

74
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,300
Don't be nervous,

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,500
you're making me nervous too.

76
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,500
Just treat is as

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,660
how you play during trainings.

78
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,850
Is that so, Brother Kong?

79
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,570
Don't think about it.

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,220
Captain, we are ready.

81
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,700
Please move faster.

82
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,380
I can't move any faster,

83
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,500
the traffic is so bad.

84
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,290
Are you insane?

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,210
President Liu said,

86
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,010
people like us who does

87
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,930
reality shows

88
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,930
either convert to an Iconquer program

89
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,210
or we are fired.

90
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,210
I did not get this

91
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,450
opportunity easily.

92
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,570
I'm definitely going.

93
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,550
I can't give up.

94
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,710
But you have zero knowledge

95
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,430
on career battles,

96
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,990
what can you do even if you're there?

97
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,270
Yi Yi!

98
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,350
Thought of snatching?

99
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
If you were to buy this flight ticket,

100
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,710
you won't be able to pay for your house instalments.

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,390
If President Liu knows that I did not make it for the flight,

102
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,630
he'll definitely fire me.

103
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,310
By then,

104
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,430
all the more I can't pay for my house instalments.

105
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,070
I...

106
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,430
Excuse me!

107
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,150
Please, stop.

108
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,070
We are not even there yet.

109
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,670
I know.

110
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,150
Please, just stop.

111
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,710
Okay.

112
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,800
Everyone, it's about time.

113
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
Don't forget

114
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
the reason why we're here.

115
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,800
All the best!

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,640
All the best!

117
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,900
Look at them,

118
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,660
it's like they are walking in slow-motion.

119
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,460
Oh my god, this is hilarious.

120
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,060
They think they are so cool.

121
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,130
Can't wait to see the looks

122
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,730
on their faces when they lose.

123
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,290
This is going to be so much fun.

124
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,690

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,060
is there anything you'd like to say?

160
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,460
Tatan's potential this year

161
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,380
should not be

162
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,180
underestimated

163
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,100
but we're in a longterm battlefield.

164
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
There will be no suspense

165
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,220

before the match?

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,900
for winning on the first round.

195
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,850
The score is now 1 to 0.

196
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,970
The score is now 1 to 0.

197
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,210
Now we're looking at

198
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,330
China's number 1 commentator, Luo Tian.

199
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,090
We're only

200
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,170
2 meters away from him.

201
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,410
Even his back view

202
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,770
gives off an aura.

203
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
Film the stage!

204
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Film the glass room and the members!

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,280
Let us have a look.

206
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,160
The first to leave

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
is the captain, Gu Fang.

208
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,230
What I just say?

209
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,220
Qiu Ying, you're doomed.

210
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,220
You missed the broadcast for the first match.

211
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,060
President Liu said

212
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,780
he doesn't need you

213
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,780
for other programs.

214
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,740
You say what do we do?

215
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,260
I don't wish to either.

216
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,060
Who knows thatI'll be stuck

217
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,260
in a jam on the way here.

218
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,860
Do you know how

219
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,860
how far I ran?

220
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,420
But I still couldn't make it.

221
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,420
I think

222
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,300
you should

223
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,060
think a something good

224
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,260
to make it up.

225
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,370
President Liu always wanted me

226
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,330
to get You Xing exclusive

227
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,690
and interview Gu Fang.

228
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,050
Just nice,

229
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,130
it's break time now.

230
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,010
Why don't I give it a shot?

231
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,570
Gu Fang usually keeps a low profile,

232
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,760
he never accepts

233
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
interview from others.

234
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,080
I can pretend to be a fan

235
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,640
and get first-hand news.

236
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
How are you going to sneak in?

237
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
Even if you're a fan,

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,060
I doubt you're even allowed

239
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,820
to be near their restrooms.

240
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,020
Yi Yi,

241
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,140
I can't talk now.

242
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,260
I got a way.

243
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
Gu Fang, are you confident

244
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,690
in getting

245
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,570
the champion after battling

246
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,370
at Vancouver for 4 years?

247
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,370
Of course.

248
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,130
Rumours has it that

249
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,230
you will be withdrawing from the team because

250
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,910
your condition isn't as good as before,

251
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,790
is this true?

252
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,550
We're running late on time

253
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,110
for the competition.

254
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,110
Thank you, everyone.

255
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,550
Here, thank you.

256
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,390
Sorry.

257
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,550
Sorry.

258
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,350
Captain.

259
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,580
I'm fine.

260
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
Your Tenosynovitis is acting up again?

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,360
Captain, you're my idol.

262
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,800
You willingly gave me a chance

263
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
when I was at my lowest.

264
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,430
I still remember

265
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,910
that you always tell me,

266
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,110
"kid, don't put up a front.

267
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,750
I'm still here for you."

268
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,350
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

269
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,300
Don't be emotional,

270
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,380
I'm the captain

271
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,980
and also the big Brother of yours.

272
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,130
I'm still here for the team.

273
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,370
Alright, let's head back.

274
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,130
Our Brothers are still waiting.

275
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,540
Damn,

276
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,500
will I get exposed?

277
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,820
Hold it right there.

278
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,820
I'm doomed,

279
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,890
what do I do?

280
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,650
It's not to late to apologise now right?

281
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,210
My apologises.

282
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,450
What are you saying?

283
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,090
Becareful of your skirt.

284
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,900
How is Gu Fang?

285
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,700
His hand is shaking very badly.

286
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
we'll lose if this persist.

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,180
So what you're trying to say is

288
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,180
to change our strategy?

289
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,860
Switch captain's and Brother Huo's position.

290
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,060
Jeffery wouldn't let

291
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,010
captain go,

292
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,370
captain couldn't do his best.

293
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,050
We might have a chance to win

294
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,930
if Brother Huo is to go mid.

295
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,110
Ji Xiang Kong,

296
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,990
what stupid strategy is that?

297
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,710
Gu Fang is being idolized by the world

298
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,950
as the ace player of mid.

299
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,070
You want him to play jungle?

300
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,510
What are you even thinking?

301
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,750
Manager Zhao,

302
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,070
Gu Fang condition isn't the best,

303
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,910
I can guarantee that.

304
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,910
Do you know how many fans are anticipating

305
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,470
Gu Fang's first battle

306
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,470
with Jeffery

307
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,510
in the mid lane?

308
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,510
What will people say if we were to

309
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,220
change his position now?

310
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,660
Gu Fang is a coward.

311
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Legends is a coward.

312
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,900
This will affect the team

313
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
and the company's image,

314
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,900
do you know?

315
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,780
Zhao Yang,

316
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,200
if you're really

317
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,960
thinking for the team,

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,920
you should be supporting me.

319
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,480
Ji Xiang Kong,

320
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,720
watch your attitude!

321
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
This is the global semi-finals

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
not just any game, you know?

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,920
What tantrum

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
are you showing me here?

325
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,920
Ji Xiang Kong, remember this.

326
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,920
Gu Fang

327
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
does not only represent himself

328
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,360
but the whole team

329
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,040
and the entire company,

330
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
do you know?

331
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,070
You're the team's commander,

332
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,190
your task

333
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,990
isn't to formulate tactics

334
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,870
put rather, executing the tactics

335
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,190
and win the champion

336
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,350
okay?

337
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
I suggest a change of tactics

338
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,940
in order for us to win the champion.

339
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,740
Xiang Kong, whatever you're saying

340
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,020
has it's own sense

341
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,940
but have you wondered

342
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,940
how the world will question you

343
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,010
if we were to lose?

344
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,330
For the team and captain,

345
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,690
it doesn't matter

346
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,810
how they question me.

347
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,250
Anyway, I do not agree.

348
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,890
Xiang Kong. just forget it.

349
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,080
get ready

351
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
to make some noise

352
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,040
because the second round

353
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,110
is about to begin!

354
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,350
Hello, everyone.

355
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,790
I'm the host, Qiu Ying.

356
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,470
In the first round,

357
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,030
Legends lost a point.

358
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,070
Let us anticipate for the second round.

359
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,660
Hopefully they are able to make a comeback.

360
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,220
Everyone saw how

361
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,660
Legends made numerous mistakes

362
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
in the previous round,

363
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,940
the five of them

364
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,860
couldn't even handle jeffery alone.

365
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,980
Indeed.

366
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,740
So the first thing Legends did for this round

367
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,860
was to topple

368
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,020
Jeffery's most impressive White Rabbit.

369
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,820
In contrast, on the Legends' side

370
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,180
seems like a sea of heroes.

371
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,260
Especially the one who

372
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,500
goes by the nickname, Deception Master,

373
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,460
Ji Xiang Kong.

374
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,500
Iconquer has a total of

375
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
101 heroes

376
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,770
and there's none that he can't play.

377
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,370
But in the previous round, Ji Xiang Kong

378
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,570
was slain 7 times.

379
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:51,770
Some even said,

380
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,450
if they don't replace the crippled,

381
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,010
Ji Xiang Kong...

382
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,330
Brother Yao,

383
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,330
I'm letting Baturu to you.

384
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,960
Sure, no problem.

385
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
Gu Fang represents

386
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
our pioneer team,

387
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,520
the first Chinese team,

388
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,200
to get the champion.

389
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,520
He's a man that crosses eras...

390
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,460
Captain, which hero are you using?

391
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
So what you're trying to say is

392
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,020
to change our strategy?

393
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,500
Switch captain's and Brother Huo's position.

394
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,980
Gu Fang is being idolized by the world

395
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,820
as the ace player of mid.

396
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,020
You want him to play jungle?

397
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Captain?

398
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,300
I'll use the...

399
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,820
I chose Creator for you.

400
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,940
Okay.

401
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,860
Gu Fang actually chose Creator.

402
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,860
Creator is said to be

403
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,370
the most difficult mid lane hero

404
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,810
in Iconquer.

405
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,010
He picked Creator,

406
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,250
what are we going to do?

407
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,610
Okay let's do this, I'm going to pick the Worm Queen.

408
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,370
Miki,

409
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,190
you're going to get the Dictator, okay?

410
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,990
Okay, alright.

411
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,790
Then we can

412
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,550
counteract his attacks.

413
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,710
Alright everyone ready?

414
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,430
Ready.

415
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,230
Let's do it.

416
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,870
How will you comment on

417
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,190
Gu Fang's current condition?

418
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,350
Gu Fang

419
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,830
as a contestant with age,

420
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,390
he's is very clear

421
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,510
on what he's about to face.

422
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,430
Okay, both sides have already confirmed their line up.

423
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,430
The second round

424
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,430
is about to begin.

425
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,910
Steady, don't get caught.

426
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,110
Okay.

427
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,230
Not an issue.

428
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,390
I'll be the eyes,

429
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,630
Lu Feng be careful of the minions.

430
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,700
Don't be nervous.

431
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,180
Bottom is disappearing,

432
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,980
bottom is disappearing.

433
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,100
Everyone, look.

434
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,660
This is Ji Xiang Kong,

435
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,060
he's the brains of Legends

436
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,820
who is able to turn the table

437
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,820
and also the team's commander.

438
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,760
Rumours has it that he never plays conventionally,

439
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
tactics are strange and variable.

440
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
Nickname,

441
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,120
Deception Master.

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh,

443
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
he's definitely the visual

444
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,600
of Legends.

445
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,320
He has a lot of fans.

446
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
You girls only look at visuals

447
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,960
that's why you'll like

448
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,960
goodlooking yet useless person.

449
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,110
Why does he look familiar?

450
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,990
Let's take a look at Ji Xiang Kong,

451
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,870
taking down a turret

452
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,630
and going towards the warrior at the peak

453
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,740
while beginning an attack.

454
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,180
Solo time?

455
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,100
Is he insane?

456
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,460
Blue, come with me.

457
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,340
Let's get him from the top.

458
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
What does this operation means?

459
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,740
Is first blood going to happen?

460
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
Nice one, Xiang Kong.

461
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,250
They're baited.

462
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,930
Brother Kong,

463
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,410
you've tricked

464
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,130
two of them over.

465
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,170
In your face, Ji Xiang Kong!

466
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,330
Look,

467
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,130
he's the first blood again.

468
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,130
He's really such a burden.

469
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,010
Ji Xiang Kong

470
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,130
is the first blood again.

471
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,770
Captain, send another surge in mid.

472
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,610
Okay, coming.

473
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,250
Brother Yao, Ah Xuan,

474
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,090
both of you ambush on the opposite.

475
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,730
Coming.

476
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,370
Follow up.

477
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,400
Walk a little.

478
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,280
We can see that

479
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,160
Gu Fang and Jeffery

480
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,960
met in mid.

481
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
Dictator goes to the back suddenly,

482
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
sending a warming strike,

483
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,280
freezing Gu Fang in place.

484
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,560
Jeffery silences him.

485
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,630
3, 2, 1, attack!

486
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,270
Attack him.

487
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,390
We did not expect Lin Yi Xuan and Huo Ya

488
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,390
saved a skill.

489
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,100
Coming,

490
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Lin Yi Xuan's skill

491
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,100
is able to control Jeffery continuously.

492
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,820
Huo Ya as

493
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,060
and amazing, natural occult force.

494
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,100
Beautiful.

495
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,540
It's the last wave!

496
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Gu Fang casted a meteor

497
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,260
combining with Lin Yi Xuan's

498
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,180
King's Command.

499
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,540
Double kill, beautiful!

500
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,380
Damn it!

501
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,020
Let us see

502
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,780
Mars on the other side,

503
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,300
he came running back.

504
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,420
Triple kill.

505
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,850
The operation is a

506
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,730
literally asking for death.

507
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,890
When was he there?

508
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,090
The ace, Gu Fang

509
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,090
has gotten triple kill.

510
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,010
The entire venue has been ignited.

511
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,970
Sorry.

512
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,040
Legends!

513
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
This view is too spectacular.

514
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,320
The game has just started

515
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,960
and Gu Fang has already gotten triple kill.

516
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
This teamwork is indeed beautifully done.

517
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,680
Legends in one of the world's

518
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
top teams indeed.

519
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,220
They've already planned the attack

520
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,620
waiting for Tatan to fall into the trap.

521
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,500
Captain, this wave of operation

522
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,340
can be in your collections of best moves.

523
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,860
Everyone assisted well.

524
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,740
Everyone assisted well.

525
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,740
This wave of 1 vs 3 steadied us.

526
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,460
Out Brother Kong is the king of first blood.

527
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
What are you saying?

528
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,900
This is called strategizing.

529
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,300
But the way Jeffery plays

530
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,980
is still pretty impressive.

531
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,580
Let us be careful.

532
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,420
Let's protect captain more.

533
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,220
Rest assured.

534
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,820
They're coming.

535
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,580
It doesn't matter.

536
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,300
We're respawning.

537
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,060
Come on!

538
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,020
Keep going!

539
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,020
We can see that

540
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,780
on Legends' side,

541
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,260
is making use of the opponent resurrecting time

542
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,900
to push forward.

543
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,060
Furthermore, at this time

544
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,780
Legends are leading by 1500 economically.

545
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,970
This is a huge advantage to them.

546
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:00,970
If Tatan still doesn't

547
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,610
work hard...

548
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,730
Excuse me,

549
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,730
I have a question.

550
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,370
Why is it an advantage

551
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,730
to be leading economically?

552
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,390
When you have more coins as compared to your opponents,

553
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,310
it means you can buy better equipments.

554
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,190
There's still a need to buy equipments?

555
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,670
No, why are you here

556
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,270
if you don't know anything?

557
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,230
When Gu Fang did a counter kill just now

558
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,110
during his wave of operation

559
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,510
is so refined.

560
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,830
If it's not for Ji Xiang Kong's first blood,

561
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,470
Legends will definitely

562
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,830
have a dream-like opening.

563
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,710
Ji Xiang Kong's job is to be the first blood.

564
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,430
They still have Gu Fang,

565
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,350
it's alright if he's a crippled.

566
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,190
I'm guessing that there's no way

567
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,790
for Legends to lose this round.

568
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,270
I'm guessing that there's no way

569
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,020
for Legends to lose this round.

570
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,100
Lu Fang, fight continuously for economic development.

571
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,220
If you can't attack, harass them will do.

572
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,740
Lin Yi Xuan,

573
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,540
come with me to jungle.

574
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,380
Coming, it's your showtime.

575
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,220
We cans ee that Legends

576
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,620
are starting a fog in opponent's jungle.

577
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,800
In order to investigate their defenses,

578
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,320
they saw a

579
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,200
spirit jungling.

580
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,040
Captain, I have it under control.

581
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,840
Push!

582
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,920
I have my Ultimate skill.

583
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,160
Captain, release now!

584
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,520
Captain, ampilfy it.

585
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,520
This skill is a miss.

586
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,400
No.

587
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,880
Gu Fang actually missed his Ultimate.

588
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,040
This is the global championship,

589
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,560
how can a mistake

590
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,630
like this occur?

591
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,990
My god,

592
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,070
this is so unexpected.

593
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,710
If Gu Fang did not

594
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,830
miss his Ultimate,

595
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,350
he could've killed Spirit instantly.

596
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,430
Don't push anymore, guard the last turrent.

597
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,350
I'll divert their attention,

598
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,950
protect captain.

599
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,590
Everyone look, Tatn's Jeffery

600
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,660
seems to go wild with joy.

601
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,660
Huo Yao is pushing

602
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,900
but Jeffery is going up against him.

603
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,420
I got it!

604
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,180
I said I got it, god damn it.

605
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,660
They are approaching in a grand manner,

606
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
Legends are putting their lives in the line.

607
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,540
All the best!

608
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,250
Block him.

609
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,450
All the best!

610
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,490
Beautiful!

611
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,690
Gu Fang followed up with a metoer,

612
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,610
it's a blessing from heavens.

613
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,330
Full output,

614
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,610
killing Jeffery instantly.

615
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,490
The skills of other members of Tatan

616
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,330
are still on cool down.

617
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,010
Things aren't looking great.

618
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,970
It's the perfect chance for Legends

619
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,290
to flip the tables now.

620
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,290
There's hope for Legends once again.

621
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,170
Legends has started...

622
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,450
This is our last chance.

623
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,050
Captain, you retreat.

624
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,650
I'll go against them.

625
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,210
I can do it.

626
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,530
Let me do it.

627
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,520
Trust me,

628
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I got this, I said I got this.

629
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,520
Tatan's support

630
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,640
is attacking Gu Fang now.

631
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
But why did Gu Fang

632
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
missed again?

633
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,190
This is very unlikely of Gu Fang.

634
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,830
Protect captain!

635
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,310
He's being controlled.

636
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,710
What exactly is the problem?

637
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,230
Where did his

638
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,230
concentration go to?

639
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,190
Ji Xiang Kong, he's here.

640
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,070
He used his Ultimate

641
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,830
in order to protect Gu Fang.

642
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,710
Jeffery purchased

643
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,260
flying shoes and continued battling

644
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,060
alongside with his teamates.

645
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,100
Retreat.

646
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,300
I'll go against them.

647
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,860
Under his influence of his Ultimate,

648
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,540
huo Yao and Lin Yi Xuan both got killed.

649
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,140
Retreat.

650
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,060
Let them in.

651
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,940
Protect captain.

652
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,820
There isn't enough mana for now,

653
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,980
mana isn't enough.

654
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,380
Ji Xiang Kong jumped into the fight once again,

655
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,060
unleasing his second skill

656
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,130
to protect Gu Fang in retreating.

657
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,050
Gu Fang managed to flee for his life.

658
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,930
But Ji Xiang Kong

659
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,690
anf Lu Feng can't hold on any longer to

660
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,930
Tatan's crazy attacks

661
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,330
and was killed when retreating.

662
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,810
What was that?

663
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,640
I said I got it,

664
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,480
didn't I?

665
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,360
Jeffery is really

666
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,400
out to kill them.

667
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,120
He doesn't want to give

668
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,960
Creator any chance of survival at all?

669
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,880
Although Legends

670
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,240
is in a state of absolute disadvantage

671
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,360
but they are not giving up.

672
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,780
Gu Fang charged out of the spring

673
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,460
single-handedly

674
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,180
wanting to block them from entering.

675
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,260
I can't hold on any longer.

676
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,900
But Tatan's controlling moves are too powerful.

677
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,820
Gu Fang is killed

678
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,700
under the Nexus.

679
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,140
There's no chance of countering attack at all.

680
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,740
At such a point of time,

681
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,980
although very unwillingly

682
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
but we have to admit

683
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,020
that China's team has already

684
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,500
tried their best in this round.

685
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,540
Captain,

686
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
let's go.

687
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,840
Let's head out and shake hands.

688
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,560
Let's do this.

689
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,360
Nah not you,

690
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,600
just keep going.

691
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,200
Well done, good job.

692
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,200
Legends

693
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,790
has already tried their best.

694
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,670
On such an advance stage

695
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,030
like this one,

696
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,630
their performance

697
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,670
made us proud.

698
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,390
Let us cheer them on.

699
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,740
Legends, all the best!

700
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,770
I'm sorry, everyone.

701
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,010
I did not perform well enough.

702
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
Don't worry, captain.

703
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,720
We will definitely

704
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
win it back next year.

705
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,910
Let's go.

706
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,510
The world of Iconquer

707
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,630
is ours!

708
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,540
Hello, President Liu.

709
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,180
Hello, Qiu Ying.

710
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,140
I just received the news.

711
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Gu Fang might retire,

712
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,540
think of a way to find him

713
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,300
and do a broadcast.

714
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,380
President Liu,

715
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,970
they just lost the competition,

716
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,970
if I were to ask for an interview

717
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,650
and it's about retirement,

718
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,010
this...

719
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,370
Isn't too nice, right?

720
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,650
Qiu Ying,

721
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,840
our page is at it's peak now.

722
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,640
It's our prime time to gain popularity.

723
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,680
They lost the competition anyways,

724
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,200
capturing the hot topic is the main point.

725
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
As a host yourself,

726
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,400
you should've this professional standard at least.

727
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,260
Also,

728
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,340
Legends Official is organizing

729
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,340
a fanmeeting for Gu Fang.

730
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,580
We've already release the notice

731
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,500
that we're doing a live broadcast,

732
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,740
you better not

733
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,860
screw it up.

734
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,620
Yes, President Liu.

735
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,500
I know.

736
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,710
I'm sorry everyone,

737
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,950
we've let you all down.

738
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,310
Gu Fang,

739
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,470
never say give up.

740
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,020
We'll never concede defeat, it's the legends calling.

741
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,020
We'll never concede defeat, it's the legends calling.

742
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:50,160
We'll never concede defeat, it's the legends calling.

743
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:20,850
Cry out loud

744
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,970
if you want to.

745
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,930
Look at the fans outside,

746
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,210
They followed us all the way

747
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,930
from China to Vancouver

748
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,930
just to see us win the champion.

749
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,000
Remember their tears.

750
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,000
We'll use 10 times of hard work

751
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,240
to repay them when we get back.

752
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
We do not rest till we get the champion.

753
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,550
We do not rest till we get the champion.

754
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,350
We do not rest till we get the champion.

755
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,780
Let's go.

756
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,260
There are too many fans,

757
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,540
I can't move.

758
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,460
How about

759
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,210
I comfort them for awhile?

760
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,770
How will you go back then?

761
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,290
Isn't there another back-up van?

762
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,210
I'll meet you guys later.

763
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,880

We'll never concede defeat, it's the legends calling.

766

We'll never concede defeat, it's the legends calling.

767
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,940

Okay.

Thank you.

It's okay, stop crying now.

780
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,930
Captain will be upset if he sees this.

781
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,930
We will continue to work hard.

782
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,370
There's still hope next year.

783
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,530
Handsome Ji,

784
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,690
I like you a lot.

785
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,170
You're my fan?

786
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:10,770
Yes.

787
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,650
I came specially to see you.

788
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,650
How specially?

789
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,470
I only look at you ans no one else.

790
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,470
Can I take a photo with you?

791
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,870
Why is it him?

792
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,510
Where's Gu Fang?

793
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:20,830
Here.

794
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,830
One more.

795
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,830
He's so friendly,

796
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,550
looks like the kind that does what you say.

797
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,910
A guy who can't reject people.

798
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,710
If I were to follow him,

799
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,510
I might even be able to find Gu Fang.

800
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,910
Thank you Handsome Ji, awesome!

801
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,750
