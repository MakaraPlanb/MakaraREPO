1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,500
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,225
Episode Fifteen

3
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,275
Brother Kong,

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,825
I'm really not used to it 

5
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,550
when you are not in the team.

6
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:56,850
Yes.

7
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,375
If I don't scold you for three days, 

8
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,775
you feel sick all over, right?

9
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,350
Make some sense. 

10
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,100
Right, brother Kong.

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,973
I think,

12
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:07,975
you join a team overboard

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,250
is also a good choice.

14
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,500
Coach Luo said 

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,375
that's the third-ranked team in the world.

16
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,125
They are willing to pay so much money to invite you. 

17
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,100
How sincere they are!

18
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,950
Alright.

19
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,950
I have my own plan.

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,100
You just focus on your game.

21
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:20,975
Don't worry about me.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,225
Right.

23
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,475
I ask you out today.

24
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,125
You know what I wanna say, right?

25
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:29,775
You don't have to praise me.

26
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,175
Working hard is what I ought to do.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,800
I know.

28
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:34,725
You. 

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,250
Don't listen to coach Luo

30
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:36,975
making a big deal.

31
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:39,575
Brother Kong.

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,500
You transfer to another team now.

33
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,125
Can you…

34
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,575
Stop!

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,000
You just stay well in Legends.

36
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,150
Don't go anywhere!

37
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:52,025
What? What are you thinking?

38
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,225
Who said I will leave with you.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,975
My god！

40
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,450
I mean 

41
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,050
you join another team right now.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,975
If we meet at the competition,

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,950
you just hide from me.

44
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,850
I hide from you?

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,225
You see，

46
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,125
all my tricks were taught by you.

47
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:15,675
If I meet you,

48
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,550
I must lose badly.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
What a wuss.

50
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:20,600
No. Brother Kong.

51
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:21,925
This thing about transferring,

52
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,650
I already thought throughly.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,725
You don't need to persuade me.

54
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,800
Really?

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,825
Tell me.

56
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,650
You see,

57
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,800
my contract with Legends

58
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:31,425
has not end yet.

59
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:32,250
Right?

60
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,400
If I leave now, I have to pay contractual penalty.

61
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,250
How can I have that much money？

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,500
You are a miser.

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,175
Good.  

64
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:44,850
Seems like I don't need to advise you.

65
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,775
Stay well.

66
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,550
Waiter, check!

67
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,350
Thanks brother Kong.

68
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,550
He's treat.

69
00:03:58,975 --> 00:03:59,500
Before finding out 

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,625
who set you up,

71
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,725
I won't leave.

72
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,700
Check.

73
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:16,475
If all the people in this world

74
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,375
can understand you,

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,500
how ordinary you need to be.

76
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,650
Naive.

77
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,475
Thanks!

78
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,150
Isn't this the famous

79
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,050
deceiver in game, Ji Xiangkong？

80
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:19,175
Why are you available today

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,500
to visit our VNG?

82
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,525
I am here to see sister Wen.

83
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,200
Sister Wen?

84
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,550
You are honey-tongued.

85
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,000
Finding our coach Shu 

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,150
after being kicked out by Legends.

87
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,200
You want to beg her to sign you, right?

88
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,800
Ridiculous!

89
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,750
You will know whether this is ridiculous or not after my talk.

90
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,825
Excuse me.

91
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,150
Stop.

92
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,675
As VNG's future leader,

93
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,700
I am telling you responsibly,

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,925
we will never find you,

95
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,850
a clumsy-handed player, to hold us back.

96
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,450
If you want to retain dignity,

97
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,200
just leave.

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,575
Bye.

99
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:27,575
What time is your appointment?

100
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:28,600
Two o'clock.

101
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,450
I confirmed three times already, Ok?

102
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,350
Don't wait. Let's go. 

103
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,100
You don't do the interview?

104
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,450
His time is precious.

105
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,500
Our time is not pre…

106
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,300
Already waited for a hour.

107
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,850
Let's wait a little longer.

108
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,825
Hello.

109
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,925
How are you doing?

110
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,300
Sorry for being late.

111
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:51,900
You are

112
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
the reporters from Gan Dong magazine,

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,100
right?

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,225
The prince of e-sports is here.

115
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:57,425
Ask anything you want.

116
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,225
Do you have a prob…

117
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,600
I am the reporter from Dong Gan e-sports magazine,

118
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,950
Lu Yiyi.

119
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,325
Today,

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,900
I am going to do an interview with you.

121
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:13,600
Wait a second.

122
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,200
You are Qiu Ying?

123
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,600
You

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,500
know me?

125
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,075
You are very famous.

126
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,650
The host who has been kicked out of UXStar.

127
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,750
Who doesn't know you.

128
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,275
Mr. Qi Yue.

129
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:30,575
We originally 

130
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,675
arranged two hours of interview.

131
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,025
There is only forty minutes left.

132
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,100
Let's hurry up,

133
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,625
OK？

134
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,025
Ten minutes is enough.

135
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,600
I will tell you

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,925
how I, Qiu Yue,

137
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,825
lead VNG win the the champion in the new season.

138
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,350
Wait a second.

139
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:44,650
You mean that

140
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,300
you will replace Pei Xi 

141
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,625
as the new captain of VNG?

142
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,950
Or what?

143
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,400
Tell me who else 

144
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,000
can be the new captain?

145
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,375
Let’s start. 

146
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,575
Don’t be nervous.

147
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,050
It's hard to avoid being excited to see an idol.

148
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,900
You.

149
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,450
OK.

150
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,250
Sister Wen.

151
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:22,375
Let me be straight with you.

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,900
I want to join VNG.

153
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:25,900
First, tell me

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,025
your opinion about VNG

155
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,325
Pei Xi makes success,

156
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,025
but also lead to failure.

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,375
Continue.

158
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,550
I believe you already noticed,

159
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,600
Pei Xi's leaving

160
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:43,950
to VNG, who only know how to play four guarantees one,

161
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,950
is a great bow.

162
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,350
A team that always rely success and failure on one person,

163
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,700
is really what you want?

164
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,575
Ji Xiangkong.

165
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:54,875
You are the first one

166
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,550
who dare to say this to me.

167
00:08:58,925 --> 00:08:59,669
So I am not

168
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,894
a likeable person.

169
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,850
Sister wen.

170
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,425
You won the champion before.

171
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:04,700
You should know that

172
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,925
IConquer is a team game,

173
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,725
not personal show.

174
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,925
VNG doesn't lack great players, 

175
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:15,600
but tactics.

176
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,500
They all hold a breath in heart.

177
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:27,250
Sister Wen.

178
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,300
Trust me.

179
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,350
I will give you 

180
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,700
a different VNG.

181
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,675
I have one more question.

182
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,800
You know our situation very well.

183
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,625
Why do you come?

184
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,125
Because brother Sun told me that

185
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,300
you still have desire for champion.

186
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,525
The position of VNG's captain

187
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,600
is yours.

188
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,775
Thanks sister Wen.

189
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,325
I won't disappoint you.

190
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,625
Come here. Tell me more.

191
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,900
This is my tactical analysis on VNG.

192
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,100
Brother Shen.

193
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,350
Why does sister Wen

194
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,100
talk with Ji Xiangkong

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,150
for such a long time?

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,375
Does she really want Ji Xaingkong

197
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,675
join our team?

198
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,175
I, I, I…

199
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:35,900
I don't know.

200
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:36,825
But I think the coach

201
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,100
has her own idea.

202
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,400
Is useless to ask you.

203
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:42,800
Lu Sheng, what do you think?

204
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,275
Don't know.

205
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:48,600
What are you guys doing?

206
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,775
Waiting to be interviewed?

207
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,500
Go training!

208
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,750
Brother Qi.

209
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,000
Take care, see you.

210
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,000
Relax next time.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,850
Don't be so nervous.

212
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
This Qi Yue

213
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,625
is so arrogant.

214
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,675
If you didn't stop me,

215
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:09,325
I really want…

216
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,625
Alright. Don't be mad.

217
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:14,950
Ji Xiangkong.

218
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,700
Who is the girl beside him?

219
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,675
Shu Wen.

220
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,525
What are they talking about?

221
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,950
They are so happy.

222
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,900
Alright.

223
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,275
Let go out and talk.

224
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:38,725
There is definitely something wrong.

225
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:39,750
Let’s go. Let’s go.

226
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,550
Ji Xiangkong.

227
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,775
Why is he here?

228
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:54,775
Does he…

229
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,925
he wanna join VNG?

230
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,500
Qiu Ying.

231
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,825
My sharp antennae as a reporter

232
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:01,475
tells me that

233
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,675
there must be something behind it.

234
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,100
Come on. Let go have a look.

235
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,200
Why are you so gossip?

236
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,475
You don't have any evidence.

237
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,275
You go so rashly.

238
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,500
They might kick you out.

239
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:09,300
You are acting stupid.

240
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:10,725
Or what do you think

241
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,750
he is doing at here?

242
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,275
Actually, VNG is a nice place to go.

243
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,425
After all,

244
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,100
they are one of the top four teams.

245
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,100
Last year,

246
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,350
they won second place in the league.

247
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,725
Just behind Legends.

248
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,400
But you should just see

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
the attitude of Qi Yue.

250
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,275
VNG is nice, 

251
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,925
but not necessarily suits for Ji Xiangkong.

252
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,650
Whether suit for Ji Xaingkong or not,

253
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,200
how is that related to you?

254
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,825
Tell me.

255
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:45,600
Why do you care so much about him?

256
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:48,075
I am not. Nonsense.

257
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:48,950
Tell me the truth! Tell me!

258
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,450
You. UFO?

259
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:52,950
Where? Where?

260
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,800
Where is it? Qiu…

261
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,275
Qiu Ying! You stop there!

262
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,475
Make it clear! You!

263
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,150
Master. 

264
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:00,900
Sister Wen.

265
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,925
Can you settle down the thing about captain today?

266
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:05,425
Qi Yue.

267
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,650
Give me more time.

268
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,775
We need to go through some processes.

269
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:09,850
Sorry for the inconvenience.

270
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,450
Master.

271
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,825
When I was in Taiwan,

272
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,450
I always wanted to join a professional team. 

273
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,875
It's you who discovered me

274
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,325
and invited me to develop in mainland.

275
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,050
You can trust me.

276
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,300
Although Pei Xi left,

277
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,125
I still have confidence 

278
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,325
to lead my bros

279
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,350
win the next season of competition for VNG.

280
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,325
Qi Yue.

281
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,750
Go to the training room first.

282
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,025
The training game is about to start.

283
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:40,975
Sister Wen.

284
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,575
Master.

285
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,150
You need to have trust in me.

286
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,850
Besides me,

287
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,825
there is no other better choice.

288
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:52,900
I will go training first.

289
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,900
I decide to sign Ji Xiangkong.

290
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,025
I have guessed

291
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:10,775
your decision.

292
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:12,175
You can sign whoever you want,

293
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:13,850
but Ji Xiangkong,

294
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,175
I don't recommend.

295
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,875
You know our team's problem before very well.

296
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,400
Even there is a member 

297
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,392
with very strong personal capacity like Pei Xi,

298
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:23,325
But without tactics,

299
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,350
we can't go far. 

300
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,900
The tactical ability of Ji Xiangkong,

301
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,300
you should know very well.

302
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,025
This is not about capability.

303
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,125
There is something wrong with his personal manner. 

304
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,850
He has too many negative news.

305
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,750
This is very hard for me.

306
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,875
If you sign him,

307
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:37,300
what will the sponsors think?

308
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:38,750
But according to

309
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,900
our current situation,

310
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,100
A good captain 

311
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,900
is much more important than sponsors.

312
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:44,250
Do you admit that?

313
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,075
Yes.

314
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,400
But…

315
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:47,300
Shu Wen.

316
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,500
If there is another sponsor

317
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,400
withdraw their investment,

318
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:51,600
VNG’s opperation

319
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,225
will face a dilemma.

320
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Dealing with sponsors,

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,050
isn't this what you are good at?

322
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:04,200
Li Gan.

323
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,425
When we established VNG,

324
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,575
We said that

325
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,025
we will develop

326
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,425
a team that able to win the world champion.

327
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,950
Even I need to put all my money on this,

328
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,275
I am not afraid.

329
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,000
Alright.

330
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,125
Then I

331
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,100
take a look at 

332
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
their training game first.

333
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,875
Cheers. Cheers. Come on.

334
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,875
Brother Sun.

335
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:40,925
I didn't expect that

336
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:42,725
it can go so smoothly talking with sister Wen.

337
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,425
She is a person with visionary ideas.

338
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,200
And

339
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,525
if she has once fasten upon an idea,

340
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,875
she will press forward without ceasing.

341
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,150
You has great room for development at VNG.

342
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Thanks brother Sun.

343
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,325
Here. Let me toast you.

344
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:56,225
Here you go.

345
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,200
Thanks for your care during this time.

346
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,925
Also,

347
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,200
If wasn't your encouragement on me,

348
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,440
I won't have the courage

349
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
to find sister Wen.

350
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,175
Cheers! Cheers!

351
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,675
My roommate is leaving after

352
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:12,400
moving in for few days,

353
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,675
Leave me alone.

354
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,150
Brother Sun.

355
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,775
You are single all this time.

356
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,500
Are you still waiting for sister Wen?

357
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,575
You.

358
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:23,775
You are talking nonsense.

359
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,100
Li Gan?

360
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,800
President Li.

361
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,225
Brother Yi.

362
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,375
Haven't seen you for so many year.

363
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,925
You haven't changed a bit.

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,475
Neither have you. Sit down.

365
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,325
Xiangkong.

366
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,175
I am here today

367
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,650
to see you representing VNG.

368
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,825
I go to grab another bowl and chopsticks for you.

369
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:56,700
You guys talk first.

370
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,300
First of all,

371
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:03,300
I represent the team 

372
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
to apologize to you.

373
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,325
We can't sign the contract with you.

374
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,750
What's more.

375
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,575
My personal thoughts

376
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,475
is to let you talk to Shu Wen 

377
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,600
that you can't sign personally.

378
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:14,675
Wait.

379
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,225
President Li.

380
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,250
I don't understand

381
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,550
what you mean.

382
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,250
From the establishment of VNG till now,

383
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:23,575
it has been three years.

384
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,100
Shu Wen went through all the difficulties

385
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,850
to win her record today.

386
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:27,775
But right now,

387
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:29,875
We are at another life-and-death moment.

388
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,100
Pei Xi's leaving

389
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,050
took away three of our largest sponsors.

390
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,850
Two another are still hesitating.

391
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,575
After your talk with Shu Wen today,

392
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,225
they got the message and told me on phone that

393
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,025
if Shu Wen

394
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,500
persist to sign you,

395
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:42,150
they will withdraw their investment.

396
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:44,150
Xiangkong.

397
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,525
Shu Wen appreciates you from her heart.

398
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,400
She even made the decision 

399
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,300
to save you 

400
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,975
by mortgaging everything.

401
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,525
You can't sit by and watch her 

402
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,450
losing all her efforts these years.

403
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,300
If you still consider

404
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:03,700
your loyalty to friends

405
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,475
and to your predecessors,

406
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,600
you should tell her initiatively that

407
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:09,700
You can't sign with her.

408
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,625
President Li. Don't talk anymore.

409
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,775
I understand.

410
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,575
It's me

411
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,850
causing trouble on you.

412
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,050
Thanks for your understanding and righteousness.

413
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:25,675
I am leaving first.

414
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,950
Leaving right now?

415
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:32,300
Brother Yi.

416
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:33,850
You owe me a drink.

417
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,525
Let's do it next time.

418
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:53,675
Right on time.

419
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,025
Ji Xiangkong's contract.

420
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,350
Take a look.

421
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,275
If

422
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,250
you made the decision,

423
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,075
I respect your choice.

424
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,175
I decide to host a signing ceremony.

425
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
The time will be the nearest.

426
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:06,925
At that time,

427
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:07,725
it's better to help me contact

428
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:08,550
few media company.

429
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,475
I want to make this…

430
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,075
Sister Wen.

431
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,250
I am not the one suitable for VNG.

432
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,075
I can't sign with you.

433
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:13,850
What happened?

434
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,950
Sorry.

435
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,875
Ji Xiangkong changes his mind in a sudden.

436
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:25,350
Hello,

437
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,275
The number you dial is power off.

438
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,675
Power off?

439
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:29,575
What does he mean by that?

440
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,875
Shu Wen. Calm down.

441
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,825
Ji Xiangkong might knew 

442
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,850
our situation right now.

443
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,825
No matter in material or financial resource,

444
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,800
We are not better than Legends.

445
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,800
He is a smart guy.

446
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:39,925
He decides not to come.

447
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:41,625
We should understand him.

448
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,425
Right?

449
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,600
No.

450
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,625
He is not that kind of person.

451
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,200
No.

452
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,600
I have to find him.

453
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:51,850
I will try whatever I can

454
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,425
to persuade him.

455
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,775
Shu Wen.

456
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,625
Don't go.

457
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,850
He is not coming.

458
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,600
How do you know?

459
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,600
You went for him.

460
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,375
Shu Wen.

461
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:29,850
Are you here for

462
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,250
Xiangkong?

463
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,000
Where is Xiangkong?

464
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,700
He is upstairs.

465
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,875
Let me lead you there.

466
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,700
Sister Wen.

467
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,475
I already draw up the contract.

468
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,150
Do you sign or not?

469
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,750
Sister Wen.

470
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,700
If it's me who 

471
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,525
make VNG face a worser situation,

472
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:38,625
I,

473
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,600
I am not signing.

474
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:43,600
Withdraw sponsorship is a worser situation?

475
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:44,700
In my eyes,

476
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,325
if we can't win the world champion,

477
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,225
even we have more sponsors,

478
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:51,350
VNG's existence is meaningless.

479
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:55,950
Sister Wen.

480
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,600
I understand you feeling.

481
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,500
But… You don't understand.

482
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,800
The Pioneer won the world champion

483
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,450
was five years before.

484
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,675
In the heart of our veteran,

485
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,825
this champion,

486
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,275
We have waited for too long.

487
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,400
But sister Wen…

488
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,575
Xiangkong, don't worry.

489
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,600
Even all the sponsors leave,

490
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,800
I will try whatever I can

491
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,400
to make VNG survive next season.

492
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,125
Ji Xiangkong.

493
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:30,600
I need you.

494
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,975
You promised to me

495
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:35,700
that you will give me

496
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,050
a different VNG.

497
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,575
Sister Wen.

498
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,900
I am not satisfied with this annual salary.

499
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,575
Write whatever number you want.

500
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,850
I am more satisfied with this.

501
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,700
One yuan?

502
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,050
From today on,

503
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,050
I will advance and retreat together with VNG.

504
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,550
Hide. Hide. Hide.

505
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,100
Perfect.

506
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,025
Perfect. Awesome. Awesome.

507
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,425
Qiu Ying. This series of moves is smooth.

508
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,225
Nice.

509
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,400
Can't believe that brother monkey

510
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:12,375
lose to you.

511
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:13,425
You're not ordinary.

512
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,500
Skinny monkey, I am sorry.

513
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,800
This superficial trick

514
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,450
can intimidated all of you?

515
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:24,625
Dare you compete with me for one more round?

516
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,675
One on one.

517
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,975
OK.

518
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:36,000
Let's compete.

519
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,250
If you are competing for the first place in district,

520
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,475
or

521
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,575
how about a open game?

522
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:45,000
Right.

523
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,100
Open competition is great!

524
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,750
After all,

525
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,875
it's to challenge the first place in district.

526
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,275
It's burning up.

527
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,800
Right. Right.

528
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,600
What? Are you being afraid?

529
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,000
Why should I be afraid?

530
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,300
If I lose, then lose.

531
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,275
I am not embarrassed.

532
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:02,875
Nice words!

533
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,000
I bet on Qiu Ying.

534
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,050
No.

535
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,300
I think Ya Tou will win.

536
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,975
Not possible.

537
00:26:21,675 --> 00:26:22,200
How about this?

538
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,850
I bet with you.

539
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,175
If Ya You lose,

540
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,100
I buy you one month of ZiHaiGuo。

541
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:28,450
Any flavor I want?

542
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:30,650
Any flavour. That's a deal.

543
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:33,525
Qiu Ying.

544
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,675
You have to try hard.

545
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:35,550
All my meals this month

546
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,275
are on you.

547
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:38,650
Don’t worry.

548
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,425
Brother Summer.

549
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,425
Why there is no one here at MengLvRen?

550
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:05,625
I don't know.

551
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,550
Take a look.

552
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,825
Play open game?

553
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,900
Brave!

554
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:29,825
First blood.

555
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,325
What's happening?

556
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:37,050
The first place in district challenged Qiu Ying.

557
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,025
They are in a fight.

558
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,675
You little girlfriend is awesome!

559
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:42,800
Solo with number one in the district.

560
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,300
No.

561
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:49,250
I am her are just

562
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,775
normal friends.

563
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:52,800
Normal friends. Normal friends.

564
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,875
We all understand. Understand.

565
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,300
Normal friends, so you teach her in person.

566
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,300
She wants to be a commentator.

567
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,775
That's why she is here for studying.

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,300
This girl is pretty nice.

569
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:04,900
She can rely on her beauty,

570
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,150
but she lives on talents. 

571
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:08,650
Later on,

572
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,400
if there is anything like this,

573
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,250
just tell me.

574
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,150
Don't try that hard.

575
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,100
I am just afraid to break

576
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,225
your MengLvRen's rules.

577
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,125
Relax.

578
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,425
Even she loses,

579
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,000
I will give her an opportunity.

580
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,125
Don't worry.

581
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,900
She definitely will win.

582
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:42,950
Residual blood. Go home. Don't wondering around.

583
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,200
Destroy the inhibitor.

584
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,550
Qiu Ying. Don't go home.

585
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,200
Destroy the inhibitor.

586
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:49,050
What are you doing?

587
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,950
Destroy the inhibitor!

588
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,075
Victory.

589
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,600
Xiangkong.

590
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,875
I finally become number one in the district.

591
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,450
Congratulation. Thanks!

592
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,325
Pei Xi.

593
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,750
Right now, do I have the qualification

594
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:22,075
to work at here?

595
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,350
You want to become number one in the district,

596
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,700
just want to 

597
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:25,675
be a waitress at here?

598
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:26,650
Right.

599
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,800
Not only because of this.

600
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,800
Then what you wanna do?

601
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,300
I want to be a commentator.

602
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,925
I worked at MengLvRen,

603
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,325
having all your masters

604
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,425
to teach me professional knowledge.

605
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,850
Also, during the time of becoming first place in district,

606
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,350
I have deeper understanding on IConquer.

607
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,125
It's not easy to become a commentator.

608
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:48,250
Everything starts from nothing.

609
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,750
I will take my steps up.

610
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:51,800
That's right.

611
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,500
She has a wonderful idea.

612
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,300
Why do you throw cold water on her?

613
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:58,375
Right.

614
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Let me introduce.

615
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:00,925
The boss of MengLvRen,

616
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:01,825
Brother Summer.

617
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,250
I know. I know.

618
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,875
You are

619
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,450
one of the five ancient masters.

620
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,275
The best support of the Pioneer.

621
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:09,350
ID name is Summer.

622
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:10,725
So after retiring,

623
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,075
people kindly call you brother Summer.

624
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:14,700
Your compliments are making me shy.

625
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,156
Nice preparation works.

626
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:18,756
Definitely.

627
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,550
Hello boss!

628
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,050
Call him boss so soon.

629
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,350
He didn't say if he want you yet.

630
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,925
I didn't say I am not hiring her.

631
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,800
Right.

632
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,375
Congratulation.

633
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,800
Welcome to join our MengLvRen.

634
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,875
Thanks boss!

635
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,375
Then, can I 

636
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,800
process the entry procedure right now?

637
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,475
Sure.

638
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:35,550
Just follow me now.

639
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,950
You two stay here for a talk. Let's go!

640
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,075
Do you really like her?

641
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,150
What?

642
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,350
Do you really like Qiu Ying?

643
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,800
How's that your business?

644
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,050
It's better to stay away from her.

645
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,875
Do you like her?

646
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:04,550
I heard you join VNG?

647
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,775
You say, what a coincidence.

648
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,800
After all these,

649
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,575
my old team

650
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:15,775
becomes your new team.

651
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:17,325
But your old team

652
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,925
becomes my new team.

653
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:23,000
It seems like we are destined to be competitors.

654
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:25,175
That's also a good thing.

655
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,775
I am not as kind as you do.

656
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:40,825
Xiangkong.

657
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,600
I finally become the official worker at MengLvRen.

658
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,425
Good for you.

659
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:47,475
Find a job.

660
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,150
Then you have to buy me dinner.

661
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:50,425
Sure do!

662
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,400
How about

663
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:54,050
MengLvRen's strawberry cake?

664
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,875
How about that?

665
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,300
Wait. What? What to eat?

666
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,750
Two pieces of strawberry cake.

667
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,600
Two pieces?

668
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:02,625
No.

669
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,850
Why are you even stinger than Lin Yixuan?

670
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,900
Never mind.

671
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,100
I also found a job.

672
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,325
The dinner is on me.

673
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:12,175
Yes!

674
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,550
Thanks.

675
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,825
I didn't expect.

676
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:24,825
At MengLvRen,

677
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,500
in such short time,

678
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,750
you become the number one in district.

679
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:28,775
It's almost

680
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:29,900
The competition of the Star of Tomorrow.

681
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:31,100
I have to work hard.

682
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,775
Brother Summer often invite

683
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:33,750
a lot professionals in the area, 

684
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,225
including teacher Luo Tian,

685
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:36,125
to do commentary on games.

686
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,275
If I stay at MengLvRen,

687
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,400
I am perfectly justifiable to stay there and listen.

688
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,250
Right.

689
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,275
What's your new job?

690
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,950
I signed with VNG.

691
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,950
Really?

692
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
VNG.

693
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,475
That's one of the top four teams.

694
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,625
We must have a drink on this

695
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,200
to celebrate.

696
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,675
Waiter. Are you sure?

697
00:32:58,275 --> 00:32:58,975
You forget the last time?

698
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,600
Your capacity for liquor. You…

699
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,850
Waiter. Two beers!

700
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:03,475
Cheers!

701
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:07,850
Captain Ji. Your hot towel.

702
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:08,350
Thanks!

703
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,050
Why do you need a hot towel?

704
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,425
Aren't your hands hurting?

705
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,175
Here.

706
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,275
Your load of work

707
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,500
can catch our training load.

708
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:26,075
Later on, the training

709
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:27,400
does not exceed three hours.

710
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,150
You need to cherish yourself.

711
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:32,500
Another hand.

712
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,200
How do you feel?

713
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:36,925
Any better?

714
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,600
Much better.

715
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,725
I still have some plaster at my place.

716
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:42,450
I will bring them to you next time.

717
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,800
Thanks.

718
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:44,900
You are so welcome.

719
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,050
We are brothers.

720
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,600
After going to VNG,

721
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:51,950
I made a pledge

722
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,450
to win the champion.

723
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,700
You are the same.

724
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:55,825
After going to the Star of tomorrow,

725
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,250
don't lose, must win!

726
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,325
Don't forget the promise between us.

727
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:00,950
We are going to the final of IConquer together.

728
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,975
Fighting! Fighting!

729
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,175
It's already nine o'clock. How come she's not back yet?

730
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,175
Yiyi. I am back.

731
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,525
Where is she?

732
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,100
Why are you here?

733
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:35,425
Come here.

734
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:36,675
Stand up. Look who's talking!

735
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,500
What's the matter?

736
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:43,250
You made so many dishes.

737
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,775
Impressive!

738
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,075
To celebrate

739
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:47,175
you become the first place in district,

740
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,525
I prepare this from three o'clock in the afternoon.

741
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,750
You see what time is it right now?

742
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,200
You just come back home.

743
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,275
You don't tell me in advance.

744
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:58,250
I need to tell you first?

745
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,000
Such an important thing!

746
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,000
Which time we didn't celebrate together?

747
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:03,975
Alright.

748
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:04,825
Don't get angry.

749
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:05,700
Don't touch me.

750
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,875
I am sorry. Isn't that enough?

751
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
My little angel.

752
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,800
Are you going out for a date with Ji Xiangkong again?

753
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,625
Today is a special circumstance.

754
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:17,975
I just join MengLvRen.

755
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,525
He just join VNG.

756
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:20,600
A double blessing.

757
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,150
So we celebrate a little while.

758
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,650
Hiberdating.

759
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,400
Silent treatment. I am not speaking to you.

760
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,225
Master Lu.

761
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:31,575
Master Lu.

762
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,400
You said silent treatment.

763
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,050
Then we silence for ten minutes.

764
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,500
After ten minutes, could you coming down please?

765
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,825
I am telling you.

766
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:38,725
I mean it sincerely.

767
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,400
Ok. Ok. You are sincere.

768
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,950
Fifteen minutes.

769
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,650
I will reheat the meal.

770
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:43,475
You have't eaten anything yet, right?

771
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,400
I eat another meal with you.

772
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,800
That's a deal.

773
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,975
Reheat the meal.

774
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,025
End of the silent treatment?

775
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:08,075
Not yet.

776
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:11,175
Come here quickly.

777
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,200
What's wrong?

778
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,725
Take a look by yourself.

779
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:24,575
-Ji Xiangkong ride on Shu Wen's coattails, being the new captain of VNG.

780
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,150
Do you remember

781
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:28,250
that time we went to VNG?

782
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,425
They are being really intimate, right?

783
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,400
I felt something wrong immediately at that time.

784
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,300
I want to go back and take a look.

785
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,125
You stopped me.

786
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,150
Don't let me go back.

787
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,450
If they two

788
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,525
go together,

789
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,875
They can help each other at work.

790
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,700
That's also a nice thing.

791
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,275
Don't pretend in front of me.

792
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:51,150
Then, what's your position?

793
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,175
Don't tell me,

794
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:53,975
Right now, you

795
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,775
still regard him as a normal friend.

796
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:36,775
Why are you staring at me?

797
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,800
Do you also want to know

798
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,900
the relationship between he and Shu Wen?

799
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,425
No matter what relationship they have,

800
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,575
is none of your business.

801
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,650
You can't sleep all night.

802
00:37:58,675 --> 00:37:59,325
Why?

803
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:07,850
But I just want to know.

804
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,675
Seeing him dating someone else,

805
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,225
I don't feel well inside.

806
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,150
Even you know the truth, what can you do?

807
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:20,250
Ji Xiangkong

808
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,900
regards you as his brother.

809
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,500
Punish you to stand!

810
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,425
Good night, Jiang Jiang.

811
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:46,975
Brother Qi.

812
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,250
Don't be angry.

813
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,350
Tong We.

814
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,425
I am sorry. Brother Qi.

815
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,750
Sorry about that. 

816
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,175
Are you stupid?

817
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:04,873
Sorry.

818
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:05,950
Can you be more stupid?

819
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,875
I am sorry, brother Qi. What are you doing?

820
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:16,150
Brother Qi.

821
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:17,600
You say,

822
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,875
is there really something between sister Wen

823
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,025
and Ji Xiangkong?

824
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,775
She offended two big sponsors for Ji Xiangkong.

825
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,800
What are you talking about?

826
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:28,750
People talk nonsense outsides.

827
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,325
You also follow them.

828
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:31,525
My master will not be cuckolded.

829
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,600
I am telling you guys.

830
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,700
If I, Qiu Yue, stay here for one day,

831
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,775
I will not let Ji Xiangkong stay well.

832
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:36,875
From now on,

833
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,575
we need to stand on one side.

834
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,025
Let's see what he can do.

835
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Lu Sheng, I am talking.

836
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:43,800
Do you hear me?

837
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:45,375
I heard.

838
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:49,125
As long as we four stand against him,

839
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,075
Let's see how he can be the captain.

840
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,700
Definitely.

841
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,750
We will do whatever brother Qi says.

842
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:55,875
Tong Wu.

843
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:58,375
I listen to brother Qi.

844
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,100
Whatever.

845
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,700
It's up to you. I am good anyway.
