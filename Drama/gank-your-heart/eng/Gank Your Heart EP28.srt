1
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,725
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:38,350
Episode Twenty-Eight.

3
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,075
Thanks for taking me here

4
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,100
to eat such delicious food.

5
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,200
Then,

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,100
what's the surprise you gonna give me?

7
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:01,400
No rush.

8
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:02,725
You will know soon.

9
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,950
Mr. Ji. Your cake.

10
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,100
Why there is a cake?

11
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,475
You cut this.

12
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,250
Then, we cut together.

13
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:05,775
Last time,

14
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:07,775
I waited here for you till it closed.

15
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:11,600
Fortunately，

16
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,100
you are here now.

17
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,150
I almost missed you

18
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,450
Hello everyone.

19
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,525
I am Miya.

20
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:07,900
A lot of things happened recently.

21
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,525
I know people are very curious

22
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,500
about my relationship.

23
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:13,850
I think

24
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,700
everyone in his or her life

25
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,550
should have it at least once

26
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,275
forget yourself for someone.

27
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,425
Don't ask for a result.

28
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,575
Don't ask for company.

29
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,575
Don't ask to have him.

30
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,625
Don't even ask you to love me.

31
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,775
I want to say to that man.

32
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,950
You've been wiht me through

33
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,050
the darkest days of my life.

34
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,000
But when you need company the most,

35
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,150
I was absent.

36
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:51,625
You have a new relationship now.

37
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,075
Best wishes to you

38
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,500
Beyond the Sky

39
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:57,825
is written for you.

40
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,275
Today

41
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,550
I sing to you for the last time.

42
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,075
The monsoon blows to the sea.

43
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,400
Beyond the sky.

44
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,475
You think birds

45
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,600
Didn't expect that

46
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,625
Miya will bless us.

47
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,475
And one day,

48
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,450
Chairman Guo.

49
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,325
This is the quarterly report of this season.

50
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,750
Originally, after this season,

51
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,300
the organization committee will have further cooperate with us.

52
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,875
Here we go.

53
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,275
There's a tactical leak scandal.

54
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,850
The committee is very dissatisfied with us.

55
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,600
I think,

56
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,125
while the season break,

57
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,100
we also need to clean up the inside.

58
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:01,675
Yes.

59
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,900
There's such a big accident.

60
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,750
It's my responsibility.

61
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,400
Luo Tian.

62
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,800
You don't have to take everything

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,275
as your responsibility.

64
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,175
This is all

65
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,300
the problem of Qiu Ying.

66
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,525
She already affected

67
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,550
the reputation of GDP.

68
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:18,825
She can't stay here any longer.

69
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,925
Chairman Guo.

70
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,825
What you mean is to fire Qiu Ying?

71
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,425
But the thing is still under investigation.

72
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,325
Even there's no real evidence,

73
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:27,775
it’s almost certain that she did this.

74
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,100
I saw all her dedication and effort.

75
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,775
Before we figure out the truth,

76
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:34,650
I don't allow

77
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,775
you to fire Qiu Yang like this.

78
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,675
Luo Tian. You…

79
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,825
If you insist on firing her.

80
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,050
Then please fire me first.

81
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,475
Do you have any idea that

82
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,800
the rumour about you and Qiu Ying

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
is spreading around.

84
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:46,375
If what you said

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,475
is heard by the committee,

86
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,050
how they gonna think of you?

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
An innocent man proves himself.

88
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:52,925
Whatever they think.

89
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:53,950
Can't you

90
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,075
think for your own reputation?

91
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,950
Compared to her career,

92
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,950
my reputation is nothing.

93
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:15,700
Not bad.

94
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:17,525
In all the e-sports professionals,

95
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,775
you are the one who can make the best coffee.

96
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,050
I invite you here today,

97
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,850
not for the coffee

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,800
You want to ask me again

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,725
which team I'm going to?

100
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,650
later on,

101
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,125
what's your plan?

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,700
Idea.

103
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,200
There is one.

104
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:37,425
The network administer here

105
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:38,475
should have high salary, right?

106
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,175
MengLvRen’s network administer,

107
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,750
you can't do it.

108
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:45,800
Right.

109
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,125
I forgot to congratulate you

110
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,750
for winning the fall championship

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,525
and the ticket to the world final.

112
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:52,925
Can China win the championship again,

113
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,100
it's all depends on the Legend.

114
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,150
You and I all know.

115
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,100
The state of Legend right now

116
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,025
is impossible to win the championship.

117
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,575
There's half a year left.

118
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,775
If there's a breakthrough on tactics.

119
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,250
It's not necessarily hopeless.

120
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,750
What they need is you.

121
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,075
Qiu Ying told me before.

122
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,950
You went to Legend because of me.

123
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,650
Yes.

124
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,450
But I come,

125
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,575
you left.

126
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:23,500
Later on,

127
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,225
What's your real plan?

128
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,825
I haven't figured out yet.

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Anyway, next season,

130
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,375
No matter where you are,

131
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,625
I'll follow you.

132
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,450
Wait. Pei Xi.

133
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,825
You must be kidding me.

134
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,750
I mean it

135
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:39,825
all the time.

136
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,550
I don't care who is the captain.

137
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,625
My dream is to be the world champion.

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,825
And your tactics

139
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:47,950
and my skills

140
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:50,025
can make this dream come true.

141
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:51,875
So

142
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,075
I want you

143
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,125
to be my teammate.

144
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:56,800
No matter where you are going,

145
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,125
I will follow.

146
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,925
Thank you for thinking highly of me.

147
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,150
But with my current situation,

148
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,150
which team

149
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,150
will accept me?

150
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,200
No team wants you,

151
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,875
then you can build your own team.

152
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,000
Please.

153
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,975
Building a team is not a game.

154
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:21,575
Even if I build a team,

155
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,100
I can't afford your high price.

156
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,725
Thank you for your coffee

157
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,250
I will come back to compete with you someday.

158
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,500
My previous dream

159
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,950
is to win the championship second time.

160
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
But now my dream

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,075
is to see you guys win.

162
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,575
But the perfect team,

163
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,175
I'm sure that

164
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,975
I'll find it one day

165
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,475
No team wants you,

166
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,100
then you can build your own team.

167
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:30,800
My brother Sun.

168
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,200
Worry about what?

169
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:33,925
No team has

170
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,050
contacted my brother Kong yet.

171
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,100
What should we do？

172
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,125
Did he never tell you

173
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,125
what he is going to do?

174
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,925
No.

175
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,050
You don't ask him either.

176
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,725
Why don't you ask him yourself?

177
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,675
I'm afraid to stimulate him。

178
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,050
Then you have to wait for him

179
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,950
to figure it out by himself.

180
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,625
Then he will tell us.

181
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,575
Right?

182
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,175
When my brother left the Legend,

183
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,300
you were too worried to fall asleep.

184
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,875
Now you behave like nothing is going on.

185
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Because Xiangkong understands clearly that

186
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,500
there's only one way in front of him.

187
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,831
And it's harder than ever.

188
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,325
Which way?

189
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:05,700
When he comes,

190
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,575
you ask him yourself.

191
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,025
They're coming.

192
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,025
I'll pick them up. OK.

193
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:13,875
Qiu Ying. Qiu Ying.

194
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,500
Come here quickly.

195
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,525
Yiyi.

196
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,300
Why haven't you went upstairs?

197
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,075
Neither of you are here.

198
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,975
I go upstairs by myself

199
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,175
is embarrassing.

200
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,100
The great reporter Lu.

201
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,850
Hey. Hey. Hey.

202
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,450
I don't care if you two

203
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
behave lovey-dovey at home.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,775
But don't show in front of

205
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,550
a hopeless single like me.

206
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,200
Love needs to be shown out.

207
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,900
Kiss me.

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Didn't see. Didn't see.

209
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,125
Didn't see.

210
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,925
I say brother Kong,

211
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,500
you used to

212
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,900
hate others show their love.

213
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,000
The man in love

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,750
changes without a word.

215
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,425
That's right.

216
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:44,875
Don't touch me.

217
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:45,975
Stay away from me.

218
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:48,625
Are you jealous?

219
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,600
Yes. Xuan.

220
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:51,775
You need to hurry up.

221
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,550
Or the good girl is running away with other man.

222
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,875
Who are you running away with?

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,650
What running away?

224
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,375
You.

225
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,700
You don't make fun of me.

226
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,900
Qiu Ying. Let's go.

227
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,125
So annoying. Really.

228
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,125
Nice to meet you, big brother Sun.

229
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,075
I'm Lu Yiyi.

230
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:05,925
I have heard of your name for a long time。

231
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,050
Last time, we meet in a rush.

232
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,975
It's my pleasure to meet you.

233
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:09,125
Come here then think this is your home.

234
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,175
Eat well and drink well.

235
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,475
Help yourself. Sure.

236
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,075
Don’t worry.

237
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:12,800
I will not be restricted.

238
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,650
Eat and drink everything you want.

239
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,575
Think here as your our place. Brother Sun said this.

240
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,725
I say, you kid

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,700
won the championship.

242
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,950
Don’t remember to invite me to a meal.

243
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm…

244
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,450
I'm afraid that you're sad,

245
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,825
so I don't dare to show off.

246
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:29,550
You even blame me.

247
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,575
Crying.

248
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:32,400
Why have you became a drama queen?

249
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,825
I learn from her.

250
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,300
What are you talking?

251
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,375
Okay. Okay.

252
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,475
Congratulations on getting

253
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,200
the ticket to the world final.

254
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Make sure to get the championship.

255
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,450
I will try my best. Fighting.

256
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,425
Be sure to try hard.

257
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,375
Teach that Jeffrey

258
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,425
a lesson.

259
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,350
But this year, teams from Europe and American area

260
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,725
and South Korea area,

261
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,550
are very strong.

262
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,775
If Legend

263
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,825
doesn't make some

264
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:54,825
tactical breakthroughs,

265
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,875
it's hard to go far

266
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,000
Even if

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,775
Legend can make to the final this year,

268
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,125
I'm sure we can't win the championship.

269
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,400
If VNG is not in trouble,

270
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,575
brother Kong is sure

271
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:07,450
to beat Jeffrey.

272
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,175
Tactical leak

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,250
is just the last straw

274
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,725
to break the camel.

275
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,525
The difference between Li Gan’s and Shu Wen’s ideas

276
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,400
is the most lethal part.

277
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,525
Don't be so upset.

278
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,925
I believe

279
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:26,925
the IConquer of China

280
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,625
is not going to stop.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,350
It sooner or later

282
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,650
will has a perfect team.

283
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,250
That must be. Here.

284
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,675
Come. Cheers. Cheers.

285
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,175
Right.

286
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:42,900
How’s the investigation

287
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,925
on tactical leak going?

288
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:44,950
Still investigating.

289
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:48,425
How long do you still need

290
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:49,275
take the blame?

291
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,050
Yeah.

292
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,225
Can't let that Qiao Xin

293
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,025
take advantage freely.

294
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,350
When I interviewed Can today.

295
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,175
The look on Qiao Xin’s face.

296
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:58,850
I get so angry.

297
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,775
Too much.

298
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,475
Brother Sun.

299
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,750
Isn’t Luo Tian really familiar with

300
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,550
the people in the committee?

301
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:07,525
What's the matter?

302
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,875
Say something for her.

303
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,800
Help Qiu Ying.

304
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:11,850
No need. No need.

305
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,525
The teacher has helped me a lot.

306
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:14,725
Don’t worry.

307
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,075
I will handle this.

308
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,225
Alright.

309
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,200
We're all hungry.

310
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:18,775
Let's eat.

311
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,175
Eat.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
Ji Xiangkong.

313
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,150
Later on,

314
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,525
what's you plan?

315
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,450
How's that your business?

316
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,525
Watch your mouth.

317
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,550
What's your plan next, brother Kong?

318
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,100
Haven't figured it out yet.

319
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,400
Haven't figured it out yet.

320
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,950
What do you mean you haven't figured it out yet?

321
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,650
Yiyi.

322
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,650
Why are you holding me back?

323
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,800
If he isn't your boyfriend,

324
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,325
I don't care about this at all.

325
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,675
Ji Xiangkong.

326
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:52,825
Are you

327
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,175
really going to

328
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,900
stay at brother Sun’s place forever?

329
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,075
Just being a network administer?

330
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,400
What are you talking about?

331
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,250
What?

332
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,200
I mean, this is impossible.

333
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,175
Brother Sun told me today that

334
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,550
my brother Kong is

335
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,350
thinking about a way.

336
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:08,975
But this road

337
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,575
is harder to walk than ever.

338
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,850
Is it, brother sun?

339
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,100
Then you tell me,

340
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,050
which way?

341
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,100
Say, Say it.

342
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,225
Which way, brother Kong?

343
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,750
Phoenix bath fire,

344
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,400
Nirvana rebirth.

345
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:32,850
I'm going to terminate my contract with the legend.

346
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,550
Are you sick?

347
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,400
You are not having a fever.

348
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm serious.

349
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,900
What serious?

350
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,100
What's the benefit of terminating your contract?

351
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,475
You don't want the qualification to enter world final?

352
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:47,825
The world final.

353
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,875
I will win with Ji Xiangkong.

354
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,400
What else did you dream about?

355
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,825
Which team dares to

356
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,825
accept ji Xiangkong?

357
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:55,850
He'll build his own team.

358
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:58,900
He told you that?

359
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,025
No.

360
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:00,775
He didn't say.

361
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:01,525
Then how do you know

362
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,725
he want to build a team?

363
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,975
I just know.

364
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,275
I know him.

365
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,750
My little brother.

366
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:10,625
It's not easy to build a team up.

367
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,100
Take ten thousands steps back,

368
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,700
even the team is built,

369
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,000
can you make sure that

370
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,625
it will enter the world final?

371
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,625
It must can.

372
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,825
I don't understand you right now.

373
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,025
You're the rival of Ji Xiangkong.

374
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,625
Right now, you chase after him crazily.

375
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,700
What do you want?

376
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I just admire him.

377
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,925
You know that

378
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,986
I joined the Legend for him at that time.

379
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,650
Do you have the money to pay contractual penalty？

380
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,300
I don’t have,

381
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,100
but you do.

382
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:41,875
Get out.

383
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,275
Get out. Get out. Get out.

384
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,650
How can I have a brother like you?

385
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,450
Tomorrow,

386
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,825
I'll talk with Chairman Guo to resign.

387
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:13,575
Why?

388
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,075
I don't want to cause

389
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:19,350
more troubles to teacher Luo Tian.

390
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,900
Since MengLvren,

391
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,225
I haven't had a good sleep.

392
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,500
Now I can finally

393
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,875
take a rest.

394
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:37,625
I miss the feeling of

395
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,425
waking up naturally.

396
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,325
I can't help you with anything.

398
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,250
As long as you stay with me,

399
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,825
I will go back

400
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,350
to the commentary stage one day.

401
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,800
I didn't forget

402
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,900
the deal between us.

403
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,075
Qiu Ying.

404
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,000
If I really,

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,150
like what Lu Yiyi said,

406
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,450
become a network administer at the net bar,

407
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:10,625
will you look down on me?

408
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,925
I will.

409
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,500
I am not looking down on your choice,

410
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,275
but looking down because

411
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,825
you don't respect your heart.

412
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,325
If you have a decision in your heart,

413
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,300
just be brave enough to do it

414
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,400
But if it fails,

415
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,750
I will lose evrything.

416
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,050
Like brother Sun said,

417
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,600
Phoenix bath fire,

418
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,525
Nirvana rebirth.

419
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:44,825
Even you break your bones,

420
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,700
I'm sure

421
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,025
you'll stand up again.

422
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,200
No matter how hard this road is,

423
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,400
I will stay with you,

424
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,375
accompany you.

425
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,675
Phoenix bath fire,

426
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,300
Nirvana rebirth.

427
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,725
How about using Phoenix

428
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,675
as the team name?

429
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,100
Phoenix?

430
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,850
Phoenix Nirvana

431
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,025
I think it's raelly good.

432
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:21,800
And

433
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,075
especially fit your current situation.

434
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,150
Or

435
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,900
we just use it.

436
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,925
Then our Phoenix team

437
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,175
lacks a team leader.

438
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,200
The great Qiu commentator.

439
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,675
Are you willing to do this?

440
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,325
You guess.

441
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,675
I heard your heartbeat says

442
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:42,125
you do.

443
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:22,850
Hello, everybody.

444
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,025
I'm the commentator Qiu Ying

445
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,900
Today, I am bringing you

446
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,325
the first competition of

447
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,450
the regular season of spring.

448
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,350
Why I can't feel

449
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,000
your passion for IConquer

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,100
from your commentary?

451
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:33,850
If I don't love IConquer,

452
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,325
I…I

453
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:36,975
I won’t stand in front of you.

454
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,250
Hello, everyone.

455
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,975
I am yout new friend, Qiu Ying.

456
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,700
Teacher Luo.

457
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,675
Why do you have to go?

458
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,375
You've helped me too much

459
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,150
I don't want to involve you in this anymore.

460
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:11,050
GDV can stand without me,

461
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,075
but not without you.

462
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,325
Qiu Ying.

463
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,550
I know you've been mistreated.

464
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,350
But they will find the truth eventually.

465
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,675
To stand on this commentary stage,

466
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,275
You’ve done so many things.

467
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,350
You just give up like this?

468
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,625
From the moment

469
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,050
I decided to be a commentator,

470
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:36,775
I think this as

471
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,175
a career of my life.

472
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,375
I think like that before

473
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,000
and now.

474
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,375
I love commentary

475
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,800
Even I leave GDV,

476
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,550
I'm not going to give up.

477
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,850
This is

478
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,525
a summary of this season.

479
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,300
Have you decided

480
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,150
to leave?

481
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,200
From MengLvRen to GDV,

482
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,775
you've been my guide all the time.

483
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:17,600
I hope you can continue

484
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,425
to give me advice later on.

485
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,600
One reanalysis video a week.

486
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:28,625
No problem.

487
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,450
Then.

488
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm leaving first.

489
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,300
I will take you.

490
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:35,150
No need.

491
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,450
Xiangkong is waiting for me downstairs.

492
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,925
Goodbye, teacher Luo.

493
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,025
Why you are late?

494
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,575
The team training base right now

495
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:55,625
is too difficult to find.

496
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,800
Later on, I'll check few more places.

497
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Find a cost-effective one.

498
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:03,950
Right.

499
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,075
But there is a good news.

500
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,675
Our combat uniform has been delivered.

501
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,550
I've seen it.

502
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,175
Really good.

503
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,025
Really?

504
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,225
You've helped a lot.

505
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,800
Our leader Qiu's work efficiency

506
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,500
Is really high.

507
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,525
That's for sure.

508
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,500
Take you to a good meal tonight.

509
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,975
OK.

510
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,800
Right.

511
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,725
The thing about us forming the team,

512
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,200
When are you going to tell Xuan?

513
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:26,800
I don't want to tell him now.

514
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,775
That's true.

515
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,925
Xuan is in Legend now.

516
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,575
He already entered

517
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,550
the world final.

518
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:37,500
There's no need to take the risk with us.

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,875
Start from beginning.

520
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,075
And I'm afraid if I tell him,

521
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:43,400
he will cry for joining us.

522
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:46,700
Yeah.

523
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,725
Right now, he is

524
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:48,750
the best support.

525
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:49,925
We can't afford

526
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,000
his price.

527
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:57,550
Then,

528
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,675
do we have new candidates now?

529
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,225
What game is this?

530
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,650
high level non-professional game.

531
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,675
Look at him.

532
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,425
The movement operation of the Creator

533
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:22,425
seems to be done by

534
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:23,750
a top professional player.

535
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,925
He is

536
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:26,700
the first person I'm looking for.

537
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:27,900
And this guy,

538
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:28,825
you also know him.

539
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:29,750
I know him?

540
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,425
Who is he?

541
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,375
Guess.

542
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:37,525
don' keep guessing.

543
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,775
You just tell me.

544
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,850
Looks like you're really silly.

545
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,325
I told you such an obvious clue already.

546
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,425
You still can't guess it out.

547
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,975
Think about it again.

548
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,250
The Creator.

549
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,200
Pei Xi's main champion

550
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,950
Is it…

551
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,150
Hi.

552
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,225
What's wrong?

553
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,575
Do you feel disappointing to see me?

554
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:34,750
Yes.

555
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:37,950
Wat?

556
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,250
Are you waiting for Ji Xiangkong?

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,700
Tell you something.

558
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:44,475
I've already asked.

559
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,425
I asked Luo Tian, brother Sun,

560
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:47,250
and Shu Wen.

561
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,225
They all said they didn't hear

562
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,450
Ji Xiangkong want to build his own team.

563
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,625
So

564
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,575
your judgment is wrong.

565
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,150
Ji Xiangkong

566
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,300
won't build his own team.

567
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Can you give up on this?

568
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,800
I've already discussed

569
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,775
with Chairman Jin.

570
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:02,425
Officially rescind the contract tomorrow morning.

571
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,100
Remember to

572
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:05,775
prepare the money.

573
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:10,800
You're really my ancestor.

574
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:13,275
Don't want to drink.

575
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,375
Cool. Xiangkong.

576
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,575
Finally set up yuor own team.

577
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,175
Phoenix is a good name.

578
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,775
Of course.

579
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,525
Brother Sun.

580
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,775
You give me this inspiration.

581
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,300
Phoenix bath fire,

582
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,275
Nirvana rebirth.

583
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,000
So it is called the Phoenix.

584
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,325
Then if you win the championship later on,

585
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:49,875
do I have some credit for this?

586
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,400
There must be.

587
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,800
And

588
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,825
we want you to wear this.

589
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,775
Be the first member

590
00:27:58,775 --> 00:27:59,800
of our Phoenix team.

591
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,525
You must be kidding me

592
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Brother Sun.

593
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,775
I'm not kidding you.

594
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:13,075
But

595
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,650
you don't have to refuse me so quickly.

596
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:16,900
Ask yourself.

597
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,250
You really don't want to go back

598
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:21,250
and try one more time?

599
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm the oldest

600
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:25,100
in the Pioneer.

601
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
Even Gu Fang,

602
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,575
who always plays on the front line,

603
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:28,700
is retired.

604
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,950
Besides,

605
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,600
I haven't attended the competition for five or six years.

606
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,075
What?

607
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,325
Is this you?

608
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,250
Brother Sun.

609
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,325
You are not over the hill yet.

610
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,750
Your APM and consciousness

611
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,925
are always there。

612
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,925
And

613
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,075
it's no worse than Gu Fang

614
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,025
three years ago.

615
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,775
You can totally go back to the game.

616
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,125
Yeah, brother Sun.

617
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,850
And we really need you right now.

618
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,275
It's just a non-professional game.

619
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,675
It's not like a formal game.

620
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:11,825
This is not a person like me,

621
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:13,350
who haven't played formal for years,

622
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,975
can get used to.

623
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,950
Besides,

624
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,975
what's your goal in this game?

625
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:19,000
It's the global championship.

626
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,000
It's not the non-professional game.

627
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,050
But brother Sun…

628
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,425
Qiu Ying.

629
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,025
You're the team leader.

630
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:27,250
You should know very well

631
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,275
how hard it is to set up a team.

632
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:31,300
The heyday of a professional player is over,

633
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,000
Then it is over.

634
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,175
Why do you two

635
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,625
have confidence in me?

636
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:38,150
No. Brother Sun.

637
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,825
You really don't want to

638
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,500
get the trophy back.

639
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:52,650
You both leave.

640
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,950
Don't waste time on me.

641
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,950
Don’t risk the future of the team

642
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:58,125
to win a possibility.

643
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,850
Why brother Sun is angry?

644
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:16,550
Maybe because of the game that year,

645
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,575
brother Sun still hurts inside.

646
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:45,800
Come. Come.

647
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,400
Fight. Fight . Fight.

648
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,675
Walk. Walk. Walk.

649
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:50,825
Go. Go. Go.

650
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,425
Come. Come. Come.

651
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,200
Summer buyback.

652
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,125
I bought it.

653
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,250
You take this.

654
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,850
Almost there. Almost there.

655
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,775
Coming.

656
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Champion trophey.

657
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,350
We're coming.

658
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,450
Why Pei Xi is not here today?

659
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,075
He is a precious gold.

660
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,475
He don’t need training.

661
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:21,825
Just hurry up

662
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,425
Behave like a human-being.

663
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,450
Come on. Brother Yao. Run.

664
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,950
Fighting! Don’t pull me.

665
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,675
I am leaving.

666
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,475
Should I say goodbye?

667
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:36,100
They don't care if I leave or not, right?

668
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,050
Then goodbye.

669
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,275
What's going on?

670
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,050
Goodbye?

671
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:11,525
Goodbye.

672
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:12,525
What goodbye?

673
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,075
Pei Xi sent this in the group chat.

674
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:14,900
He sent a WeChat message

675
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,450
without explanation.

676
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,200
What does he mean?

677
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,100
What does he mean?

678
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,750
Today morning, I heard that he

679
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,675
broke the contract with the team.

680
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,750
Is it true?

681
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:24,675
He is leaving?

682
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,225
Let's go back.

683
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,625
Anyone here?

684
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:10,875
No one is here.

685
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,075
Not here.

686
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:13,075
Not in the dorm.

687
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:14,025
You say where he could be？

688
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,575
He should at least tell us directly.

689
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,525
I don't know what's in his head.

690
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,775
Pei Xi, this guy,

691
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:28,700
is actually a good person.

692
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,400
Sometimes he is a little arrogant.

693
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:35,450
When he drove

694
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,650
Zhao Yang out for us,

695
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,200
I really think he is so justice.

696
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,275
Then why you keep talking about him?

697
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,500
You also have some problem.

698
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,375
Don't cooperate with him.

699
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:46,825
After all, he is the captain.

700
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,925
Sometimes when you think it over.

701
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,375
The man is leaving.

702
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,175
I feel reluctant to see him leave.

703
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:09,350
I forget to take my combat suit.

704
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,200
I

705
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,325
also forget to say goodbye.

706
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:28,925
Thank you very much.

707
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,175
Thank you.

708
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:41,625
I'm sorry.

709
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,675
Captain.

710
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,500
Thanks.

711
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,650
I learnt a lot from you.

712
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,625
We won't forget you.

713
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,925
Yi Xuan.

714
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,525
Come on.

715
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,650
Captain.

716
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:09,800
Don't forget

717
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,725
you've once had

718
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,675
us as your teammates.

719
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,250
Legend always welcomes you back.

720
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,675
Fighting.

721
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Fighting.

722
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:29,350
I'm leaving first.

723
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,900
Hey.

724
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,600
What happened before,

725
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,550
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,500
Goodbye.

727
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:12,825
Captain.

728
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,400
See you at the game.

729
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,650
This one doesn’t work?

730
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,700
You're not satisfied with this either?

731
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,075
You're not satisfied with all these people?

732
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,400
These players,

733
00:38:16,825 --> 00:38:17,625
no matter capability,

734
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,075
experience,

735
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:18,900
or quality，

736
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:20,325
at most

737
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,700
can survive till the preliminary.

738
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,275
Wait for them to mature,

739
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,275
we need at least two years.

740
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,150
Then what can we do?

741
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:32,600
Or

742
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,750
we find a way

743
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,675
to convince brother Sun join us.

744
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:39,600
I think,

745
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,675
at present,

746
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:42,050
only one man

747
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,125
can convince him.

748
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:47,975
You are talking about sister Wen?

749
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:50,825
Let's go.

750
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:51,625
We meet sister Wen now.

751
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:52,450
Wrong.

752
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:53,950
We should find Brother Summer first.

753
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,850
Brother summer?

754
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,050
Why?

755
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,375
The reason why sister Wen doesn’t forgive brother Sun

756
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,900
is because that year,

757
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,050
before they went to Vancouver,

758
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,675
brother Sun left the team

759
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,475
for no reason.

760
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,075
For no reason?

761
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,150
Wait.

762
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,025
He left not because he need to

763
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,125
take care of his family?

764
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:15,650
I think

765
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,500
That is just an excuse.

766
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,725
There must be something

767
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,925
inside that no one knows.

768
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,675
Brother Summer must know.

769
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,275
Hero in women.

770
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:37,825
Don't think I don't know.

771
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:38,675
You are being gentle.

772
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,725
Don’t say out if you see.

773
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:44,250
I just want you to come out

774
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,300
and relax.

775
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,300
Actaully, after leaving VNG,

776
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,700
I feel more comfortable.

777
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,950
The achievement you get after so many years of hard work.

778
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,525
You don’t feel pity？

779
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:02,275
What should I feel pity about?

780
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,750
Different minds pursue different goals.

781
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:06,650
I should've known that.

782
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,125
Then,

783
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,650
you and Li Gan,

784
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,875
what’s the situation right now?

785
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,250
I hope he can find

786
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:14,425
the right person.

787
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:17,250
Do you have any plans in the future?

788
00:40:17,975 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm going to Singapore

789
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:20,600
Exchange study for a period of time.

790
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,400
Think it as a way to charge myself.

791
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,225
Did you ever think about

792
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:26,375
talking with brother Sun?

793
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,050
After all, both of you…

794
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,250
Alright.

795
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,500
We talk or not. It's the same.

796
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,525
I just want to change an environment now.

797
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:33,775
Start form the beginning.

798
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:38,275
You

799
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,250
can't get rid of

800
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,475
your gossip trait, aren't you?

801
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,275
I'm not gossiping.

802
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,625
I mean it.

803
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,050
You and big brother are so pity.

804
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,000
Stop it.

805
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,350
One more game.

806
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,824
I take it seriously. Don't give way to you.

807
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:54,025
Please don't.

808
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,450
You guys.

809
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,025
Are you looking for me?

810
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:10,625
No.

811
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,050
We are here for your cousin.

812
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,825
Pei Xi.

813
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,425
Where are you going?

814
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,250
I just determinate my contract with Legend.

815
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,250
You leave Legend?

816
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,775
We can

817
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,900
build new team now.

818
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,375
We?

819
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,700
This must be our combat suit.

820
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,500
Phoenix.

821
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:44,675
Interesting.

822
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:46,425
Wait.

823
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,350
Pei Xi. What do you mean?

824
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,600
I am joining you.

825
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,200
Really?

826
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:55,675
That's wonderful, Xiangkong!

827
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,150
Pei Xi.

828
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You are the most talented player

829
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,975
of the new generation in China.

830
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,800
You are also my most admired opponent.

831
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:05,300
But I'm sorry.

832
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:06,975
You're not the right one for Phoenix.

833
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,725
Are you refusing me?

834
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,775
Stay in Legend.

835
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,750
You've got

836
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,275
the ticket to the world final.

837
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,075
So you don't have to take the risk.

838
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:19,625
I’ve told you before.

839
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:21,075
My goal

840
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,725
is the world championship.

841
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:24,475
Stay in Legend.

842
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,425
Continue to play four guarantee one.

843
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:26,775
We can’t make this dream come true.

844
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,800
In that case,

845
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,400
I'd rather take the risk.

846
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,725
Right, Xiangkong.

847
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,900
Actually, Pei Xi is really good.

848
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,125
Or we just give it a shot.

849
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,775
What are you still hesitating.

850
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,325
Aren’t you gonna tell me that

851
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,550
you are not prepared for this?

852
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:54,875
It’s you the one who are not

853
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,250
prepared to join the team.

854
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,250
Others always says you can beat nine at once.

855
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Except for five opponents,

856
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,400
you also carry four

857
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,575
teammates who hold you back.

858
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,850
Your personal strength stands out.

859
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:04,875
But you didn't

860
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,025
cooperate well with your teammates.

861
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,225
What do you think?

862
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,700
I always

863
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,200
play on my own.

864
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:16,975
So,

865
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:18,950
that's why I'm looking for your to be my teammate.

866
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,075
I hope on the battlefield in the futur,

867
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:22,825
because of your tactics,

868
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,275
things will be different.

869
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,100
No matter what team you join,

870
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
You will get the same result.

871
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,325
Shouldn’t you

872
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,600
find your own problem first.

873
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,050
If you're born to be a player

874
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,175
who doesn't know how to cooperate.

875
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:36,925
Then any tactic given to you

876
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:38,450
will turn into four guarantee one.

877
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:39,450
You choose me,

878
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,000
the result will be the same.

879
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,150
Xiangkong.

880
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,100
Or let’s think it over.

881
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:49,650
Qiu Ying.

882
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:51,100
Don't forget.

883
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,375
What we want

884
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:53,550
is a perfect team.

885
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,075
Ji Xiangkong.

886
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,625
Besides me,

887
00:43:59,325 --> 00:44:01,075
you can't find a better candidate.

888
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:02,175
No matter who you find,

889
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,100
you need to adjust.

890
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,325
Why can't I?

891
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:06,700
Unless,

892
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,950
you can't control me.

893
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,825
Before questioning me,

894
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,950
let me see your determination first.

895
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,950
Even refuse my cousin.

896
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,325
Looks like Phoenix

897
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:25,900
is really

898
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,200
a marvellous team

899
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,875
Brother Summer.

900
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,750
Brother Summer, you're finally back.

901
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:32,950
I will not give up

902
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:39,525
Alright, don't look at him.

903
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:40,450
He always behave like that.

904
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,950
Let's talk in the office.

905
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,500
Brother Sun refused

906
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,600
to join Phoenix.

907
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:50,200
He said he had given up.

908
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,000
Don't want to fight anymore.

909
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,525
So I want to know,

910
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,700
before the world final that year,

911
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,575
what made him give up?

912
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,500
I didn't know about this

913
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,725
until Shu Wen’s birthday.

914
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,250
I,

915
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,525
Li Gan,

916
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:07,425
get

917
00:45:07,425 --> 00:45:08,325
the world championship.

918
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,075
That

919
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,675
was just a coincidence.

920
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,275
Every dog has his day.

921
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,825
She doesn't even know

922
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,550
how the three hundred thousand dollars to Canada came?

923
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:23,700
How did you get it?

924
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:24,850
How it came?

925
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,625
I used my house as security

926
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,000
to borrow the three hundred thousand dollars.

927
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,050
Didn't you say

928
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:36,975
that three hundred thousand dollars

929
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:38,825
was from a sponsor?

930
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,325
Brother

931
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:43,975
Are you stupid or am I stupid?

932
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,225
Who dare to give us?

933
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,425
Did big brother know this?

934
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,750
Big brother left

935
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:06,075
Because he knew

936
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:08,850
you mortgaged your house.

937
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:25,100
That year,

938
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,125
broher Sun left the team.

939
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,000
We all thought

940
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,025
was for things in his family.

941
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,375
Li Gan was originally

942
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,525
our alternative.

943
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,625
He brought three hundred thousand dollars of sponsorship.

944
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:36,975
So he naturally

945
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:38,495
became one of us

946
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,650
and won the championship.

947
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:42,350
But we didn't expect that…

948
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,625
Didn’t expect that

949
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,300
it was actually Li Gan

950
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:46,675
who used three hundred thousand dollars

951
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,275
to drive brother Sun away from the team

952
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,775
and away from sister Wen.

953
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,525
Li Gan really love Shu Wen.

954
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,175
At that time,

955
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:56,175
We all could see.

956
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,400
But Shu Wen and brother Sun

957
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,375
were already together.

958
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,275
But Li Gan,

959
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,000
in order to win the championship

960
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,325
and stay with Shu Wen.

961
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,050
So finally,

962
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,750
in order to fulfill your dreams,

963
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:14,800
brother Sun carried all these on his own.

964
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,225
He didn't explain to sister Wen.

965
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,025
Even for so many years,

966
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:22,425
hiding in the King

967
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,150
and keeping distance from you.

968
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:29,750
He should come back to the game.

969
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,625
We all owe him a championship.

970
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,875
So listen to me.

971
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,475
Shu Wen is leaving to Singapore tomorrow.

972
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,675
Both of you

973
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,700
find a way to keep her.

974
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,850
All the rest，

975
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,975
I and Pei Xi will take care of.

976
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,975
Thank you, brother Summer.
