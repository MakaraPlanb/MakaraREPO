1
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,128
I'd better not do that,would I?

2
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:54,748
No

3
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,887
He broke my necklace

4
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,208
He didn't apologize to me

5
00:01:58,697 --> 00:01:59,634
Why should I forgive him?

6
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,480
He talked all sorts of nonsense.

7
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,098
Why should I forgive him?

8
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,301
No

9
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:16,815
What are you looking at?

10
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,114
Let me guess

11
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,149
Are you here to ask me for something? 

12
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,753
Yeah, how was it?

13
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:27,717
If you don't come to me

14
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:28,389
I might think that necklace

15
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:29,783
is really important to you

16
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,147
But now I'm more sure

17
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:34,757
you're a showman

18
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,906
Xiangkong Ji

19
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,741
I don't care what you think of me 

20
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:42,687
But you said 

21
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,728
you could do anything Iwanted

22
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:48,061
Do you want to back out now?

23
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,834
I never go back on what I said

24
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:56,768
Okay, then you can 

25
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,194
play a double qualifying live with me

26
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:02,199
Is there nothing else to ask?

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,089
Is it as simple as double qualifying?

28
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,763
Ok, no problem

29
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,839
Xiangkong Ji

30
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,634
From when I was in vancouver until now

31
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:12,900
You've been teasing me

32
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,783
I wish you wouldn't tease me this time

33
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,546
After we had finished this double qualifying match

34
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:18,971
We don't owe each other

35
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:21,086
Be careful

36
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,445
Stop imitating Miya

37
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:04,890
There's something wrong with you

38
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,888
That's where the address should be.

39
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,041
Hello

40
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:39,190
Is this the Donggan esports magazine?

41
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:39,991
That's right

42
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,136
Are you here for an interview?

43
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:42,153
Yes,I am

44
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:44,060
Wait a moment

45
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,467
Handsome boy

46
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,623
You seem to have a lot of leisure here

47
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:56,193
Director Shi advocated an adle life

48
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,021
An idle life?

49
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:00,816
Come on, take you upstairs 

50
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,405
Handsome boy, handsome boy

51
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,027
Don't you need a job here?

52
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:17,340
No ,we do

53
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:18,646
Didn't I tell you?

54
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:20,232
Director Liu advocate an idle life

55
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,299
Let's go

56
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:35,979
Come on

57
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,149
Thank you, thank you

58
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:43,380
You are a top journalism graduate

59
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,390
and we went to school together

60
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,645
Hello,seniors!Hello! 

61
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:54,754
You worked at YouXing for two years

62
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:55,659
Yes

63
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,582
Do you know anything about professional esports?

64
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,416
To be honest

65
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,924
I switched to the Conquer section not long ago

66
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,725
I used to work in the lifestyle section

67
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,600
So

68
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,884
I don't know much about it

69
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,759
Just because I was in a hurry to get a job

70
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,113
I applied widely.

71
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,090
I didn't look too closely 

72
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,595
at your job requirements

73
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,422
I'm so sorry

74
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,514
I see! 

75
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,070
Our magazine 

76
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,511
is a professional esports magazine

77
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,876
In nearly a decade

78
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:29,869
It has experienced many challenges in the industry

79
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,470
Now it's going really well

80
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:32,945
In the last few years

81
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,587
Our industry is getting more and more attention

82
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,966
Therefore, we are in urgent need of 

83
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,736
recruiting some professionals 

84
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:39,786
who are specialized in collecting and editing

85
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:40,795
I see what you mean

86
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:43,662
Thank you for your time

87
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,663
I'm so sorry

88
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,041
Then I'll go

89
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:48,132
You're not bothering me

90
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,102
You'll be paied 

91
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:51,664
according to the job Posting

92
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,019
When do you think you can start job?

93
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,449
Director 

94
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,931
Do I get paid for working overtime?

95
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:07,980
If I go out for an interview

96
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:07,996
how do I arrange it?

97
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:08,701
how do I arrange it?

98
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,271
You don't have to work overtime

99
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:11,825
you don't have to go out and interview

100
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,612
All you have to do is 

101
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:16,429
 sort out the news from your peers

102
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,684
He really doesn't care 

103
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:23,952
Hi!

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,049
Hi, yiyi

105
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,981
How was your interview today?

106
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,143
I got a job in a nursing home

107
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,299
I'm kidding

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,413
I changed my job to a magazine 

109
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,713
that specializes in esports news

110
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,755
I'll cover all your news from now on

111
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,245
You have to buy me something delicious

112
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:42,014
I remeber something

113
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
How about you asking Xiangkong Ji for help?

114
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,020
He promised to double with me

115
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:48,558
He said yes?

116
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,122
Please enjoy your meal when the dishes are ready

117
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:58,474
OK

118
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,550
I heard about Xi Pei

119
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,724
Yang Zhao was clearly well prepared this time

120
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,231
And I see what chairman Jin means

121
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,555
If we can sign Xi Pei over

122
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,638
he's sure to make him captain

123
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:18,971
Xi Pei as China's first mid

124
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,180
 in the generation

125
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:21,422
has strong strength

126
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,631
If he comes to our team

127
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,410
I think he's more than a captain

128
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,972
Yang Zhao

129
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,211
can not accommodate Xiangkong

130
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,084
As a coach

131
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:35,559
I can't do anything about it this time

132
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:39,733
I understand that

133
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,999
I've heard chairman Jin mention one thing before

134
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:56,609
If I retire

135
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,507
He wanted me to leave esports forever

136
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,015
If I do that

137
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,723
My image will be bound to legend forever

138
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,740
I heard about it

139
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,616
But the board is not in a position 

140
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,833
to ask you to do that

141
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,384
Coach Luo

142
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,060
If I sign this agreement

143
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:18,948
Wait a minute

144
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:21,960
Do you want to use this agreement

145
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,947
 to make a deal with chairman Jin?

146
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,451
Then you must  think it over carefully ,Fang Gu

147
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,213
I think if you do it

148
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,047
it's too much for you

149
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:40,750
And what if you want to come back in the future?

150
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:49,007
I wouldn't have done it for something else

151
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,772
But because of Xiangkong,

152
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,798
I think it's worth it.

153
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,382
How about you? Are you ready?

154
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:13,527
Yes,I am

155
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,260
Why do you buy so many masks?

156
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,529
This facial mask is very popular on the Internet these days

157
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,716
I use it as a fan welfare

158
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:24,869
to boost my popularity

159
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:26,455
So generous?

160
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:28,568
I've never seen you so generous

161
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,268
What do you mean?

162
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,870
I've always been generous, okay?

163
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:32,495
OK,OK

164
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:34,361
I'll cheer you up by looking at the Ipad

165
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,242
OK

166
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:44,830
Hello, everyone

167
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,008
I am Ying Qiu

168
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,347
from the IConquer section of YouXing video company's

169
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:49,640
I have a surprise for you today

170
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,058
That is tomorrow 

171
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,922
I'll have a double qualifying with a super pro.

172
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,547
Let's guess who he is.

173
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:59,065
Perfect! She left the suspense and then she said

174
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,589
The one who guesses correctly will get a prize

175
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,723
The prize is YuniFang mask with YuniFang mask

176
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:05,870
It is also a magic weapon 

177
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,202
to keep my skin in good condition every time

178
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:09,846
Let's guess

179
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:21,947
Ying Qiu, Ying Qiu

180
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,063
Xin Qiao said she had an appointment 

181
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,286
with a top player for double qualifying

182
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,390
and she want to challenge you

183
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,290
It's hard to get rid of her

184
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,653
That's good.I accepted her challenge

185
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,509
I am not afraid of her

186
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,568
Come on  

187
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,508
This is probably the best data

188
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,808
we've ever had on the IConquer board

189
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:43,042
That's great 

190
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,727
 Who came up with the idea of double qualifying

191
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,660
I wanted to do this activity myself

192
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,403
Unexceptedly

193
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:52,150
you are interestedin participating in it

194
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,247
I heard you're under pressure to perform

195
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,576
If your show doesn't rank within a month

196
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,393
you're leaving the company

197
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,301
I also loathe to part with you

198
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,043
So as a senior

199
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:05,493
I have to help you

200
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,399
Yes, thanks to sister xin's help

201
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:10,329
My popularity went up

202
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,698
That's right

203
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:13,350
We help each other

204
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:14,057
don't we?

205
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,085
Who are the masterswho cooperate with you?

206
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,098
Masters are mysterious

207
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,722
If I say the name,it won't be mysterious

208
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,170
Yes,it should remain a my stery

209
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:26,463
It was such a great event

210
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,497
Will you hold more such activities 

211
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,575
in the future? 

212
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,125
Mr. Liu, can we ask the publicity department 

213
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,710
to put this activity on the homepage of the website

214
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,584
This will get more attention

215
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:36,583
This is a good idea

216
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,379
I should give you a good publicity

217
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:39,772
Thank you,manager Liu

218
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:40,929
Let's go get ready

219
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:41,815
OK

220
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,131
I'll wait and see

221
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,139
Manager Liu, see how we perform then!

222
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:56,785
Brother Yao

223
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:58,352
Have you found any problems 

224
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:00,064
with the matches of Xiaolong?

225
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:02,243
Tell me about it

226
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:05,566
View is not good

227
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,874
Jungle has been caught

228
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:08,340
He did not arrest anybody earlier

229
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,393
Captain,fox Zhao comes

230
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,095
Each ace

231
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,219
There's something I need to tell you

232
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,310
JiGuang video company

233
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:23,381
There's a reality show over there

234
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,326
You arrange foor a person to attend

235
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:26,750
Manager zhao

236
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,515
Didn't we make an appointment?

237
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,469
The new beta is only a few days away

238
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:31,613
We all have to train

239
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,081
 We're not doing any business these days

240
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:34,901
Xiangkong

241
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,832
If you don't participate in commercial activities

242
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,193
 Where do you get the operating expenses of the team?

243
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,863
 Isn't it?

244
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,547
Manager Zhao, operation is something you 

245
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:44,853
and chairman Jin are thinking about

246
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:46,384
Coach luo and I are only responsible

247
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,762
 for playing games and getting good results  

248
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:49,113
Besides

249
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,401
the win and loss of the new version of the test match 

250
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,229
determines whether I can become the captain

251
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:53,328
At this time

252
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:54,805
you arrange for us to participate in the reality show

253
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:56,093
Those who know will say that 

254
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,038
manager Z hao has devoted himself to the company

255
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,732
Don't know the people also think that 

256
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,659
manager zhao is not willing to let me be the captain

257
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:02,868
so deliberately give me difficult for me

258
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,486
You're not going, are you? All right

259
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:08,925
You go on with the meeting

260
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,260
This double qualifying is very important to me.

261
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,602
Please be sure to keep the appointment

262
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:14,592
The appointed time is almost up

263
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,664
Are you ready?

264
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:23,644
I'm coming

265
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,868
Quickly come in.

266
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:33,119
How's it going?

267
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:35,875
Did you find out who Xin Qiao's partner is?

268
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,883
No one in the whole company knows who he is

269
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:44,755
It seems that 

270
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,215
Qiao xin is prepared this time

271
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,093
What's the matter?Are you scared? 

272
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:03,795
I am not afraid of Xin Qiao

273
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,633
It's because Xiangkong Ji hasn't come online yet 

274
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,451
He.. He won't tease you again,will he? 

275
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:12,928
Who knows?

276
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:17,956
Why hasn't he come yet? 

277
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:23,111
Hello

278
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,023
We're going to have a race in a few minues

279
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:30,328
 you have to protect me

280
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:34,846
I'll reward you first

281
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,579
After win the game

282
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,071
I have a surprise for you

283
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:40,965
Feng Lu, please practice  with this hero 

284
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,028
named Zhanche xia

285
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,784
But this hero...

286
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,009
There are no buts

287
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,053
When Xiangkong asks you to practice,practice

288
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:47,918
He must have plans

289
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:58,591
That's all for today's meeting

290
00:15:58,933 --> 00:15:59,742
This is the end of the meeting

291
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:03,149
I'm leaving

292
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,010
He's logged into the game  

293
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:26,583
Hello,everyone

294
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:27,610
I am Xin Qiao

295
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,357
Then the battle between me and Ying Qiu

296
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,483
is about to begin

297
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,434
I hope you will support me more

298
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,959
cheer me on

299
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:34,968
I'll try, too

300
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:35,977
Thank you,everybody

301
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:38,913
I invited her

302
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,290
You see, Xin Qiao's partner is Xi Pei

303
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,425
Who is Xi Pei?

304
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,632
Xi Pei?

305
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,965
 WeiTeng's carry

306
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:49,062
The first in the new generation

307
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:51,328
The strongest mid 

308
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,359
There are wonderful games to see

309
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:56,774
Why haven't you gone yet?  

310
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:58,889
I want to watch the fun

311
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,051
Take the computer back for me

312
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,220
If you want to play with the girls yourself

313
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:08,508
just say it

314
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:15,299
Then he must be really good

315
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,208
He is the dark horse of the year

316
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:18,352
But that's okay

317
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,388
Tatan was defeated by Legends

318
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,198
Don't worry,don't worry

319
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:23,540
That's good,that's good

320
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,457
So today's live broadcast is the battle

321
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,458
 between the champion and runner-up of

322
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,043
 the Chinese IConquer game

323
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,432
also is the game the first host of the battle

324
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,672
Be relaxed,don't be nervous

325
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,113
Come on, come on, come on

326
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:36,789
You have to beat her

327
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:37,972
Come on

328
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:39,878
The game is on

329
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,002
There are so many people

330
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:50,614
Then you have to run

331
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:51,929
He's after you

332
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:52,956
I'm running,I'm running

333
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,828
He attacked me,not a good man

334
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,539
They're trying to kill me over the tower

335
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:01,791
Xiangkong Ji, come and save me

336
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,304
Where are you,Xiangkong Ji?

337
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,294
Xiangkong Ji, Are you in a daze? 

338
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,834
What is Xiangkong Ji thinking?

339
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:11,797
He's so close to you

340
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:12,923
he didn't even save you

341
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,360
Xi Pei is mid in the game 

342
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:16,769
Why did he become Jungle today? 

343
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,525
Ying Qiu is not so strong

344
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:20,137
It's not hard to play

345
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:22,997
You scored too fast

346
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:25,343
Leave it to me

347
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:26,433
I want to get points

348
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,333
We don't play games by mouth

349
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,378
Let me remind you of one thing

350
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:32,449
Xiangkong Ji has a nickname

351
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:33,548
called Disabled Hand

352
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:34,431
This...

353
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,256
What's going on?

354
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:41,771
Looks like

355
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,319
I picked the wrong teammate again

356
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:47,940
That's normal

357
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:48,961
You...you stay calm

358
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:49,895
You're coming back to life

359
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:50,605
You go ahead and play

360
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:52,444
Let me check for you

361
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:55,920
Brother Kong,brother Kong,brother kong

362
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,586
Why are you back again?

363
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,181
No,I just heard Bing Wang say somehing

364
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,138
Because of you

365
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,729
the captain will sign an agreement to quit esports 

366
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:05,053
with the company in the conference room

367
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,161
What should we do?

368
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,497
Go and have a look

369
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,600
They are hitting you again. You run

370
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:15,581
It's over, it's over, it's over

371
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:16,554
Take it easy

372
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,382
Take it easy, take it easy

373
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:20,346
I'm lost again

374
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:22,399
I was so worried.What does it say?

375
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,228
I ...I... I...

376
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,282
I'll read it to you quickly

377
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:24,921
You read it quickly

378
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,750
Xiangkong Ji

379
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,524
Professional esports embroidered pillow

380
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,064
Weakness of Legends

381
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,271
Shame on Chinese IConquer

382
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:32,063
This guy is famous for his broken hands

383
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,534
The second line didn't want him

384
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,891
Is he so weak? -yes

385
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:38,690
I don't know how he can join the Legends 

386
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:45,645
Hang up?

387
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:47,212
Is he hang up?

388
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,590
Xiangkong is a scum

389
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,157
Even if he hangs up

390
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,213
I can't give up

391
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,633
QiuYing , quickly

392
00:19:58,696 --> 00:19:59,794
Xin Qiao is alone now

393
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,676
This is a good opportunity

394
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:02,055
Hit her,hit her

395
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:02,640
I'll be there now

396
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:03,316
Go,go,go

397
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,622
I beat her. I beat her

398
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,333
Do you want to beat me? 

399
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:07,401
I'm sure to win

400
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:08,702
Finished,finished,finished

401
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,152
Xi Pei caught up again

402
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,637
What kind of dark horse mid is he?

403
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:16,583
As a professional player

404
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,186
he bullies a girl 

405
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,662
I bet he's an ugly, creepy guy 

406
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,815
Yeah, it's a middle-aged man 

407
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:24,923
who's afraid to see anyone

408
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,147
Fang Gu

409
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,426
You've been in Legends for so many years

410
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,552
I really hate for you to leave

411
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:33,560
Thanks for everybody taking care of me

412
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:34,785
for so many years

413
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:36,982
There's not much I can do

414
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:37,701
for the team

415
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:39,702
The future of the team 

416
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,143
depends on chairman Jin

417
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,903
coach Luo and manager Zhao

418
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:46,763
OK

419
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:49,727
I hope you remember that 

420
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:54,311
Legends will always be your home

421
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,757
You can't sign it

422
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,153
Xiangkong, what are you doing?

423
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,052
This unequal agreement is 

424
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:22,186
to take you out of esports forever

425
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:24,303
Whatever your purpose

426
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:26,086
You're gu fang. Even if you retire

427
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,563
You should stay in esports

428
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,089
You stay out of this

429
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:32,425
Xiangkong Ji

430
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:37,297
Fang Gu puts so much thought and sacrifice 

431
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,604
to make you captain

432
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:41,784
What kind of childish behavior 

433
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,096
are you playing here

434
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,259
If my captain was paid for this,

435
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:53,953
I'd rather not be captain

436
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:55,771
Xiangkong,this is not

437
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,113
the time for your passions

438
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,787
Don't you believe me?

439
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:01,139
I certainly believe in your ability

440
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:02,031
Since you believe me

441
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,877
you should listen to me

442
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,011
In the new beta

443
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,127
If I can let the Legends win,

444
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,917
you'll let me be the captain

445
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,010
If I lose,

446
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:16,847
I quit

447
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,425
Xiangkong Ji

448
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,578
Never make an impulsive decision

449
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,655
You are responsible for what you say

450
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,099
OK, I believe you

451
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,266
You can prove yourself

452
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,723
That's what it takes to be a captain

453
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:55,584
That's all for today

454
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,699
Thanks for watching

455
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,277
See you next time

456
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,101
Goodbye

457
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:02,654
He makes me so angry

458
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:03,798
What kind of people are these people? 

459
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,582
What the hell are that? 

460
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:10,508
It was all because of Xiangkong Ji

461
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,408
If he hadn't hung up

462
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,596
we wouldn't have lost so badly

463
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:15,443
The problem is that 

464
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,200
he didn't help me 

465
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,253
while he was in the game

466
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:19,566
No

467
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,369
If ywe don't teach him a lesson

468
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,044
he really think we're a pushover

469
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,359
Yiyi, where are you going?

470
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:28,782
I'm go to hit him

471
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:30,718
I'll go with you, and so will I.

472
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,402
It doesn't matter 

473
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:34,576
if I stay in the business

474
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:37,455
You are too impulsive

475
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,481
Captain

476
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:40,652
I can't stay behind you all my life 

477
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:42,256
and let you solve my problems

478
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,975
By the way,I heard Yang zhao 

479
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,417
was talking about a contract with Wei Teng's Xi Pei

480
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:50,699
What's going on here?

481
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:54,910
Wei Teng's coach Shu is not an ordinary person

482
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,324
It's difficult to snatch someone from his hand

483
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,620
The rest of the way is up to you

484
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:02,925
Don't worry, captain

485
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:04,385
Then I'll leave

486
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:06,861
Come on, come on

487
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:18,255
All right, I've got work todo

488
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:19,254
I'll go first

489
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:20,857
Brother Kong

490
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:24,388
If we lose

491
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,085
will you really leave the team?

492
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,135
What?

493
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:29,495
Don't you believe me?

494
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,842
Of course I believe you

495
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:33,818
Xiangkong Ji

496
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:36,799
What's going on?

497
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:39,465
I guess it's because I hung up

498
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,591
and they came after me

499
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,888
Well, you go first. I'll stop them

500
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,185
Can you hold up two people?

501
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,049
Yes,I can.No poblem

502
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,418
I'm leaving. Don't worry

503
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:47,409
Are you still running? Stop

504
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:55,506
He is over there

505
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:56,478
Don't move

506
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:58,730
Get out of the way

507
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,351
No,wait a minute

508
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:01,738
Don't move,don't go

509
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:03,251
Who are you?

510
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:04,134
My name is Yixuan Lin

511
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:04,665
You don't care who I am

512
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,845
I don't care who you are

513
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:07,142
Yiyi, let's go

514
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,655
No, you come back, yiyi

515
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:10,673
Ying Qiu, you look for Xiangkong Ji

516
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,411
I'll take care of this guy

517
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:12,402
Hold on. Don't go

518
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,014
You mustn't go

519
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,491
What's wrong with you?

520
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:15,527
Why do you swear?

521
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:16,761
I hit someone. How about that?

522
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:20,562
I tell you

523
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:21,156
I don't hit women

524
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,156
You don't hit women,do you?

525
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:24,045
It's just that I hit men

526
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:25,686
You don't hurt me

527
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,172
I'm going to fight back

528
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:28,289
I'm going to fight back

529
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,118
What's your name?You tell me

530
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:30,613
Don't hit me.Don't hit me.

531
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,351
I'm going to fight back

532
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,657
I'm going to fight back

533
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,053
What are you doing?

534
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,395
Can you explain to me 

535
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:39,836
why you did that

536
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,375
What?

537
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,492
About the double qualifying

538
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:44,735
So many people watched the live broadcast at that time 

539
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:45,915
you didn't help me at all

540
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:47,150
Do you know how humiliated I am?

541
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:50,684
You're talking about double qualifying

542
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:52,985
But you said you played double qualifying with me

543
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,588
and I didn't say I was protecting you

544
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,164
I thought you were good

545
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,704
and played with me just to make it harder

546
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:02,172
Well, even if you're not obligated to protect me,

547
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,550
at least you should ginish playing the game

548
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,018
Why did you hang up halfway?

549
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:08,801
Something has come up.Really

550
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:10,764
Something's come up,haven't you?

551
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,186
OK, Xiangkong Ji

552
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,626
You think it's funny to tease me,don't you?

553
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:21,977
What are you doing?

554
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:24,922
We don't owe each other any more

555
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:26,976
Are you crazy?

556
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,349
Because you've been teasing me

557
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:44,061
Yeah, I was just trying to trick you

558
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:45,079
I just want to see 

559
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:46,487
how long you want to stay on the show

560
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:50,456
You're going to cry again

561
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,212
How cheap your tears are

562
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,581
Haven't you been talking about 

563
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,626
making a transition?

564
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:57,076
What did you do?

565
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,931
You've been trying to 

566
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:00,732
suck up to us all day long

567
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,236
That's your effort, isn't it?

568
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:05,118
You don't know anything, Xiangkong Ji

569
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:06,604
Yeah, I just don't know anything

570
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,559
I've seen a lot of people like you 

571
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:09,892
who like to suck up to people to gain popularity

572
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,799
but you're first in there

573
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:18,277
Xiangkong Ji, you are bastard

574
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,871
Yeah, I'm a jerk

575
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,744
You're sucking up to the wrong person

576
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:23,420
I give you some advice

577
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,779
There's no shortage of vases like yours

578
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:33,687
Get out of the way!

579
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,086
Don't think so much

580
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,293
Today is his lucky day

581
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:00,851
Next time I'll help you catch him 

582
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,314
and give him a good beating

583
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,759
Be happy

584
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:08,973
I made a mistake in this matter

585
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,641
I deserve to be scolded

586
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,669
 for bringing shame on myself

587
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,342
I've always said 

588
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,578
I'm going to succeed on my own merit

589
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:21,737
But from vancouver to today

590
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,124
I am still an esports idiot

591
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:25,781
What makes me think 

592
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:27,889
I can get ahead by taking shortcuts

593
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,851
Why do you think so again?

594
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,571
I've been trying to persuade you 

595
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,805
all night in vain

596
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,138
OK

597
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:40,804
We have to work tomorrow

598
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:42,463
Go to bed early

599
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,778
I walked back on my own

600
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:46,298
All right, all right

601
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,811
 Think about it for yourself 

602
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,251
I"ll go home first

603
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,377
Don't worry

604
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:54,167
Bye

605
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:14,376
She's a girl after all

606
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,118
It's inhumane of you 

607
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:18,451
to do her such a disservice

608
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,333
Who are you calling inhuman?

609
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:23,242
I didn't say that,I didn't say that

610
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:24,641
Keyboardist, forget it

611
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,295
What happened to your arm?

612
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:27,971
Don't mention it

613
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:30,799
I was nearly killed by 

614
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:32,402
the madwoman next to YingQiu today

615
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:35,653
No, no, wait a minute

616
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,310
I have to give you a piece of my mind

617
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,250
You can't harm her like that

618
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:43,777
She has ambition,

619
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,651
only to strive to transform to the IConquer version

620
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:48,461
Ying Qiu is at least a girl

621
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,901
It wasn't easy

622
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:50,784
OK

623
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:52,811
You can give her your help

624
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:56,269
I'd like to give her some help

625
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,638
but she looks down on me

626
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,232
I'm warning you

627
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:02,457
Don't go out with girls like that

628
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:03,421
She may sold you out 

629
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,474
and you foolishly helped her

630
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:20,624
44

631
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:24,542
45

632
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,055
46

633
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:29,642
Come on

634
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,107
47

635
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,655
Mom, I just can't do it

636
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:39,838
Really?

637
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,537
Come on, shall we get a drink of water first?

638
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:46,430
Little Ying

639
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:48,211
The children who take part in 

640
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:49,634
the New Year's performance must be the best

641
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:50,375
Isn't it?

642
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,426
So try to be the best kid you can be

643
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,083
Don't be afraid of hard work

644
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:00,785
Don't be lazy

645
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:02,973
Well, we have the last three 

646
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,558
Hold it

647
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,558
Will you finish it?

648
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:08,062
Come on, I believe you

649
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:09,161
You can do it

650
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:13,340
48

651
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:17,393
49

652
00:32:18,473 --> 00:32:19,635
Come on, little Ying,the last one

653
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,896
50

654
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:24,057
You're amazing

655
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:33,703
Little Ying, are you hungry?

656
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:34,829
Yes, I am

657
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,014
What would you like to eat?

658
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:43,394
I'm sorry,I let you down

659
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,139
Only 30 seconds left

660
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:54,959
Be careful,Carry

661
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:55,787
Someone is in the grass

662
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,273
They will come after you

663
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:58,741
There's someone in the middle of the grass.-OK

664
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:02,263
Take a look at the view of the river

665
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:03,956
Be careful,Mid.-OK,OK,OK

666
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,280
Upper way,upper way.-OK

667
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:06,055
Top goes to middle way

668
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:06,721
Be careful,Mid

669
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:13,053
The opponent Mid has a 30 second cooldown

670
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,274
Manager zhao

671
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:16,890
The organizers of the private test event 

672
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:18,018
made adjustments to the event

673
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,321
Don't let them know that 

674
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:23,311
tomorrow's opponents are replaced by XinTu

675
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,959
I'll see what they can do

676
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,400
You didn't even look at it

677
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:29,648
How do you know opponent is XinTu?

678
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,332
Did you do it?

679
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,605
How else could the organizers 

680
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,073
have easily changed?

681
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,909
Cool, cool, manager Zhao

682
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,258
Coach  Coach  Coach

683
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,050
The first game is WeiTeng vs XiaoLong

684
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:59,543
The second game is Legends vs XinTu

685
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:01,031
Coach

686
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:03,381
Haven't we been fighting with XiaoLong?

687
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,165
Why did the opponent suddenly change to XinTu?

688
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,308
It's impossible for the organizers 

689
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,793
not to inform us of such an important event

690
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:17,134
This must have been done on purpose by fox Zhao

691
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:20,007
It's really a big trap

692
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,547
Manager Zhao

693
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:25,348
You see this

694
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,888
The organizers changed the schedule

695
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:27,816
without informing us

696
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:28,753
What should we do?

697
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,924
Yeah, the tactics haven't changed

698
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:30,734
How can we do that?

699
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:31,842
This game is sure to be lost

700
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,310
My god

701
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,274
When did they adjust the time?

702
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:35,121
Bing Wang

703
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,678
Didn't you get the message?

704
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,700
Yes

705
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:40,498
Coach Luo

706
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,190
 Didn't you get the message, too

707
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,208
What?

708
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:44,622
We were never informed

709
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:45,968
This...

710
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:48,585
We used to practice against XiaoLong

711
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,675
What should we do now?

712
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:50,954
Yeah, yeah

713
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,403
What are you doing?Go and ask about it

714
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:56,006
I'll find them now

715
00:34:58,141 --> 00:34:59,330
No, we can't win at this point

716
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,104
The tactics are all practiced

717
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,023
Suddenly they changed our opponent 

718
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,140
We can't fight.We can't win

719
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:02,941
It's a waste of time

720
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,932
What are we doing here?

721
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:04,878
Manager Zhao, do something about it

722
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:06,382
I know, I know

723
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:06,913
I know

724
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:07,661
Don't worry

725
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:08,607
You see 

726
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:09,931
 I ask Bing Wang to do something

727
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,011
and that's what happened.

728
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,434
Do not worry

729
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,893
Shall I ask about it now?

730
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:14,776
You wait to hear from me

731
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,127
Manager Zhao, you must get justice for us

732
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:17,550
OK,OK,OK

733
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:18,054
We're counting on you

734
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,919
We trust you.

735
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:19,865
You have worked hard, manager Zhao

736
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,296
Come on
