00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 5

2
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,900
I should forget it.

3
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,730
No, it's not right.

4
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,690
He spoilt my necklace.

5
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,250
He didn't even apologise.

6
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,490
What right does he have?

7
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,630
Telling me senseless things.

8
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,110
Why should I forget it?

9
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,590
No way.

10
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,790
What are you looking at?

11
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,270
Let me guess.

12
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,110
You came to request something from me.

13
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,750
Yes, what about it?

14
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,750
If you didn't came to find me,

15
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,350
I would have felt that

16
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,790
the necklace

17
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,990
means a lot to you.

18
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,260
But now, you've confirmed

19
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
you are a worthy drama queen.

20
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,020
Ji Xiang Kong.

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,840
I don't care how you think of me.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
But you are the one who said that

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,960
you can satisfy

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,200
all my requests.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,280
Why? Are you going back on what you say now?

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
the things that I've said before.

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
I never go back on

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay, then you should live stream

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
and play a 2V2 with me.

30
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,670
Nothing else?

31
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,430
Just a 2V2, that simple?

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,390
Okay, no problem.

33
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,150
Ji Xiang Kong.

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,020
From Vancouver up till now,

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,420
you've been messing with me.

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,620
This time,

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,260
I hope you stop messing with me.

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,940
Once we're done with this 2V2,

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,460
we are both clear.

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,090
Be careful!

41
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,070
Don't imitate Mi Ya anymore.

42
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,980
He has problems.

43
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,860
It should be here.

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
Uh, hello.

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
May I ask, is this

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Dynamic gaming magazine?

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,960
That's right.

48
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,180
You're here for an interview, right?

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,340
Yes.

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,100
Hold on for a minute.

51
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,780
Handsome guy.

52
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,660
It seems very leisurely here.

53
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,100
Our Director Shi,

54
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,340
admires living a relaxed life.

55
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,180
Relaxed.

56
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
Let's go, I'll bring you upstairs.

57
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,730
Handsome guy.

58
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,010
Do you all

59
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,290
not do any work here?

60
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,570
Work?

61
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,770
Didn't I already tell you?

62
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,490
Our Director Shi,

63
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,710
admires living a relaxed life.

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,950
Let's go.

65
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,310
Come.

66
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,510
Thanks.

67
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,910
A talented student who graduated with a news major.

68
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,790
And, we are schoolmates.

69
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,140
Then, hello senior.

70
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,460
Previously,

71
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,300
you worked with UXStar videos for two years.

72
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,260
Yes.

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,980
Then do you understand the career's competiton?

74
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,900
Truthfully,

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,440
I didn't transferred to Conquer's department

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
for a long time.

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
I used to work in the lifestyle department.

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,080
So,

79
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm not really familiar with it.

80
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I'm just urgently

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,280
looking for a job.

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
So, I mass sent out my resume.

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
I didn't really look at

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,240
what you guys require carefully.

85
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm really sorry.

86
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,270
Since it's this way.

87
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,750
Our magazine company

88
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,950
is a professional

89
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,310
online gaming magazine company.

90
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,510
In this ten years, within this industry,

91
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,630
we went through a lot.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,260
And we developed ourselves pretty well.

93
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,620
But in the recent years,

94
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,300
our industry

95
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,300
is noticed more and more.

96
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,620
So, we urgently need

97
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,420
professional talents who

98
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,540
writes for similar things.

99
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,530
I understand.

100
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,530
Sorry for

101
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,370
taking up your time.

102
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,810
Then, i'll take my leave first.

103
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,810
You didn't take up my time.

104
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,970
As for the pay,

105
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,610
we'll follow according to the hiring notice.

106
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,010
When will you be able to

107
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,930
report for work?

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,280
Director,

109
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,760
is there over time pay for working over time?

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,960
If I need to go out for an interview,

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,880
how do we make arrangements?

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,270
You don't need to work overtime.

113
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,910
You also don't need to go out for an interview.

114
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,590
You can just summarize

115
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,670
the notices of those in the same profession.

116
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,980
He's really relaxed.

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,220
Hello?

118
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
Hello, Yi Yi?

119
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,940
How's your interview today?

120
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,340
I found an old folks home.

121
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,380
Just joking.

122
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,660
I switched industries to a

123
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,900
magazine company that specialises in gaming news.

124
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,060
In future, your news

125
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,820
is on me!

126
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,290
You have to treat me to good food, okay?

127
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,370
Right.

128
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,650
About you finding Ji Xiang Kong,

129
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,570
how did it go?

130
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,210
He agreed to the 2V2.

131
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,730
He agreed?

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
Your dishes are all here, please enjoy.

133
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,120
Okay.

134
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,940
I've heard of the news about Pei Xi.

135
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,940
This time, Zhao Yang,

136
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,300
came here prepared.

137
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,780
And I think Chairman Jin

138
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,060
If we really let them

139
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,020
recruit Pei Xi,

140
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,260
they will definitely let him be the leader.

141
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,420
Pei Xi being China's

142
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,620
rising mid-solo star player,

143
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
his skills are good.

144
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,140
Looking at this,

145
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,020
I don't think he'll only be the leader.

146
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,380
There's no space for Xiang Kong

147
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,820
on Zhao Yang's team anymore.

148
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,690
I'm afraid I'll be incompetent

149
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,330
as a coach now.

150
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,290
I understand.

151
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,790
Previously, I heard Chairman Jin mention

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,390
that if I quit,

153
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,670
he hopes

154
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,310
I will leave the gaming industry forever.

155
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,830
In that case,

156
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,630
my image will always be

157
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,550
tied to Legends.

158
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,550
I've heard about this.

159
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,510
But the board of directors have no right

160
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,870
to request that of you.

161
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,300
Coach Luo.

162
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,940
If I signed this contract-

163
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
You want to use this contract

165
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
to make an exchange with Chairman Jin, right?

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Then you'll have to think it through, Gu Fang.

167
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
I feel that by doing it this way,

168
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
the price to pay is too much for you.

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,880
And, in future,

170
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
if you want to come back,

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,990
What do we do?

172
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,830
If it's because of other reasons,

173
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,190
I definitely won't do it.

174
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,980
But if it's because of Xiang Kong,

175
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,140
I feel that it's worth it.

176
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,650
How is it? Are you ready?

177
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,970
I'm ready.

178
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,770
Why did you buy so many face masks?

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,920
This is a hot item online recently.

180
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm using it as a fan's benefit,

181
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
to up my popularity.

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,800
You're so generous.

183
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,120
I've never seen you

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
being this generous before.

185
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,790
What do you mean?

186
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,270
I've always been generous.

187
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:36,990
Okay, okay.

188
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,350
Then I'll cheer you on from

189
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,870
- Okay.

190
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,870
the padlet!

191
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,380
Hello everyone.

192
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,580
I am Qiu Ying from UXStar videos's

193
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,860
Conquer department.

194
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,140
Today, I've brought a surprise

195
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,940
for everyone.

196
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,700
Tomorrow, I'll be playing

197
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,220
2V2 with a very skilled

198
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,540
professional gamer.

199
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,260
Everyone make a guess, who is he?

200
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,780
Perfect, tease them about it first before revealing.

201
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,290
Fans who got it right will be able to win a prize.

202
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,450
This is the prize.

203
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,490
It's a imperial mud workplace's face mask

204
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,570
made with a special inhouse recipe.

205
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,690
It's also my secret to

206
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,850
maintaining a good skin condition.

207
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,610
Everyone come make a guess.

208
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,140
Qiu Ying.

209
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,940
It's Qiao Xin, she said she had also

210
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,140
arranged a 2V2 with a professional,

211
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,180
and wants to battle with you.

212
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,220
She's really everywhere.

213
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,580
That's fine, if she wants to, let's battle.

214
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,580
Am I scared of her?

215
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,460
Fighting!

216
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,060
This should be our

217
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,340
best viewership rate

218
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,780
in record history.

219
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,020
Amazing.

220
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,780
This 2V2 idea.

221
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,020
Who thought of it?

222
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,300
Originally, I wanted to

223
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,820
do this activity alone.

224
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,370
I didn't expect

225
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,490
Xin Jie would be interested to join.

226
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,250
I heard that you're stressed about your performance.

227
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,610
If your programme

228
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,570
is still not in the rankings

229
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,810
within this month,

230
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,430
you'll have to leave the company.

231
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,470
I'm also reluctant to let you leave.

232
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,430
So, as a senior,

233
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,870
I have to help you.

234
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,470
That's right, because of Xin Jie's help,

235
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,190
my followers

236
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,470
have increased rapidly.

237
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,750
That's right.

238
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,750
Everyone should help each other,

239
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,470
is that right?

240
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,110
Who are the professionals that are

241
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,390
collaborating with you guys respectively?

242
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,550
Professionals should be a little more mysterious.

243
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,190
If we say it out, they won't be

244
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,190
professionals anymore.

245
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,550
That's right, a little mysterious.

246
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,750
This event was so well done.

247
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,630
In future, you guys should host more

248
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,990
activities of this sort, okay?

249
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,700
President Liu, can we

250
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,260
let the promotion team publicise this

251
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,060
on the front page?

252
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,780
This way, more people will notice.

253
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,020
Good idea.

254
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,780
We should give you guys

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
some good promotion.

256
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,140
Thank you President Liu.

257
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,400
Then we'll go prepare.

258
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay.

259
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Then, I'll be anticipating.

260
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
President Liu, we'll do well.

261
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Yao Ge,

262
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,800
did you discover

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,710
Xiao Long's problems in the past few rounds?

264
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,950
Tell us.

265
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,350
His field of vision isn't good.

266
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,630
He's always caught when he's predating.

267
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,910
He doesn't predate at the first round.

268
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,020
Leader, Fox Zhao is here.

269
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,860
Professionals,

270
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,050
there's something

271
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,010
I need to tell everyone.

272
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,970
Aurora videos

273
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,970
is holding a reality show.

274
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,170
You guys should arrange who'll go.

275
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,450
Manager Zhao.

276
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,170
Didn't we make an agreement already?

277
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,250
internal trial competition of the updated game.

278
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,250
We aren't left with many days for the

279
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,370
We all need to practice.

280
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,890
We aren't participating in business activities for now.

281
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,850
Xiang Kong,

282
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,610
not participating in business activities,

283
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,890
where will the fee to maintain this group

284
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,880
come from, am I right?

285
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,560
Manager Zhao, maintenance

286
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,880
is for you and Chairman Jin to consider.

287
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,160
Coach Luo and I

288
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,840
are only in charge of the competition's results.

289
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Besides, the internal trial competition

290
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,030
decides whether I,

291
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,270
the assistant leader, is able to promote.

292
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,350
You're arranging a reality show

293
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,670
for us at this time,

294
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,990
those that know will say

295
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,190
for the company, Manager Zhao

296
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,030
is exerting his utmost.

297
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,470
Those that don't

298
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,500
will think Manager Zhao

299
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,580
isn't willing to let me be the leader.

300
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
Purposely setting up obstacles for me.

301
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,540
You're not going? Okay.

302
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,020
Continue the meeting.

303
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,300
The 2V2 this time round is very important to me,

304
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
please show up.

305
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
The time's almost up,

306
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
are you ready?

307
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,810
Coming.

308
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,050
Come in quickly.

309
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
How is it?

310
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,760
Did you managed to find out

311
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,960
who Qiao Xin's partner is?

312
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,120
No one in the office knows.

313
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,980
Then as I see it,

314
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,260
Qiao Xin seems prepared this time.

315
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Why? You're afraid because of this?

316
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm not afraid of Qiao Xin,

317
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,700
it's Ji Xiang Kong.

318
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,140
Until now, he hasn't come online.

319
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,850
He- he won't be messing with you again right?

320
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,490
Who knows?

321
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,450
This Ji Xiang Kong

322
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,710
Hello.

323
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,550
The battle is starting

324
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,990
You have to protect me well.

325
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,510
I'll reward you first.

326
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,150
When we win the battle,

327
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,830
I'll give you a surprise.

328
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,670
Lu Feng, practice a little more.

329
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,910
Chariot man, this hero,

330
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,510
But- but Chariot man-

331
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,190
Don't say so many buts.

332
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,790
Kong Ge asked you to practice, then you should.

333
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,990
He definitely has his plans.

334
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,380
Let's wrap up here today.

335
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,580
Everyone's dismissed.

336
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm going.

337
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,150
He's online.

338
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,470
Hello, everyone.

339
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,510
I am Qiao Xin.

340
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,310
Me and Qiu Ying will be battling.

341
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,460
It's starting soon.

342
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,540
I hope that everyone can support me loads.

343
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,980
Cheer for me.

344
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,940
I will work hard too.

345
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,100
Thank you everyone.

346
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,380
I invited her.

347
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,490
Look, Qiao Xin's partner is Pei Xi.

348
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,770
Who's that?

349
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,850
Pei Xi.

350
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,210
VNG's ace.

351
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,210
Rising mid-solo star player.

352
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,610
Strongest solo player.

353
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,610
This is going to be fun.

354
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,210
Why aren't you going?

355
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,970
I'm going to watch.

356
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,160
Help me bring the laptop back.

357
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,520
You want to play with the girl alone,

358
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,960
just be straightforward.

359
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,670
Then, he must be really good.

360
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,590
He's the dark horse player this year.

361
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,670
But it's okay.

362
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,660
VNG always loses to Legends.

363
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,740
Relax.

364
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,020
That's good.

365
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,860
So, today's live stream

366
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,820
is China's peak.

367
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,500
First and second team's battle.

368
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,260
Also, it's the competition for

369
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,060
UXStar's top streamer.

370
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,060
Loosen up, don't be nervous.

371
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,580
Fighting!

372
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,180
You must beat her.

373
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,460
Fighting!

374
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,540
It's started.

375
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,650
So many people.

376
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,200
Then you'd have to run quickly.

377
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
They're chasing and targetting you.

378
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,640
I'm running.

379
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
What kind of man is he?

380
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
He sneakily attacked.

381
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,140
They jumped over the tower and did a strong kill.

382
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,380
Ji Xiang Kong, quickly come and save me.

383
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,980
Ji Xiang Kong, where are you?

384
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,900
Ji Xiang Kong is day dreaming.

385
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,580
What is Ji Xiang Kong thinking?

386
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,460
He's so near to you,

387
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,580
yet he didn't save you.

388
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,220
Isn't Pei Xi a mid-solo player,?

389
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,500
Why is he killing the monsters today?

390
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,300
This Qiu Ying also isn't too good.

391
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
You're really good.

392
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,020
It's not very difficult.

393
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,020
You are quick at accumulating points.

394
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,140
Leave it for me at the last moment.

395
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,260
I want to snatch some points.

396
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,260
Battling isn't just about talking.

397
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm reminding you.

398
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,210
Ji Xiang Kong has a nickname.

399
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,490
Called "not good with his hands".

400
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,490
This.

401
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,080
What's happening?

402
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,790
Looking at it,

403
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,270
I chose the wrong team mate again.

404
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,910
It's nothing.

405
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,910
Don't panic.

406
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,950
You're going to revive soon.

407
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,670
Continue fighting first.

408
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,550
I'll check for you.

409
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,950
Kong Ge.

410
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,590
Why are you back?

411
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,190
No, I just heard from Wang Bin that

412
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,310
for you, leader

413
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,190
is going to meet to sign some sort of

414
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,870
contract about leaving the industry

415
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,270
in the meeting room.

416
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,430
What do we do?

417
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,670
Quick, go and have a look.

418
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,780
They're attacking you again, run quickly.

419
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,740
I'm doomed.

420
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,700
Don't be nervous.

421
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,840
Lost again.

422
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
You're making me anxious. What do you want to say?

423
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,440
I-

424
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,600
Let me read it for you quickly.

425
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,360
Quickly read it.

426
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,040
Ji Xiang Kong's

427
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
professional skills are just for show.

428
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,240
Legends' disgrace.

429
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,720
China's top embarrassment.

430
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
This guy is well-known for not being good.

431
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,880
doesn't want him.

432
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,880
Even the second route competitive team

433
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
- Yes!

434
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
He's that bad?

435
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,040
I didn't know how

436
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,920
he entered the Legends.

437
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,550
[Your team mate VOID has disconnected.]

438
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,150
Disconnected?

439
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,710
He disconnected?

440
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,020
Ji Xiang Kong, this trash.

441
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,580
Even if he disconnected,

442
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,860
I definitely won't admit defeat.

443
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,140
Qiu Ying, quick.

444
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Qiao Xin is alone now.

445
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,210
Good opportunity.

446
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,570
Hit her.

447
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,130
I'll head over now.

448
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,010
Hit.

449
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,210
I'll beat her.

450
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,970
You want to beat me?

451
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,930
I definitely will win.

452
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,250
We're doomed.

453
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,730
Pei Xi is coming back again.

454
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,330
What is this Pei Xi?

455
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,330
He's a mid-solo star dark horse.

456
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,170
A professional player.

457
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,810
How can he bully girls?

458
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,970
I bet he's definitely

459
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,730
an ugly looking wretched man

460
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,320
who's never seen the world before.

461
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes, he definitely is

462
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,720
a middle aged man who doesn't socialise.

463
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Gu Fang, you've been in

464
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,080
Legends for some many years.

465
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,590
I really can't bear to part with you.

466
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,230
Thank you for everyone's care

467
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,630
in the past few years.

468
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,710
What I can do for the team

469
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,710
is no longer much.

470
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,390
The team's future

471
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,060
has to rely on Chairman Jin,

472
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,220
Coach Luo and Manager Zhao.

473
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,660
Okay.

474
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,660
I hope that you can remember

475
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,260
that this place is always your home.

476
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,730
You're not allowed to sign!

477
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
Xiang Kong, what are you doing?

478
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,120
This uneven contract

479
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,140
is to make you leave

480
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,140
the gaming industry forever.

481
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,380
No matter what your purpose is,

482
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,380
you are Gu Fang, even if you quit,

483
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,780
you still have to be in the industry.

484
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,180
Don't bother about this.

485
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,860
Ji Xiang Kong.

486
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,260
Gu Fang put so much thought into it.

487
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,740
He made such a big sacrifice.

488
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,540
Just to let you

489
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,700
be the leader.

490
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,900
What kind of temper

491
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,500
are you throwing here?

492
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,890
If my leader

493
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,050
is using this method for me to be leader

494
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,490
I'd rather not be the leader.

495
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,130
Xiang Kong, now isn't

496
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,770
the time to be loyal.

497
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,330
Do you not believe me?

498
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,590
I do believe in your abilities.

499
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,510
Since you believe me,

500
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,470
then listen to me.

501
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,390
If during the internal trial competiton,

502
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,590
I can let Legends win,

503
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,350
you guys have to let me be the leader.

504
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,470
If I lose,

505
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,390
I will leave.

506
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,070
Ji Xiang Kong.

507
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,270
Don't be loyal.

508
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,270
You have to be responsible for your words.

509
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,980
Okay, I believe you.

510
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,860
Prove your abilities.

511
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
This is the kind of spirit

512
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,300
a leader should have.

513
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Today's live stream

514
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,320
will be up to here.

515
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Thank you everyone for watching.

516
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,040
Let's meet on the next live stream.

517
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,080
Bye bye.

518
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,430
I'm so angry!

519
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,670
What kind of human is he?

520
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,270
What even is this?

521
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,420
We can only blame Ji Xiang Kong.

522
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,300
If he didn't disconnect,

523
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,380
we wouldn't have lost this badly.

524
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,300
The problem is

525
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,100
when he disconnected,

526
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,100
he didn't even bother about me.

527
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,540
No way.

528
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,290
If we don't express our anger towards him,

529
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,010
he'll think that we are easy to bully.

530
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,170
Yi YI, Where are you going?

531
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,890
I'm going to fight him.

532
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,730
I'll follow you, I'll come too.

533
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,410
Actually, why does it matter if I

534
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,890
stay in the industry or not?

535
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,610
You are too reckless.

536
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,650
Leader, I can't be hiding behind

537
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,720
your back and make you shelter me

538
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,560
for the rest of my life.

539
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh right, I heard from Zhao Yang

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
they were discussing about VNG's Pei Xi.

541
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,910
What's the situation?

542
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,470
VNG's Coach Shu

543
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,310
isn't just anyone.

544
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,710
It won't be easy to recruit her ace.

545
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,150
In future,

546
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,860
you have to rely on yourself.

547
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,300
Relax, leader.

548
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,780
Then I'll leave first.

549
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,300
Fighting.

550
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,700
Okay, I still have things on.

551
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,580
I'll leave first.

552
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,490
Kong Ge.

553
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,890
If we really lose,

554
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,450
do you really intend to leave the team?

555
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,610
Why?

556
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,890
Do you not trust me?

557
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,240
Of course I trust you.

558
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,480
Ji Xiang Kong!

559
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,240
What's the situation?

560
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Presumably looking for me

561
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,100
since I disconnected.

562
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,460
Then, leave first, I'll block them for you.

563
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,620
Can you handle both of them?

564
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,620
I can do it, okay, no problem.

565
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,980
- Relax.

566
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm leaving.

567
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,980
- Stay there!

568
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,980
Still running away?

569
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,060
That way.

570
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,180
Don't move.

571
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
Go away.

572
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,020
No, wait a minute.

573
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,420
Don't move, don't go.

574
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,900
Who are you?

575
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,900
I am Lin Yi Xuan.

576
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,420
Why do you bother who I am?

577
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,540
I don't bother who you are.

578
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,900
Yi Yi, let's go.

579
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,300
No, come back, Yi Yi.

580
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,450
Qiu Ying, go look for the one surnamed Ji.

581
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,170
Leave him to me.

582
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,170
- Don't leave.

583
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,170
Hang on.

584
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,890
Don't leave.

585
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,330
Do you have issues?

586
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,290
Why are you scolding people?

587
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,130
I'm going to beat people now.

588
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,350
Let me tell you.

589
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,990
I'm not going to hit women.

590
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,950
Not going to hit women, right?

591
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,870
Just nice, I'm going to hit men.

592
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,470
Don't beat me.

593
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,950
I'm going to retaliate.

594
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,230
I'm going to retaliate.

595
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,990
What's your name? Tell me.

596
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,550
Don't hit me already!

597
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,270
I'm going to retaliate!

598
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,630
I'm going to retaliate!

599
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,990
What are you doing?

600
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,270
Tell me clearly.

601
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,750
Why did you do that?

602
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,430
Why I did what?

603
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,390
The 2V2.

604
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,710
So many people were watching.

605
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,870
Don't you care about me a little?

606
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,350
Do you know how embarassing it is for me?

607
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,740
You were talking about the 2V2?

608
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,020
But you said you were playing 2V2 with me,

609
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,620
I didn't say I'd protect you did I?

610
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,260
I thought you were really good.

611
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,620
And that you just wanted to play with me.

612
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,700
Just to increase the level of difficulty.

613
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Okay, even if you aren't obligated

614
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,280
to protect me,

615
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,800
but you at least have to finish the game right?

616
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,960
You disconnected midway,

617
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,120
what's going on?

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,880
I had something urgent, really.

619
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,920
Something on?

620
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,520
Okay, Ji Xiang Kong.

621
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
Is it meaningful to mess with me?

622
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,390
What are you doing?

623
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,230
We're even now.

624
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,150
You're crazy.

625
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,860
Who asked you to mess with me purposely?

626
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,490
Yes, I just wanted to.

627
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,410
I purposely messed with you, what's wrong?

628
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,530
I want to see how long a drama queen

629
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,010
can persist her act until.

630
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,970
Are you going to cry again?

631
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,810
How cheap are your tears?

632
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,010
Didn't you say that

633
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,090
you wanted to transform?

634
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,490
What did you do?

635
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,490
You work so hard the whole day.

636
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,280
Being so close to us,

637
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,680
that's what hard work is to you right?

638
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Ji Xiang Kong, you don't know anything.

639
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,200
Yes, I don't know anything.

640
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,120
I've seen many people like you

641
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
who leach of others and are fighting for popularity.

642
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,550
But you stand at the top.

643
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,830
Ji Xiang Kong, you asshole.

644
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,750
Yes, I'm an asshole.

645
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,500
You leached off the wrong person.

646
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
I'll give you a final warning.

647
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,540
The gaming industry doesn't lack people like you.

648
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,740
Move away.

649
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't think about it too much.

650
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,120
Count Ji Xiang Kong lucky today.

651
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,860
Next time, I'll catch him for you,

652
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,460
and fiercely teach him a lesson.

653
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Be a little happier.

654
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,060
I was wrong.

655
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,660
Looking to be insulted.

656
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Serves me right for being scolded.

657
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,460
I said that I wanted

658
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,620
to rely on my own abilities.

659
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,540
But from Vancouver

660
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,900
to today's 2V2,

661
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,300
I'm still a blank paper in the industry.

662
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,940
What right do I have to assume

663
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,220
I can rely on short cuts to success?

664
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,130
Why did you go back to square one?

665
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,850
I advised you the whole night.

666
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,290
I wasted my effort.

667
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,410
Okay.

668
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,990
We still have to work tomorrow.

669
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,830
Let's go home and rest early.

670
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,030
I'll walk around and go back.

671
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,630
Okay.

672
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,070
Then, you think carefully.

673
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,470
I'll go home first.

674
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,870
Don't worry.

675
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,710
Bye bye.

676
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,020
She's also a girl afterall.

677
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,540
Messing with someone like this.

678
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,060
Too heartless.

679
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,880
Who are you calling heartless?

680
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,800
No one.

681
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
Keyboard warriors, don't bother.

682
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
What happened to your arm?

683
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,600
Don't mention it.

684
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,400
Today, I nearly got beaten to death

685
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
by the crazy woman beside Qiu Ying.

686
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,400
No, wait a while.

687
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,120
I have to criticize you a little.

688
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,070
You can't mess with people like that.

689
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,590
She has ambition.

690
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,470
the conquer department.

691
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,470
That's why she's working hard to transfer to

692
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,110
Qiu Ying is a lady, in the least.

693
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,750
It's not easy.

694
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,700
Okay.

695
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,780
Then let her leach off you.

696
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,140
I wanted her

697
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,660
to like me first.

698
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,250
I'm warning you.

699
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,490
In future, stop interacting

700
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,330
with this type of women.

701
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,170
She'll sell you.

702
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,410
for her stupidly.

703
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,410
And you'd still be counting the money

704
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,200
[Dear Miss Qiu Ying! Your China Business Bank's loan totals to RMB 2,200,000. Currently you've paid RMB 10,600, please arrange for repayment before the 25th of this month. Thanks!]

705
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,100
Forty four.

706
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,980
Forty five.

707
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,540
Forty six.

708
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,180
Fighting.

709
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,860
Forty seven.

710
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,140
Mom, I really can't do it anymore.

711
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,420
Really can't do it anymore?

712
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,100
Come, let's have some water okay?

713
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,980
Xiao Ying,

714
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,780
the little kids participating in the

715
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,780
new year's performance this year

716
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,210
must be the most excellent, right?

717
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:06,850
So,

718
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,090
you must work hard to be the most excellent.

719
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,010
You can't be scared of suffering.

720
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,490
You can't be lazy.

721
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,790
Okay, we still have the last three more.

722
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,270
Persist a little more.

723
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,230
Let's complete it okay?

724
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,750
Come, mom believes in you.

725
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,950
You can definitely do well.

726
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,230
Forty eight.

727
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,230
Forty nine.

728
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,430
Fighting Xiao Ying, the last one.

729
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,830
Fifty.

730
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,950
Our Xiao Ying is too awesome.

731
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,580
Xiao Ying, are you hungry?

732
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,700
Hungry.

733
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,180
What do you want to eat?

734
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,440
Sorry, I've disappointed you.

735
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,240
There's still thirty seconds.

736
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,120
Be careful or you'll lose.

737
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,800
There's people in the grass.

738
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
They're going to catch you.

739
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
There are people in the grass in the middle route.

740
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
- Okay.

741
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,430
Look at the field of vision from the river.

742
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,070
- Okay.

743
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,070
Be careful in the middle route.

744
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,310
Go, go, okay.

745
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,110
The people on the top route is in the middle now.

746
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:20,830
Be careful in the middle route.

747
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,340
The opponent's cool down time

748
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,220
is still left with thirty seconds.

749
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,620
Manager Zhao.

750
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,100
The organiser for the internal trial competition

751
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,180
made changes to the rules of the competition.

752
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,610
Don't let them know.

753
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,850
Tomorrow's competitor is taking a new route.

754
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,370
Let's see how they'll do.

755
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,610
You didn't even look, how do you know

756
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,970
the opponent changed to Xin Tu.

757
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,850
It can't be-

758
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,290
Otherwise

759
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,970
how can the organiser

760
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,490
will change people so easily.

761
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
Great, Manager Zhao.

762
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,870
Coach.

763
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,630
First round, VNG versus Dragon.

764
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,270
Second round, Legends versus New Land.

765
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,780
Coach.

766
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,940
Haven't we always been

767
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
competing with Dragon?

768
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
How come it's changed to New Land?

769
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,780
Such an important change to the competition,

770
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,620
the organiser wouldn't not notify us.

771
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,700
Must be Fox Zhao causing trouble.

772
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,930
This trap was dug really deeply.

773
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,170
Manager Zhao.

774
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,130
No, have a look.

775
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,650
The organiser changed the rounds.

776
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,530
They didn't notify us prior to it.

777
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,450
How are we going to fight?

778
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,850
Exactly, we didn't even change our tactics.

779
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,640
How do we play?

780
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,520
We'll definitely lose.

781
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,200
Oh my gosh.

782
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,040
When did they change it?

783
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,080
Wang Bin.

784
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,400
Did you not receive the notification?

785
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
No.

786
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,500
Coach Luo.

787
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,020
You weren't notified too?

788
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,100
What notification?

789
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,380
There was no notification at all.

790
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,900
This.

791
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,740
When we practiced previously,

792
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,380
we always fought with Dragons.

793
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,380
How do we compete like this?

794
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,860
Yes.

795
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,300
Why are you freezing here? Go and ask.

796
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
I'll go find them.

797
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,180
No, there's no way we can win like this.

798
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,260
We already practiced the tactics.

799
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,020
Suddenly we're changing competitors.

800
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,100
We can't compete, we won't win.

801
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,980
Even if we compete, it'll be a waste.

802
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,980
Why did we come?

803
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,140
Manager Zhao, think of something.

804
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,980
I know.

805
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,780
Don't be nervous.

806
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,140
I told Wang Bin to arrange

807
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,130
and it became like this.

808
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,530
Don't be nervous.

809
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,850
I'll go and ask personally, okay?

810
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,850
Wait for my notification.

811
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,170
Manager Zhao, make the decision for us.

812
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,650
Okay.

813
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,170
We are relying on you.

814
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,890
We are trusting you.

815
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,210
You've worked hard, Manager Zhao.

816
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,550
Fighting.
