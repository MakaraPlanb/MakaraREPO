[Episode 33]

3
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,710
Xiang Kong...

4
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,990
I'm here.

5
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,500
Xiang Kong...

6
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,500
You're back.

7
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,420
It's nothing,

8
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,650
go to bed first.

9
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,410
Sister,

10
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
you'll catch a cold like this.

11
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm fine, go to bed.

12
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Sister,

13
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Ji Xiang Kong is being unfair to you.

14
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,780
You're his Girlfriend,

15
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,460
how can he abandon you

16
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,460
and care for others?

17
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,060
Previously, Mi Ya

18
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,460
got injured because of him.

19
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,260
If it's not for that,

20
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,500
Mi Ya wouldn't have been blind.

21
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,980
Xiang Kong is only taking care of her

22
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,780
because he felt guilty.

23
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,340
Also, Mi Ya doesn't have any relatives.

24
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,220
Both of them grew up together,

25
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,490
Xiang Kong is considered her closest kin.

26
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,690
How about in the future?

27
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
If her eyes doesn't recover,

28
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,650
is Ji Xiang Kong

29
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,130
going to take care of her for the rest of her life?

30
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,130
No,

31
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,190
Mi Ya's eyes will definitely recover.

32
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,390
Hurry to bed.

33
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,910
There's still training tomorrow.

34
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,630
We've already practice together

35
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,550
for the past few days.

36
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,470
We can't practice

37
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,070
properly with someone missing.

38
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,630
Don't worry,

39
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,910
Pei Xi already told me about it.

40
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,430
Sister Wen will come tomorrow

41
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,710
to train with you guys.

42
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,910
Sister, I don't wish to see you at a disadvantage.

43
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
Silly boy,

44
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,020
why will I be at a disadvantage?

45
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,240
Hurry to bed.

46
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm going to wash up too.

47
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,240
You go up first.

48
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,760
Then you rest early.

49
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,790
All the best! You can do it!

50
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,140
Mi Ya's emotions aren't stable,

51
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,180
it fluctuates.

52
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,090
I might be back a ittle later,

53
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,650
you rest early.

54
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,810
Tired?

55
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,930
Thank you for visiting me.

56
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
How's the preparations for the competition?

57
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,780
American zone's potential this year

58
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,580
is very strong,

59
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,700
especially Tatan

60
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
so I did 2 reviews

61
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,900
on their recent matches.

62
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,810
Did you not rest well recently?

63
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,210
You look pale.

64
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,250
There's too many things to do recently,

65
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,530
so I'm a little tired.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,280
Oh,

67
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
the tactic leakage matter has been

68
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,040
investigated thoroughly.

69
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,480
Really?

70
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
What actually happened?

71
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,060
This matter has nothing to do with you,

72
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
it was done by Qiao Xin and Qi Yue.

73
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,060
The committee

74
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,820
will release

75
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,340
an official statement later on.

76
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,540
Qiao Xin

77
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,940
has been fired by Ji Guang.

78
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,380
Qi Yue can't compete for

79
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,460
a year.

80
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,500
Thank you so much, Teacher Luo.

81
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,980
If it's not for you,

82
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,900
this matter will

83
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,460
be left unsettled.

84
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
I don;t even know

85
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,820
how long I will

86
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,100
have to be the scapegoat for.

87
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,260
This is what I should do.

88
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,260
Oh,

89
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,130
let you a

90
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,170
better news.

91
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,050
I've discussed with President Guo.

92
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,450
If you're willing to,

93
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,450
you'll be the commentator for Iconquer

94
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,930
global finals alongside with me,

95
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,110
for chinese commentary.

96
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,070
I know,

97
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,950
Phoenix needs you now.

98
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,910
You don't have to give me an answer now.

99
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,590
The commentator team will depart next week,

100
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,910
you can still discuss

101
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,070
with Ji Xiang Kong first.

102
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,630
Of course as your partner,

103
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,310
I really hope that

104
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,270
you're able to participate

105
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,710
in the global finals with me

106
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,270
as the commentator.

107
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,590
Thank you, Teacher Luo.

108
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,590
I'll consider properly.

109
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Teacher Luo.

110
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
Why are you still here?

111
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,270
I'm here to apologise to you.

112
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,630
Teacher Luo,

113
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,150
I know I made a lot of mistakes,

114
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,630
You should apologise to Qiu Ying,

116
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,460
to Wei Teng, to those colleagues who

117
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,620
worked deiligently

118
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,340
in Ji Guang and not to me.

119
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,700
I'll apologise to them and

120
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
ask for their forgiveness.

121
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,930
Teacher Luo,

122
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,130
please give me another chance.

123
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,290
Please help me, will you?

124
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,970
Even being an intern is okay.

125
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,370
Teacher Luo,

126
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,530
I promise I'll work hard.

127
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,170
I definitely

128
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,250
will work diligently.

129
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,850
This is the committee's decision,

130
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,050
I can't help you.

131
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,600
Teacher Luo, I know I'm wrong.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm too silly then.

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,630
I was envious of Qiu Ying.

134
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,750
I was envious that she's better than me.

135
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,430
I was envious that everyone likes her.

136
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,340
I was envious that she has many things

137
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,940
on herself that I don't have.

138
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,260
Qiao Xin,

139
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,780
you're the first runner-up for 'The Star of Tomorrow'.

140
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,820
In terms of talent and potential,

141
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,460
you're not worse than anyone else.

142
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,530
You could actually be

143
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,610
a really good commentator.

144
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,530
If you were to really compared,

145
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,410
Qiu Ying is more hardworking and

146
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,650
cherish opportunities

147
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,290
more than you, taking steps by steps.

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,720
Qiao Xin,

149
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
stop comparing with others.

150
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,980
It's more important to

151
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,740
look at where you're going.

152
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,780
Reflect upon yourself.

153
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,330
How was it?

154
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,310
Did Luo tian agree to let you go back?

155
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,390
Since he doesn't agree,

156
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,070
I'll invite President Guo

157
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,550
for dinner,

158
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,150
go doll yourself up.

159
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,710
Say some nice words

160
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,590
to coax him,

161
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,990
It's useless.

162
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,230
This is the committee's decision,

163
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,750
Ji Guang will not want me anymore.

164
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,310
But

165
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,550
I can't just let it go after

166
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,940
putting in so much effort to

167
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,420
let you go to  Ji Guang.

168
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,860
You see if this works,

169
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,940
we'll push the entire blame

170
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,560
to Qi Yue.

171
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Qi Yue?

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Anyway, everybody

173
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,600
hates him now.

174
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
Just say that he manipulate you into this.

175
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
President Liu,

176
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,120
how can you let me use

177
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
such despicable means?

178
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
Qi Yue is my Boyfriend.

179
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,390
Qi Yue is your Boyfriend,

180
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,710
then I advise you

181
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,710
to break up with him quickly.

182
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,950
I will not break up with him.

183
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,910
Are you being stupid now?

184
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,260
I'm indeed stupid.

185
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,340
I'm the first host in You Xing and

186
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,580
the first runner-up for 'The Star of Tomorrow'.

187
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,330
I clearly could

188
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,650
ge tto the analyzing table with

189
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,970
my own ability.

190
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,050
So you're blaming me now?

191
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,930
I have no rights to blame anyone,

192
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,570
I deserve it.

193
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,490
From today onwards,

194
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,810
I don't wish to compare with anyone.

195
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,290
I will also not use

196
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,560
any despicable means

197
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
to harm others.

198
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,640
Qiao Xin.

199
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,630
Qiao Xin,

200
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,270
I cultivate you

201
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,430
from scratch.

202
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,550
If it's not for You Xing,

203
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,990
you'll never enter Ji Guang.

204
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,900
Your contract is

205
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,780
still with Xing You.

206
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,260
Don't think about being successful

207
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,700
if you don't do as I say.

208
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,410
I really hope she's able

209
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,850
to cry it out.

210
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,090
She's been keeping it in these few days,

211
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,170
this is what I"m worrying about.

212
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,920
Sometimes I wonder if

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,720
heavens' is being unfair to her.

214
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Her relationship is gone,

215
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
her career is gone

216
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,620
and now even her health is gone.

217
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,460
I wouldn't dare to think about

218
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,380
her life in the future.

219
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,820
Xiang Kong,

220
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,940
what we can do not

221
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,020
is to help Mi Ya

222
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
recover quickly

223
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,460
and what she needs most

224
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,530
is your company.

225
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,090
I know,

226
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,770
I try to accompany her more.

227
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,830
Kai Lun.

228
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,270
Kai Lun, my phone is ringing.

229
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,910
Kai Lun.

230
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Kai Lun, where are you?

231
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Kai Lun.

232
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
Mi Ya, why are you sitting on the floor?

233
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,440
Don't move around if you can't see.

234
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,510
Here, get up.

235
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,070
Don't touch me, I don't need you to care.

236
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,710
I don't want your sympathy.

237
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,190
Ji Xiang Kong, leave.

238
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,830
-Calm down,          -Leave.

239
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,870
I can't leave with you being like this.

240
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,070
I don't want your sympathy.

241
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,020
I don't want your sympathy.

242
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Mi Ya!

243
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,780
Leave.

244
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,300
Xiang Kong,

245
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,340
what do I do?

246
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,410
You're here with me when

247
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,090
I couldn't see previously,

248
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm not scared at all

249
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
but now I

250
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,480
have nothing at all.

251
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
Mi Ya,

252
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm still here.

253
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,860
I'll take care fo you

254
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
until your eyes recovers.

255
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,980
Will you always be with me

256
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,580
if I'm no longer able to see?

257
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,060
Are you willing to always

258
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
be with me?

259
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,450
-Qiu Ying, you're back.          -Sister Wen.

260
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,210
Qiu Ying, hurry inside.

261
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,150
Sister Wen and I will go buy some groceries.

262
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,950
We'll do some of your favourite dishes tonight

263
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,550
to celebrate for you.

264
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,150
Thank you Brother Sun and Sister Wen.

265
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,550
You're welcome.

266
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,470
Hurry inside, quick.

267
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,590
Go on in.

268
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,910
Hurry in.

269
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,870
We'll be back shortly.

270
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,510
Let's go.

271
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,310
Kungfu Dog.

272
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,310
Are you stupid?

273
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,710
Don't you think

274
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,950
that you look like it?

275
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,070
It's not as nice as me.

276
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,870
How narcissistic.

277
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,180
-Qiu Ying.          -Sister.

278
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,300
You're back.

279
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,660
Let me tell you a good news.

280
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,660
The committee

281
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,740
of Iconquer released

282
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,380
a statement that

283
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,480
they've checked it through.

284
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,680
The leakage of tactic

285
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,960
was done by Qiao Xin and Qi Yue.

286
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Are you happy?

287
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,480
Oh,

288
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,240
Ji Guang also released a

289
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,000
statement apologising to you.

290
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,600
Reporter Lu said

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,960
it'll be on tomorrow headlines,

292
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,080
annoucing it to the world.

293
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
What's wrong with you?

294
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Why don't you have any reaction

295
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,280
to such a

296
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,440
happy matter?

297
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,750
No,

298
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,950
because

299
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,940
Luo Tian has already told me.

300
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,060
That...

301
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,700
Brother Sun and Sister Wen went out to buy groceries.

302
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,180
Today, Brother Sun will be cooking.

303
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,180
We can all have a good meal.

304
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,170
I'll call Brother Kong over since

305
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,290
Brother Sun is cooking prok ribs.

306
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,490
I'll go get change first.

307
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,160
Lin Yi Xuan,

308
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
did you do that on purpose?

309
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,800
Pei Xi,what are you doing?

310
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,350
You lad, get up.

311
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,350
No. Ouch, it hurts.

312
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,350
How did you get your job done?

313
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,990
What's happening

314
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,710
between Qiu Ying and Ji Xiang Kong?

315
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,660
Ever since Mi Ya was hospitalised,

316
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
Brother Kong never come back in the day,

317
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,420
only returns in the night.

318
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,780
Don't even mention us,

319
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,380
Qiu Ying and him

320
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
don't even talk much.

321
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,660
This Ji Xiang Kong...

322
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,540
I'll go take a look at her.

323
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,120
Are you willing to always

324
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,000
be with me?

325
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,140
Qiu Ying, it's me.

326
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,660
I'm coming in.

327
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
Qiu Ying, are you okay?

328
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,510
Why didn't you tell me

329
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,630
when you've something on your mind?

330
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,750
You're so busy,

331
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,310
I don't want to give you more trouble.

332
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,430
What am I  busy with?

333
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,830
With that magazine company,

334
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
nobody will notice

335
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,430
if I were to go missing for 2 days.

336
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,110
Yi Yi,

337
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,860
I've something to discuss with you.

338
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,340
What is it?

339
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,260
Luo Tian

340
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,620
want me to return to Ji Guang

341
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,440
and be a commentator with him for the global finals..

342
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,800
Really?

343
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,160
You're to be the chinese commentator

344
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
with Luo Tian?

345
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
Qiu Ying, that's awesome.

346
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,200
You luck is really changing,

347
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,550
No

348
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,670
but

349
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,190
what happens to Phoenix

350
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,590
if you leave?

351
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
Who's going to be the leader?

352
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,380
Actually, it doesn't matter to Phoenix

353
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,020
whether I'm around or not.

354
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,620
Xiang Kong can't handle it.

355
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,970
There's still Pei Xi and Brother Sun.

356
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,090
Pei Xi?

357
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,850
Pei Xi, did I hear it wrongly?

358
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,770
The Pei Xi now

359
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:41,770
is no longer

360
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,290
the Pei Xi then.

361
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,650
If Xiang Kong were to leave,

362
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,530
Pei Xi is considered as half the captain.

363
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,840
Actually,

364
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
Phoenix doesn't need me.

365
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,070
Qiu Ying, tell me honestly.

366
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,670
What happened between you

367
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,910
and Ji Xiang Kong?

368
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,100
Is that Ji Xiang Kong back together

369
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,220
with Mi Ya again?

370
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,060
Yi Yi, don't make wild guesses.

371
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,100
I considered completing my mission

372
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,170
with where Phoenix is at today.

373
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,650
I should return

374
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,130
to the stage of my dreams.

375
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,320
Although I've never been in a relationship,

376
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,440
but

377
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,920
I understand

378
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
how you're feeling now.

379
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,540
It doesn't do the 3 of you

380
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,380
any good if this continues

381
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,780
but

382
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,020
I'll support you in whatever

383
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,940
decision you made.

384
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,500
Thank you , Yi Yi,

385
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,380
Here,

386
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,540
our Xiao Ying Zi is the best.

387
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,540
Don;t be unhappy anymore.

388
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,260
I'll always be with you.

389
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,830
Brother Kong,

390
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,150
you're finally back.

391
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,030
Where's the rest?

392
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,030
Why am I sleeping here?

393
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,510
We celebrated for

394
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,470
Qiu Ying last night,

395
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,710
all of us slept too late.

396
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,110
What celebration?

397
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,470
Don't you know?

398
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,540
The matter of tactic leakage

399
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,380
has been checked.

400
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,900
Ji Guang

401
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,620
and the committee of Iconquer

402
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,900
has apologised to Qiu Ying.

403
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,820
Why didn't

404
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,760
you notify me about this?

405
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
I thought you knew!

406
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
I have to scold you a little,

407
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,440
you're going overboard recently.

408
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,040
You aren't showing concern for Qiu Ying.

409
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,510
Look, what a great lady.

410
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,710
What time is it now

411
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,750
and breakfast is already ready.

412
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,900
Why does everyone have one?

413
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,780
What's this?

414
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,130
No,

415
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,530
what's happening?

416
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,970
Where's she?

417
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:06,930
Where's she?

418
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,970
I don't know.

419
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,690
She was still

420
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,930
around yesterday night.

421
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,330
Ah Xuan, what happened?

422
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,440
Did you see Qiu Ying?

423
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,280
No. Xiang Kong, you're back.

424
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,440
Impossible,

425
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
you slept later than me yesterday.

426
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
Yes, she was still around last night.

427
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,070
No,

428
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,540
Brother Kong...

429
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Where did my Sister go?

430
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,020
When did Xiang Kong come back?

431
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,300
What is it?

432
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,420
Xia Ling and Pei Xi,

433
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,140
come over.

434
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,420
Qiu Ying left,

435
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,020
she left us a letter each.

436
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,980
Pei Xi's.

437
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,940
Brother Sun,

438
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
I've discussed it with Sister Wen.

439
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,500
She will be

440
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,580
taking over the leader role.

441
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,050
Ah Xuan,

442
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,090
you're smelly socks are all washed.

443
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,930
It's a total of 18 pairs,

444
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,970
it's enough to last you till

445
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,510
the global finals.

446
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,990
Also, about you and Yi Yi.

447
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,510
I want to help you

448
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,990
confess if you don't hurry.

449
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,470
Pei Xi, look behind you.

450
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,950
You have so many teammates behind you.

451
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,550
You won't have to be

452
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,830
alone in the future.

453
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,510
Xia Ling,

454
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,510
from the moment you threw your clutches

455
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,430
away during the finals,

456
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,510
I know that

457
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,780
you'll never

458
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,380
be defeated by anything else.

459
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,220
All the best, I'll be waiting for you in the global finals.

460
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,140
Gu Jia Yi

461
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,100
came personally to cheer for you,

462
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,520
aren't you

463
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,000
going to express something?

464
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,280
Qiu Ying

465
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
just left like that,

466
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,320
not even a bye was said.

467
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,880
It hurts more

468
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
to bid farewell.

469
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
Why don't I ask Lu Yi Yi?

470
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,520
Let them settle

471
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,190
the problem between themselves.

472
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,790
Xiang Kong,

473
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,380
I've already left by the time

474
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,020
you're reading this letter.

475
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,340
I thank the heavens

476
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,780
for letting us meet

477
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,140
at the lowest point

478
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,500
of our lives,

479
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,970
walking through the storm together.

480
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,050
Now,

481
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,810
you have things you need to do

482
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,090
and responsiblities you need to bear.

483
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,890
I don't want to be a burden to you.

484
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,690
Also, I've received

485
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,930
Ji Guang's invitation

486
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,050
to be the Chinese commentator for

487
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,170
this year's global finals.

488
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,440
I believe you'll be

489
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,120
happy for me that I'll be fulfilling my dreams.

490
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,480
No matter what the future holds,

491
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,240
I will not forget

492
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,240
our promise

493
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,550
to get to the peak of the world

494
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,030
to see nicer sceneries.

495
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,190
See you at the global finals.

496
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,750
I believe you

497
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,630
will be able to stand at the peak of the world.

498
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,910
The I hope that you'll

499
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,990
be the one standing on the commentary table

500
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,350
announcing it to the world

501
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,910
that our China team

502
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,350
won the championship that day.

503
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,630
It's a deal.

504
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,190
It's a deal.

505
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Hello, your coffee.

506
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,080
Alone today?

507
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,750
Where's your Girlfriend?

508
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,410
No,

509
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,450
you're about to leave

510
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,210
and Ji Xiang Kong

511
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,210
has yet to contact you.

512
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,730
This bastard.

513
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:50,810
Is he

514
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,210
intending to take care of Mi Ya forever?

515
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:54,880
Okay,

516
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,760
he's only doing

517
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,920
what he should.

518
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,230
Take care of yourself

519
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,870
and sleep early.

520
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,990
Don't you worry about me.

521
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,940
Alright.

522
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,340
I'll send you off

523
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,460
when the car comes later.

524
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,060
I'll go get change first.

525
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,940
Go ahead.

526
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,640
Take good care of yourself.

527
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,100
you too.

528
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,210
Morning.

529
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:28,930
Morning.

530
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,730
Morning.

531
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,650
Morning, Borhter Sun.

532
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,810
Eat breakfast.

533
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,410
Morning, Ah Xuan.

534
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,470
I'll wake him up, you eat up first.

535
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,670
Wake up and have breakfast.

536
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,830
Eat up.

537
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,550
Who was it one snoring last night?

538
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,150
I couldn't sleep.

539
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,630
Brother Sun, was it you?

540
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,150
It's definitely not me.

541
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,230
Don't lie.

542
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,470
Older people likes to snore,

543
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,190
I know.

544
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,580
Breakfast is not bad.

545
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,780
Sister Wen, you're here.

546
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,380
How nice.

547
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,380
Seems like the few of you can manage

548
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,380
yourselves pretty well.

549
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,560
Pei Xi did it?

550
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I did it with Brother Sun.

551
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Next time,

552
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,800
you guys can practice at ease.

553
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Such things like breakfast

554
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,840
will be handled by me.

555
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Okay.

556
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,440
Sister Wen, are you

557
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,150
here to be our leader?

558
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,750
Why? Am I not welcome?

559
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,470
No,

560
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,260
welcome.

561
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,780
Oh, Qiu Ying

562
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,900
told me about Xia ling and your

563
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,980
bad habits.

564
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,930
No, that's impossible.

565
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,130
-We're obedient.         -Yes.

566
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:58,970
We're doomed,

567
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,570
a scarier one came this time.

568
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,090
Sister Wen, Ah Xuan said you...

569
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,730
Of course we welcome you.

570
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,730
Cut the crap,

571
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,450
there's 3 minutes more

572
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,010
for breakfast.

573
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,730
Training will start at 8am.

574
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,530
Noted.

575
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,320
This is

576
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,830
the venue for our global final.

577
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,350
You've worked hard.

578
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,030
This is our commentary table.

579
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,390
It's so cool.

580
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,660
Not bad right?

581
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,900
Imagine

582
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,500
the audience cheering

583
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,780
for the team

584
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,220
from this angle.

585
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,260
Feel like it's a huge change

586
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,540
from a year ago.

587
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,660
A year ago?

588
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,780
I was still a small host from

589
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,940
You Xing.

590
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,250
I thought  I was good enough to be a host

591
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,250
after playing a few rounds of Iconquer.

592
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,330
Who knows

593
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,490
that the silly girl

594
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,290
that was laughed at by everyone

595
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,920
will be able to become

596
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,440
the commentator for Iconquer global finals.

597
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,480
To be honest,

598
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,840
you're really my idol then.

599
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,840
Then

600
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,380
how did you become my partner now?

601
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,980
I work hard.

602
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,540
Preparations will

603
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,380
officially start

604
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,700
tomorrow.

605
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,100
Why?

606
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,580
You're afraid that I'll be a burden?

607
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,060
You're no longer the

608
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,460
Qiu Ying that waits for me in the rain

609
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,820
just to pass me video reviews.

610
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,540
Your understanding

611
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,860
towards Iconquer now is nothing

612
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
less than anyone else

613
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,540
especially

614
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,380
those video reviews you showed me

615
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,700
when you were the leader of Phoenix.

616
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Pretty interesting.

617
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,890
I heard what happened beween

618
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,610
you and Xiang Kong.

619
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,720
If you don't mind sharing,

620
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,310
I can be your

621
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,510
listening ear anytime.

622
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,910
Weirdly,

623
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,190
I don't seem to be as upset.

624
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,190
Knowing him

625
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,510
is the best thing that

626
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,710
happened in my life.

627
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,500
He started me on my dream,

628
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,980
brought me to see better views

629
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,360
and allowed me to be braver

630
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,840
to climb up higher mountains.

631
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,360
Let's go, we'll take a look there.

632
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,780
Why are you still listening to these?

633
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,580
I want to understand Xiang Kong more.

634
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,260
It's as if

635
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,780
he's with me.

636
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,290
Enough, rest now. Don't listen anymore.

637
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,050
You can see?

638
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,170
Wait,

639
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,490
let me get the doctor.

640
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,410
Tony,

641
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,240
can you

642
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,880
keep this as a secret?

643
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,860
What are you thinking? drink some.

644
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,100
Luo Tian called me in the afternoon,

645
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,260
He said that Qiu Ying and him have checked in

646
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,620
the hotel beside the competition venue.

647
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
It's good that everything is going well for her.

648
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,770
Mi Ya and Qiu Ying,

649
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,370
one is responsiblity

650
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,570
and the other is love.

651
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,770
It's difficult to choose.

652
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,420
Qiu Ying chose to leave

653
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,580
as she wants to give you more space,

654
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,100
she doesn't want you to compete

655
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,340
with many things in your head.

656
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,780
I know,

657
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,220
but I'm not as

658
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,460
conflicted as she thinks I am.

659
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,500
So I wanted to stop her

660
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,660
yesterday,

661
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
to tell her my promise towards her

662
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,020
has never change.

663
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,300
I just want to hold her hand

664
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,980
and get to the peak of the world.

665
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,300
Before Mi Ya's issue

666
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,580
is settled,

667
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,740
Idon't want her to feel burden

668
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,090
because of my promise.

669
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,210
I don't want her to give up

670
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,370
her dream as a commentator because of me.

671
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,650
The both of you

672
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,710
think too much,

673
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,590
considering for each other

674
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,430
but I want to remind you

675
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,110
to not be

676
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,110
like me then.

677
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,790
Keeping what I want to say in my heart for so long,

678
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,270
missing out all those years

679
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,550
with the one I love.

680
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,670
No,

681
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,310
I'll settle everything

682
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,110
properly,

683
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,590
I'll not give up on her.

684
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,630
I believe you, drink up!

685
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,660
Doctor,

686
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,100
how is Mi Ya's situation now?

687
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,740
She just did a check up this morning,

688
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,940
the blood clot in her head

689
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,940
has gotten better.

690
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,240
How about her eyes?

691
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,040
Although the blood clot has gotten better,

692
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,640
but her symptoms

693
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,960
aren't getting better.

694
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,440
There's 2 reasons for this.

695
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,000
What reasons?

696
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,480
One of it is psychology

697
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,560
but such situation usually goes away

698
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,560
naturally after some time.

699
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
The other is

700
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,320
that her visual nerve

701
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,160
is permanently damaged.

702
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,030
What you mean is

703
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,150
she'll never recover?

704
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,160
Why didn't you ask for the nurse?

705
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,000
Xiang Kong?

706
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,670
Thank you.

707
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,980
I didn't visit you because

708
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,460
I was busy with training recently.

709
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,380
It's okay, competition is important.

710
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,100
When does your

711
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,460
competition start?

712
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,820
Tomorrow afternoon.

713
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,940
If only

714
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,940
I can watch you play at the venue.

715
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,170
You will, after you eyes recovers.

716
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,170
Actually,

717
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,450
I can go now.

718
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,130
Even if I were to just sit in the audience to listen,

719
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,730
I want to witness

720
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,760
the moment you get champion.

721
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,680
Wait till i get into the finals,

722
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,280
I'll invite you over to watch.

723
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,600
Really?

724
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,040
Okay.

725
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,740
I heard fromTony

726
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,380
that the tactic leakage issue

727
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,660
is settled.

728
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,540
Qiu Ying returned to Ji Guang.

729
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,300
She's not the

730
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,250
Chinese commentator for the global finals.

731
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,410
Did Qiu Ying left Phoenix

732
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,430
because of me?

733
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:48,390
Commentary

734
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,110
has always been her dream.

735
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,030
Don't think too much.

736
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,270
Xiang Kong, you're so busy.

737
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,510
Actually, you don't

738
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,990
have to come and visit me.

739
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,310
It's not your fault

740
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,550
that I can't see.

741
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,070
You don't have to feel guilty.

742
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,820
Mi Ya,

743
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,440
I'll take care of you till

744
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,080
your eyes recovers.

745
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,600
Thank you, Xiang Kong.

746
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,320
I wouldn't know what to do

747
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,790
if it's not for you.
