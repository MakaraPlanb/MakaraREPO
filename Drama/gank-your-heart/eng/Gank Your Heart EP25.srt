00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,525
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,325
Episode Twenty-Five

3
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:03,900
I am sorry.

4
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,075
Yesterday,

5
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,725
I sprained my ankle by accident.

6
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,700
It's fine.

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Take a seat.

8
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,675
Hello.

9
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:27,800
Your strawberry milktea.

10
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:38,800
Actually,

11
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,750
the news about you and Xiangkong,

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,775
I've already known

13
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:46,350
before you attend the Rising Star.

14
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:49,750
When I saw your pictures online,

15
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,275
I have a feeling that

16
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,225
you and he

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,900
are not just gossip.

18
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,575
That's why I asked you

19
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,075
to the fan meeting.

20
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,650
I want to talk with you.

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,325
He never mention

22
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,600
the things between you two to me.

23
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,200
So,

24
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,150
I put us in such a awkward position.

25
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,525
You like him?

26
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:34,800
I do.

27
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,275
I like him.

28
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,800
But so far,

29
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,350
we are just friends.

30
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,700
I know.

31
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,825
Some things

32
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,425
even he didn't say,

33
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:57,475
I know as well.

34
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,400
Because we grew up together.

35
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:06,550
No one knows us better than each other.

36
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,600
Does the feelings of you two

37
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,800
really like what is written in Beyond the Sky?

38
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,625
Beyond the Sky

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,125
is originallly for him.

40
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:31,850
This song

41
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,863
records the hardest

42
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,625
but also the sweetest days of us.

43
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,425
I became a trainee,

44
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,550
so he applied to be an exchange student.

45
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:51,075
Near my company,

46
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,400
he rent a room 

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,225
which is only twelve square meters

48
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,225
After coming back from school everyday,

49
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,050
he cooked for me.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,000
During the weekends,

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,025
he accompanied me to the theatre，

52
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,800
rehearsing,

53
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,650
performing.

54
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,225
I feel so tired.

55
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,475
I can't hold on anymore.

56
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,900
Even we might fail,

57
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,000
be laughed at.

58
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,325
Yes.

59
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,675
It feels bad indeed.

60
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,025
But we are still supporting each other.

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,350
At that time,

62
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,850
We have nothing

63
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:38,625
but each other.

64
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:41,525
Xiangkong he said that

65
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,425
he will always be on my side.

66
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,125
Forever.

67
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,200
Later on,

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
I started to become popular.

69
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,300
My company forbiden me from dating .

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,050
Xiangkong, he

71
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,700
chose to leave

72
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,575
for my career development.

73
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,650
Till now,

74
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,975
we never meet again.

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,525
But my every concert,

76
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,350
he came.

77
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,975
You see.

78
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,250
Right now, I finally succeed.

79
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,500
I can give him support.

80
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,275
Help him realize his dream.

81
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,100
We accompanied each other

82
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:25,500
through the whole youth.

83
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,400
Qiu Ying.

84
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,900
Can you understand

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,275
our feelings?

86
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,725
Sorry, miss Fu.

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,875
I am going back to work now.

88
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,400
But don't worry.

89
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,950
I won't step in your relationship again.

90
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,550
Thanks for your coffee.

91
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,550
Bye.

92
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,175
This version of Holy Spirit Princess

93
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,100
seems to be strengthen.

94
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,950
You did some preparation.

95
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:00,525
Qiu Ying.

96
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:09,925
What's wrong?

97
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,250
Your confession failed?

98
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,300
Qiu Ying refused you?

99
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,925
Captain Ji.

100
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,700
Couch.

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,625
Is it because of Pei Xi?

102
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,075
Say something.

103
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,450
This is the line-up of the Polaris in three games.

104
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,125
They often use Worm Queen

105
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,000
and Gorgon,

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
these two group control heroes.

107
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,525
But there is also one weakness.

108
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:49,600
They have really long cooldown 

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,500
after ultimate ability.

110
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,925
That means we need to fight back

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,705
when the ultimate ability is still at cooldown.

112
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,825
No problem.

113
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,150
Qi Yue.

114
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,600
Say your opinion.

115
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,450
Say your opinion.

116
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,025
It's already very clear.

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
You are the captain.

118
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,800
You decide the tactics.

119
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,325
We just listen.

120
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,350
The captain already explained the tactics very clear.

121
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,225
Nothing but

122
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,775
me and the captain trick the ultimate ability,

123
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,725
brother Qi cuts back.

124
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,175
Later at the training game,

125
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,225
pay special attention

126
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,050
on entrance time

127
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,675
The game tomorrow is extremely important.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,675
If we lose,

129
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,375
we will proceed into the losers bracket.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,725
Qi Yue.

131
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,550
Do you understand?

132
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,800
Clear.

133
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,150
Are you done?

134
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,500
My mom is at the hotel.

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,700
Can I find her?

136
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,000
Teacher Can.

137
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,000
Have you seen the shift schedule 

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,975
these days?

139
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,225
Qiu Ying suddenly rose 

140
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,400
from assistant to commentary stage.

141
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,864
Who can believe she is not pulling strings?

142
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,375
This thing.

143
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,550
You have to think like this.

144
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,900
Even Qiu Ying gets this through the back door,

145
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,975
she is the one picked by teacher Luo.

146
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,350
Who can say no?

147
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:31,650
Even…

148
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,125
Even chairman Guo

149
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,900
needs to show respect for Luo Tian.

150
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,600
These few months, at the commentary stage,

151
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,800
I learnt so much from you.

152
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:49,600
We can't watch others use tricks to move up.

153
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,625
I am personally trained by you.

154
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:55,875
Can you help me?

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Help me find a way.

156
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,000
Qiao Xin. Don't worry.

157
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,100
Right?

158
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,675
I will definitely help you.

159
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,050
But the playoffs have began.

160
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,325
We can only let it be right now.

161
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,375
Don't worry. Later on,

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,450
I will definitely find a way for you.

163
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,125
OK?

164
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,450
I have to use the bathroom. 

165
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:28,975
OK.

166
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:34,450
Go with me first.

167
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:35,475
Go with me first.

168
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,650
Wait. Where are you going?

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,150
Release me.

170
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,375
Why are you with that Can again?

171
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,675
Explain it clear to me.

172
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,575
What's your attitude?

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,450
What attitude I have?

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,975
Then, what's your attitude?

175
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,325
Why not reply my WeChat?

176
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,875
If I wasn't happen to meet you,

177
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,050
is it even hard to see you once?

178
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,725
Didn't you see? I am at work.

179
00:11:58,525 --> 00:11:59,800
Drinking coffee with other man 

180
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,025
is called work?

181
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,475
Look at yourself.

182
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,100
Do you feel embarrassed for shouting out loud?

183
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,200
If you really have capability,

184
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,975
do I need to drink coffee with other man?

185
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,025
I already told you.

186
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,350
The development potential of UXStar is limited.

187
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,650
I need to find a place at GDV.

188
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,850
Right now, Qiu Ying

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,575
already won the backing of Luo Tian.

190
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,200
If I don't find a way to save myself,

191
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,850
can you help me?

192
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,425
You are finally telling the truth.

193
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,525
In your heart,

194
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,000
I am just a loser.

195
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,850
Or what?

196
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,750
All these years,

197
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,050
have you done anything for me?

198
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,225
Right now, everyone stays here,

199
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,600
Don't bother me.

200
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:00,275
Qiao Xin.

201
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,050
Release me.

202
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,100
Qiao Xin.

203
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,550
All these years, I care for you .

204
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,875
But what about you?

205
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,550
Who do you think I am?

206
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,325
I can't stand anymore.

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,875
Then, let's break up.

208
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,600
I didn't beg you to stay with me.

209
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,875
You are finished.

210
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,775
Director.

211
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:55,700
We are going to the training first.

212
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,925
Where is Qi Yue?

213
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,225
Director LI.

214
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,250
There is a thing

215
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,775
I want to talk with you.

216
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:09,400
Qi Yue is your apprentice.

217
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,000
He only listens to you at VNG.

218
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,975
Xiangkong.

219
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,200
Just say whatever you think.

220
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:16,284
If he is really with his mother,

221
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:17,600
It's fine to leave.

222
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,675
If he uses this as an excuse 

223
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,100
to stay with his girlfriend and influences training.

224
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,625
That's a different story.

225
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,375
Xiangkong.

226
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,600
Right now is the key moment for VNG.

227
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,800
You and Qi Yue are both indispensable.

228
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,250
I don't want you two having any misunderstanding

229
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,225
at this time.

230
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,550
Director Li. If this is really a misunderstanding,

231
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:35,875
I would like to apologize to Qi Yue.

232
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,925
But if it's not,

233
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,225
I hope you can alert him.

234
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:43,450
OK.

235
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:44,550
I understand.

236
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,450
I am going to the training first.

237
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,125
The Polaris is a relatively forceful team.

238
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,275
They like to destroy inhibitor in a short time.

239
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,750
From their average damage per game

240
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,650
Three of them are over thousand.

241
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,075
You did really well on data analysis.

242
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,700
But not comprehensive enough.

243
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:05,975
Well.

244
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,100
Let's eat first.

245
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:07,950
After eating,

246
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,725
I will help you organize them.

247
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,525
OK.

248
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,975
Xiangkong.

249
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,100
You are here for Qiu Ying.

250
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,750
Qiu Ying.

251
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,775
Can I talk with you privately?

252
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,550
Sorry.

253
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:32,925
I am busy right now.

254
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,375
Teacher Luo.

255
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,050
I still have some questions.

256
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,100
I am going back first.

257
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,750
Then,

258
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:47,725
I am also back to work.

259
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,075
Brother Qi, you are finally back.

260
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,100
Director Li.

261
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,225
Is Qi Yue back?

262
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:09,850
Don't know.

263
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,300
He is probably with his mom.

264
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:13,350
What is he doing?

265
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,550
He doesn't answer the call

266
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,500
nor the text message.

267
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,300
He probably forgets to bring his phone.

268
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,350
Then tell me when he comes back,

269
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,225
OK.

270
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:22,050
Go to sleep early.

271
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,150
Director Li. Goodbye.

272
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,925
Why don't you answer my call, brother Qi?

273
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,900
Go out for a while?

274
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,250
I took a look at Qi Yue.

275
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,950
I heard Qi Yue leave earlier today again.

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,050
Yes.

277
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,150
His mom is not familiar with this area,

278
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,150
needs his company.

279
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,850
Isn't it 

280
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,275
because of 

281
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:09,875
something else？

282
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,025
Are you so distrustful to Qi Yue?

283
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:14,400
I am going to sleep.

284
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,475
Li Gan.

285
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,275
I am caring for Qi Yue.

286
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,275
Can we talk?

287
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,050
It's not early.

288
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:24,900
There is game tomorrow.

289
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,200
Go to sleep early.

290
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:53,075
Qi Yue.

291
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,175
What's wrong?

292
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:57,950
Why have you drank so much?

293
00:17:58,475 --> 00:17:59,125
Don't bother me.

294
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,425
Qi Yue.

295
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:01,825
Tomorrow is the competition.

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,850
What's wrong with you?

297
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,775
Wake up.

298
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:07,850
Sister Wen.

299
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,075
Am I a loser?

300
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,850
Why does Qiao Xin treat me like this?

301
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,625
Qi Yue, you are drunk.

302
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,675
Let me take you to your room.

303
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,050
You tell her.

304
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,450
There is a day.

305
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,000
I will let the whole world know 

306
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,725
she is my woman.

307
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,525
Look at him by yourself.

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,575
Qi Yue.

309
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:32,350
Go back.

310
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,600
Shut up.

311
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,100
Why does Qiao Xin treat me like this?

312
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,400
I give her whatever she wants.

313
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:40,475
Go away.

314
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:43,600
Li Gan.

315
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,075
Did you hear that?

316
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,800
Tomorrow is the game.

317
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,900
He is drunk like this.

318
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,600
Dare not cause any trouble.

319
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:07,575
Brother Qi.

320
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,250
Get up.

321
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:16,825
Master.

322
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,625
Did you see that?

323
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,225
Teacher Luo.

324
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,675
At my first live commentary,

325
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:46,925
I alway standed here for a while.

326
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,925
Only look down from this angle,

327
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,375
you can feel more responsible.

328
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,625
The competition is about to start.

329
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,350
Let's do the preparation.

330
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:00,350
OK.

331
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:10,950
I know first time being the commentator.

332
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,275
You must feel really nervous.

333
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:13,450
Later, during the commentary,

334
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,900
try to calm down.

335
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,250
Don't rush to talk.

336
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,100
Be sure to say

337
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,125
the accurate data.

338
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,800
If you are not confident with your memory,

339
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,425
review your notebook first.

340
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:29,275
Teacher Luo.

341
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,375
The director An is looking for you.

342
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,700
Ok.

343
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,125
I go there for a while.

344
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:33,975
You prepare first.

345
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,275
Let's go.

346
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,125
Qiu Ying. Let's talk.

347
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,775
Let's talk outside.

348
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,175
Qiu Ying. fighting.

349
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:13,925
This is your first time

350
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
on the commentary stage.

351
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:17,475
You've waited for so long for this day.

352
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,000
Don't be nervous.

353
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,675
Show your ability.

354
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,075
Thanks.

355
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,950
Good luck on your competition too. 

356
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,450
Right.

357
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,625
The motorcycle model you gave me,

358
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:40,600
I really like it.

359
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:42,125
Thank you.

360
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,800
That's just a gift to thank 

361
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,375
for your support all along.

362
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,100
There is no other meaning.

363
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,475
OK. I am leaving first.

364
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,625
You also go back to your lounge.

365
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,750
Qiu Ying.

366
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,500
I know

367
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,450
I shouldn't bother you at this time.

368
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:23,075
But

369
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,675
after the game,

370
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,400
can we have a talk?

371
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,050
OK.

372
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,150
Let's take Yiyi and Lin Yixuan with us.

373
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,175
We haven't gathered for a while.

374
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,225
I mean…

375
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,000
Just two of us.

376
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:48,925
Can we?

377
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,100
Let's talk about this after the game.

378
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,025
What are you looking for, Qiu Ying?

379
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,525
Zheng.

380
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:35,950
My notebook is missing.

381
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,100
All my prepared words

382
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,025
and competition analysis are in there.

383
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:41,800
You lost such an important thing?

384
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,150
I just went out for a while.

385
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:45,375
I remember I just

386
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,775
put it on the desk.

387
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,750
See how can you still show off?

388
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,750
Qiao Xin.

389
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:06,525
The game is about to start.

390
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,525
What are you doing here?

391
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:12,550
Teacher Luo.

392
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,025
I am doing nothing.

393
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,225
I just throw a garbage.

394
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,875
I am going up to prepare.

395
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:26,550
Zheng.

396
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,175
The game is about to start.

397
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:29,100
Aren't you suppose at the analysis stage

398
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,925
doing preparation?

399
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:37,150
I will go now.

400
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:43,725
What happened?

401
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:44,625
What are you looking for?

402
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,100
No…No…Nothing.

403
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,125
Can's partner is not feeling well in a sudden.

404
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,575
They can't find someone to substitute.

405
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,350
So later on,

406
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,175
we commentary stage

407
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:55,025
needs to cooperate with

408
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,350
Can's live host.

409
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,450
Cooperate with the host？

410
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,375
Right.

411
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,000
These emergencies happen a lot during live shows.

412
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:04,975
But it's fine.

413
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,875
Later, you just follow my pace.

414
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,625
This is the host draft.

415
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,425
You take a look first.

416
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:10,350
Right. Right.

417
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:30,850
Brother Qi.

418
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,150
Are you alright?

419
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,275
Drink some water.

420
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,225
Why have you drank do much alcohol?

421
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,800
What should I do?

422
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,075
Sister Wen saw all these.

423
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:49,075
I don't know the details.

424
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,275
But the thing between you and Qiao Xin,

425
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:53,825
president Li should know.

426
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,050
I think

427
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,175
sister Wen is fine.

428
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,075
This will influence the game.

429
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,375
Of course not.

430
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:03,975
You are so important at our team.

431
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,525
How could this influence the game?

432
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:07,450
You are right.

433
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,475
I am indispensable at VNG now.

434
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:11,850
The game is about to start.

435
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:12,875
Let's go.

436
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,900
Where is Qi Yue?

437
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
He is in the bathroom.

438
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,425
Sister Wen.

439
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:35,650
Master.

440
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,100
Play well in the game.

441
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,725
Don't worry.

442
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:42,800
Trust me.

443
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,050
Show your best mode during today’s game.

444
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,500
I am confident with you.

445
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,350
Don't worry, sister Wen.

446
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,225
We met Polaris before during regular season.

447
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,325
We all know them well.

448
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,375
OK.

449
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:58,450
You guys, cheer up！

450
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,550
Welcome, every summoner

451
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,400
to the site of 2018 fall season playoffs.

452
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,875
I am your old friend,

453
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,825
Luo Tian.

454
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,875
Hello everyone.

455
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,025
I am your new friend,

456
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,775
Qiu Ying.

457
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,300
After two months of competitions,

458
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,425
the top four teams

459
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,800
are in the playoffs already.

460
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,000
This playoffs,

461
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,075
we use double-elimination tournament.

462
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,725
Two consecutive defeats result in elimination.

463
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,425
Today is the first match of 2018 IConquer playoffs.

464
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:25,325
At the regular season,

465
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,150
the old strong team VNG

466
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,750
which set the record of a 11-game-straight win,

467
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,725
versus dark horse Polaris.

468
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,900
Miya.

469
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,000
Sister Wen.

470
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,675
Why are you here today?

471
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,225
I am here to support Xiangkong.

472
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,100
Thanks for your support.

473
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:03,800
Miya.

474
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,650
The popular singer Miya is at the site.

475
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,325
Miya. Miya.

476
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:13,650
Sorry.

477
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:14,400
Thanks everyone. Thanks.

478
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:15,175
Don't take photos first.

479
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,700
This is a private time.

480
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,375
Thanks everyone.

481
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,650
You all can sit down first 

482
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:19,550
to support this game.

483
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,950
Everyone, please watch the game first, OK?

484
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,650
Thanks.

485
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,925
Thanks everyone. Thanks everyone.

486
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,000
Qiu Ying.

487
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,075
Your first time being commentator.

488
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:25,975
You are so lucky.

489
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,625
It seems like our Qiu Ying

490
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,700
has already been overwhelmed 

491
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:31,375
by the enthusiasm at the site.

492
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,725
This is really a surprise

493
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:33,400
to our playoffs.

494
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,150
Can.

495
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,800
Such a great surprise.

496
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,000
It's time for you to do the interview.

497
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,825
Why the big star also

498
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,025
likes to come along for the ride?

499
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:41,875
Welcome the famous singer,

500
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:43,150
Miya!

501
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,425
Let's welcome her.

502
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,250
Actually, I come here today

503
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,250
to be an ordinary audience

504
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,075
to feel 

505
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:53,750
the passion at the competition site.

506
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:56,225
Can't believe everyone is so enthusiastic.

507
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:57,925
Then you are here today.

508
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,650
I can't miss this opportunity.

509
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,025
I want to gossip.

510
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,625
Between two teams, which one do you support?

511
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:06,275
I am a fan of VNG.

512
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,675
Because I heard that,

513
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,100
during the regular season,

514
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,400
they set the record of a 11-game-straight win.

515
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,175
I really really admire

516
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,125
this passionate,

517
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,350
powerful team.

518
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,575
Which teammate do you support the most in VNG?

519
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,300
VNG's captain.

520
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,375
Ji Xiangkong.

521
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:30,875
Can't believe that

522
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:31,725
Miya is also

523
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,450
a fan of VNG

524
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,950
and a fan of Ji Xiangkong.

525
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,250
What's wrong with you?

526
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,450
Are you uncomfortable?

527
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,750
Sorry. Teacher Luo.

528
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,975
I just lost control of myself.

529
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,825
The game is about to start.

530
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:46,050
Adjust your mood.

531
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,950
Relax. Don't be too nervous.

532
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:58,200
thanks.

533
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,050
Let's welcome both teams to enter.

534
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,150
Welcome everyone.

535
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,725
Both teams take a seat please.

536
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,575
Based on the points earned in regular season,

537
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:02,000
Polaris ranks the fourth.

538
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,850
Also, during the regular season,

539
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,450
two teams

540
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,550
already competed once.

541
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,380
VNG defeated Polaris with two to zero.

542
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,250
Indeed.

543
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,550
After entering the playoffs,

544
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,475
it's a new start.

545
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,650
For all four teams,

546
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,000
every game is a life-and-death fight.

547
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,500
I believe Polaris today

548
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:17,975
will not give up easily.

549
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,125
don't save your passion,

551
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,925
cheer for the team you support.

552
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,875
Xiangkong, fighting!

553
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,125
I am coming. Coming.

554
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,200
Follow. Follow.

555
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:35,750
Go. Go. Go. Focus fire. Fire. Fire.

556
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,575
You farm for a while.

557
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:37,450
I will protect you. Protect yo.

558
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,175
I can't farm.

559
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:38,650
Can't farm.

560
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,325
Can't farm.

561
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:40,675
Qi Yue, what are you doing?

562
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:42,350
Can't farm for such a long time.

563
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,325
Mind your own business.

564
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:44,825
Sorry. Sorry.

565
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:45,625
It's my problem.

566
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,200
Qi Yue is so pool during this round.

567
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,675
He has been forced to farm in the jungle.

568
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:50,275
Polaris seems 

569
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,125
unwilling to let him go.

570
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,500
Two supports invade jungle directly.

571
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,250
Level six double supports.

572
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,250
What is the jungler doing?

573
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,425
Why not wandering around right now?

574
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:58,325
Right now.

575
00:33:58,975 --> 00:33:59,950
Don't worry. Don't worry.

576
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:08,200
I am being caught.

577
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,875
Aid. Aid.

578
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:09,550
Qi Yue has been caught.

579
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,675
He has been caught by two heroes from the other side.

580
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,725
It seems like Qi Yue is going to be taken.

581
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:14,600
True.

582
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,600
Right now, he has been suppressed harshly.

583
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,575
He can't farm at all.

584
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,525
Actually, at around this tenth minutes point,

585
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,000
is VNG

586
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,450
Double Moon's wandering time.

587
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,475
But clearly,

588
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:23,675
in this round, Qi Yue has been focused.

589
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,475
He hasn't reached level six in the eighth minute.

590
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,625
The data right now

591
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,475
is not unfavourable.

592
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:33,875
According to the data in the past,

593
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,550
actually Qi Yue's

594
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,000
average time to reach level six

595
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,050
is seven minutes.

596
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,325
Six to seven minutes.

597
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,000
The wandering time of Double Moon

598
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,850
is about ten minutes.

599
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,050
They should already farmed.

600
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:44,200
The KP% of the team 

601
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,400
is high at seventy five percent.

602
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,950
Comparing to the KP% of Polaris…

603
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:48,975
Seventy five percent.

604
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:50,975
But compared with double Moon's 

605
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:52,775
ninety three percent of KP rate,

606
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,600
there is still a big difference.

607
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,375
But this round,

608
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,175
Double Moon's KP% 

609
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:00,125
will decrease.

610
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,875
According to the Mid at Polaris right now,

611
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:02,850
economy per minute is

612
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,800
four hundred eighty-four.

613
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:05,375
They already surpassed Qi Yue.

614
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,200
His original

615
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,475
economy per minute should be 

616
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,275
around five hundred and eight.

617
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,475
But right now it's only four hundred and sixty-five.

618
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:12,425
In the situation of 

619
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:13,575
lacking skill and equipment,

620
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:15,500
Qi Yue might not able to play his full role.

621
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,350
It's hard even initiate.

622
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,725
Polaris intentionally

623
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:19,750
split Double Moon.

624
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:20,875
Next group battle,

625
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,350
VNG will be at a disadvantage.

626
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,775
How is it now?

627
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:28,375
I am the MVP, 

628
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,600
so everyone targets on me, right?

629
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,825
Next time, when I call you,

630
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,700
come quickly, OK?

631
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:32,725
No. You are the one…

632
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:33,400
What?

633
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:41,200
See the state of Qi Yue.

634
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,050
The opponent is targeting him all the time.

635
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:44,875
Right?

636
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:46,350
Is he 

637
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,525
the first being targeted?

638
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:49,275
Double Moon 

639
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:50,925
is not a long-term plan anyway.

640
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,175
If he doesn't make any mistake,

641
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:52,875
Double Moon

642
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:53,700
in this game

643
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:54,625
has absolute advantage.

644
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,350
Shu Wen.

645
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,600
In this world,

646
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,475
nothing is absolute.

647
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:05,250
We can target here.

648
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,900
I hold it. I hold it.

649
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,200
Brother Qi, I am below you.

650
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:09,050
Brother Qi, walk your way.

651
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,700
Walk your way.

652
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:10,425
Back. Back.

653
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:11,150
Can't hit. Can't hit.

654
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,525
Go. Go. Go.

655
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,700
Back. Back. Back.  

656
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,550
Fight with them. Fight with them.

657
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,650
Push. Push. Push.

658
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,850
Push. Push. Push.

659
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:22,800
Fighting.

660
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,200
Congratulation to the Polaris

661
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,125
for winning this round first.

662
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:57,850
Next,

663
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,075
will VNG catch up

664
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,250
and have another match?

665
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,725
Let's rest for fifteen minutes.

666
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:03,650
Looking forward to the next game.

667
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:20,550
Explain to me.

668
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,925
You said two data wrong consecutively.

669
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,150
What's wrong with you?

670
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,750
Sorry, teacher Luo.

671
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,975
I didn't prepare my notes well.

672
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:35,125
Where is your notes?

673
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,850
It's missing.

674
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,125
Missing?

675
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,075
Sorry, teacher Luo.

676
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:48,825
I didn't keep them well.

677
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,750
Lift your head up.

678
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,850
Without notes,

679
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:57,650
you don't know how to do commentary?

680
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,150
No.

681
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,850
I am not confident without data.

682
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,750
To be a good commentator,

683
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:09,075
The most important ability

684
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:10,225
is adaptability,

685
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,925
not relying on data.

686
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
You don't need to stress too much.

687
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,975
Later, the part on data,

688
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:19,975
I will do it.

689
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,325
We are partners.

690
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,225
Later on,

691
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,400
if there is another emergency like this,

692
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,075
you need to tell me in the first time.

693
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:44,300
Since Double Moon

694
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,150
is being targeted,

695
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:45,925
then the next round,

696
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:46,825
we change tactics.

697
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:49,375
Sister Wen.

698
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:50,975
Next round,

699
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,600
let's play fake Double Moon.

700
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,775
What do you mean?

701
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,450
Since Qi Yue is being targeted,

702
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:00,550
Then we pretend to be targeted.

703
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,375
Let Lu Sheng play Carry.

704
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,350
I don't care true or false,

705
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,600
next round,

706
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,275
I will let them know,

707
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:10,700
I, Qi Yue, am not to be trifled with.

708
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:18,750
Qi Yue.

709
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:19,825
Next round

710
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,550
is Polaris' match point.

711
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:22,950
I hope you can adjust 

712
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:23,850
your state well,

713
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,850
and cooperate.

714
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,450
Do you understand?

715
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:43,600
Qi Yue, come here, help me.

716
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,975
Stop playing jungle, come here to help.

717
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:45,950
This mid is able to hit.

718
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:46,800
Qi Yue.

719
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,275
Protect Lu Sheng. Protect Lu Sheng.

720
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,000
Shen Yue, you protect him.

721
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,875
Qi Yue. Qi Yue.

722
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:50,550
Brother Qi, come here.

723
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,275
I am coming. Coming.

724
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,700
Qi Yue, Qi Yue. Where are you going?

725
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,325
Brother Qi. Brotehr Qi.

726
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,350
Mid initiate.

727
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,225
I am going to Kill the dragon.

728
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,900
Why kill dragon now?

729
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,200
How to play mid without money?

730
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,550
There is a man at the bottom.

731
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:00,900
We can push at the mid.

732
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,600
Being caught. Being caught.

733
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,000
Being caught.

734
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Aid. Aid.

735
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,700
OK. I know. I know.

736
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,625
It's in a mess.

737
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,425
Shen Yue come back!

738
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:06,325
You seek death if you go.

739
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,350
We can't take this round.

740
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,825
Brother Qi. Brotehr Qi come back.

741
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,500
Qi Yue has been killed.

742
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,375
Three of VNG are residual blood. 

743
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,175
This round VNG lost too much.

744
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:14,950
This round of group battle,

745
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,225
Qi Yue seems to be implusive.

746
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:17,025
But Qi Yue

747
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:18,225
is suppressed hardly indeed.

748
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,225
No ability to wander,

749
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:20,850
so he thinks of killing the dragon.

750
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,600
Try his best.

751
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,700
That round indeed seems like Qi Yue 

752
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,950
give it a try.

753
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,225
But have you noticed that

754
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,050
this round VNG

755
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,125
is not using Double Moon anymore.

756
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,225
Indeed.

757
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,200
Ji Xiangkong seems to

758
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
use Qi Yue to lure his opponent on purpose.

759
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,275
Let's see the economy of Lu Sheng.

760
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,600
He is the top in the team.

761
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:35,325
Actually, if they didn't kill the dragon

762
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,625
at that round, they might result better.

763
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:37,225
Right.

764
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,100
But Ji Xiangkong,

765
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,975
Tong Wu, Lu Sheng,

766
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,675
are all on the bottom.

767
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:40,525
They can use the time of 

768
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
Polaris killing the dragon 

769
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,225
to push the outer turret.

770
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:44,625
My Qiu Ying's commentary 

771
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,125
is getting better and better.

772
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,450
Qiu Ying broke the relationship of

773
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:55,900
Fu Miya and Ji Xiangkong on purpose

774
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,700
Right now, she stands on the commentary stage,

775
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,050
all because of Ji Xiangkong.

776
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:02,975
Why these people are bored 

777
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,250
all day long?

778
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,400
The past of Ji Xiangkong

779
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,275
and Miya,

780
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,150
How is it related to Qiu Ying?

781
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:14,475
But

782
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,875
what's the relationship between

783
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:19,400
Ji Xiangkong and Miya?

784
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:24,850
Go. Go. Go.

785
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,650
Focus fire. Focus. focus.

786
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,775
Gather here. Quickly. Quickly.

787
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,125
The other side is open.

788
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,650
Qi Yue, come here to help.

789
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:31,500
Shen Yue follow me.

790
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,575
I know. I am following you.

791
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,425
Another group battle at the mid.

792
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,825
What does Qi Yue want to do?

793
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:36,950
He is tower dive gank.

794
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,200
But carry can't follow him.

795
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,125
Next round,

796
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,825
replace Qi Yue.

797
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:41,550
Replace him, who can go?

798
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:48,850
No. No.

799
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,400
I've been caught.

800
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,900
Who can save me?

801
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,425
Who can save me?

802
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,150
I am coming. I am coming.

803
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,625
I am coming.

804
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,400
I hold him.

805
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,250
Aid. Aid. Aid.

806
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,800
Shen Yue. Where are you，Shen Yue?

807
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,325
Coming. Coming. Coming.

808
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,925
The Polaris catchs Qi Yue again.

809
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:04,825
What?

810
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,900
The star is down there,

811
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,825
you are nervous, right?

812
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,800
Right now, the economy of Polaris

813
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:11,450
is much higher than VND.

814
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:13,200
If VNG is being aced，

815
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,625
there's no chance to reverse the situation.

816
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,050
Coach. I need to pick up a phone call.

817
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,100
Go.

818
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,550
Hey. What's wrong?

819
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:29,575
Lin Yixuan. I am asking you.

820
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:30,625
Do you know that

821
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,000
Miya is Ji Xiangkong's first lover?

822
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,650
Brother Kong and Miya?

823
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,450
Is that true?

824
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,450
The news are all over the Internet.

825
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,950
No. Is it a joke?

826
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,425
Brother Kong is Miya's first lover?

827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,925
Then I say I am Miya's

828
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:46,200
losted brother.

829
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,425
You kid.

830
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:49,100
Don't play dumb with me.

831
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,875
How dare I play dumb with you？

832
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:52,775
The great reporter Lu.

833
00:42:53,775 --> 00:42:54,400
Brother Kong

834
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,425
is Miya's fan.

835
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,575
The whole team knows that.

836
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,300
Then.

837
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,525
Miya went to the competition site first.

838
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:01,925
And then 

839
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:02,850
the news of them

840
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,000
is immediately trending online.

841
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,200
This can't be a baseless rumour.

842
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:07,150
Then.

843
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,275
Why don't they just simply say that

844
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,175
Miya likes VNG?

845
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,325
It can't be that simple.

846
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,125
See it carefully.

847
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,450
The picture of hugging.

848
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:18,025
That's Ji Xiangong for sure.

849
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:19,850
There is even a picture?

850
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,600
Right now, they also posted 

851
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,375
The news between Qiu Ying and Ji Xiangkong.

852
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:24,800
The netizens are all on one side.

853
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:26,425
Accuse Qiu Ying for stepping in relationship.

854
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:28,450
I am telling you. Lin Yixuan.

855
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,400
If my Qiu Ying

856
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,500
is being bullied again,

857
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:31,425
you

858
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:33,550
and Ji Xiangkong will be a dead man.

859
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,350
Wait. How is this realted to me?

860
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:36,525
Why are you angry with…

861
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,975
Hello. Hello. Hello.

862
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,450
What's happening?

863
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:45,150
Is it true?

864
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,625
Let's us congratulate the Polaris.

865
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,075
Brother Kong lost?

866
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,575
Congradulation to Polaris for entering winners bracket.

867
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,625
Qi Yue made too many mistakes today.

868
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,175
He is that kind of person.

869
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,025
If the situation breaks,

870
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:18,700
he can't control himself.

871
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,900
In the losers bracket,

872
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,250
they have to go back if they lose another game.

873
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:23,300
No. No.

874
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,650
The situation of this round is not right.

875
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,600
I think there's something wrong with Double Moon.

876
00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:28,900
I already alerted him.

877
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:30,550
If a person becomes too arrogant,

878
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,100
a crash will happen sooner or later.

879
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:33,800
Pei Xi. What do you mean?

880
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,300
Don't forget.

881
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,275
Brother Kong has defeated you before.

882
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:38,175
Look who is saying that he is too arrogant.

883
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:39,200
Yixuan. Yixuan.

884
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:41,550
Pei Xi is talking about Qi Yue.

885
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:43,325
He gets MVP every round.

886
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:45,200
He is overwhelmed by

887
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,075
arrogance and proud.

888
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:48,400
If he continue like this,

889
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,100
Double Moon is not in positive state.

890
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,075
Then. Then Double Moon is over.

891
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,075
What should my brother Kong do?

892
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,325
I also want to see

893
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:00,750
how Ji Xiangkong

894
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,200
gonna handle this?

895
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,000
Thanks for watching 

896
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,825
today's competition.

897
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,725
I am the commentator, Luo Tian. 

898
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,100
I am the commentator, Qiu Ying.

899
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,325
Every summoner,

900
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:10,900
see you in the next game.

901
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:18,050
Wihtout notebook,

902
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,325
it's not as hard as you think.

903
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,175
Right?

904
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:24,300
Thank you, teacher Luo.

905
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,925
If it wasn't you,

906
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:31,350
I can't hold on till now.

907
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:35,850
Commentary

908
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
is on two people.

909
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:37,850
One person

910
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,900
can only play monodrama.

911
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,125
Your performance today

912
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,425
is really good.

913
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,500
Xiangkong. Xiangkong. Xiangkong.

914
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,375
Please, hold on.

915
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,150
Well,

916
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,200
come to the front stage with me.

917
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,825
Just for a short time.

918
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,775
Let's go. It's fine.

919
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,825
Here. Just a while.

920
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:53,800
Invite Xiangkong to the front,

921
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,350
because today, at the site,

922
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,550
there is a fan related to you.

923
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,525
So,

924
00:45:58,075 --> 00:45:59,750
do you have any word for her?
