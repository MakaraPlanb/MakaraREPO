[Episode 25]

3
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,950
My apologises,

4
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,190
I sprained my ankle

5
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,710
on accident yesterday.

6
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,830
It's okay.

7
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,510
Have a seat.

8
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,710
Hello,

9
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,950
your strawberry milk tea

10
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,340
and your coffee, enjoy.

11
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,140
Actually,

12
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,040
I knew about the rumours

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,240
between you and

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Xiang Kong before you joined the

15
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
competition for 'The Star of Tomorrow'.

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,600
When I saw

17
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,320
your photo on the internet,

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,680
I had a feeling that

19
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
you and him

20
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
isn't merely just rumours

21
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,990
so I invited you

22
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,430
to my fanmeet

23
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,070
so I could chat with you.

24
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,900
He never told me about

25
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,300
the both of you

26
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,580
so

27
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,820
things got really awkward.

28
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,450
You like him?

29
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,450
Yes,

30
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,970
I like him

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
but up till now,

32
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
we're only just friends.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,400
I know.

34
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,630
Some things

35
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,030
even if he doesn't say,

36
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,390
I know it very well

37
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,900
because we grew up together

38
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,260
since young.

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,980
Nobody understand us

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,460
better than the both of us.

41
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,540
The relationship you guys had,

42
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,540
is it like how it was written in

43
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,970
'Beyond the sky'?

44
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,770
'Beyond the sky'

45
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,050
was written for him.

46
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
This song

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
records our

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
bitter

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
but also sweetest moments.

50
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,540
I became a trainee,

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,660
he applied to be an exchange student.

52
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,620
He rented a

53
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,340
small house of only 12meter square fee

54
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,540
beside

55
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,540
my company.

56
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,620
He will cook for me

57
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,420
everyday after school.

58
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,140
During the weekends,

59
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,300
he'll accompany me to the theatre

60
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
to practice

61
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,860
for my shows.

62
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,650
I feel tired,

63
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,850
I can't hang on anymore.

64
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,290
Even if we were to fail,

65
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,350
to be laughed at,

66
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,710
yes,

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,070
it feels terrible

68
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,510
but we have each other's support.

69
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,990
At that time,

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,230
we have nothing

71
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,990
but each other.

72
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,070
Xiang Kong said,

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,150
he will forever be by my side,

74
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,670
for a lifetime.

75
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,940
After that,

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,460
I gained popularity.

77
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,780
My company didn't allow me to be in a relationship.

78
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,860
Xiang Kong

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,500
chose to return to China for

80
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,440
my career development.

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,240
Up till now,

82
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
we've never met since then

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,200
but he will attend

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,200
my every concert.

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,760
You see,

86
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm finally successful.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,270
I can give him my support,

88
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,230
help him fulfil his dreams.

89
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,110
We accompanied each other

90
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,390
during our youths.

91
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,390
Qiu Ying,

92
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,900
can you understand

93
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,420
this feeling of ours?

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
I'm sorry, Miss Fu.

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,940
I have to get back to work

96
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,290
but don't you worry,

97
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,490
I will not involve myself

98
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,970
between both of your relationship.

99
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,570
Thank you for the coffee.

100
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,610
See you.

101
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,540
The revamped version of Spirit Princess

102
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,500
seems to be a little stronger.

103
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,260
Did your homework?

104
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,060
Qiu Ying.

105
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,420
What's wrong?

106
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,060
Your confession failed?

107
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,060
Qiu Ying rejected you?

108
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,700
Handsome Ji.

109
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,540
Coach.

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,460
It's because of Pei Xi, right?

111
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,010
Say something.

112
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,390
This is the line-up for Polaris the last 3 match.

113
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,110
They often use worm Queen

114
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,950
and Snake-hair Demon,

115
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,270
these two tank heroes

116
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,390
but there's also a weakness,

117
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,630
their ultimate has a very

118
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,670
long cool down period

119
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,950
which means we have to

120
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,350
make use of the time of their cool down

121
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,590
to find opportunity to attack.

122
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,750
No problem.

123
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,150
Qi Yue,

124
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,710
any opinions?

125
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,390
Any opinions?

126
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,220
Didn't you make yourself clear?

127
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,580
You're the captain,

128
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,780
you decide on the tactics.

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,340
We'll just listen.

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Captain has already said

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
the tactics very clearly just now,

132
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,440
it will be

133
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,080
Captain and I will cheat their Ultimate.

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Brother Qi will take over.

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
During the trial match later,

136
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,440
you have to take note

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
of when to enter.

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
Tomorrow's match is very important.

139
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,080
If we were to lose,

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
we'll be in the loser group.

141
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,030
Qi Yue,

142
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,990
di you understand me?

143
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,110
Very.

144
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,580
Are you done?

145
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,900
My Mother's at the hotel,

146
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,220
can I go look for her?

147
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,530
Teacher Ah Can,

148
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,370
did you see the rooster

149
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,490
for these few days?

150
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,650
Qiu Ying got promoted to the analysis table

151
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,890
so quickly after being an assistant.

152
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,530
Who will believe if I were to say

153
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,330
she did not take the shortcut?

154
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,920
This matter,

155
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
you have to look at it this way.

156
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,600
Even if Qiu Ying did take a shortcut,

157
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
isn't she still the one

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,600
Teacher Luo selected?

159
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,030
Who dares to disagree?

160
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,470
Even if...

161
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Even if it's Chairman Dong,

162
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,150
he has to give

163
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,430
Luo Tian face.

164
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,220
I've learn many thnigs from you

165
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,620
on the analysis table these few months,

166
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,620
we can't possibly

167
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,660
watch others use

168
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,100
unmean ways

169
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
to get promoted.

170
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
You trained me yourself,

171
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,820
can't you help me

172
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
think of a solution?

173
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,930
Qiao Xin, don't be anxious,

174
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,050
right?

175
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,370
I surely think of a solution for you.

176
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,930
The tournament has already begun,

177
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,440
it can only be like this now.

178
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't worry, I'll definitely

179
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
think of a solution for you after,

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
okay?

181
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,580
I'll go to the washroom.

182
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Go ahead.

183
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,540
Come with me first.

184
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,580
Come with me first.

185
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,860
You don't... Where are you going?

186
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,340
Let me go.

187
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,420
Why are you

188
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,540
with Ah Can again?

189
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Give me an explanation.

190
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,860
What kind of attitude?

191
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,660
My attitude?

192
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,250
what about your attitude?

193
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,570
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

194
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,170
If I did not meet you coincidentally,

195
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,370
is it so hard just to meet you?

196
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,930
Can't you see? I'm working.

197
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,050
Accompany other man to drink coffee

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,430
is called working?

199
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,750
Isn't that Qiao Xin?

200
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,790
Yes, that's Qi Yue.

201
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,230
-What's wrong with them?          -I don't know.

202
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,950
Look at you now,

203
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,550
aren't you embarassed for shouting so loudly?

204
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,630
If you really

205
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
have the ability and capability,

206
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,070
do I need to

207
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
accompany other man to drink coffee?

208
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,590
I told you before,

209
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,910
there's limited space fore development in You Xing,

210
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,910
I have to stand my foot

211
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,070
firmly in Ji Guang.

212
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,390
Qiu Ying has

213
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,140
Luo Tian as her backing now.

214
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
I have to think of solutions to save myself.

215
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,340
Can't it be that you'll help me?

216
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,020
You finally said the truth.

217
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,020
In your heart,

218
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,660
I'm just trash.

219
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
If not?

220
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,400
All these years,

221
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,600
what have you done for me?

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,800
Everybody is staying here now,

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,280
don't look for me if there's nothing important.

224
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,990
Qiao Xin.

225
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,670
Let me go.

226
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,870
Qiao Xin.

227
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,430
I've been taking care of you all these years,

228
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,670
but you?

229
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,310
What do you treat me as?

230
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,180
I can't take it anymore.

231
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,780
Then let's break up.

232
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,130
I did not

233
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,570
beg you to be together with me.

234
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,030
Finish discussing?

235
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,030
Manager.

236
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,790
We'll go for training now.

237
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,180
Where's Qi Yue?

238
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,340
Manager Li,

239
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,340
there's something

240
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
I'd like to talk to you about.

241
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,660
Qi Yue is your disciple.

242
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,260
In Wei Teng, he only listens to you.

243
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,260
Xiang Kong,

244
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,460
just speak your mind.

245
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,260
If he's really accompanying his Mother,

246
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,820
there's nothing in applying for leave

247
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,940
but if he's using it

248
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,490
to accompany his Girlfriend and affecting training,

249
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,930
that's another matter.

250
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,810
Xiang Kong,

251
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,090
it's a critical moment

252
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,090
for us, Wei Teng.

253
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,090
We can't do it without you or Qi Yue.

254
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,760
I don't hope to see any

255
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,760
misunderstanding at such a time.

256
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,960
Manager Li, if it's really a misunderstanding,

257
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm willing to apologise to Qi Yue

258
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,320
but if it's not,

259
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,700
I hope you'll give him some reminder.

260
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,940
Okay,

261
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,900
I know.

262
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,820
I'll go for training now.

263
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,020
Polaris,

264
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,780
is a team that more inclined to pushing,

265
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,700
fast pushing.

266
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,340
From the looks of the

267
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,380
turret damage,

268
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,300
it's a more than a thousand for 3 person.

269
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,740
Not bad at analyzing.

270
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,380
just that it's not comprehensive.

271
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,540
How about

272
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,620
we head for lunch first?

273
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,540
I'll help you

274
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,300
organize after lunch.

275
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,300
Okay.

276
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,870
Xiang Kong,

277
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,910
here to look for Qiu Ying?

278
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,550
Qiu Ying,

279
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,310
can I speak

280
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,670
to you regarding some matter?

281
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,430
Sorry,

282
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,830
I'm a little busy now.

283
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,270
Teacher Luo,

284
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,950
there's still some parts I'm unsure of,

285
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll go back first.

286
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,790
Then...

287
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,790
I'll go get busy first.

288
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,220
Brother Qi, you're finally back.

289
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,040
Manager Li?

290
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
Is Qi Yue back yet?

291
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,840
I don't know,

292
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
he might be with his Mother.

293
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,680
What is this lad up to?

294
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,680
He isn't picking up my calls

295
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,720
nor replying my messgaes.

296
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Maybe he didn't bring his phone.

297
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,480
Notify me

298
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,630
when he's back.

299
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,630
Okay.

300
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,350
Rest early.

301
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,430
Manager Li, walk slowly.

302
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,250
Brother Qi, why aren't you picking up?

303
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,210
You went out?

304
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,650
I went to look for Qi Yue.

305
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,480
I heard that he left early

306
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,480
again today.

307
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,720
Yes.

308
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
His Mother need accompaniment

309
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,720
since she's unfamilar with the place.

310
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,400
Could it be

311
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,840
that it's because

312
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,670
of something else?

313
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,310
You don't trust

314
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,670
Qi Yue that much?

315
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:21,910
I'm heading to bed.

316
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,030
Li Gan,

317
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,870
I'm showing concern for Qi Yue.

318
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,860
Can we have a talk?

319
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,740
It's getting late,

320
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,660
there's still a competiton tomorrow.

321
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,940
Rest early.

322
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,960
Qi Yue,

323
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,960
what's happened to you?

324
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
Why did you drink so much?

325
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,960
Don't need you to care.

326
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,460
Qi Yue,

327
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,900
the competition is tomorrow,

328
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,820
what's wrong with you?

329
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,700
Sober up.

330
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,700
Sister Wen,

331
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,100
am I trash?

332
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,540
Why did Qiao Xin

333
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,900
treat me like this?

334
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,740
Qi Yue, you drank too much.

335
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,780
I'll bring you back to your room.

336
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,140
Tell her

337
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,420
that one day

338
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,980
I'll let the world know

339
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,660
she's my woman.

340
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
Look at him yourself.

341
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,690
Qi Yue,

342
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,450
come with me.

343
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,890
Shut up.

344
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,290
Why did Qiao Xin treat me like this?

345
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,610
I gave her whatever she wants.

346
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,750
Go away.

347
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,870
Li Gan,

348
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,430
you heard him.

349
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,990
The competition is tomorrow

350
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,150
and he's drunk.

351
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,510
Better not

352
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,910
screw up anything for me.

353
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,990
Brother Qi.

354
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,780
Get up.

355
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,180
Master,

356
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,060
you see for yourself.

357
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,220
Teacher Luo.

358
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,740
I stood here for a long time

359
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,980
when I commented for the first time.

360
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,180
Only when you look down from this angle,

361
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,620
it makes you feel more responsiblity.

362
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,780
The competition is starting soon,

363
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,540
let's us get ready.

364
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,730
Okay.

365
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,320
I know you're surely nervous since

366
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
it's your first time doing commentary.

367
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,760
When you're commenting later,

368
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,160
try to stready your breathe.

369
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,680
Don't be to anxious to speak.

370
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
You have to remember

371
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,500
to get the statistics right.

372
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,460
If you;re not confident

373
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,100
with your memory,

374
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,820
take a look at your notebook beforehand.

375
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,620
Teacher Luo,

376
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,900
Director An is looking for you.

377
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,180
Okay.

378
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,540
I'll go first.

379
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,300
You prepare yourself.

380
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,820
Let's go.

381
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,160
Qiu Ying, let's have a talk.

382
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Let's talk outside.

383
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,420
Qiu Ying, all the best.

384
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,940
It's your first time

385
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,300
on the commentator table.

386
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,660
You've waited for this day long enough.

387
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,330
Don't be nervous,

388
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,970
unleash your full potential.

389
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,370
Thank you.

390
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,410
I also hope your competition will go on smoothly.

391
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,770
Oh,

392
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,810
the car model you gave me,

393
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:50,880
I like it a lot.

394
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Thank you.

395
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
It's just a gift of gratitude

396
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
for the help you've always given me.

397
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,550
There's no other meaning.

398
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,950
Okay, I'll get going.

399
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,110
You should head back to the restroom.

400
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,310
Qiu Ying,

401
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,060
I know

402
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,130
I shouldn't be disturbing you at such a time

403
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,810
but

404
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,410
can we have a good chat

405
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,050
after the competition?

406
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,690
Sure.

407
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,880
Let's call Yi Yi and Lin Yi Xuan along.

408
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,880
We haven't gather for a long time.

409
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,880
I mean

410
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,760
just the two of us,

411
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
is it okay?

412
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,020
We'll talk about it after the competition.

413
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,310
Qiu Ying, what are you looking for?

414
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,790
Xiao Zheng,

415
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,150
my notebook is missing.

416
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,310
My prepared speech

417
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,270
and competition analysis are all in it.

418
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,230
You misplaced such

419
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,030
and important thing.

420
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,470
I went out for a while just now.

421
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,630
I remember I

422
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,030
placed it on the table.

423
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,180
I'll see how you can show off.

424
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,040
Qiao Xin,

425
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,000
the competition is about to begin.

426
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,000
What are you doing here?

427
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,080
Teacher Luo,

428
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,560
I wasn't doing anything.

429
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I was merely just some trash.

430
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
I'll go prepare now.

431
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,150
Xiao Zheng,

432
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,790
the competition is about to begin.

433
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,630
Shouldn't you be preparing

434
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,390
at the analyzing table?

435
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,620
I'll go this instance.

436
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,170
Is there an issue?

437
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,290
What are you looking for?

438
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,810
Nothing.

439
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,610
Ah Can's partner

440
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,770
felt unwell suddenly,

441
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,490
we couldn't find a substitute

442
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,290
at such late notice.

443
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:04,970
So later,

444
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,890
we will have to

445
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,770
cooperate

446
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,130
with Ah Can's live hosting.

447
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,210
Cooperate with live hosting?

448
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Yes.

449
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,080
Such suddenly

450
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,960
matters

451
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,040
usually happens

452
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,840
but it's okay,

453
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,800
just go according

454
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,720
to my tempo will do.

455
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,440
This is the host's script.

456
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,160
Take a look.

457
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,350
Okay.

458
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,780
Brother Qi,

459
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,380
are you okay?

460
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,420
Drink some water.

461
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,370
Brother Qi, why did you drink so much?

462
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,850
What do I do?

463
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,130
Sister Wen saw everything.

464
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,210
I'm not too sure about the entire thing

465
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,520
but about you and Qiao XIn,

466
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
Manager Li should know about it.

467
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,200
I think

468
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,440
there shouldn't be much with Sister Wen.

469
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,380
It'll affect the competition.

470
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,500
Of course not.

471
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,260
You're so important to our team,

472
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,900
how will it affect the competiton?

473
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,780
True.

474
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,740
Wei Teng can't do it without me.

475
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,180
The competition is about to begin,

476
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
let's go.

477
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,380
Where's Qi Yue?

478
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,620
He went to the washroom.

479
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:46,970
Sister Wen.

480
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,130
Master.

481
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,630
Play well in the competition later.

482
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,270
Don't worry,

483
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,390
I'll handle it.

484
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,030
Bring out your best in

485
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,670
today's competition,

486
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,150
I have faith in you guys.

487
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,870
Rest assured, Sister Wen.

488
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,830
We match up

489
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,950
against Polaris in the previous round,

490
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,990
everyone knows how it feels.

491
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,950
That's good.

492
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,110
You all do your best.

493
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,310

Qiu Ying.

501
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,140
After two months of competing,

502
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,300
the top 4 teams

503
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,540
have entered the finals.

504
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,620
For this round of finals,

505
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
we do it in a double lose system.

506
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,480
The team will be elliminated when they lose for two consecutive rounds.

507
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,600
Today is Iconquer 2018

508

first match in the finals.

509
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,200
During the Semi-finals,

00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Wei Teng who breaks the record of

511
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,680

512
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,680
were up against and the

513
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,880

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,860
Mi Ya.

515
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,020
Sister Wen.

516
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
What brings you here today?

517
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm here to support Xiang Kong.

Thank you for your support.

519

Mi Ya!

520
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,330
Our popular singer, Mi Ya

521
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,770
is actually sitting among the crowd.

522
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,690
Mi Ya!

523
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:26,730
Sorry,

524
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,690
thank you everyone.

525
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,570
Don't film first.

526
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,930
This is her personal time,

527
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,730
thank you everyone.

528
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,810
Everyone, please have a seat

Thank you everyone.

533
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Qiu Ying,

534
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,280
it's your first time commentary

535
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,120
and you're so lucky.

536
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,880
Seems like Qiu Ying

537
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,110
got shocked by the

538
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,830
passion at the venue.

539
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,110
This is a surprise for our

540
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,790
finals.

541
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,470
Ah Can,

542
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,070
I'll hand it over to you to interview

543
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,350
such a big surprise.

544
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,230
Big celebrity likes to

545
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,260
join in the fun too?

546
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,300
Welcome the popular singer,

547
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,740
Mi Ya.

548
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,900
Welcome her!

549
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,780
Actually I came today

550
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,820
as a normal

551
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,860
audience,

552
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,620
to feel

553
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,340
the atmosphere

554
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,860
during competition.

555
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,580
I can't miss this opportunity since

556
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,220
you're here at the venue.

557
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,570
I want to gossip a little,

558
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,210
which team do you support amongst

559
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,290
the two?

560
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,810
I'm a fan of Wei Teng

561
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,280
is because I heard

562
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,840
they broke the record with

563
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
11 consecutive wins during the semi-finals.

564
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,760
I admire such impulse

565
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,760
very much and

566
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,000
the will to fight.

567
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,000
Which member do you

568
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,300
support more in Wei Teng?

569
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Wei Teng's captain,

570
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,940
Ji Xiang Kong.

571
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,780
Never thought that

572
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,500
Mi Ya is also

573
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
a fan of Wei Teng

574
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,620
and also a fan of Ji Xiang Kong.

575
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,980
What's wrong with you?

576
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,140
Feeling unwell?

577
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,460
Teacher Luo, I'm sorry.

578
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,700
I wasn't in the right state of mind just now.

579
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,620
The competition is about to start,

580
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,740
regulate your mind.

581
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,740
Relax, don;t be too nervous.

582
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,130
Thank you.

583
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,670
Both teams, please

584
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,270
enter.

585
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,350
Welcome everyone.

586
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,040
Both teams, please have a seat.

587
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,070
Based on the results ofthe semi-finals,

588
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,310
Polaris was fourth in ranking.

589
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,270
Also, during the semi-finals,

590
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:18,870
both teams

591
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,070
played against each other once.

592
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,510
Wei Teng won against Polaris

593
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,790
with the score of 2 to 0.

594
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,670
Indeed.

595
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,020
After entering the finals,

596
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
it's a new beginning.

597
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
To the 4 teams,

598
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,100
every match

599
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,500
is a battle of life and death.

600
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,140
I believe Polaris will not

601
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,580
concede defeat so easily today.

602
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Audience a tthe venue,

603
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,690
don't be stingy with your passion.

604
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,330
Shout to show support

605
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,570
for the team!

606
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,450
Xiang Kong, all the best!

607
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:45,770
I've enter.

608
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,890
Follow up.

609
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,370
Attack, start a fight.

610
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,290
You develop for a while.

611
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,250
I'll protect you.

612
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:52,890
I can't develop.

613
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,290
I can't develop.

614
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,010
I can't develop.

615
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,560
Qi Yue, what are you doing?

616
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,080
Half a day has past and you're still not developed.

617
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,960
Look at yourself.

618
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,560
Sorry,

619
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,360
it's my problem.

620
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Qi Yue is disastrous in this round.

621
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,320
He got forced to develop in the jungle.

622
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,150
Polaris seems to

623
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,870
not want to let him go.

624
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,310
Both their support has entered the jungle area.

625
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,910
Both support of level 6.

626
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,030
Why is he jungling for?

627
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,270
Why don't he just walk now?

628
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,150
Now.

629
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,630
Don't be anxious.

630
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,980
I'm caught.

631
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,740
need assistance.

632
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,380
Qi Yue got caught,

633
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,300
he got...

634
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,540
caught by two heroes in the middle.

635
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,660
Qi Yue if you were to get caught...

636
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,460
Retreat, we can't attack.

637
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,540
Indeed,

638
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,540
he's stunned to death,

639
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,540
he totally can't develop at all.

640
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Actually, usually at the

641
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,380
10 minutes mark,

642
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,780
it's usually Wei Teng's

643
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,450
Double Moon combi walking time

644
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:37,490
but very obviously,

645
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,850
Qi Yue is being aimed.

646
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,370
8 minutes yet he hasn't reach level 6.

647
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,610
The statistics now

648
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,370
isn't ideal.

649
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,840
Based on previous statistics,

650
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,720
actually Qi Yue

651
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,080
usually takes about 7 minutes

652
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,080
to reach level 6.

653
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,200
About 6 to 7 minutes.

654
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,100
Double Moon walking time is

655
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:56,900
around 10 minutes.

656
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,340
Should be fully developed.

657
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,380
Group attacks are

658
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
75%,

659
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,220
comparing to Polaris group attacks

660
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,100
who is at 75%.

661
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,100
But comparing to Double Moon combi,

662
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,980
93% of

663
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,940
group attacks,

664
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,740
there's still a certain distance.

665
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,420
But in this round,

666
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,460
Double Moon combi

667
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,540
group attacks are lowering.

668
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,300
Based on Polaris' middle,

669
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,060
his economy for

670
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,060
every minute is 484.

671
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
He already overtook Qi Yue.

672
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,500
He's economy

673
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,660
for every minute should be

674
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
around 580

675
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,850
but he's only at 465 now.

676
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:27,810
With the lack of

677
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,970
equipments,

678
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,850
Qi Yue can't do much.

679
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,810
He can't counter group attacks.

680
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,090
Polaris is trying to seperate

681
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,090
the Double Moon combi.

682
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,270
In the next group attack,

683
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,790
Wei Teng will be in a disadvanatge.

684
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,150
What now?

685
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,910
See that I'm the MVP for every round

686
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,030
that's why you guys are aiming me right?

687
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,270
Next time if I ask you to come over,

688
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,230
please be quick, okay?

689
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,230
No, it's clearly...

690
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,030
What now?

691
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,790
Look at Qi Yue's condition.

692
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,710
The opponents are aiming him,

693
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,470
right?

694
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:01,950
Could it be that

695
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,070
it's his first time being aimed?

696
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,830
Double Mon combi

697
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,620
isn't a long term plan

698
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,500
in the first place.

699
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,780
As long as he doesn't make mistakes,

700
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,460
Double Moon Combi

701
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,460
is able to get a definite

702
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,300
advantage in this match.

703
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,100
Shu Wen,

704
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,220
there's nothing

705
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,220
definite in this world.

706
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
Assist me.

707
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,800
You can attack here.

708
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm stunned.

709
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Brother Qi, I'm just below you.

710
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,760
Brother Qi, walk your way.

711
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,280
Walk your way.

712
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,280
Walk towards the back.

713
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,880
Can't attack.

714
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
Go.

715
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,600
Back.

716
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,280
Fight them.

717
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Push.

718
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,910
Push!

719
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,830
All the best.

720
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,070
Polaris!

721
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,180
Polaris!

722
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,370
Congratulations, Polaris!

723
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,210
Taking down the first match.

724
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:13,930
Will Wei Teng

725
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,210
be able to catch up in the

726
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,280
following match?

727
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,800
We'll take a break of 15 minutes.

728
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,720
Anticipate the next match.

729
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,860
Explain to me,

730
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,300
why did you say the statistocs wrongly?

731
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,500
What's happening?

732
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,940
I'm sorry, Teacher Luo.

733
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,300
I did not remember the notes well.

734
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,420
Where's your notes?

735
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,100
It's missing.

736
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,530
Missing?

737
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,530
I'm sorry, Teacher Luo.

738
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,250
I did not take good care of it.

739
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,360
Look up,

740
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,480
you can't comment

741
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,160
without your notes?

742
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,860
Without...

743
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,460
I'm not confident without the statistics.

744
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,420
To be a good commentator,

745
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,660
you must have the ability to

746
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,740
adapt to changes

747
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,540
and not rely on the statistics.

748
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,620
You don't have to feel pressure,

749
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,660
I'll handle the statistics parts

750
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,460
at the back.

751
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,860
We are partners.

752
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,020
Next time,

753
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,220
if such things happened,

754
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,820
notify me at once.

755
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,190
Since we can't use

756
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,990
Double Moon anymore.

757
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,710
Next round,

758
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,510
we'll change another tactic.

759
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,150
Sister Wen,

760
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,790
next round

761
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,510
we can pretend to play a Double Moon.

762
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,750
What do you mean?

763
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,430
Since Qi Yue is being aimed,

764
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,590
we'll just go with the flow.

765
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,350
Let Lu Sheng play the damage.

766
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,390
Who cares if it's real or fake?

767
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,590
Next round,

768
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,310
I'll let them know

769
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,700
I, Qi Yue, is not to be trifled.

770
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,820
Qi Yue,

771
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,860
next round

772
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,760
is Polaris mark.

773
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,200
I hope you're able to regulate

774
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,880
your condition

775
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,800
and cooperate well.

776
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Do you understand?

777
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,870
Qi Yue, come over and help.

778
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,190
Stop jungling, come over and help.

779
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,310
This attack in the middle can be attack.

780
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,110
Qi Yue.

781
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,510
Protect Lu Sheng.

782
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,190
Shen Yue, go protect him.

783
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,110
Brother Qi,

784
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,940
come towards me.

785
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,740
I'm going over.

786
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Qi Yue, where are you going?

787
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,660
Brother Qi,

788
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,940
start a fight in the middle.

789
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,700
I'll go attack the dragon.

790
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,340
At this moment, attack what dragon?

791
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,460
How do I attack the bottom when I have no money?

792
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,020
There's someone at the bottom,

793
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,290
we can push from the middle.

794
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:18,970
I'm caught.

795
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,490
I'm caught.

796
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,330
Need assistance.

797
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,250
Okay, I know.

798
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,090
playing so messily.

799
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:22,930
Shen Yue come back,

800
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,770
you'll be slain too if you go.

801
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,810
We can't take on this attack.

802
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,210
Brother Qi, walk towards the back.

803
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,050
QiYue has been slain.

804
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:29,970
Wei Teng has 3 men down.

805
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,610
This made made Wei Teng in a losing end.

806
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,490
In this round of team attack,

807
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,850
Qi Yue seems a little rash

808
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,570
but Qi Yue

809
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,730
indeed got attacked badly

810
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,810
with no ability to walk.

811
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,400
Therefore, he wants give it a try by

812
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,200
snatching the dragon,

813
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,440
Qi Yue indeed seems like

814
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,440
he was giving a shot just now

815
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,840
but did you realise,

816
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,720
Wei Teng did not use

817
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
use Double Moon combi in this round..

818
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,800
Indeed,

819
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Ji Xiang Kong seems to be

820
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,510
using Qi Yue as a bait.

821
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,950
Let us have a look at Lu Sheng's economy,

822
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,270
he's the highest among the team.

823
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,030
Actually, it's better if he did not

824
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,270
attempt to snatch the dragon just now.

825
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,950
Yes,

826
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,710
but Ji Xiang Kong,

827
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,710
Tong Wu and Lu Sheng

828
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,310
are all in the bottom lane.

829
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,380
They can totally make use

830
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,820
of the time where Polaris is snatching the dragon

831
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,860
to push down turrets.

832
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,220
Our Qiu Ying's commentary

833
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,940
is getting better.

834
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,300
Qiu Ying delibrately break

835
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,980
Fu Mi Ya and Ji Xiang Kong up.

836
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,660
She's only able to stand at the analyzing table

837
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,060
because of Ji Xiang Kong.

838
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,930
Do these people have nothing

839
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,970
better to do?

840
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,170
Digging up

841
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,090
Ji Xiang Kong and Mi Ya's past.

842
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,090
Why get Qiu Ying involved?

843
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,520
But,

844
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,720
what's the relationship between

845
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
Ji Xiang Kong and Mi Ya?

846
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
Attack.

847
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,620
Start attack.

848
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Gather, come over quickly.

849
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,220
The opposite team has start a fight.

850
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,660
Qi Yue come over and help.

851
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,660
Shen Yue come with me.

852
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,620
I know, I'm with you.

853
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
There's another wave of attack in the middle lane,

854
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,060
what is Qi Yue doing?

855
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,980
He's crossing turrets to attack

856
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,340
but the input and output isn't keeping up.

857
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,220
Next match,

858
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,900
change Qi Yue down.

859
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,740
Who will go if you remove him?

860
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:06,900
I can't,

861
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,460
I'm caught.

862
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,210
Who is able to protect me?

863
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:08,730
Who is able to protect me?

864
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,490
I'm coming.

865
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,010
I'm coming.

866
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:10,570
I got stunned.

867
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,570
Need assistance.

868
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,970
Shen Yue, where are you at?

869
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,570
Going over.

870
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,110
Polaris slain Qi Yue once again.

871
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,150
Why?

872
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,110
You're nervous

873
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,150
because there's a celebrity in the audience?

874
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,230
Polaris' economy is

875
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,950
far more than Wei Teng's.

876
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,670
If Wei Teng were to be wiped out,

877
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,150
there's no chance of winning.

878
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,510
Coach, I'll pick up a call.

879
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,670
Go.

880
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:46,950
Hello, what is it?

881
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,030
Lin Yi Xuan, let me ask you.

882
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,060
Do you know

883
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,540
Miya is Ji Xiang Kong's first love?

884
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,100
Brother Kong and Miya?

885
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,980
Are you for real?

886
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,020
It's spreading like crazy on the net.

887
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,600
No, what joke.

888
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,960
Brother Kong is Mi Ya's first love,

889
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,600
I'm still Mi Ya's

890
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
long-lost Brother.

891
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:05,960
You lad,

892
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,600
don;t acting dumb with me.

893
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,560
How would I dare to?

894
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,480
Reporter Lu,

895
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,000
Brother Kong

896
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,120
is Mi Ya's fan.

897
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Our whole team knows about that.

898
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,920
Then...

899
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,310
First, Mi Ya went to the venue to see the competition.

900
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,710
Then the news about

901
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,750
them start spreading

902
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,830
on the internet.

903
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,950
This can't be just a baseless rumour.

904
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,030
That...

905
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,870
Can't it just be that

906
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,940
Mi Ya purely likes Wei Teng?

907
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,060
Purely, as if.

908
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,020
Look at it carefully,

909
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,340
that photo of them hugging,

910
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,700
it's obviously Ji Xiang Kong.

911
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,460
There's even a photo?

912
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,450
Now, there's even news

913
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,210
on Qiu Ying and Ji Xiang Kong.

914
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,930
Netizens are taking sides,

915
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,370
scolding Qiu Ying for being the third party.

916
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,250
Let me tell you, Lin Yi Xuan.

917
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,370
If our Qiu Ying

918
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,410
is getting bullied again,

919
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,410
you

920
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,530
and Ji Xiang Kong are doomed.

921
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,450
No, what has it got to do with me?

922
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,450
What are you angry at...

923
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,970
Hello?

924
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,320
What's the situation?

925
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,160
Are you for real?

926
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,740
Let us congratulate Polaris...

927
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,340
Brother Kong lost?

928
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,020
Congratulations to Polaris in entering the winner group.

929
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,020
Qi Yue makes too many mistakes.

930
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,460
He's like that,

931
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,220
he can't control himself

932
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,900
when the situation gets out of control.

933
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,130
If they were to lose again in

934
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,530
the losing group, they'll have to go home.

935
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,450
No,

936
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:43,970
this match is not right.

937
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,130
I think Double Moon combi

938
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:45,930
has a problem.

939
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,130
I reminded him earlier,

940
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,760
when he gets cocky,

941
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,400
crashing is a matter of sooner or later.

942
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,120
Pei Xi, what do you mean?

943
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,640
Don't forget,

944
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,560
Brother Kong win you before.

945
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,600
Aren't you embarassed saying that he's cocky?

946
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,600
Yi Xuan,

947
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,020
Pei Xi meant Qi Yue.

948
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,820
He gets MVP for every match,

949
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,660
he got dizzy up

950
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,500
with his arrogance.

951
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,820
If this goes on,

952
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,580
Double Moon combi is not ideal.

953
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,740
Then Double Moon combi is over.

954
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,540
What happens to Brother Kong?

955
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,900
I want to see

956
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,220
how will Ji Xiang Kong

957
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,860
handle it.

958
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,660
Thank you everyone for watching

959
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,500
today's competition.

960
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,420
I'm commentator, Luo Tian.

961
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,660
I'm commentator, Qiu Ying.

962
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,900
Fellow summoners,

963
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,220
we'll see you again in the next competition.

964
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,490
Bye.

965
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:37,810
It's not as difficult as you think

966
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:38,970
to do it without notes,

967
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,110
right?

968
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,030
Thank you, Teacher Luo.

969
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,710
If it's not for you,

970
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,190
I couldn't hang on till now.

971
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:55,590
Commentary

972
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,790
is a two-man show.

973
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:57,550
One person

974
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,670
is unable to do a solo act.

975
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:00,990
Your performance today

976
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,230
is already very good.

977
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,470
Xiang Kong!

978
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,230
Please stay.

979
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,030
That...

980
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,150
Come with me to the front of the stage.

981
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:08,790
Just a little time.

982
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:09,750
Let's go, it's fine.

983
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,740
Just a little of your time.

984
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,780
Let's invite Xiang Kong on to stage.

985
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,340
It's because there's a fan related

986
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,540
to you in the venue today

987
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,620
so

988
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,780
do you have anything to say to her?
