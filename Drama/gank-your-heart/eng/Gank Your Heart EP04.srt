[Episode 04]

3
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,340
Why is it broken?

4
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,900
Broken?

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,250
Show me.

6
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,570
It shouldn't have broke.

7
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,690
When I left my house earlier,

8
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,730
it was still intact.

9
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,270
How about this?

10
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
How much? I'll compensate the cost.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,790
Do you know the definition of priceless?

12
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,870
Since this is a priceless item,

13
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,710
no amount can be compensated,

14
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,460
How about this?

15
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,900
State your request.

16
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,020
I will fulfill your request no matter what.

17
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,740
Ji Xiang Kong.

18
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,280
I thought you're a decent person.

19
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,320
Seems like it's my misjudgment.

20
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,970
Mum, sorry.

21
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,050
Sorry.

22
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,570
I broke the necklace.

23
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,700
Regardless of what you think of me,

24
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,700
I still wish that you can help me.

25
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,900
Because Gu Fang is a star in the gaming industry.

26
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,740
Do you know the definition of priceless?

27
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,170
Still meddling with your phone here?

28
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,410
What happened?

29
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,850
Captain is leaving.

30
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,970
Where is Captain?

31
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,010
Downstairs.

32
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,720
Wait.

33
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,260
Captain.

34
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,180
Don't call me that.

35
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,300
A better player will take over my role.

36
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,260
To me, you're still the Captain.

37
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,530
Captain.

38
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,890
Are you really leaving the team?

39
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,030
I'm already 30.

40
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,870
It's time to leave.

41
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,710
Xiang Kong.

42
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,990
The group can do without me.

43
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,990
But not you.

44
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,110
In these recent years,

45
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,630
the best thing I have done was

46
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,110
recruiting you into the team.

47
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,630
Ever since we returned from Vancouver,

48
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,260
netizens' criticsms about you

49
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,460
were all over the internet.

50
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,380
In the professional gaming industry,

51
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,420
I was indeed an amateur.

52
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,260
Sorry.

53
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,320
To put you to such injustice.

54
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,080
No big deal. Let them be.

55
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,360
Those criticsms don't affect me.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Regardless of what I've done since young,

57
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,520
I'd always be mocked and laughed at.

58
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm already used to it.

59
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,060
I've competed for so many years

60
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,090
but I still fail to win a second championship ring.

61
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,290
Previously, I dream to

62
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,530
win a second championship.

63
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,490
But my dream now is

64
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
to see you guys win a championship.

65
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,930
It's your turn to take

66
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,410
the responsibility as the Captain.

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Captain, you overestimated me.

68
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm just an amateur.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
The role of the Captain..

70
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,640
- I can't be..

71
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,990
Don't act as if this doesn't concern you!

72
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,550
That hidden passion in you.

73
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,190
All of us sense it.

74
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,340
Don't let those external factors

75
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,180
affect your emotions.

76
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,300
All the best.

77
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,900
You're our hope.

78
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,500
Captain.

79
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,860
I don't know if I can make it.

80
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,100
Believe me.

81
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,980
You definitely can!

82
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,770
Ah Xuan is talented.

83
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,570
Huo Yao is experienced in this line.

84
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,130
Lu Feng is cooperative and has a good personality.

85
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,160
If the team is led by you,

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,320
my regrets may be compensated.

87
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,180
Don't turn me down.

88
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,980
All the best.

89
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Captain.

90
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,860
I'll definitely do my best

91
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,330
to strive for the championship.

92
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,350
Captain. Don't go.

93
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,990
Captain.

94
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,070
We lost this... year.

95
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,470
Next year..

96
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,110
Next year, we..

97
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,350
We will definitely win next year.

98
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,590
Captain.

99
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,910
We have been in this together so many years.

100
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,630
It's alright to lose this time.

101
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,990
Don't go. Let's do this again.

102
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,940
What is there to cry for?

103
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,660
Haven't cried enough at Vancouver?

104
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,500
No more cryings!

105
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,800
You said you will lead us

106
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
to get the championship trophy.

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
Aren't you happy when we came in second?

108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,800
Aren't you happy?

109
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
I want to win the championship!

110
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,540
Though I left the team,

111
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,820
I'm still your big brother.

112
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,940
I'll still be a fan of this team.

113
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,490
Y'all on your own next year.

114
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,850

If you lose, treat me Zihai instant hotpot.

118
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,260
You lost. Treat us!

119
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,050
Another round.

120
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,770
I attacked you repeatedly!

121
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,770
You've been tricked!

122
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,930
He deliberately lured you to attack him.

123
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,080
Not bad. Not many people see that tactic.

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Brat! Look at who you're talking to.

125
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960

Nice to meet you, I'm Ji Xiang Kong.

Nice to meet you.

I'm here to recruit you to the 'Legend' team

131
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,180
as a strategist.

132
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,380
Using your strategies,

133
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,900
to help the team in winning the championship.

Smells good!

138
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,630
Look. How nice am I.

139
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,830
Thanks, Yiyi.

140
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,630
Right.

141
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,390
I think Director Liu was right.

142
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,030
After transferring to ICONQUER,

143
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,310
it's different from doing 'Lifestyle' concept broadcasts.

144
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,110
It isn't just about having a refreshing content.

145
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,190
It's important to showcase professional knowledge.

146
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,030
Otherwise, your viewers might doubt your content.

147
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,470
They left comments on my Weibo page

148
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,350
saying that they are anticipating my broadcast tomorrow.

149
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,670
You were a smart person.

150
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,420
Why are you so naive now?

151
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,460
Qiao Xin used her connections with the team's manager

152
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,660
She got the opportunity to hold an exclusive interview.

153
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,980
Director Liu is over the moon.

154
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,120
Hey!

155
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,800
If you were to get closer with Ji Xiang Kong,

156
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
maybe..

157
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
Stop.

158
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Ji Xiang Kong is a jerk.

159
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,960
I don't ever want to see him anymore in my life.

160
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,160
If I had to use connections

161
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
in order to surpass Qiao Xin,

162
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
that's losing my true self.

163
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,710
Do you think it's worth it?

164
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,510
Look what's written here.

165
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,270
No spice, no life.

166
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,060
No dream, no youth.

167
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,620
Remember what I've said?

168
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,980
The journey to pursue your dream

169
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,260
is full of obstacles.

170
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,410
Qiao Xin is treating you as a rival.

171
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,250
She caused you to miss your flight.

172
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,090
We'll never know what she is up to next.

173
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,450
Am I right?

174
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,370
Why are you shaking your head?

175
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,610
Delicious.

176
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,920
Delicious? Eat more.

177
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,390
Morning. Coach Luo.

178
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,710
Morning. Had breakfast?

179
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,750
Breakfast? I'm not in a mood to eat.

180
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,950
I'm so vexed right now!

181
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,340
To attain the team's stability,

182
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,020
you have to coach them.

183
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,220
This is such a serious matter.

184
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,260
You're still in a mood

185
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,260
for your breakfast and coffee?

186
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,940
Impressive.

187
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,980
It's nothing serious.

188
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,540
Just a board's meeting.

189
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,460
Nothing serious?

190
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,220
Gu Fang is leaving the team!

191
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,330
Who should take over the responsibilities of the Captain?

192
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,530
We will discuss later when we head back.

193
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,650
Don't worry.

194
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,360
Coach Luo.

195
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
Is there any candicate in your mind?

196
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,720
I think..

197
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,420
Huo Yao, right?

198
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,900
Huo Yao is good.

199
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,020
Huo Yao is the longest member in the team.

200
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,820
We should decide in accordance to their experience.

201
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,100
Right, Coach Luo?

202
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,860
Level of experience is just one of the conditions.

203
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,060
Huo Yao has passed his prime age.

204
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,980
Despite his stable performance these 2 years,

205
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,500
but there wasn't any impressive breakthrough.

206
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,980
Coach Luo, you're saying that..

207
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,710
Impressive.

208
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,390
Positioning, awareness, coordination.

209
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,390
You're excellent in all aspects!

210
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,390
Pretty talented.

211
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,630
Thanks to the teamwork.

212
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,030
I was quite nervous just now.

213
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,910
Both my palms were perspiring.

214
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,270
We don't allow humbleness here.

215
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,590
You're more experienced than

216
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,630
a 3 years experienced gamer.

217
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,670
He played for 3 years.

218
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,750
But he is better than you.

219
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,950
You're under me now.

220
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,470
Why is he under you?

221
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,270
Didn't we agree that newbies are under me?

222
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,310
Enough..

223
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,790
Huo Yao, what do you think?

224
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Huo Yao?

225
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,460
Pretty good.

226
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,620
You're pretty outstanding among the newbies.

227
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,700
Keep it up.

228
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Fine. I thereby announce,

229
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
from today onwards,

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
Li Nan will be a part of our 'Legend' team.

231
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,920
Thanks, Ji Xiang Kong.

232
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Thanks everyone!

233
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,120
All the best.

234
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Treat us dinner!

235
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,520
Treat us dinner!

236
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,870
You will get used to this.

237
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,670
With regards to Gu Fang's withdrawal from the team

238
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,670
I believe everyone here must have heard of it.

239
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,750
Today,

240
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,100
the purpose of this meeting

241
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,540
is to discuss

242
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,260
the next possible candidate to take over Gu Fang.

243
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,860
Actually, the best replacement..

244
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,530
has always been with us.

245
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,090
Ji Xiang Kong.

246
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,050
He has been the team's strategist.

247
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,850
He has always been working closely with Coach Luo

248
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,010
on the line-up and gaming strategy.

249
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,170
I believe everyone here

250
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,330
acknowledges his capabilities.

251
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,650
I think..

252
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,290
He is the best candidate.

253
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,410
Sorry to interrupt.

254
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,250
Since everyone is here,

255
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,280
let's review the results.

256
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,840
What could be the root of the problem?

257
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,080
Why did the team lose?

258
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,910
This is the first round.

259
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,110
Ji Xiang Kong was killed 7 times.

260
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,190
Second round. 5 times.

261
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,540
16 teams.

262
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,180
80 members' statistics.

263
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,020
Ji Xiang Kong ranked last.

264
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,180
Should we give a thought?

265
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,740
Perhaps..

266
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,700
There is a problem with his capabilties.

267
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,890
Everybody. For this competition..

268
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,330
The biggest problem lies on me.

269
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,690
I was being selfish and unthoughtful.

270
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,810
Gu Fang!

271
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,440
During the first round,

272
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,080
Ji Xiang Kong lost 7 points to protect me.

273
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,960
During the intermission,

274
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,240
I heard what he said to

275
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
all of you in the waiting room.

276
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
What did he say?

277
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,700
What are you doing here?

278
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,980
Today's meeting looks weird.

279
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,420
It has been going on for so long.

280
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,620
What do you think they are up to?

281
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,860
Since when were you concern about the Director?

282
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
It's not that. Think.

283
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,020
Ever since we came back from Vancouver,

284
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,460
Zhao Yang has been poking his nose on trival matters.

285
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,220
Look..

286
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,660
Look at his expression.

287
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,740
Do you think he..

288
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,660
Enough. Don't worry too much.

289
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,810
Let's head back to training.

290
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,890
No. We..

291
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,010
Come here.

292
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,010
Coming..

293
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,930
Ji Xiang Kong knew I was out of condition.

294
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,230
He was attacked umpteen times in the game

295
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,270
but it was in vain.

296
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,150
His sacrifice

297
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,030
was a huge advantage to the team.

298
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,990
Gu Fang.

299
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,630
You recruited Ji Xiang Kong.

300
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,630
Trying to side him?

301
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,470
That's understandable.

302
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,990
But the problem is

303
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,470
Even the fans are aware

304
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,110
that Ji Xiang Kong's skills is lacking.

305
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,230
We are professional gamers.

306
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,270
Why should we bothered with

307
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,750
those unprofessional comments online?

308
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,230
It concerns the fans' economy.

309
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,470
Can we close an eye on it?

310
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,180
So.. Sorry.

311
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,900
I was over-reacting.

312
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,260
Sorry.

313
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,260
We have our own dreams.

314
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,500
That's why we persevered till this day.

315
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,520
But reality can't match up with dreams.

316
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
A commercialised team.

317
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
The main focus has to be the Captain.

318
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
It is necessary to recruit a new member.

319
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,200
A potential star player like Gu Fang

320
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
to replace the Captain's position.

321
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
Look at Ji Xiang Kong's current image.

322
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
How can he be the Captain?

323
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,070
The fans will snap and rage at us.

324
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,070
Attaining the championship

325
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,670
is the best payback for the fans.

326
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,390
How did 'Legend' team become

327
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,790
the top international gaming team?

328
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,670
How did we gain so many loyal fans?

329
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,180
Because our goal has never changed.

330
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,260
Battle the world. Attain the championship!

331
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,620
That's the basic.

332
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,980
It will never change.

333
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,740
But the problem is..

334
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
That's enough. Stop.

335
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,010
Initially..

336
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,410
This is supposed to be an open discussion.

337
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,010
Each airs his own views.

338
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,930
Each makes his own sense.

339
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,010
What about..

340
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,530
Let's give him a try.

341
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,810
I just received an insider's news.

342
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,210
ICONQUER is debuting a new game called 'Five Heros'.

343
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,290
There will be a new beta game competition held.

344
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,600
Ji Xiang Kong shall lead the team in this competition.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,360
As a form of test.

346
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,020
Everyone.

347
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,220
Captain! Coach!

348
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,940
Take note, everybody.

349
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,620
I've an announcement to make.

350
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
From today onwards,

351
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,700
Ji Xiang Kong

352
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
shall temporarily be the team's Captain.

353
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,140
Temporarily?

354
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,020
Just make it permanent.

355
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,620
Exactly.

356
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,860
You talked too much.

357
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,650
Being the Captain,

358
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,170
without true talent,

359
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,850
even if you're a Captain now,

360
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,730
you'll fall off eventually.

361
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,280
That's right.

362
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,080
Manager Zhao you made sense.

363
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,080
I've never been a class monitor in my life.

364
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,680
To be the team's Captain,

365
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,080
I need time to adapt.

366
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,640
Take your time.

367
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,540
You'll get used to it.

368
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,380
Xiang Kong, it's a matter of time.

369
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,940
I believe you. In future,

370
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,420
work well under Xiang Kong's lead.

371
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,620
I entrust his capabilities.

372
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,620
So now..

373
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,300
Any objections?

374
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,500
Anyone against the idea, challenge me.

375
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,380
I support this idea. How about you?

376
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,300
Of course, I do.

377
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,180
Captain, in future..

378
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,260
I'll be under you.

379
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,690
Didn't you say you're under me?

380
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,770
Who is under you?

381
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,010
You're not the Captain.

382
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,490
Right, Huo Yao?

383
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,730
Yes.

384
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,090
Congratulations, Xiang Kong.

385
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,050
Thanks, Huo Yao.

386
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,690
Thanks for all your support.

387
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,830
But the new beta game competition is nearing,

388
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,190
since everyone here is ambitious to win,

389
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,070
I have three requests to make.

390
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,990
New broom sweeps clean?

391
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,390
What guts you have.

392
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,510
Come. Let's hear.

393
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,070
Firstly,

394
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,790
when it comes to practice, time is crucial.

395
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,950
We have no time to attend commercial activities.

396
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,710
Secondly,

397
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,950
I wish for everyone's full cooperation on

398
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,550
the new training schedule upcoming.

399
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,140
Third,

400
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,820
other teams have upgraded their system.

401
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,020
We need an upgrade too.

402
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,340
Okay.

403
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,540
The three requests Xiang Kong made,

404
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm on it too.

405
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
Everyone, clap if you agree too.

406
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
Manager Zhao has always been unconditionally supportive.

407
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,200
He shouldn't reject.

408
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,830
Am I right?

409
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,510
In that case,

410
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,390
let's thank Manager Zhao.

411
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,140
Manager Zhao, please look after us.

412
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,660
Bye, Manager Zhao.

413
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,730
Goodbye.

414
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,810
A bunch of idiots!

415
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,320
Manager Zhao.

416
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't get worked up.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Nothing is confirmed yet.

418
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,560
Chill. Have some tea.

419
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm not drinking.

420
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,390
He is just a temporary Captain.

421
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,950
Who is he to be arrogant?

422
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,670
He put me down in front of everyoone.

423
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,550
He requested to put off all commercial events.

424
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,030
Who is he to decide?

425
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,900
If they're not attending,

426
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,700
how much loss will that cost?

427
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,500
Right..

428
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,300
Ji Xiang Kong is refraining me from making money!

429
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,380
For now, he has Gu Fang's support.

430
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,380
Wait till when the farewell party ends.

431
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,580
Once Gu Fang leaves,

432
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
he wouldn't act this way.

433
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,300
How about.. let's find someone external?

434
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,450
Well-known.

435
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,530
Someone who puts his heart and soul on the competition.

436
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,530
Director Jin will definitely support that idea.

437
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
You're referring to him?

438
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,440
Director Liu, you're looking for me?

439
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,980
Hang on.

440
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,180
Director Liu, this has been decided.

441
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,140
Okay.

442
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,300
Qiu Ying, take a seat.

443
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,260
Director Liu.

444
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,020
You don't seem to be doing well recently.

445
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
Judging from the reaction of your section

446
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,580
and live broadcast statistics,

447
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,940
the figures are dropping drastically.

448
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,740
Director Liu, I've been trying my best.

449
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,170
But I've no idea why

450
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,450
I tend to fumble during the competition broadcast.

451
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,310
What about.. try covering it at a different angle?

452
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,830
Like live analysis of the competition

453
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,630
in combination with your talent.

454
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,070
Director Liu, I think that

455
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,430
ICONQUER is a professional gaming series.

456
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,390
I don't want the viewers to think that

457
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,590
I'm unprofessional.

458
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,270
You have your own expectations.

459
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,870
This is a good thing.

460
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,990
But you're aware that

461
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,390
this industry is competitive.

462
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,470
I can only allow a month's time.

463
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,430
A month later,

464
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,710
if there are still no improvements,

465
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,470
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,100
I understand.

467
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,900
Why is she inside for such a long time?

468
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,680
Qiu Ying, how was it?

469
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,160
One month.

470
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,360
One month?

471
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,400
In a month's time,

472
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,760
if there is still no improvement

473
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,680
in my broadcast's statistics,

474
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
I will have to leave.

475
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Lu Yiyi, come in.

476
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,040
I'll pass him the script first.

477
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,510
What's wrong with Director Liu?

478
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,990
I think I know why.

479
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,620
Just now, Qiao Xin talked to him for a long time.

480
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,580
Right after, you were called in.

481
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,020
No wonder things didn't work.

482
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,610
She managed to please Manager Zhao.

483
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,210
Whoever contributes more to the company has a higher value.

484
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,490
Nothing surprising.

485
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,250
I think I wasn't professional enough.

486
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,570
Everything about this company seems good.

487
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,130
Except the coffee brewed from the machine.

488
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,450
Nothing comparable to the retail coffee.

489
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,250
Yan Yan.

490
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,160
I miss those days when you bought coffee for me.

491
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,280
You're not the one firing me!

492
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm the one who fired you!

493
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,550
It's okay. Eat some prawns.

494
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,750
Don't be upset.

495
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,910
Thank you.

496
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,670
Come, cheers.

497
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,020
Cheer up.

498
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,540
You always warned me to be cautious when I speak.

499
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,660
In the end,

500
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,980
you're the one who blew up first.

501
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,300
Rashness is the Devil.

502
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,460
I'm really curious.

503
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,620
How did Director Liu provoked you today?

504
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,130
What spiked you earlier?

505
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,570
He didn't provoked me.

506
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,570
He was just scratching his toes.

507
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,520
Scratching his toes?

508
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,240
He was scratching his toes

509
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,280
while reading my script.

510
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,640
Reminds me of what you have told me.

511
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,360
What is there to be scared of?

512
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,360
Lu Yi Yi.

513
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,580
You have brains.

514
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,380
You have talents.

515
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,620
You will find a job easily.

516
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,220
At the point of time, I was so vexed.

517
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,100
So I told him

518
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,740
Director Liu,

519
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,860
please do not touch the script with your dirty hand.

520
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
Stop laughing.

521
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,700
I can't. You're so cool seriously.

522
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,020
Cool? I've lost my job.

523
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,170
What about you?

524
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,930
Ever since you came back from Vancouver,

525
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,530
Director Liu doesn't assign you coverages.

526
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,170
You refuse to dance and sing.

527
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,410
Your live broadcast aren't doing well either.

528
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,590
If you want to change to a professional style,

529
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,310
it can't be achieved within a short period.

530
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,350
In this era we're living,

531
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,990
creating content is the only way to get popular.

532
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,270
What do you mean?

533
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,910
Creating content?

534
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,150
I have an idea!

535
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,390
Didn't Ji Xiang Kong damage your necklace?

536
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,430
Don't mention him.

537
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,830
Didn't he promise that he will accept any request from you?

538
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,830
Am I right?

539
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,420
So?

540
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,060
Engage him!

541
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,500
Promote your broadcast by engaging him!

542
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,940
Let's say, at 2 a.m.

543
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,240
An interview between profession gamer and pretty host.

544
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,400
No.. No way.

545
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,000
What nonsense?

546
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,240
Think of something realistic.

547
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,360
How is this unrealistic?

548
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,880
Or..

549
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,480
Play a 2-players duel.

550
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,480
I will get a friend to write a post.

551
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,590
The title will be..

552
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,470
A 2-players duel of a professional gamer versus a pretty host.

553
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,900
This will definitely gain INCONQUER fans' attention.

554
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,940
Yi Yi.

555
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,140
I really don't wish to

556
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,140
be contact with

557
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,620
someone like him anymore.

558
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,570
It sounds like a business deal to me.

559
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,770
I don't like it.

560
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,810
Oh please.

561
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,890
He is the one at fault.

562
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,850
Not you.

563
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,170
Afterall,

564
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,450
Besides this idea,

565
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,370
do you have any other better ideas?

566
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,690
Don't forget. Your rental fee.

567
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,360
You have monthly instalments to pay off.

568
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,120
Is..

569
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,110
Is there no other solution?

570
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,100
Director Jin.

571
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,300
This is the guy I've mentioned before.

572
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,500
VNG's Pei Xi.

573
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,220
This year's gaming competition.

574
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,740
He is the strongest black horse.

575
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,140
He is first in ranking internationally.

576
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
I've asked around.

577
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,370
His contract with VNG is expiring soon.

578
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,250
If we're able to recruit him,

579
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,250
by next year,

580
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,970
the championship will definitely be ours.

581
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
Such a talent like him.

582
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,440
We will definitely be more than glad

583
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,520
for him to join us.

584
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,100
What Manager Zhao meant was

585
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
Recruit Pei Xi.

586
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,140
Get him to replace Gu Fang?

587
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,300
Nope.

588
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,780
I'm planning to get him to replace the Captain.

589
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,900
Captain?

590
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,820
He was personally trained by Shu Wen.

591
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,060
How can he switch his team so easily?

592
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,700
I did a research on Pei Xi.

593
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,820
His speed and tactics are indeed amazing.

594
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,540
But have you wonder

595
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,850
why did VNG come in 4th this year?

596
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,930
Besides Pei Xi,

597
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,930
no one else are talented in VNG.

598
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,650
It's not that.

599
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,930
It's because Pei Xi is too individualistic.

600
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,150
The team survives. The outcast dies.

601
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,950
Someone like Pei Xi

602
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,990
doesn't fit to be the Captain.

603
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,350
Why are you overreacting?

604
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,990
Pei Xi is well-liked by the public.

605
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,870
The public like his gaming style.

606
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,470
The public enjoy watching it.

607
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,790
How interesting.

608
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,990
Who likes to see your crappy gaming tactics?

609
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,390
I'm thirsty.

610
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
The both of you

611
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,100
are always fighting with each other.

612
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,360
Coach Luo. Your views?

613
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,920
My view is

614
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Pei Xi is talented indeed. I agree.

615
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,480
But Pei Xi definitely isn't someone

616
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,400
who fits to take up the Captain role.

617
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,040
Recruiting a new player is costly.

618
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,320
Can we afford?

619
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,760
None of your concern.

620
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,320
What has that got to do with you?

621
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,920
So what if recruiting Pei Xi is costly?

622
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,470
Look at how huge Pei Xi's fanbase is.

623
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,590
That will earn us big bucks.

624
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,870
Loads of sponsors are waiting to sign him on.

625
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,460
Director Jin.

626
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,660
Ever since Gu Fang left,

627
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,180
there isn't anyone in the team

628
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,860
has the potential to be the next star player.

629
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,410
Next year's sponsorship..

630
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,130
will be a challenge.

631
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,930
I'm really worried.

632
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,290
Zhao Yang,

633
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,410
How about..

634
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,040
Try talking to Pei Xi.

635
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,360
Sure! No problem!

636
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,030
This is driving me crazy!

637
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,990
I'm not convinced that

638
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,390
I can't find a job after leaving Lu Xing.

639
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,180
Hello? Is this Miss Lu?

640
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,900
Hey you!

641
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,980
I'm not buying any house or car!

642
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,620
I'm not applying any loans! Stop bothering me!

643
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,500
Hang on.

644
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,300
This is calling from 'Dong Gan' Gaming Publication.

645
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,580
You have passed on first review.

646
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,300
Hold on.

647
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,180
'Dong Gan' Gaming Publication?

648
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,860
Don't hang up.

649
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,180
I'm on my way now!

650
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,450
How should I bring this up?

651
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,370
Hey! Ji Xiang Kong!

652
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,960
Didn't you promise to fulfill my request?

653
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,840
Unnatural. This won't work.

654
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,020
Ji Xiang Kong. Can you..

655
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,580
please do me a tiny favour?

656
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,180
Too fake. This won't work.

657
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,540
I shall just go with the flow.

658
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,020
Forget it.

659
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,850
No.

660
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,810
He was the one who damaged my necklace.

661
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,370
He didn't even apologise.

662
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,610
No way!

663
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,750
Still have the cheek to lecture me?

664
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,230
I must not let him off so easily.

665
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,710
I can't.
