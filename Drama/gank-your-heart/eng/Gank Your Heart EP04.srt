1
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,479
Why did the necklace break?

2
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,053
Is it broken?

3
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:50,402
Let me have a look at it.

4
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:54,774
This shouldn't be.

5
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,782
It was fine when I left the house just now.

6
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:00,322
Is that ok?

7
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:01,879
How much is it? I compensate for you

8
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,844
What is priceless you know?

9
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,792
Well, since you think it's priceless

10
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,681
Money won't pay you back.

11
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,436
So let it be

12
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:32,759
You make a request

13
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,595
No matter what I can satisfy you

14
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:38,682
Xiangkong Ji,

15
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,120
I thought you were a decent guy

16
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,151
Now it seems that I misunderstood you

17
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:25,483
Mom,I'm sorry

18
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,473
I'm sorry

19
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,015
I broke the necklace

20
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,919
Whatever you think of me

21
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,799
I still hope you can help me

22
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:05,792
Because Fang Gu is

23
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,243
The idol of domestic esports circle

24
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,757
What is priceless you know?

25
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:22,358
Why are you still playing with your phone?

26
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:23,462
What's the matter?

27
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:24,887
The captain is retiring

28
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:27,076
Where's the captain?

29
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,142
He's right downstairs.

30
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,804
Wait a minute

31
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,136
The captain

32
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,068
Don't call me captain

33
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:07,279
There will be someone more suitable to replace me

34
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,108
At least for now you're still the captain.

35
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,675
Are you really retiring?

36
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,797
I'm thirty years old

37
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,667
It's time to retire

38
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:25,427
Xiangkong

39
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,796
The team can do without me

40
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,597
But not without you

41
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,760
Over the years

42
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,167
If there's anything esle I can do

43
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:43,778
it's because I found you

44
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,162
From vancouver

45
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,184
Come back later

46
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,073
Many people have written a lot of bad things about you on the Internet

47
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:53,820
Among the pros

48
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:55,921
My hands are not fast enough.

49
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,798
I'm sorry

50
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,804
You've suffered a lot.

51
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,469
It's all right. They call me names.

52
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,913
I don't care

53
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,269
No matter what I did as a child, 

54
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,912
I was questioned and ridiculed.

55
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,139
I'm used to it

56
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,360
I've been fighting for years

57
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,327
And I still haven't won a second ring

58
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:44,463
Before

59
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,680
my dream was to win a second championship

60
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:53,521
But now the dream is to see you win the cup

61
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,432
The captain's burden is on you

62
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:06,068
Captain, you think too highly of me

63
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,513
My hands aren't fast enough

64
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,752
How can I be captain?

65
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,314
In front of me

66
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:11,241
You still wear a mask 

67
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,033
And pretend you don't care

68
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,393
How hot you are inside!

69
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:17,190
We all felt it

70
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:22,079
Don't let external factors affect your own mood

71
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:25,258
Come on

72
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:27,844
You are my hope and the team's hope

73
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,405
The captain

74
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,802
I don't know if I can do it

75
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,429
You have to trust me

76
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:39,836
You can do it.

77
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:42,536
A Xuan is very talented

78
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,384
Yao Huo is an experienced veteran

79
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:49,917
Lu feng has a good personality and strong combining ability

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,787
Give you such a good team

81
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,985
My regrets may be fulfilled

82
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:01,776
Don't refuse me

83
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,556
Come on

84
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:25,085
The captain

85
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,203
I'll do my best

86
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,595
We'll get the championship back

87
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:46,648
Captain, you're not leaving here

88
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:48,129
The captain

89
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,389
It was our fault that we lost the game this year

90
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,720
Next year

91
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:53,446
Next year,

92
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:54,549
We are sure to win the championship

93
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:56,872
The captain

94
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,814
We fought together for so many years

95
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:02,712
Let's not miss this year

96
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,082
Don't leave. We'll fight for another year

97
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:14,882
Don't cry

98
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:16,725
Haven't you cried enough in Vancouver?

99
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,446
Don't cry

100
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:26,161
You said you were going to take us to the podium

101
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:32,794
After you come second

102
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,899
Aren't you guys having a good time?

103
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:35,736
Aren't you guys having a good time?

104
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:37,182
I want to win the championship

105
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,323
Even though I retired

106
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,612
I am still your brother

107
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,674
I will be your fan in the future

108
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:05,086
You must work hard next year.

109
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,275
Go! Go! Go!

110
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,299
Xiao Yu,

111
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:54,766
If you lose the game, you should treat us to hot pot

112
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,217
You must be willing to bet to lose.Go and buy it.

113
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:01,433
Let's play another game

114
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:03,000
I just killed you so many times in the game

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,895
You fell for his trick.

116
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:07,310
He took you on the road to be killed on purpose.

117
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,090
You are right. Almost no one understands my tactics

118
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,343
Boy, do you know who he is?

119
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,004
Brother Sun, I know.

120
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,929
Gris - Fang Gu.

121
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,154
He is the captain of the legends team

122
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,826
Hello, my name is Xiangkong Ji

123
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:21,510
Hello

124
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:26,024
I'd like to invite you to be the team leader

125
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,748
I hope you use your tactics to help our team to the top

126
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:30,706
Are you interested in it?

127
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:53,452
I've got the hot pot for you

128
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,179
Please have your dinner, Xiao Yingzi.

129
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:58,461
 It smells good!

130
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,370
Am I being nice to you?

131
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:01,778
Thank you, Yiyi.

132
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:05,490
There 's something I want to tell you

133
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,113
I think Mr. Liu was especially right

134
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,911
After I moved to the IConquer game section to work

135
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,017
It's really different from working in the lifestyle section

136
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,780
Not only is the work much fresher

137
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:16,076
But the most important thing is that I need to have professional knowledge

138
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:17,802
Otherwise the audience will question your ability

139
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,240
They left a message at the bottom of my micro blog 

140
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,439
And said they wanted to watch my live broadcast

141
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:24,914
I hope I can make a good start

142
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,439
How smart you are

143
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,149
Why are you so innocent now?

144
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:32,728
Qiao Xin!

145
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,076
She contacted the legendary team manager Zhao

146
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:37,177
And she got the exclusive right to interview

147
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,578
Mr. Liu was very happy

148
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:41,621
I think...

149
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:45,333
If you get along well with ji xiang kong and become friends

150
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,675
Then maybe...

151
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,247
Stop!

152
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:49,925
Xiangkong Ji is a jerk

153
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,437
I don't want to see him any more

154
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,781
If I in order to win over Xin Qiao

155
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,172
So as to become like her

156
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,626
Then I lose myself

157
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,054
Do you think it's worth it?

158
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,864
Look what it says

159
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,668
Life can not be without pepper

160
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,301
Youth is not youth without dreams

161
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,996
Do you remember what I told you

162
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,321
On the path to your dreams

163
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,580
There are traps everywhere

164
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:20,793
Now,Xin Qiao thinks you are imaginary enemy all the time

165
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,503
Last time she made you miss the plane

166
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,386
And then we don't know what she's gonna do

167
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:29,768
Do you think if I'm right?

168
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:34,541
You... You shook your head

169
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,625
What do you mean?

170
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:37,835
It is really good

171
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:40,074
Eat as much as you like

172
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,560
Good morning! Coach Luo

173
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,602
Good morning! Have you had breakfast yet?

174
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,919
I'm not in the mood to eat right now

175
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,036
I'm so worried 

176
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,070
On our team

177
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,809
You are the most steady person

178
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,190
So much has happened now

179
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,341
You're still in the mood for breakfast and coffee.

180
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:09,913
Very fierce!

181
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:11,860
It's not a big deal

182
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,477
We just had a board meeting. Nothing happened.

183
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,198
Isn't it a big deal?

184
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,179
Fang Gu retired

185
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,911
Who do you think will be the captain? 

186
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:21,088
Isn't it? 

187
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:24,910
In this case

188
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,329
Let's go back and talk it over

189
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:27,478
Don't worry

190
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,137
Coach Cao

191
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,890
Do you have a team leader in mind?

192
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,302
I think...

193
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,739
What do you think of Yao Huo?

194
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:42,532
How nice Yao Huo is!

195
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,576
He's been the longest on our team

196
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,594
We have to choose the captain according to seniority

197
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:48,929
Isn't it? Coach Luo

198
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:52,431
Seniority is only one facctor.

199
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,635
The main reason is huo yao's golden period has passed

200
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,518
Although his performance these two years is relatively stable

201
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:01,988
But he didn't surprise me.

202
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,398
Coach Luo, What is your meaning? 

203
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,139
You're amazing!

204
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:25,797
Positioning, awareness, coordination

205
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:26,873
Every aspects are very good

206
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:27,828
You have a gift

207
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,034
That's because everyone works together.

208
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,304
I was really nervous

209
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,891
Both of my palms were sweating all the time

210
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,554
Modesty is not in fashion here

211
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,998
It's not like you've only been playing for three years

212
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,848
He has been playing better than you for three years

213
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,215
You'll follow me later

214
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:43,705
Why is he following you again?

215
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:44,717
Didn't we say the new guy would follow me?

216
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:45,542
The newcomers follow me

217
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:46,207
Stop!Stop!

218
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:48,844
Brother Yao, what do you think?

219
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:52,636
Brother Yao?  

220
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,814
Good.He's the best of the new boys

221
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:58,872
Come on

222
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,154
Okay, I'll announce it now

223
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,701
From today

224
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,197
Nan Li officially became a member of our Legendary team

225
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:09,067
Thank you

226
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:09,848
Thank you for your attention

227
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:11,060
Come on!come on!

228
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,761
It's your treat tonight

229
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:18,624
Your treat tonight

230
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:19,772
You just get used to it

231
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:20,952
You just get used to it

232
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,422
Gu fang is retiring

233
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,718
I think everyone knows about it already

234
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:28,742
Today   

235
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,954
I've called everyone together to discuss a matter

236
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:36,146
Who can take the captain's burden instead of gu fang?

237
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:40,292
In fact, the best candidate is here

238
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:41,831
Xiangkong Ji

239
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,761
He has been the leader of the team

240
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,921
And the lineup and tactics are he and coach Luo ordered

241
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,958
His ability should be seen by all

242
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:52,459
I think...

243
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,899
He is the best candidate

244
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,317
Let me say one word here

245
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:57,910
It just so happens that everyone is here today

246
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,867
Let's just go back to the last game

247
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,468
Let's find out what the problem is.

248
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,660
Why did we lose the game?

249
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:11,601
This is the first game

250
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,663
Xiangkong Ji was killed seven times

251
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,133
He was hit five times in the second game

252
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:23,047
There are 16 teams in all

253
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:24,717
Data from 80 players

254
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,483
Ji xiangkong was last

255
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,623
Should we think about it

256
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,092
Is there a problem with the player's ability?  

257
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:42,411
Everybody

258
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,760
Actually, the biggest responsibility for losing this game lies with me

259
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:46,985
It's because I'm selfish

260
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:48,029
Gu Fang...

261
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,764
In the first inning

262
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,336
Because Xiangkong Ji wanted to protect me, he lost seven points

263
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:55,265
And at halftime

264
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,591
I heard everything he told you in the lounge

265
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,106
What did he say? 

266
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,014
What are you doing here if you don't training ?

267
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,010
Their meeting today will be abnormal

268
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:13,508
It's been a long time

269
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,746
Do you think there will be any trouble?  

270
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,119
No, when did you fuck the president?

271
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,558
No,you think about it.

272
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,072
Ever since we got back from vancouver

273
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:24,542
Zhao Yang is bothering us every day

274
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,258
And make it hard for us every day

275
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:25,948
You see him, you see him.

276
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:26,715
Look at him

277
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:27,966
Do you think he'll say anything in front of chairman Jin?

278
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,450
All right, don't worry about it

279
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:30,868
Come back with me for training

280
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:31,833
No,we...we...

281
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,905
Let's go!

282
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:35,646
I'm coming. I'm coming

283
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,973
He knew I wasn't in good form.  

284
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,251
Even if he had been shot so many times,

285
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:41,062
he can't protect me

286
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:43,914
His sacrifice really gave the team a big advantage

287
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:47,796
Fang Gu

288
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,490
You brought Xiangkong Ji into the team

289
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,407
If youwant to protect him

290
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,296
There are many reasons  

291
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:55,844
But the problem is

292
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,050
Even the fans know

293
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,700
Xiangkong Ji's ability is insufficient

294
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,836
We're a professional team

295
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,640
Why should we care about the unprofessional comments on the Internet?

296
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,027
Now it's fan economy

297
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,175
We can't help but look at it.

298
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

299
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,607
I'm a little emotional

300
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:15,854
I'm sorry

301
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:17,654
For the dream

302
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:18,905
We just hold on to today 

303
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:22,226
But dreams don't fill the stomach.

304
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,832
A commercial team

305
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,739
The most important position is the captain

306
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:31,912
We have to find another star player like Fang Gu 

307
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:33,389
Let him take on the responsibility  

308
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,055
With Xiangkong Ji's current public image

309
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:38,560
If we make him captain

310
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,546
The fan will yell at us

311
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:42,539
Winning the championship 

312
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,028
It is the best explanation to the fans

313
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:47,131
Why our Legend can become the top team in the country? 

314
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,194
Why does our team have so many loyal fans? 

315
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,368
This is because our goal is consistent

316
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,610
To win the world championship

317
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,076
This is the basic

318
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,423
We can't put the cart before the horse

319
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,190
But the thing is we're going to...

320
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,020
All right, all right, all right

321
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:02,382
Originally

322
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:03,878
We were supposed to discuss the matter together.

323
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,484
Everyone gave his opinion

324
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:06,329
Everyone has their own reason

325
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,347
Let's do it this way 

326
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:11,900
Let's give him a try

327
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:13,177
I just got a message

328
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,582
IConquer is launching five new heroes

329
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,485
A new version of the beta will be held

330
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:21,664
Let Xiangkong Ji as acting captain to participate in the game

331
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,495
Use it as a test to test him

332
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:40,977
Everybody

333
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:43,318
Captain,Coach

334
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,013
May I have your attetion,please.

335
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:47,704
Let me make an announcement

336
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:49,529
From today on

337
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,773
Xiangkong Ji 

338
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,191
He is our acting captain

339
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,128
No. Why the acting captain?

340
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:57,112
He should just be the captain

341
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:57,709
That's right

342
00:20:59,074 --> 00:20:59,792
You talk so much

343
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:05,066
The captain is a man of no ability

344
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,760
Even if you sit on it now

345
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:08,305
you will fall down sooner or later

346
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:12,067
That's right

347
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,073
What manager Zhao said is reasonable

348
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:15,820
I haven't been a group leader since I was a child

349
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:17,656
Now I'm suddenly the captain

350
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,095
I'm not used to it

351
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,344
You get used to it.

352
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,192
Xiangkong, this is just a transition

353
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,694
I believe in you

354
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,350
Everyone should follow Xiangkong have a good match in the future

355
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,233
I'm sure he can lead you

356
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,235
How's that?

357
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,899
Are there still unconvinced?

358
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:36,218
Dare a disobedient man play a game with me?  

359
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,928
I agree.Do you agree? 

360
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,088
Do you have a problem?

361
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:42,058
I don't have, I don't have.

362
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,699
Captain,in the future 

363
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:47,794
I'll be with you from now on

364
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,320
Didn't you say you were following me?

365
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:51,183
I won't follow you  

366
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,572
You're not the captain

367
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:53,952
Isn't that right, Brother Yao

368
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:55,220
It's right

369
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:56,703
Congratulations to you!

370
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,604
Thank you, Brother Yao

371
00:21:58,113 --> 00:21:59,224
Thank you for your support

372
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:02,219
But the new version of the beta is about to begin

373
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:04,506
Since everyone is with the goal of winning

374
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,415
I'd like to make three demands on the company

375
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,405
A new broom sweeps clean

376
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:12,867
You have the nerve to ask the company

377
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,898
Come on, let me hear it

378
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,411
First

379
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,196
We need to train fast.

380
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,199
So there's no time for  commercial activities

381
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,042
Secondly

382
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:26,137
I have a customized training program with my coach

383
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,565
I expect everyone to cooperate unconditionally

384
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:31,337
Thirdly  

385
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,078
Each team is upgrading equipment

386
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,305
Our equipment also needs upgrading

387
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:37,582
OK

388
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:41,111
I agree with Xiangkong Ji's three demands

389
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:44,244
Everyone who agrees with it clap

390
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:57,217
Manager zhao has always supported us unconditionally

391
00:22:57,832 --> 00:22:58,664
I don't think he'll say no

392
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:02,825
Isn't it?  

393
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,216
Then I'll thank manager zhao

394
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,368
In the future

395
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,002
Please give manager Zhao a lot of attention .

396
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:18,705
Manager zhao,please be careful where you walk

397
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,388
Leave youself

398
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,578
A group of uneducated  people

399
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:40,057
Manager zhao

400
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:40,914
Don't be angry

401
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:42,563
It's not certain yet!

402
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:44,394
Calm down and have a cup of tea   

403
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:45,319
I don't drink

404
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:49,954
He was just an acting captain

405
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:51,920
I wonder what he's proud of? 

406
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,345
He challenge me in front of so many people

407
00:23:54,644 --> 00:23:55,226
He also said that

408
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,282
They do not engage in all commercial activities

409
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:58,540
That's not for him to decide

410
00:23:58,922 --> 00:23:59,911
The activities are all arranged

411
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,586
if he doesn't go

412
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:01,389
How much will I have to lose? 

413
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:02,187
yes,yes,yes

414
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:03,244
Anyway

415
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:04,768
 Xiangkong Ji is just wanted to stop me from making money

416
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:08,162
Xiangkong Ji also relied on Fang Gu

417
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,921
When the retirement dinner is over

418
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,090
The Fang Gu is gone

419
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,962
How long do you think he can stay proud?  

420
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,801
Why don't we find someone from the outside

421
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:23,035
The man had to be famous and focused on the game

422
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:25,967
Chairman Jin was absolutely pleased with the man

423
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:33,004
Is that the man you mean?

424
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,972
Mannager Liu, are you looking for me?

425
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:41,215
Wait a moment

426
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,599
Let's settle the matter like this, manager Liu

427
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:44,519
OK  

428
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,399
Ying Qiu,come and sit down  

429
00:24:56,992 --> 00:24:57,569
Manager Liu  

430
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:00,952
I've noticed that you don't look very well recently

431
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,784
From the personal column of the heat and attetion of live broadcast

432
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:06,140
They've all come down too much lately

433
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:09,748
Manager Liu,in fact I have been training hard

434
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,362
But I don't know why I can't practice well

435
00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:15,426
I made a lot of mistakes when I played

436
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:20,717
Can you consider the diversity of the programs?

437
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:25,662
For example, you combine the game analysis with your individual talents.

438
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,147
 Manager Liu, here is what I think

439
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:32,441
I think the IConquer version is a professional version of pro sports

440
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:36,367
I don't want people to think I'm unprofessional as a host

441
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,222
You set high standards for yourself

442
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,911
This is a good thing

443
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,148
But you know there is too much competition in our industry

444
00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:43,868
I can only give you one month

445
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,542
If the problem hasn't been solved by then

446
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,128
I can only apologize for that

447
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,813
I get it  

448
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:56,950
She's been in there a long time

449
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,817
 What hasn't she come out yet?

450
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,531
How's it going, Ying Qiu?

451
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,835
A month

452
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,205
A month?

453
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:07,073
In a month

454
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:09,607
If my show doesn't catch on

455
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:11,404
I'll be fired

456
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,463
Yiyi Lu, come in

457
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:17,841
Now I'll go in and deliver his papers to him

458
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:25,016
Why did manager Liu suddenly do this to you? 

459
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:29,515
I know why he did this to you. 

460
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,125
Just now I watched Xin Qiao go in for a long time

461
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:34,172
Then he called you in there

462
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,596
This is not a good thing 

463
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,821
She helped manager Liu to appease

464
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,934
 manager Zhao of Legends 

465
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,477
Of course he will help more valuable people

466
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:44,065
This is normal

467
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:46,425
I should blame my lack of professional ability

468
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,897
The company is good everywhere

469
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:55,443
The coffee made in this coffee machine is not as good as 

470
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:57,904
the coffee made by hands outside

471
00:26:58,897 --> 00:26:59,657
Yanyan 

472
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,162
Actually, I miss the days when you bought me coffee

473
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,242
when you bought me coffee

474
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,719
You didn't fire me.

475
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:09,207
I fired you

476
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:12,879
Don't be angry.Let's eat the shrimp

477
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,305
Don't be unhappy

478
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:17,938
Thank you

479
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,920
Come on, cheers!cheers!

480
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,217
Be happy

481
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,185
You're a guy who

482
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:27,777
sends me positive messeges every day

483
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:28,814
Then your actions are more honest 

484
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,008
than your mouth

485
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:33,430
Impulse is the devil

486
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:36,497
I really want to know 

487
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,682
 how manager Liu bullied you today

488
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:41,117
so that you suddenly broke out

489
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,713
Actually, he didn't abuse me today

490
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,486
He's just touching his feet

491
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:51,453
What? 

492
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:54,066
I watched him touch his feet 

493
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:55,065
and read my mancscript 

494
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:56,433
The words you said to me 

495
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,614
just come back to me

496
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,356
You have nothing to fear.

497
00:27:58,475 --> 00:27:59,261
You ae Yiyi Lu

498
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,386
You have substance and talent

499
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:02,344
You're not afraid of not getting a job

500
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:05,887
Then I told him impulsively

501
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:09,654
Manager Liu, please don't take my manuscript 

502
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,716
with your hands that have dug out your feet

503
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,311
You're still laughing at me

504
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,489
No, you're so cool. Really

505
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:22,864
Cool? The jobs are gone

506
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:30,839
How's your job going?

507
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,733
Ever since you come back from vancouver

508
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:33,483
Manager Liu hasn't let you go out 

509
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:34,252
for a live interview.

510
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:35,726
You don't want to sing and dance

511
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:37,961
The popularity of personal column is not good

512
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:40,307
But if you want to go professional

513
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:42,922
It's not something you can do in a month or two, is it?

514
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:47,013
If you want to be popular now 

515
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,752
you can only create hot spots

516
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:50,617
What is your meaning?

517
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,215
How do you make hot spots?

518
00:28:59,013 --> 00:28:59,799
I have an idea

519
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,524
Did you say your necklace 

520
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,023
was broken by Xiangkong Ji?

521
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,966
Don't mention this man to me

522
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:06,345
Did he still say he would grant you 

523
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,359
anything you asked for?

524
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:09,311
Did I remember that correctly?

525
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:10,656
So?

526
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,572
We can count on him for attention

527
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,924
Let him to help you advertise

528
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:19,069
For example,at two in the moring

529
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:21,097
Esports handsome boy 

530
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,595
accepts the invitation beauty host

531
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,884
You... Stop! Stop!

532
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,136
What a bad idea!

533
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:27,636
Can you give me a good idea?

534
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,693
Isn't that a good idea?

535
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:34,023
How about this idea?

536
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,792
You ask him to play a double qualifying with you

537
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:38,180
When the time comes

538
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,653
I asked a friend to write a promotional article for you

539
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,590
The title of the article is

540
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:44,775
Famous professional esports player 

541
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,802
live double qualifying with beautiful female hosts 

542
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:49,203
I promise to make you popular with fans 

543
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:49,966
who like the IConquer

544
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,567
How about it?  

545
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,079
Yiyi 

546
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,359
I really don't want to have anything to do 

547
00:29:58,408 --> 00:29:59,722
with these people anymore

548
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,247
And this sound...

549
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,569
This sounds like a deal

550
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:06,809
I don't like doing that

551
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:08,860
Sister

552
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,978
It was he who did the wrong thing

553
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:11,936
Not you

554
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:13,103
Secondly

555
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:14,620
Is there any other way for us to go 

556
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,227
besides this method?

557
00:30:17,494 --> 00:30:19,815
Don't forget that you have a mortgage 

558
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:22,265
on your house every month

559
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:31,905
Is ther really nothing else I can do?

560
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,756
Chairman Jin

561
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,034
This is the player I told you about earlier

562
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,385
Xi Pei of WeiTeng team 

563
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,672
is the biggest black horse 

564
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,349
in professional esports this year

565
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,811
He is currently the no. 1 player in the world

566
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:57,361
I also learned that 

567
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,916
his contract with WeiTeng is about to expire

568
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:02,900
If we can sign him over

569
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:04,902
Over the next year

570
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,616
We are sure to win the vancouver finals

571
00:31:13,493 --> 00:31:14,426
For such talents

572
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,921
our Legends team welcomes you with open arms

573
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,690
Do Manager Zhao means to replace Fang Gu 

574
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:23,515
 with XiPei as the mid?

575
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,544
No

576
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,957
I wanted him to be captain

577
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:32,094
The captain?

578
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:36,116
He  was raised by Shuwen

579
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,273
  They couldn't let him just switch teams

580
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,871
And I also studied Xi Pei

581
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:43,719
His hand speed and handling 

582
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,082
are truly top-notch

583
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,968
But have you ever wondered

584
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,866
why Weiteng only finish fourth this year?

585
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:52,255
Because the other members of the WeiTeng team 

586
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,165
are not good except Xi Pei

587
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,878
It is not that WeiTeng is not strong

588
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,194
but Xi Pei's playing style is too arbitrary

589
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:01,012
A pack of wolves can live well

590
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,344
but a Wolf cannot live

591
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,105
His personality 

592
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:06,330
is definitely not suited to be captain

593
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,491
Don't shout

594
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,259
The audience like to see Pei Xi

595
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,396
a dozen of this kind of play

596
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:13,549
How interesting to watch!

597
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:14,756
How wonderful!

598
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:17,931
No one likes to see you

599
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:19,638
with this esoteric tactic you don't understand.

600
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,137
You...

601
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,199
So thirsty!

602
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,861
The two of you quarreled 

603
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,687
  when you met

604
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,996
Whenever you meet, you fight

605
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:40,199
What do you think, coach Luo?

606
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:41,825
I admit that

607
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:44,672
 Xi Pei is a talent

608
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:48,059
But he is definitely not the kind of person to be captain

609
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,889
And how high the signing fee is!

610
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,150
Can we afford it?

611
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:55,508
This not your job decription

612
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:57,112
Don't worry about it.

613
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:59,616
 Xi Pei's signing feeis high

614
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,207
but you should see how many Xi Pei fans there are

615
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:03,274
He can attract a lot of investment

616
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,432
There is many sponsors lining up to sign him

617
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:09,940
Chairman Jin

618
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,195
Since Fang Gu left

619
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,069
On our team

620
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,563
We don't have any more star players 

621
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,695
It's hard to talk about 

622
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:24,716
next year's sponsorship.

623
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,528
I'm also under a lot of pressure

624
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:34,802
Yang Zhao

625
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,449
Well,You talk to Xi Pei about it

626
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,755
Sure. No problem.

627
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:55,391
I have interviewed so many companies and failed.

628
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,299
I don't believe I can't get a job 

629
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,535
after I leave YouXing company

630
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,530
Hello, are you Miss Lu? 

631
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:05,302
I tell you

632
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:06,227
I won't buy a house or a car

633
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:07,997
I won't take out a loan.Don't bother me.

634
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:08,748
Wait a minute

635
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,507
This is Donggan esports magazine

636
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,862
Your resume has passed our first round of screening

637
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:13,460
Wait a minute

638
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:16,524
Donggan esports magazine?

639
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:17,193
Please hold the line

640
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:18,386
I'll be right there. I'll be right there.

641
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,560
What should I say?

642
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,449
Hello, Xiang Ji

643
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,100
Didn't you say you could 

644
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,018
grant me anything I asked for?

645
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,904
No,my tone is too hard.

646
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:41,693
Xiangkong Ji

647
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,526
could you do me a little favor?

648
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,200
No, it's too soft

649
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,363
Let me improvise!

650
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:01,939
I'd better not do that,would I?

651
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:12,565
No

652
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,520
He broke my necklace

653
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,083
He didn't apologize to me

654
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,534
Why should I forgive him?

655
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,543
He talked all sorts of nonsense.

656
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:23,934
Why should I forgive him?

657
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,329
No
