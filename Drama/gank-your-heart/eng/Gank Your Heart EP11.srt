Episode 11

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,540
Reporter Lu.

3
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,020
What do you want?

4
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,060
Thank you for your help just now.

5
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,820
Don't need to.

6
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,300
I can't stand your thank you.

7
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,850
I only ask that you

8
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,250
don't provoke our Qiu Ying anymore.

9
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,770
Please and thank you.

10
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,690
In order to find this video for you,

11
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,010
she waited to at the airport for a night.

12
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,210
do you know?

13
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,210
And something nearly happened to her,

14
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,070
What happened?

15
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,870
Where is she now?

16
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,070
She's fine now.

17
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,270
Let me tell you.

18
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,990
Stop trying to take her advantage.

19
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,830
No.

20
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,270
My Kong ge is sincere.

21
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,870
You can't say it like that.

22
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,630
As long as he

23
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,990
stops messing with our Qiu Ying.

24
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,790
I'll be sincerely grateful.

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,750
Is this what she wants

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,590
or is this what you want?

27
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,830
Is there a difference?

28
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,150
What I want

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,190
is also what she wants.

30
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,470
Our Qiu Ying is naive,

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,630
simple and kind.

32
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,470
Let me tell you.

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,790
Don't try to take advantage of her.

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,910
Or I'll never forgive you.

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,940
And you.

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,460
What has this got to do with me?

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
You're going?

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,980
Take care.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Remember to send WeChat messages to me.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,920
Something's going on.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,120
Interesting.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,760
Not- not interesting.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
I-

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
Am I that obvious?

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,400
You know it yourself.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,200
You're going?

47
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,110
We've suffered a lot today.

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,950
It's okay.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,140
Don't do anything today.

50
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,980
Sleep early.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,820
You didn't really sleep well last night.

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,580
It's fine.

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,410
I slept on the chair at the airport.

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,690
Waist hurts a little.

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,890
Obviously. It'd be surprising if your waist didn't hurt

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,450
while you're pressing the chair like that.

57
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,050
I saw online that

58
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,010
so many people were apologising to Ji Xiang Kong.

59
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,490
I just feel that

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,210
my efforts weren't wasted.

61
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,800
I don't understand.

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
What has he 'sinking into the snow'

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
got to do with you?

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
You're worry about him the whole day.

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,430
No way, I'll go to the toilet first okay?

66
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,150
My stomach hurts a little.

67
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,870
Sleep early.

68
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,590
Go.

69
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,510
Where's my phone?

70
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,670
It's there.

71
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,510
Sleep early.

72
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,580
[Is it alright if we have dinner together?]

73
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,580
Ji Xiang Kong

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,380
[You're polite, I should be the one treating.]

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,380
Qiu Ying

76
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,610
Gong Shu district, Hang Zhou City]

77
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,610
[Location: Top Roast Meat,

78
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,290
Ji Xiang Kong

79
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,290
[This store has pretty good roast meat.]

80
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,010
See you.

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,740
Yi Yi.

82
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm suddenly really sleepy.

83
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm going to sleep.

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,730
Don't disturb me later.

85
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,450
Goodnight.

86
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,390
She really slept?

87
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,780
What are you doing?

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
Acting all suspicious.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
Didn't you say you were going to sleep?

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm suddenly a little hungry.

91
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,160
I want to go and buy some instant noodles.

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
We still have a lot at home.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
What are you buying for?

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Our house-

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
I want a seafood flavoured one.

96
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,590
Buying instant noodles?

97
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,630
What are you holding in your hand?

98
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,630
Hand it over.

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
You're going to wear this

100
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
to go and buy

101
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,380
instant noodles?

102
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
Who are you lying to?

103
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,860
Did someone ask you out?

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,090
That person or Ji Xiang Kong?

105
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,490
No.

106
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,410
This guy is really perseverant.

107
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,450
I clearly rejected him

108
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,570
in the afternoon for you.

109
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,890
He still dares to ask you out?

110
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,850
Yi Yi,

111
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,090
but he also helped us previously?

112
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,440
Just having a meal together, it's not too much right?

113
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,400
He asked you to eat out when it's so late.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,360
Then why don't he ask you

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
tomorrow morning or afternoon?

116
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,200
It's so late, he definitely doesn't have good intentions.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
You're thinking too much.

118
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,150
We are just purely going out for a meal.

119
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,990
Tell me honestly, you

120
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,990
Have you already fallen for him?

121
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,460
What joke are you cracking?

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,780
We are just normal friends.

123
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
How is that possible?

124
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,100
I swear.

125
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
We are just simply eating a meal.

126
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,860
Sure.

127
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,010
What are you doing?

128
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,570
If you want to change, that's fine.

129
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,170
Come here, change into this.

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,840
And for the pants, just keep this on.

131
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,000
Change your top into this.

132
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
It'd be best if you're

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,560
covered from head to toe.

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
You definitely can't be this exposed.

135
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Okay.

136
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
[Lu Yi Yi]

137
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:16,980
Hello?

138
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,940
Hello? Lin Yi Xuan.

139
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,580
What's up?

140
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,580
Let me ask you.

141
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,780
Is your Kong Ge going out?

142
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,660
How did you know?

143
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,860
Where's he going?

144
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,220
A roast meat store

145
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,340
that we always go to.

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,970
Roast meat store?

147
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,450
Then since it's this way,

148
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,530
send the address to me later.

149
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,530
Wait for me there.

150
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,760
You want to ask me out for a meal?

151
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,910
What are you saying?

152
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,590
Move quicker, bye.

153
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,710
Okay.

154
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,980
How do I look? Am I handsome?

155
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,160
No.

156
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
You're going to have a meal with me.

157
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,160
What are you wearing?

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
This is the trend for next year.

159
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
What do you know?

160
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
Trend for next year.

161
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,950
Be quieter.

162
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,070
Okay.

163
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,660
Have a look at the menu.

164
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,900
Thank you.

165
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,860
I'm declaring first.

166
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm treating for this meal.

167
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,290
Thank you for willing to reconcile with me.

168
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,690
It's necessary.

169
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,930
You waited at the airport

170
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,850
throughout the night.

171
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,050
And helped me out so much.

172
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,850
So I'm treating for this meal.

173
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,130
But-

174
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,410
Stop fighting with me.

175
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,250
Okay.

176
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,210
Since you're so persistent,

177
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,450
you'll be treating for this meal.

178
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,370
I'll definitely treat the next meal.

179
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,570
We just sat down,

180
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,250
you're already arranging for

181
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,320
for a next meal.

182
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,960
You

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
can't be serious for more than three seconds.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Hurry.

185
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,520
What do you want to eat?

186
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Slow down.

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,070
Where is it?

188
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:35,950
Is it here?

189
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,750
It's here.

190
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,150
This is Kong Ge's car.

191
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,390
Why are you looking for him?

192
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,270
He's not here too.

193
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,660
He's not here.

194
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,820
Come down.

195
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,540
What if we get discovered?

196
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,460
It's okay.

197
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,020
Then you-

198
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
Exactly why are you looking for him?

199
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,100
We have to find him first.

200
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Am I right?

201
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,460
Where is he?

202
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Sorry.

203
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,420
Let's go there.

204
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,860
Oh my, they're really there.

205
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,130
Sorry.

206
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,730
They're sitting in an isolated corner.

207
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,730
They're definitely not up to anything good.

208
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,410
This Ji Xiang Kong,

209
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,930
better act more honestly.

210
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,490
Can I ask something?

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,640
What did we come here to do today?

212
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you done?

213
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
It's so obvious can't you tell.

214
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,700
You're following them?

215
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,620
I still thought that

216
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,860
you were asking me out for a meal.

217
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,180
What did you say?

218
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,420
Nothing.

219
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,060
I have to go in.

220
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,140
I have to hear what they're talking.

221
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,620
People are dating.

222
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,140
It's immoral for us

223
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
to eavesdrop on them.

224
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,700
Date!

225
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,500
You also think it's a date.

226
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,580
How dangerous is a date?

227
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,580
I can't not supervise them.

228
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,580
What has it got to do with you?

229
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,140
Are you going or not?

230
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,900
Going.

231
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,980
Did we order too much?

232
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Actually, usually at this time,

233
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,970
I don't eat.

234
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,530
I'm on a diet.

235
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,170
You're already so thin, and you're

236
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,170
still dieting?

237
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,490
At least eat a little.

238
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,290
Then I'll help myself.

239
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,230
Let's barbecue this first.

240
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,150
Let me do it.

241
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,590
Let's sit there.

242
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,790
Okay.

243
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,430
One, two, three, let's go.

244
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,470
One, two, three.

245
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,350
What are you two doing?

246
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,070
Tying our laces.

247
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,950
Sorry.

248
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,280
What are you two doing?

249
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,150
Gastric.

250
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,830
Look at what you'd like.

251
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,230
Just give us-

252
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
We'll just

253
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,780
get any barbecue meat.

254
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,100
Anything's fine.

255
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,060
No.

256
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,900
We don't want barbecue meat.

257
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,850
That- we have to drink some hot drinks for gastric.

258
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,370
Just serve us some porridge.

259
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,490
Those that are free flow.

260
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,250
Why are you so stingy?

261
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,610
I ate before coming here.

262
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,730
But I didn't.

263
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,450
Let's talk later.

264
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,570
Oh right, do you want to order some drinks?

265
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,050
Or beer is fine too.

266
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,370
Let's not drink beer.

267
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,640
No problem, if you're drunk,

268
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,640
then you can tell me your house's address.

269
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
I'll send you home!

270
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,200
Besides,

271
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
we are in a 'no discord, no concord' relationship.

272
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,510
I'll apologise to you first.

273
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,070
For spoiling your mom's necklace.

274
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,710
How do you know that's my mom's necklace?

275
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,950
That night when you were drunk,

276
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,950
you treated me like I was your mom.

277
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,580
Sorry.

278
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,220
I didn't expect that necklace

279
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,660
to be so important to you.

280
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,100
I misunderstood you.

281
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,180
and for the 2V2 battle, reality show

282
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,500
the things I said to you

283
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,420
were too overboard.

284
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,740
I apologise to you.

285
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,610
I almost don't recognise you when you're like this.

286
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,130
The necklace is fixed.

287
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,250
Actually,

288
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,240
I ought to apologise to you too.

289
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
method to get on your car.

290
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
I shouldn't have used that

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,440
and selfishly played the 2V2 battle with you.

292
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,080
It was right that you educated me.

293
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,540
Then, from what you say,

294
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,140
we are even now.

295
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,540
Cheers.

296
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,540
Cheers.

297
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
That's not right.

298
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,420
Why do I feel like

299
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,260
the plot deviated a little.

300
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,380
Isn't this good?

301
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,620
You still want them both to fight?

302
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,900
We didn't order this.

303
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,530
This is what you ordered.

304
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,410
No worries.

305
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,970
Leave it here.

306
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,410
To express my gratitude,

307
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,230
this is for you.

308
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,150
How can I let the girl do the cooking?

309
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,790
I should be serving you.

310
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,510
Come.

311
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,510
I'll wrap one for you.

312
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,310
Here.

313
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,460
What's wrong? Is it not easy to take?

314
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,260
Or do you want me to feed you?

315
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,930
No need.

316
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,200
Right.

317
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,560
I almost forgot.

318
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
This is a gift for you.

319
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,960
You don't have to be too thankful towards me.

320
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,280
What is it?

321
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,030
Although your video

322
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,940
and had many errors,

323
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,940
was badly produced, excessively made,

324
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,100
but for a newbie like you,

325
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180
it's already good enough.

326
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,740
and had many errors.

327
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,740
Badly produced, excessively made,

328
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,610
You are the anonymous netizen?

329
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,570
You can't deny.

330
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,490
I dare to confirm that it's you.

331
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,050
As for the hitting video,

332
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,930
it's already cleared.

333
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,250
with UXStar videos.

334
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,250
I will invite the team to communicate

335
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,810
So as to allow you to continue working.

336
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,570
Fulfill your mom's wish well

337
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,370
and become an excellent host.

338
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,200
Thank you.

339
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,720
I don't really want to go back anymore.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,200
If I stay at UXStar,

341
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,960
Conquer host.

342
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,960
there's nothing else I can do besides be a

343
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,590
Actually, it's not possible to learn

344
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,590
anything professional.

345
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,710
I'm only nice to look at.

346
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,470
The moment I sold my house,

347
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,700
I thought it through.

348
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,100
No matter what I do,

349
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,220
I will have to succeed.

350
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,540
The best is to become so professional

351
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,100
that others can't pinpoint.

352
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,460
Then, did you ever thought of

353
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,540
doing professional gaming commentary?

354
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,740
Professional gaming commentary.

355
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,940
Because a lot of people are

356
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,060
following up with esports now.

357
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,500
There are also many players that are pretty good.

358
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,290
But there are very little commentators

359
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,370
that can comment well,

360
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,810
understand the team's tactics and

361
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,690
and the players.

362
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,130
Especially female commentators.

363
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,730
Majority of them are

364
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,050
just pretty to look at.

365
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,320
Or are female-

366
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,880
No,

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,320
I don't mean it that way.

368
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,080
I wanted to say.

369
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
If you're willing to work hard,

370
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,880
I trust that you'll have a good future.

371
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,790
I- can I really?

372
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,940
Why not?

373
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,580
People like me who have unskilled hands

374
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,260
are still able to get into the Vancouver finals.

375
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,420
You definitely can do it.

376
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm really stuffed.

377
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,220
I really don't know why

378
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,140
I called you here.

379
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,020
You only know how to eat.

380
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,380
If we don't eat it, it would be very wasted.

381
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,980
Now that we're full, how was it?

382
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,100
Pretty good.

383
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,500
Waiter, we're paying.

384
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,780
Coming.

385
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,330
Hello,

386
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,210
the total will be RMB 460.

387
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,170
RMB 460?

388
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,930
Okay, thank you.

389
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,450
Settle the bills for both sides.

390
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,110
He's paying.

391
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,630
Kong ge, what a coincidence.

392
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,510
Kong ge what a coincidence.

393
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,870
Qiu Ying, you are here too.

394
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,750
Stop being enigmatic and

395
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,590
suspicious with me.

396
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,470
Yi Yi.

397
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,710
What are you doing here?

398
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,750
Reporter Lu,

399
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,190
I'm returning Qiu Ying to you

400
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,310
in one piece without any flaws.

401
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

402
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,790
Qiu Ying, it's so late.

403
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,030
You're still fooling around outside.

404
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:15,910
Follow me home.

405
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,670
I'll wait for you outside.

406
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,580
Then, I'll go back first too.

407
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,100
Thank you for dinner and the notebook.

408
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
- Bye bye.

409
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Bye bye.

410
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Okay, I'm going too.

411
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,160
Go and pay the bill.

412
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
Kong ge, you...

413
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
asking me to pay?

414
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You're chasing women and

415
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
This isn't appropriate.

416
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Kong ge, you're really leaving? Kong ge.

417
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
No, don't leave, I didn't bring-

418
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,040
Kong ge, Kong- I-

419
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,320
- Sir.

420
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,320
Kong- Kong-

421
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm not leaving, I'm just looking.

422
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
You haven't paid.

423
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,600
No, he-

424
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,040
Please pay. Come.

425
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,600
Let me check the receipt for you.

426
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,880
Okay, speak.

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,070
This is that table's bill, RMB 460.

428
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,310
This is your table's, RMB 600.

429
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,830
Mine is RMB 600?

430
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,830
No worries, that-

431
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,100
Sir.

432
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
No, I-

433
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,620
Bro, no.

434
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,260
Don't go.

435
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,300
Do you know the Legends team?

436
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,420
No I don't.

437
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,260
Do you play games?

438
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,380
No I don't.

439
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,690
I am Lin Yi Xuan.

440
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,370
Can I get a discount?

441
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,610
Who?

442
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,610
I- I'm Lin Yi Xuan.

443
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,450
I don't know you.

444
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,930
Let me tell you.

445
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,450
The meal earlier.

446
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,570
Even if you guys have reconciled,

447
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,130
for your own

448
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,930
blissfulness,

449
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,930
In future, block him on wechat,

450
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,530
block his number, don't even think about seeing him.

451
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,770
Do you understand?

452
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm talking to you.

453
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Do you hear me?

454
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,480
You're ignoring me again.

455
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,830
Yi Yi, I've decided.

456
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,950
I want to become a

457
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,190
professional commentator.

458
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,710
are you having a fever?

459
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,710
You're doing this again,

460
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,190
I'm being serious.

461
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,070
I've decided.

462
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,100
I've decided to become

463
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,660
a person like Luo Tian.

464
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,460
What are you saying so late at night?

465
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,780
I know.

466
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,860
Is it because Ji Xiang Kong

467
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,300
convinced you to do commentary?

468
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,700
The first time I

469
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,580
saw Luo Tian,

470
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,820
I already had this thought.

471
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,700
From today onwards, I want to

472
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,980
move towards my dreams.

473
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,820
I'm stopping you.

474
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,460
Don't talk to me about dreams.

475
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,490
About dreams,

476
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,010
I know more about them than you.

477
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,410
Then let me ask you.

478
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,170
Are you satisfied with the present?

479
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,290
I have to be.

480
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm living so comfortably now.

481
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,080
I don't think about so many things like you.

482
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,720
If you're really satisfied with the present,

483
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,560
you wouldn't

484
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,080
have acted like that at the press conference.

485
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,140
How did I act?

486
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,300
You said because of my dreams, I

487
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,740
have to seek for the truth.

488
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,740
Oh my god, I have to stop you.

489
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,620
I didn't act that way.

490
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,500
Stop pretending in front of me.

491
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,500
Listen to me.

492
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,580
You said you could.

493
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,860
And you definitely can.

494
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,100
Stop saying those things like

495
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,220
"my dreams died on the way."

496
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,900
Okay.

497
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm scared of you now is that okay?

498
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,500
Stop telling me motivating things.

499
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,700
Let's go home.

500
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,340
Are you shy?

501
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,420
When am I shy?

502
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,780
Enough.

503
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,540
I especially hate when others

504
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,700
tell me motivational things.

505
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,890
Move quicker, yes.

506
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,410
I asked you to carry this away long ago, hurry.

507
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,970
Director.

508
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,770
Worrying me to death.

509
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:05,970
Director.

510
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,130
What's the occasion today?

511
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,250
Why's everyone so busy?

512
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,250
Lu Yi Yi.

513
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,110
You finally came.

514
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,070
Look at this.

515
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,430
[Dynamic esports magazine reporter persistantly asks for the truth for justice.]

516
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,790
Isn't this me?

517
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,910
Why am I on there?

518
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,670
You're going to be on hot trends soon.

519
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,750
I'm going on hot trends?

520
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,830
Oh gosh, isn't it good Director?

521
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,110
Good?

522
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,350
Is that not good?

523
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,710
Come.

524
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,580
Then, look at this too.

525
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,540
This is what

526
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,780
the Legends fans

527
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,060
specially sent for you.

528
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,020
In order to praise you.

529
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Praise me?

530
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,320
So, Director, look,

531
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,720
such a good thing.

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
Right? But why do I feel like

533
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,760
you're a little

534
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,480
unhappy?

535
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,560
Yi Yi.

536
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
You really can't tell

537
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,160
whether I'm praising or

538
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
insulting you?

539
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,040
Do you know?

540
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm definitely

541
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
it's the biggest challenge

542
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,390
for our company ever since I've started working here,

543
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,030
Throughout the morning, I've received

544
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,230
four to five calls from the leader.

545
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,110
He wants to come down in the afternoon

546
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,630
for a check and ask some questions.

547
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,100
My days of tasting tea and reading books

548
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,740
won't be back forever.

549
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,620
Sorry Director.

550
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,930
What's the use of apologising?

551
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,610
We are merely a

552
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,170
small magazine company under the organisation.

553
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,410
Why do you have to make such bold moves?

554
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,890
What's the use of the leader coming?

555
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,250
No matter how many times the leader comes,

556
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,610
they're unable to increase our budget.

557
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,210
We still can't go out for interviews.

558
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,210
Look, now GDV

559
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,250
wants us to go out in the afternoon

560
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,370
for an interview at special event.

561
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,560
We struggled and worked hard for many years.

562
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
Who went out for an interview before?

563
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,640
Director.

564
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Me. I can go and try.

565
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,390
But doesn't it still have to be you?

566
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,510
Whoever started the blunder

567
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,710
has to be responsible.

568
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,510
Go.

569
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,230
I'll go now.

570
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,110
Quickly go. Take away those flowers.

571
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Right, Director. Where's the venue?

572
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,700
Where could it be?

573
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,100
GDV office.

574
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,180
Then I'll go now.

575
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
Go quickly.

576
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,180
Bye Director.

577
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,140
Quickly go.

578
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,300
What has happened to the world?

579
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,570
I did the work and still need to suffer criticism.

580
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,520
Hello Lu Yi Yi.

581
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,340
I'm at GDV.

582
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
This place is too big.

583
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,100
Every level is GDV.

584
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Where are you?

585
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Just walk in.

586
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,740
The interview is

587
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,500
going to start soon.

588
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,260
If you don't deliver it to me now,

589
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,180
I'm doomed.

590
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
I know.

591
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,340
You have to tell me which

592
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
which level you're at.

593
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,180
You left without bringing your things.

594
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,060
Luckily I was home.

595
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,620
I'm at the seventh floor.

596
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,540
Hello?

597
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
Hello?

598
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,450
Can't be.

599
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,090
It ran out of battery at an important moment.

600
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,550
Hello, do you need help?

601
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,270
It's fine.

602
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,150
I already found her, thanks.

603
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,150
Okay.

604
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,870
My phone ran out of battery at an important time.

605
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,950
Can Qiu Ying find me?

606
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,630
- Yi Yi.

607
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,630
Qiu Ying.

608
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,430
You're finally here.

609
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,430
- Here.

610
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,430
Where's the documents?

611
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,670
I really love you.

612
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,910
My phone ran out of battery.

613
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,190
I was so nervous.

614
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,780
You're a professional reporter

615
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,460
and you didn't even bring your materials out.

616
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,260
I got here on short notice okay.

617
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,980
These documents

618
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,980
are my summaries after studying.

619
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,740
Then when I go for interview,

620
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
I have to be at least a little prepared.

621
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,260
Hurry.

622
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,920
Qiu Ying, the interview is going to start soon.

623
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,640
Let's talk later.

624
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,560
Sit here and drink some water, wait for me.

625
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Love you, mua, bye bye.

626
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,140
Commentary table.

627
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,550
Hello everyone.

628
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,790
I am commentator Qiu Ying.

629
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,550
Today, what I'm sharing with everyone is

630
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,910
the first round of the Spring competition's

631
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,380
conventional competition.

632
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,380
VNG versus Legends.

633
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Let us have a look at the screen.

634
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,100
This really is

635
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
an exciting competition.

636
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,220
Oh gosh.

637
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,340
Both teams are both shooters.

638
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,690
Are they trying to output later?

639
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,770
Luo Tian, what do you think?

640
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,490
Do interns do as they please

641
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,690
when they practice?

642
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,760
Or do you think the commentary script

643
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,360
are simple words that just flows out your mouth?

644
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Sorry.

645
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm not an intern.

646
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,540
I went to the wrong place.

647
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,260
So sorry.

648
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,780
Qiu Ying, oh my god.

649
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,260
You're done with reporting? How was it?

650
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,180
So tiring.

651
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,580
Thankfully, you sent the materials to me on time.

652
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,580
Or else, I'd be unprepared.

653
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,610
I don't even know how I would 'die'.

654
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,170
Why are you

655
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,490
looking so love sick?

656
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,950
Yi Yi.

657
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,190
Wasn't I researching on

658
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,230
how to be a commentator lately?

659
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,590
I met a big opportunity.

660
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,590
Do you know GDV

661
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,470
are conducting a competition called

662
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,070
'Tomorrow's star'.

663
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,910
The champion will be partnering with Luo Tian.

664
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,990
You still get to host Conquer together.

665
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,070
Luo Tian, forget it.

666
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,270
Luo Tian is the top in making snarky comments.

667
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,590
If you partner with him,

668
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,870
he'll argue with you all the way.

669
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,950
He's someone so excellent.

670
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,630
It's normal for him to be a little more strict.

671
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,510
Besides, I've already registered.

672
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,940
Sister, you entering the competition

673
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,700
with your current standard.

674
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,540
You'll only be his denominator.

675
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,300
Anyway,

676
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm not going back to UXStar anymore.

677
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,520
But I don't want to leave the industry.

678
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,760
I don't want to miss out on

679
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
such a good opportunity.

680
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,000
I can't miss out on it.

681
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,360
Later, you drink this quickly.

682
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Then follow me to the bookstore.

683
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
And buy some related books.

684
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
So that I can study.

685
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,280
Not going.

686
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,360
I have no more energy. I'm so tired.

687
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,040
Yi Yi.

688
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,440
I know a software that has everything.

689
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,390
Even things about gaming.

690
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,270
Let me search it for you.

691
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,790
Gaming.

692
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,630
Okay. Choose.

693
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,110
So cheap!

694
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,180
The cost of a new book is good enough for you to buy two of three here.

695
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,820
That's of course.

696
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,580
It's a second hand site.

697
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,420
Am I good?

698
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Is it authentic?

699
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,820
Of course, choose quickly.

700
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,890
This, this and this.

701
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,370
It's so cheap, I want everything.

702
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,530
Then I'll order now.

703
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,370
I estimate that it'll reach tomorrow.

704
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,370
Done, nice.

705
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,850
My knowledge and understanding

706
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,970
finally has some landing.

707
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,570
But how am I able to quickly raise

708
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,130
my experience with commentating.

709
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,330
Yi Yi, quick, help me think.

710
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,160
How would I know?

711
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,920
I know that in the industry,

712
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,800
there's an internet cafe

713
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,040
that has scheduled competition livestreams

714
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,040
and competition analysis.

715
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Especially suitable for people like you

716
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,630
who are seeking help last minute.

717
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,750
Really? Then let's go.

718
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,870
Let's hurry and go.

719
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,150
Here.

720
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,460
How's it? Not ordinary right?

721
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,460
There are so many people over there.

722
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,340
Follow me.

723
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,900
Wait a minute.

724
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,860
Let me tell you.

725
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,180
There wouldn't be little people in the industry

726
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,020
in this kind of places.

727
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
We have to change our accent.

728
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,420
But remember.

729
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,010
Talk less, listen more.

730
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,130
Do I need you to teach me this?

731
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,610
Let's go.

732
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,090
You walked to the wrong place.

733
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Here, sister.

734
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,220
So cool.

735
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,940
There are Conquer's elements all over.

736
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Didn't you come here previously?

737
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,820
I came here before.

738
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,820
When I came here previously, it didn't look like this.

739
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,060
Okay.

740
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,820
Look at that skinny guy,

741
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,940
I know him.

742
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,620
Nickname: Fat cat.

743
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,500
Was first in the previous server.

744
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,860
But, now his first place

745
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,660
got defeated by someone called skinny monkey.

746
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,300
Skinny monkey

747
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,260
What do you want to drink?

748
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,210
My gosh. He's also here.

749
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,610
How come you don't even

750
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,610
know what I like to drink?

751
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,330
I want a 'scream'.

752
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,570
What colour?

753
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,750
Blue, hurry.

754
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,670
What time is it now?

755
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,510
The competition over there is almost starting.

756
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,430
Aren't they rivals?

757
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,910
Why are they acting like friends?

758
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,310
How do you know everything?

759
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,430
That's a must.

760
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,590
But these two,

761
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,190
the skinny one is called Fat cat,

762
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,750
the chubby one is called Skinny monkey.

763
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,630
They're a match made in heaven.

764
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,670
What are they looking at?

765
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,310
Come, let's go see.

766
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,310
Let's go.

767
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,830
I'm sorry.

768
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,500
Let us through.

769
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,460
Thank you.

770
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,380
Go.

771
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,460
This girl is so cool.

772
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,200
What are you doing?

773
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,160
Go, attack.

774
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
Top route's army line.

775
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,680
Use your skills.

776
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,880
Quickly go back, they're pushing your crystal.

777
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,760
Nice.

778
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,590
Excellent.

779
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,070
Consider yourself excellent.

780
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,860
Are you okay?

781
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,060
First time I met a girl

782
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,540
that incredible.

783
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,180
She's too good at this.

784
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,180
Jie jie,

785
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,450
are you in the current server rankings?

786
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,490
Then you fit in the hiring notice here.

787
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,490
Yes.

788
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,690
I don't serve others tea or pour water for them.

789
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,290
Move away.

790
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,650
Okay.

791
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,170
Cool.

792
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,600
She's a little cold.

793
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,360
Cold.

794
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
Hello, I know you guys.

795
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,240
You know us?

796
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,600
Fans.

797
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
Yes.

798
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,030
were talking about?

799
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,030
What was the hiring that you guys

800
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,830
Dream Journey's hiring.

801
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,430
It's over there.

802
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,310
[Hiring waitresses]

803
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,900
[1. If you're not a girl we don't want you.

804
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,900
2. If you don't like professional gaming, we don't want you.

805
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,900
3. If you're not the first in the server, we don't want you.

806
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,780
Oh my god.

807
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,740
You have to be first in server,

808
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,780
just to even be a waitress.

809
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,500
Really frenzied.

810
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,620
This can only prove that

811
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,380
their standard is high.

812
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,340
Maybe the ones delivering tea and water,

813
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,500
are all masters.

814
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,820
Qiu Ying, look.

815
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,290
Pei Xi.

816
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,410
This cold facade?

817
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,520
The last time you played 2V2,

818
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,760
he and Qiao Xin were trying to kill you.

819
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,840
What kind of person is he?

820
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Forget it, it's already in the past.

821
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,360
But what's he doing here?

822
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,540
And he's wearing the waiter outfit.

823
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,780
Right.

824
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,180
I remember.

825
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,500
The boss here is his cousin, Summer.

826
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
Then that's why.

827
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,020
A top player working as a waiter here,

828
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,580
what are they planning?

829
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,940
Forget it, let's not bother about him.

830
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,460
Come, play two rounds with me.

831
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Let's go.

832
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,820
Chairman Jin, you were looking for me?

833
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,050
Xiang Kong.

834
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,130
Come, come quickly.

835
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,610
Sit.

836
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,530
Today, I called you and Manager Zhao over

837
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,830
not for something big.

838
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,950
Previously, during the press conference,

839
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,790
there seems to be a misunderstanding between you two.

840
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,710
I apologise to you on behalf of the company.

841
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,470
At the same time, I also hope you can understand

842
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,790
after the video had went out,

843
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,790
everyone in the team is jittery.

844
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,230
At a moment in time, the company

845
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,390
made a special decision.

846
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,870
We were forced to.

847
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,790
It's okay, Chairman Jin.

848
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,230
It's over now.

849
00:35:59,470 --> 00:35:59,870
Manager Zhao.

850
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,230
Just give me an appropriate apology and that's okay.

851
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,070
Of course,

852
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,310
Manager Zhao wants to sincerely apologise to you.

853
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,780
Sorry, it's all my fault.

854
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,380
Sorry.

855
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,520
I've worn the earpiece for too long

856
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,960
I didn't hear clearly, what was it?

857
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,960
Sorry, it's all my fault.

858
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,280
You're too polite, it's okay.

859
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,590
Actually, everything that Manager Zhao

860
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,830
is for the good of the team.

861
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,790
We understand very well.

862
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,990
Completely understand.

863
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,350
Everyone is part of the 'family',

864
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,620
don't take it personally.

865
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,580
The most mission currently

866
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,420
- Yes.

867
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,420
is the internal trial competition.

868
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,380
Don't worry.

869
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,980
I won't let you guys down.

870
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,140
Since it's this way,

871
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,490
We will just wait for

872
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,250
our Ji handsome to make a glorious return.

873
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,970
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

874
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,210
Manager Zhao,

875
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,370
since we are a 'family',

876
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,730
shake hands with Xiang Kong.

877
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,530
Treat it as this is over,

878
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,110
President Zhao, have some tea.

879
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,190
Not drinking.

880
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,910
No, don't be angry.

881
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,350
He's just lucky this time.

882
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,390
Made me apologise.

883
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,060
Was it done cleanly?

884
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,860
Relax, it was done cleanly.

885
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,260
They won't be able to trace it down to us.

886
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,060
Ji Xiang Kong.

887
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,580
You're playing with me. I'll play you to 'death'.
