1
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:41,870
Big reporter Lu

2
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:45,357
What are you doing?

3
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:47,386
Thank you for that

4
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,117
I don't need your thanks

5
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,723
I can't take your thanks

6
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,412
I just beg you 

7
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:54,046
to stop messing Ying Qiu

8
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:55,954
She stayed at the airport all night 

9
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,213
to help you find this video

10
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:58,544
and almost had an accident, you know?

11
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,304
What's the matter?

12
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:00,915
Where is she now?

13
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,262
She's all right now

14
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:03,468
I'm telling you,

15
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,149
don't try to get at her again

16
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:07,079
That's not true

17
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,537
Brother Kong is also sincere

18
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:09,906
You can't say that

19
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,118
As long as he stops hurting Ying Qiu

20
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,850
This is the most sincere thanks

21
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:17,902
Is that what she means 

22
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:18,722
or what you mean

23
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,964
What's the difference?

24
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,192
I mean what she means

25
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:23,457
Ying Qiu is heartless

26
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:24,677
simple and kind

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,524
I'm telling you

28
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,822
don't approach her again

29
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,856
or I'll never let you off the hook

30
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:30,793
And you

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,560
What's this got to do with me?

32
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,901
Did you just leave?

33
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,875
You walk slowly

34
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:38,618
Remember to give me send WeChat messages

35
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:44,833
You two have a situation

36
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:47,076
That's interesting

37
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,777
It's not interesting

38
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:51,745
I...

39
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:53,632
Is it that obvious?

40
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,084
You know it

41
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:57,989
Are you leaving?

42
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm really tired today

43
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:09,552
OK

44
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:11,895
You're not doing anything today

45
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:12,720
Get to bed early

46
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,579
You didn't sleep well yesterday

47
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,148
It doesn't matter

48
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:21,041
I slept on a chair in the airport 

49
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:24,984
and I had a pain in my waist

50
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,509
Nonsense! the airport chair is so tight

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,928
you must be back pain

52
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,651
I saw so many people 

53
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,538
apologize to Xiangkong Ji online

54
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,104
I feel my hard work

55
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,787
 is not in vain

56
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,097
I don't understand

57
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,825
His grievances were discharged

58
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,309
but what's that got to do with you?

59
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,438
Worry about him all day

60
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:53,778
No, I'll go to the bathroom first

61
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,565
I have a pain in my stomach

62
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:55,313
You go to bed early

63
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:55,956
Go! Go!

64
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:56,990
Where's my phone

65
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,024
It's there

66
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:58,849
You go to bed early

67
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,877
Would you like to have dinner with me?

68
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:17,536
You're welcome. I'll treat you

69
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:21,979
The First Barbecue

70
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:24,372
This barbecue restaurant tastes good.

71
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,825
Be there or be square

72
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:05,683
Yiyi

73
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,038
I'm suddenly so sleepy

74
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,528
I'm going to bed

75
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,568
Don't bother me for a while

76
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,229
Good night 

77
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:42,897
Is she really asleep?

78
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,328
What are you doing?

79
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,508
What are you doing on the sly?

80
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:04,477
Didn't you say you were going to bed?

81
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:08,085
I'm suddenly a little hungry

82
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,488
I'm going to buy instant noodles

83
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:13,171
We still have plenty

84
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:13,908
We don't need to buy any

85
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,349
Our house

86
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,626
I'd like some noodles with seafood flavor

87
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:23,851
Are you going to buy instant noodles?

88
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,265
What's that in your hand? 

89
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:25,925
Hand it over to me

90
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:31,897
Buy instant noodles?

91
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:33,657
Are you going out dressed like this 

92
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:34,674
to buy instant noodles?

93
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:35,636
Who are you kidding?

94
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,167
Is someone asking you out?

95
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:43,308
That person unexpectedly still Xiangkong Ji?

96
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:47,625
NO

97
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,596
This guy is so persistent

98
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:54,582
It was only this afternoon that

99
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,682
I helped you reject him unequivocally

100
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,046
He even had the nerve to ask you out

101
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,013
Yiyi

102
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,466
Is it all right to have a meal?

103
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,374
He's asking you out to dinner at this late hour

104
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:04,585
Then why doesn't he make an appointment

105
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,366
 tomorrow morning or tomorrow noon?

106
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:08,259
He must be up to no good in the middle of the night

107
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,271
you think too much

108
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,129
We just had a meal

109
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:16,937
You, you tell me honestly

110
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:17,883
You kind of like him

111
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,895
don't you?

112
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,304
Are you kidding?

113
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,701
We're just friends

114
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:24,850
 No way

115
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:27,023
I swear 

116
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:29,574
we just had a meal

117
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:35,629
OK

118
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:42,718
What are you doing?

119
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,330
I'll let you change

120
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,752
Come on,you change this dress

121
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,550
and put on the pants

122
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,633
wear this dress in my hand

123
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,191
I'd better cover it from head to toe

124
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:56,494
You mustn't wear anything so revealing

125
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:58,053
OK

126
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:13,443
Hello

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,467
Hello,Yixuan Lin

128
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:16,957
What's the matter?

129
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,090
Let me ask you something

130
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:20,103
Is Xiangkong Ji going out?

131
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,084
Why do you know?

132
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,279
Where is he going?

133
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:29,699
A kebab shops we used to go to

134
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:31,272
Barbecue shop?

135
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:34,847
Let's do this

136
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:36,931
You can send me the address later

137
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:38,097
You can wait for me there

138
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,022
Are you inviting me to dinner?

139
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,270
NO

140
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,826
Hurry up.I'm hanging up

141
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,064
OK,OK,OK

142
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,875
How's that?   Am I handsome?

143
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,823
No,you aren't. you scared me

144
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:24,999
NO

145
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:26,282
What are you wearing 

146
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,114
when you come out to dinner with me?

147
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,606
This, this is the trend for next year

148
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:33,036
You don't understand

149
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,969
Next year's trend

150
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,792
Be quiet

151
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:44,837
OK

152
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,482
Would you like something to eat?

153
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:53,708
Thank you

154
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:57,689
Let's start with an agreement that 

155
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:58,778
this meal is on me

156
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:00,934
Thank you for coming with me

157
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,344
Reconciliation is the right thing to do

158
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,503
You did me such a big favor 

159
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:05,779
by waiting in the airport all night

160
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,544
so this meal is on me

161
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:08,848
But...

162
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:09,997
Don't argue with me for the bill

163
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:11,966
All right

164
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,863
Well, if you're so insistent

165
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:14,936
this meal is on you

166
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,069
The next meal is on me

167
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,412
As soon as we sit down

168
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:20,891
you make an appointment for another meal

169
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,625
You are not at all serious

170
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,110
Please hurry upand order

171
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:27,117
You can order whatever you like

172
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:29,888
 Walk slowly

173
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,675
Where are they?

174
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,406
Is this it?

175
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,215
That's it. That's it

176
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:33,523
This is brother Kong's car

177
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:37,928
What do you want with him?

178
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:38,858
He's not here, either

179
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,069
There's nobody here

180
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:42,295
You come down quickly

181
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:42,977
What if they find out?

182
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:43,906
OK

183
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:44,385
You...  

184
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,474
What the hell do you want with him?

185
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,595
We need to find him first

186
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,074
don't we?

187
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,860
Where is he?

188
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:49,890
Excuse me. Excuse me

189
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:50,792
Let's go over there

190
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,119
Here they are

191
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,449
Excuse me. Excuse me

192
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:04,919
You can't be doing anything serious sitting 

193
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:05,999
in the middle of nowhere

194
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,708
Xiangkong Ji 

195
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,203
had better be honest

196
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,706
Can I ask you something?

197
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,944
What are we doing here today?

198
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,363
Are you stupid?

199
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:16,666
It's so obvious.Can't you see it?

200
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:20,738
Are you following them?

201
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:21,863
I thought 

202
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:22,952
you were offering me dinner

203
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,497
What did you say?

204
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:26,598
I didn't say something

205
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,248
I have to go inside 

206
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,073
I have to hear 

207
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,155
what they're saying

208
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,643
They're dating 

209
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:35,232
and we're eavesdropping

210
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,035
It's so immoral

211
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,784
On a date, on a date,on a date

212
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:38,614
You said it was a date

213
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:39,659
What a dangerous date it was

214
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,627
I had to watch them

215
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:41,595
What's that got to do with you?

216
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,205
Are you going?

217
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:42,849
Yes,I am

218
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:46,896
Are we ordering too much?

219
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,921
Actually

220
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:50,977
I don't usually eat at this time

221
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:52,506
I'm on a diet

222
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,364
Do you need to lose weight 

223
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:54,865
when you're so thin?

224
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:56,454
You can at least eat some

225
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,296
Then I'm welcome!

226
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,147
Let's bake this first

227
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:04,929
Let me do it. Let me do it

228
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,460
Let's sit at that table

229
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,549
OK

230
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,177
 1,2,3, let's go

231
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,148
1,2,3

232
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:18,133
What are you doing?

233
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,860
We're tying our shoes,tying our shoes

234
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:22,593
I'm sorry

235
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:57,717
What are you doing?

236
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,522
I've got a pain in my stomach...

237
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,210
What would you like to eat?

238
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,625
Please help us to a dish

239
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,808
We'll just, we'll just 

240
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,062
order some barbecue

241
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:15,464
Anything, anything

242
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:16,443
No, no

243
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:17,262
No,we don't want barbecue

244
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:17,926
What is that?

245
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,061
Drink something hot for my stomachache

246
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,711
Just bring us some porridge 

247
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,591
with unlimited refills

248
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,508
How could you be so petty?

249
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:28,904
I came after dinner

250
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,927
I haven't eaten yet

251
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:31,610
Hold that thought,hold that thought

252
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,936
By the way, would you like something to drink?

253
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,229
Or drink alcohol

254
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,527
I would rather not drink 

255
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,750
It's okay.If you're drunk

256
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:41,718
you give me your address

257
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,796
I'll take you back

258
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:45,331
After all

259
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,030
we are friends now

260
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:50,511
first of all,I apologize for my mistake

261
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,184
Last time I broke your mother's necklace

262
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:54,631
How did you know 

263
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,774
it was my mother's necklace?

264
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,007
The last night you got drunk

265
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,915
you thought I was your mother

266
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,651
I'm sorry

267
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,192
I didn't realize that necklace 

268
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,545
was so important to you. I misunderstood you

269
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:11,090
I misunderstood you

270
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,918
And in the double play, in the reality show

271
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,222
 I went too far with you 

272
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,525
and I apologize

273
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:22,402
I don't even know you anymore

274
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:26,846
The necklace has been repaired

275
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,083
Actually

276
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:30,943
I owe you an apology, too

277
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,385
I should not have 

278
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,386
got into your car in that way 

279
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:36,222
and had a ulterior motive for double qualifying with you

280
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:38,813
you taught me the right thing

281
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,821
So we don't owe each other

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,307
Cheers

283
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,286
Cheers

284
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,854
NO

285
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:49,965
Why do I think 

286
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:52,902
the plot seems a little bit off

287
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,926
That's good

288
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,230
Do you want them to fight?

289
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,411
We didn't order this dishes

290
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,963
This is what you ordered

291
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:12,914
It does not matter,it does not matter

292
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:15,483
You,put it down

293
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,519
This piece of meat is for you 

294
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,692
to show your thanks

295
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,388
It's not polite 

296
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,664
to ask you to help me

297
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,089
I should be at your service

298
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,804
Come on,come on,come on

299
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,876
Let me help you

300
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:39,713
Give you

301
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:56,607
What's the matter? Is it hard to carry?

302
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,444
Do you want me to feed you?

303
00:15:59,384 --> 00:15:59,929
No, no

304
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,121
I remeber something

305
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,728
I almost forgot

306
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:12,858
This is for you.

307
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:13,985
Don't thank me too much

308
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:15,310
What is this?

309
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,075
Although that video you made 

310
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,879
was crudely made and full of mistakes

311
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,991
But for starters

312
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,162
it's pretty good

313
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:37,759
It was churned out with many mistakes

314
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,443
You are the anonymous netizen

315
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,380
Don't deny it.

316
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,371
I'm sure. I'm sure it's you

317
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:48,934
The video of the beating 

318
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,760
has been clarified

319
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:51,859
I will ask the team 

320
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,983
to explain it to YouXing

321
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,576
 so you can go back to work

322
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,440
and fullfill your mother's wish 

323
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,261
to become an excellent host

324
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:00,939
Thank you

325
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,348
 But I don't really want to go back

326
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,928
If I stay at YouXing

327
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,578
I could just be an IConquer host

328
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,196
In fact, I can't learn anything at all

329
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,064
and I look like a vase

330
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,124
At the time I sold my house

331
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:21,589
and I realized that no matter what I do

332
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:22,804
I have to be

333
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,064
 the best and the most professional person

334
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,598
Let everyone agree with me

335
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:29,035
Have you ever thought about 

336
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:31,053
becoming a professional video game commentator?

337
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,127
Professional esports commentary?

338
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,365
Because a lot of people 

339
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,509
are paying attention to e-sports now

340
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,021
and there are a lot of good players

341
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,918
but there are very few good commentators

342
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:40,639
who can really explain a game

343
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:41,783
understand the tactics

344
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:44,010
understand the players

345
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,484
 especially female commentators

346
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,465
Most of them are like vases

347
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:50,631
 or female...

348
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,237
No

349
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,711
 I don't mean you

350
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,365
 I mean

351
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,883
if you work hard

352
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,236
 I'm optimistic about your future

353
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:59,903
Can I really succeed?

354
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,278
Why not? 

355
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:02,889
Someone like me 

356
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:04,589
could go to the finals in vancouver

357
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,760
You can make it,too

358
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:10,798
I'm so full

359
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:13,437
I don't know 

360
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,400
what are you here for?

361
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,148
All you know is to eat

362
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,579
If you don't eat it,isn't it all wasted?

363
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm full.How do you like the taste?

364
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:24,310
It's good

365
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,681
Waiter, I'd like to pay the bill

366
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:28,885
OK

367
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,321
Hello

368
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,372
That'll be 460 yuan

369
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,191
460 yuan?

370
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:34,005
Well, thank you

371
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:35,512
The two tables will be charged together

372
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,145
He'll pay

373
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,602
Brother Kong,brother Kong, what a coincidence

374
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:45,488
Brother Kong, what a coincidence

375
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:46,912
Ying Qiu, there you are

376
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,512
Don't sneak around in front of me

377
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:51,334
Yiyi

378
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,676
What are you doing here?

379
00:18:58,796 --> 00:18:59,720
Big reporter Lu

380
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,062
I have returned Ying Qiu to you 

381
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,195
in one piece

382
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,048
I don't know what you're talking about

383
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:05,643
Ying Qiu, it's so late

384
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:06,902
You're still hanging out

385
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:07,810
 Come home with me

386
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,553
I'll be waiting for you outside

387
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,375
I'm going home first

388
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,773
Thanks for the dinner and the notebook

389
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:17,241
Bye  -Bye

390
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:19,936
Well, I'm leaving too

391
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,778
You go to pay

392
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,592
Brother Kong,you,you,you...

393
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:23,708
You're dating a girl and make me pay

394
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:24,665
 It's not appropriate

395
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:25,864
Are you really leaving, brother Kong? 

396
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,195
No, you don't leave. I didn't take...

397
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:28,713
Brother Kong,brother kong,I...

398
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:29,928
Brother Kong,brother kong....    -Sir

399
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm not leaving. Let me see

400
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,843
You haven't paid the bill yet

401
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:34,256
No, he...  

402
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,609
Please pay the bill. Come here

403
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,253
Let me check the bill for you

404
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:38,513
Say it please

405
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,587
The cost of this table is 460 yuan

406
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,858
The cost of your table is 600 yuan

407
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:45,398
 600 yuan for my dish?

408
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,395
It doesn't matter.What...

409
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:51,546
Sir

410
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:52,949
No, I...

411
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:54,928
NO,brother...

412
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:55,781
Don't go!

413
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:56,936
Do you know Legends?

414
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:57,926
No,I don't 

415
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:58,885
Do you play computer games?

416
00:19:59,135 --> 00:19:59,801
No,I don't

417
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:01,049
I am Yixuan Lin

418
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:01,814
Can you give me a discount?

419
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:03,090
Who are you?

420
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,074
I...I'm Yixuan Lin

421
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:04,800
I don't know

422
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,407
I'm telling you

423
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,892
that meal was a reconciliation

424
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,207
But for your own happiness

425
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:14,248
in the future you block his WeChat

426
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,909
block his mobile phone number,not meet him

427
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,009
Do you understand?

428
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:21,435
I'm talking to you

429
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:22,502
do you hear it?

430
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:27,705
Hey, you're ignoring me again

431
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,098
Yiyi, I decided 

432
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,270
I wanted to be a professional commentator

433
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,845
Do you have a fever again when you say that?

434
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,445
I'm serious

435
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,248
I've made up my mind

436
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:40,293
I decided to be a commentator 

437
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:41,657
like Tian Luo

438
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,555
Why are you so excited late at night?

439
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:47,932
I see

440
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:49,042
Did Xiangkong Ji 

441
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,302
fool you going to the commentator?

442
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:51,858
I had this idea 

443
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,777
the first time I saw Tian Luo

444
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,757
Starting today

445
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,055
I'm going to towards my dream

446
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:57,825
Stop

447
00:20:58,408 --> 00:20:59,453
Don't talk to me about dreams

448
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,477
I know more about dreams 

449
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,000
than you do

450
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,381
Let me ask you a question

451
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:07,113
Are you really satisfied with your current life?

452
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:09,302
Yes,I am

453
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,425
How comfortable I am now! 

454
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm not like you,you think about shit all the time

455
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,589
If you were really comfortable with the current life

456
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:17,557
you wouldn't 

457
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:19,020
do that at a press conference

458
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,966
What 's wrong with me?

459
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,139
You said 

460
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,568
I was looking for the truth for my dreams."

461
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:25,624
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Stop it

462
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,522
I didn't say that

463
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,386
Don't act in front of me

464
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,332
You listen to me

465
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:31,327
You can do it 

466
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,598
if you think you can

467
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,027
You don't say

468
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,930
 my dreams are dead on the road

469
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:36,678
Stop,stop

470
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:37,954
All right,you win

471
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,257
Don't comfort me

472
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:40,401
Let's go home, go home, go home

473
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:40,951
Are you shy?

474
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,056
I'm not shy

475
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:43,519
Please stop

476
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,307
I hate being comforted

477
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:50,421
Hurry up,hurry up.OK

478
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:51,548
I told you to move it out a long time ago

479
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,027
Hurry up

480
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:54,584
Director

481
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:55,327
It really freaked me out

482
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:56,591
Director

483
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:57,746
What day is it today?

484
00:21:58,027 --> 00:21:58,841
Why is everyone so busy?

485
00:21:58,995 --> 00:21:59,831
Yiyi Lu

486
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,635
You're here

487
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,614
Look at this

488
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,296
Isn't that me? 

489
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,374
What is my picture on this?

490
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:13,062
You're on a hot search list

491
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:17,181
Am I on a hot search list?

492
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:20,283
Oh, my god. That's great, director

493
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,444
Is that good?

494
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,585
Isn't that good?

495
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,097
You come here,come here,come here

496
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,946
Look at this

497
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,114
This was sent to you 

498
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,362
by the Legends team fans 

499
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,330
just to praise you

500
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:37,864
To praise me?

501
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,543
Look, director

502
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,941
What a good thing!

503
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,762
 Isn't it? But, but why do I think

504
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,688
 you're a little upset

505
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:51,684
Yiyi

506
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,054
Did you really not recognize that 

507
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:54,296
I was complimenting you 

508
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:55,479
or blaming you?

509
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,200
You know what

510
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:58,146
this is definitely 

511
00:22:58,157 --> 00:22:59,119
the biggest challenge I've had 

512
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:00,390
since I've been at the magazine.

513
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,172
I have received four or five phone calls 

514
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,277
from the leaders this morning

515
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,141
The group leaders

516
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,896
will come to visit us this afternoon

517
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:10,085
These good days of drinking tea and reading books 

518
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,718
will never come back

519
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:18,576
Director, I'm sorry

520
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:21,898
What's the use of being sorry?  

521
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:23,630
We are a small magazine 

522
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,049
under the group

523
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,469
Why do you think you're doing this?

524
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,927
What's the point of leader"s visit? 

525
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,192
Even if the leader comes again and again

526
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:32,435
he can't increase our budget

527
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,096
we still can't go out to interview

528
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:36,103
Now JiGuang video company 

529
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,082
wants us to interview them 

530
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,226
for a special event this afternoon

531
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:40,450
After all those years of work

532
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,207
Has anyone ever been out and interviewed?

533
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,468
Director

534
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,734
I, I can try it

535
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:51,078
You must go 

536
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:52,452
Who caused the trouble 

537
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,415
should bear the responsibility

538
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:55,296
Go ahead,go ahead

539
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm going right now

540
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,822
Go ahead! Go ahead! Take away flowers  

541
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,214
By the way, where is it,director?  

542
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:03,435
Where else could it be?

543
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:04,892
JiGuang video company building

544
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,895
Well, I'll go now

545
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:08,827
Go! Go! 

546
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:09,902
Goodbye,director

547
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,655
Go! Go! Go!

548
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:19,949
What's wrong with the world?

549
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,061
I was criticized for my work

550
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:38,790
H ello

551
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:39,951
Hi, Yiyi Lu

552
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,743
I have arrived at JiGuang video company

553
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:43,162
It is too big

554
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,614
Each floor is JiGuang video company

555
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:45,758
Where are you?

556
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,111
You go inside. You go inside

557
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:48,854
My interview is about to begin

558
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,712
If you don't send it to me

559
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:50,509
I'm screwed

560
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,315
I know, I know

561
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:55,624
No, you have to tell me 

562
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,779
what floor you're on?

563
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,467
You're going out here with nothing

564
00:24:58,643 --> 00:24:59,391
I'm glad I'm here

565
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:00,771
Seventh floor. I'm on the seventh floor

566
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:02,817
Hello?

567
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,218
Hello?

568
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:13,673
Oh no!

569
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,301
The phone died at the critical moment

570
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:24,749
Hello, can I help you?

571
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:26,371
No,thank you

572
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:28,290
I found her. Thank you

573
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,198
Ok

574
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,923
The phone died at the critical moment

575
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:38,734
Can Ying Qiu find it?

576
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,496
Ying Qiu   -Yiyi

577
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:44,326
Here you are at last

578
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,410
Material, material is here

579
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:46,680
I love you so much

580
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:47,907
My cell phone suddenly ran out of power

581
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:49,182
I'm so worried

582
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:50,640
As a professional journalist 

583
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,345
You go out without materials

584
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:54,104
I was called in on the spur of the moment

585
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:54,902
These materials 

586
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:55,787
are my study summary

587
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:56,640
I have to be somewhat prepared 

588
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:57,723
to interview people, right?

589
00:25:58,438 --> 00:25:59,109
Quickly,quickly,quickly

590
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,792
Ying Qiu, the interview is about to begin

591
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:01,419
I'm going to work

592
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:02,485
Just stay here 

593
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:03,420
and wait for me while you have a drink of water

594
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,542
Love you, bye-bye

595
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:32,776
Commentary table

596
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:14,918
Hello, everyone

597
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,133
I am commentator,Ying Qiu

598
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,827
 Today I bring you 

599
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,461
the first game of the spring regular season

600
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:22,568
WeiTeng against Legends

601
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:23,816
Let's look at the big screen

602
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:33,380
What a fantastic game!

603
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:36,448
Oh! my god!

604
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:39,550
Both teams have two carries in their lineups

605
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,705
Is this going to be late game to hit damage?

606
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,941
Tian Luo, what do you think?

607
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:48,618
Do interns practice 

608
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,608
so casually these days?

609
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,703
Or do you think the commentaries are simple words 

610
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:53,337
that come out of the mouth?

611
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,960
Sorry,sorry,sorry

612
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:58,688
I...I... I'm not an intern

613
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,449
I'm going the wrong way. I'm going the wrong way

614
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,148
Excuse me. Excuse me

615
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,705
Ying Qiu,oh,my god

616
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:19,926
Is the interview over? How about it?

617
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:21,994
 I'm so tired

618
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,372
I'm glad you delivered the materials in time

619
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,385
If I'm not prepared

620
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,365
I'm doomed

621
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,184
Why do you look so fanatical again?

622
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:40,675
Yiyi

623
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,842
I've been studying 

624
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:43,887
how to be a commentator lately,haven't I

625
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:46,235
I had a great opportunity

626
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:48,281
You know that video company JiGuang 

627
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,084
is hosting a competition 

628
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:50,613
called The Stars Of Tomorrow.

629
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:52,505
The winner will partner with Tian Luo 

630
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:54,655
and host "IConquer hour" together.

631
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:57,723
Tian Luo? Stop dreaming

632
00:28:58,037 --> 00:28:59,775
Tian Luo has a sharp tongue

633
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:01,128
If you partner with him

634
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:02,502
 he'll swear at you

635
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,554
It's normal for 

636
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,160
a tough guy to be tough

637
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:08,040
Besides, I signed up

638
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:11,433
Sister, at your present level

639
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:14,077
 you can only be the last place in the competition 

640
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,794
Anyway

641
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,384
I'm not going back to YouXing

642
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:20,953
But I don't want to leave the industry

643
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,191
I don't want to miss 

644
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:24,110
such a good opportunity

645
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:25,215
You accompany me to the bookstore to buy some relevant books, I plan to learn more

646
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,679
Well, you drink it quickly

647
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:29,796
You accompany me to the bookstore

648
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:30,791
to buy some relevant

649
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:31,710
I'll learn it

650
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:32,518
No, no, no

651
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,585
I'm tired. I'm exhausted

652
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,312
Yiyi

653
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:38,688
I know a piece of software

654
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:39,893
 that has everything in it

655
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:41,592
You need some books like esports,righe?

656
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:42,477
 I'll search them for you

657
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,083
Esports

658
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:45,876
All right, choose them

659
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,290
So cheap  

660
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,309
The price of a new book 

661
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:51,293
can buy two or three old books

662
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:53,009
Yeah,  after all

663
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,780
it's Zhuanzhuan secondary trading site

664
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:55,583
It's useful

665
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,825
Is it genuine?

666
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,014
Of course. Quickly choose it

667
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:00,922
This, this, this 

668
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:02,451
It's so cheap,I'll take it all

669
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,700
I'll take the order now

670
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,515
It is expected to arrive tomorrow

671
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:09,452
Finished it. Great

672
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:11,905
I was able to acquire theoretical knowlegde

673
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:14,572
 but how can I quickly improve

674
00:30:14,588 --> 00:30:16,084
 my practical experience?

675
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,284
Yiyi, please help me

676
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:21,072
I don't know

677
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:23,860
I know that 

678
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:24,900
there is an Internet cafe in the industry 

679
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,918
that regularly hosts live broadcasts of matches 

680
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,051
and resets of matches

681
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,332
which is especially suitable for those of you 

682
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:30,482
who have just entered the industry to learn

683
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,593
Is it true? Let's go!

684
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:33,803
Let's go now

685
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:36,998
Right here

686
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:44,192
How's that?It isvery unusual

687
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:46,292
Look at all those people

688
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:48,157
Come with me

689
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:52,666
Wait a minute. Wait a minute

690
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:53,601
Let me tell you something

691
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:54,844
There must be a lot of people 

692
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:56,769
in the circle on this occasion

693
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:57,924
We need to be aggressive

694
00:30:58,468 --> 00:30:59,161
But you must remember 

695
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,618
to talk less and listen more

696
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:02,769
You don't have to teach me that

697
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,193
Let's go

698
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,747
You're  going the wrong way

699
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:11,480
This way, sister

700
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:22,660
So cool

701
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,328
It's all about IConquer

702
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,088
You've been here before,haven't you?

703
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:30,320
I... I was here

704
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,233
It didn't look like this 

705
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:32,196
when I was here

706
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:33,406
All right

707
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:38,229
Look at that thin guy

708
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,339
I know him

709
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:40,967
His nickname is Fat Cat

710
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,859
He used to be number one in the district

711
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,959
But

712
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:45,070
now he was beaten by 

713
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:47,077
a man called Thin Monkey

714
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:47,732
Thin Monkey

715
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,688
What do you want to drink?

716
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,432
Oh,my god

717
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,559
Thin Monkey is also here

718
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,842
Why don't you know what I like to drink? 

719
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,679
I want the JianJiao

720
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,928
What colour do you want?

721
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:00,265
 Blue

722
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:00,936
Hurry up

723
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:01,876
What time is it?

724
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:03,735
The game is about to start over there

725
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,677
Aren't they enemies? 

726
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,200
Why do they look like friends?

727
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,406
How do you know everything?

728
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,638
Of course

729
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:13,859
But in these two people

730
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:15,283
the thin call Fat Cat

731
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:16,917
the fat call Thin Monkey

732
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,875
two people's name is a match

733
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:21,800
What are they looking at?

734
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:24,368
Go, go, go, let's go and see

735
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:25,320
Go

736
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:28,960
Excuse me

737
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:29,923
Please let me pass,please let me pass

738
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,556
Please let me pass,please let me pass

739
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,513
Thank you, thank you, thank you

740
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,416
Go!Go!

741
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:37,391
This girl is so cool

742
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:43,110
What are you doing? 

743
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,909
Go! Go! Go!

744
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:46,388
The upper way's pawns,the upper way's pawns

745
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:48,153
Put skills, put skills

746
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:48,648
Put skills

747
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,798
Go back,she is pushing your crystal

748
00:32:58,542 --> 00:32:59,597
Well done

749
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:01,390
So tough

750
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:08,842
You're formidable

751
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:12,543
Are you okay?

752
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:14,809
This is the first time I have met 

753
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,222
such a tough girl like Wantujiang

754
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:17,872
She's too good

755
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:18,856
Little sister

756
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,034
Are you on the district list?

757
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:21,705
Then you

758
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,074
 meet the recruitment requirements here

759
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,196
Yes

760
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,273
I don't want to be a waiter

761
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:31,879
Get out of the way

762
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:33,254
OK

763
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:38,764
So cool

764
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,075
She is a little chilly

765
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,867
Chilly

766
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,820
Hello, I know you

767
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:46,727
Do you know us?

768
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,174
They must be fans

769
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:49,290
Right,right,right

770
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,556
What kind of hiring 

771
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,518
were you talking about?

772
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:54,190
MengLvRen's recruitment

773
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,779
It's over there

774
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:02,263
Oh,my god

775
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:03,121
To be a waiter

776
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:04,199
you have to be number one

777
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:06,943
It's so insane

778
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,000
This only shows 

779
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,633
the high level of MengLvRen

780
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:12,668
Maybe the waiters here 

781
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,747
are the best

782
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:19,058
Hey,hey, hey, Ying Qiu.Look!

783
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:27,593
Xi Pei

784
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,617
This high cold facial paralysis

785
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:30,656
The last time he played double qualifying

786
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:31,932
he chased you down with XinQiao

787
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:33,049
He's not a good guy

788
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:35,314
It doesn't matter.It's all in the past

789
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:39,461
But what's he doing here?

790
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:41,551
Still wearing a waiter's uniform

791
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:42,843
Yes

792
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,221
I remember something

793
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,595
MengLvRen's boss 

794
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,432
is his cousin, Summer

795
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:52,533
So that's it

796
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:58,032
A top player is a waiter here

797
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,474
What game are they playing?

798
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:02,828
Forget it. Leave him alone

799
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,429
Come on, you play two games with me

800
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:06,441
Let's go

801
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,790
Chairman Jin,what can I do for you?

802
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:10,912
Xiangkong

803
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:12,034
Come on, come on,com on

804
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:13,480
Please have a seat

805
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:19,309
It's no big deal to ask 

806
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:20,646
you and manager Zhao to come here today 

807
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:22,796
During the last press conference

808
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:24,512
there was some estrangement between the two of you. 

809
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:26,123
On behalf of the company

810
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:27,553
I would like to apologize to you

811
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,215
At the same time,I hope you can understand me

812
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,476
After the video incident broke

813
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,560
 the team was in a panic.

814
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,112
The extraordinary decisions that a company makes 

815
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:39,558
at a certain point are also forced upon it

816
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:41,423
I understand it,chairman Jin

817
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:42,924
It's all over

818
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,513
Manager Zhao 

819
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:45,806
will just give me a proper apology

820
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:46,713
Of course

821
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,115
Manager Zhao would like to

822
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:48,962
 sincerely apologize to you

823
00:35:53,686 --> 00:35:56,238
I'm sorry. It's all my fault

824
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:59,032
Sorry

825
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,072
I've been wearing these earphones for a long time

826
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:02,524
 so I can't hear you clearly. What did you say?

827
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:16,404
I'm sorry. It's all my fault

828
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,720
You're welcome. It's all right

829
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:21,865
In fact, everything manager zhao does 

830
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,124
is for the sake of the team

831
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,208
We quite understand you

832
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,330
We totally understand you

833
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,673
Everyone is one of us

834
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,967
Don't take it to heart

835
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,820
 The most important task now 

836
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,745
is the inside final    - Yes

837
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:35,624
You can rest assured that 

838
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,318
I won't let you down

839
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,392
In that case

840
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,755
we are waiting for

841
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:42,400
 Xiangkong triumphal return

842
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:44,171
If it's all right, I'm gonna go

843
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:45,397
Manager Zhao

844
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:46,546
everyone is one of their own

845
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:48,037
 You shake hands with Xiangkong

846
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:49,692
this thing so past

847
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,057
Manager Zhao, have some tea

848
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:12,201
I don't drink it

849
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:13,950
No, don't be angry

850
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,347
This time he was lucky

851
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,381
He made me apologize

852
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:24,036
Was it done without a trace

853
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,758
Please rest assured.yes,it was

854
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,210
They're not gonna find us
