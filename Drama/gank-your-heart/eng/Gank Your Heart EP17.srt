Qiu Ying.

4
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,250

requires to earn one thousand points in one hour.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,375
The time is limited.

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,675
There's not enough time

8
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,450
even searching answers online.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Also,

10
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,525
if you miss one,

11
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:54,875
you have to start from the beginning.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Do you have confidence in this?

13
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,725
I have to be confident even I'm not.

14
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,200
Then, let's start!

15
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright.

16
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,350

18
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:08,725

00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:09,925
Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,950
All set.

21
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,225

22
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,750
It's correct!

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,450
Be quick! D.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,600

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Choose C.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,525
Quick. Quick. Quick.

27
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,200

28
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,025
Choose D.

29
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,850
It's right!

30
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,100
You rock!

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,325
Right again!

32
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,550
Choose C. Choose A.

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah! CCC.

34
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:44,900
And this, choose A.

35
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,475
Good. Good. Good.

36
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,100
Ten seconds left for the last question.

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,825
What's the initiate Health Point for Jin Can?

38
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,600
Only five seconds. Be quick!

39
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:52,400
Three.

40
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,375
Two.

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,400
One.

42
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,450
Choose C.

43
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,875
You've got it!

44
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,400
You are so wonderful!

45
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,950
Let's see.

46
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,700
What's the rule for the preliminary contest.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,275
Let me see.

48
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,625
All the people who get promoted,

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,025
in group of five,

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,675
answer questions on site.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Only the first can get promoted.

52
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,750
It's not a problem for you.

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,375
You even finished this one thousand points test.

54
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,200
At the site,

55
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,850
you just relax. Don't be nervous.

56
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,075
You definitely can pass.

57
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,775
But the questions at the site

58
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,375
must be harder than the ones online.

59
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,725
Can't you be more confident?

60
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Sure.

61
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,100
Start to do more exerscise.

62
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,600
Alright.

63
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,575
I'll stay with you.

64
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:38,325
Get promoted.

65
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,675
Don't even tell your teacher Ji?

66
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:47,975
Just the preliminary.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,150
You are so busy.

68
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,575
I am afraid to bother you.

69
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,325
I originally plan to celebrate with you.

70
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:06,525
If you say so,

71
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:07,425
forget it then.

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,775
Qiu Ying.

73
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,150
What are you expecting for?

74
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,850
Or,

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,150
why do you feel hollow at heart？

76
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,575
No matter how busy I am,

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,425
there is always time for a milk tea.

78
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,675
Ji Xiangkong?

79
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,575
Why are you here?

80
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,875
I miss

81
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,050
the strawberry milk tea at here.

82
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:49,950
Who knows that

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,625
I can accidentally meet

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,975
the ungrateful little apprentice.

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,425
It's not like that.

86
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,550
I am going to

87
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,725
the preliminary contest soon.

88
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:01,625
I'm a little nervous.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
So I stop by to review my notes.

90
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,200
No matter how busy you are,

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,425
you need to take care of yourself.

92
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,250
You looked so worn out.

93
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:11,575
This is for you.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,700
Your girls' favourite.

95
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:14,650
UNIFON facial mask.

96
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,150
Thanks!

97
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:22,175
You just

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
swotting up at the last moment.

99
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,950
Can you remember all these?

100
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,600
Let me share you a secret tip.

101
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:28,575
Ok.

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,575
What's the tip?

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,325
This secret…

104
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,200
What?

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,125
Secret tip

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
can't share with others.

107
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,025
Forget about it.

108
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,550
Who doesn't know

109
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,975
your little secrete tips?

110
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,200
The great captain of Legends,

111
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,600
Gu Fang, once said,

112
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,350
"This Ji Xiangkong,

113
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,975
no matter choose which heros,

114
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,450
only has four fixed modes.

115
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,475
They are

116
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,450
pretending not to see,

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,375
pretending can't hit,

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,200
pretending can't run away,

119
00:06:58,425 --> 00:06:59,775
and pretending there is someone behind.

120
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,825
After all, this is

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,275
a textbook example of jerk." Keep saying.

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,100
You keep saying.

123
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,100
looking for a fight.

124
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,950
looking for a fight. My bad. My bad.

125
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,900
My bad.

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,475
You.

127
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,725
Why are you staring at me?

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,100
Can't I look at you?

129
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,350
When you become the best commentator later on,

130
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,750
I can only watch you on the screen.

131
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,875
Don't make fun of me.

132
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,025
No matter I can be the

133
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:27,875
best commentator or not,

134
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,375
if you want to see me,

135
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,250
I will come for sure.

136
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:50,925
Also, you said before.

137
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,325
We are brothers.

138
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,325
Ji Xiangkong.

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,850
You and VNG's coach, Shu Wen.

140
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,075
Do you have good relationship with her?

141
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,675
As a matter of fact,

142
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,300
we've known for many years.

143
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,075
But…

144
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:23,275
You have somethings else to do?

145
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,100
Today is the preliminary contest.

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Then, let me

147
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,050
take you there quickly.

148
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,600
OK.

149
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,450
Thanks for your ride.

150
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,075
Be more careful when you drive back.

151
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,375
I am going there now.

152
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,200
Bye.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,350
Wait a second.

154
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,000
You hair is messed up.

155
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,450
Later on, when you in the competition,

156
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:28,675
Don't be nervous.

157
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Fighting!

158
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:30,675
I have faith in you.

159
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:33,825
I will try my best.

160
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,400
Bye bye.

161
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:18,875
You get fired up today！

162
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:19,625
It's fine.

163
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,550
Losing to me. It's not a shame.

164
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,075
This year,

165
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:21,725
CUBA,

166
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,325
We must be the winner.

167
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,275
Xia Ling.

168
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,350
Good job!

169
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,475
Not a big deal. Just normal play.

170
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:30,300
How is it? How is it?

171
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:31,375
Is the result released？

172
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,950
Right on time. See.

173
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
My sister gets through to the final.

174
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,325
Great. Xia Ling.

175
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:38,950
Let your sister give us few

176
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,850
tickets to the final. That's right.

177
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,900
We cheer up for her.

178
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,325
No problem. Everyone gets two tickets.

179
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,875
That's a deal.

180
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:45,975
Let's go.

181
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,850
Go. Go.

182
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:48,525
Hello, sister Xin.

183
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:52,900
Qiu Ying.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,700
Congratulation

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,350

186
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,825

187
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,925
Actually, if you are here,

188
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,600
I won't fell bored.

189
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,375
I am also glad

190
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,400

191
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,075

with true ability.

196
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,325
Can't play little tricks.

197
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:25,875
Speaking of this,

198
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,275
I am really worried about you.

199
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,200
But it's fine.

200
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,925
Try you best.

201
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,725
I think high of you.

202
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,675
I already sent you the exam questions.

203
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,050
You will definitely be the winner.

204
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,775
Ok. Ok. Teacher Can.

205
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,700
I get it.

206
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Thanks so much!

207
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,525
Want to compete with me?

208
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,425
Lu Feng!

209
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,425
Lu Feng!

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,975
Lu Feng!

211
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,125
Bad luck.

212
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,850
I am telling you. This doesn't count.

213
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,550
What doesn't count?

214
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,175
Doesn't count you win.

215
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:33,925
I have ran for a while before.

216
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,375
Who compete with you?

217
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,425
You didn't compete with me.

218
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,500
Then when I speed up, you also speed up.

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,375
What do you mean?

220
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,025
This is my regular running speed.

221
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,125
Is you the one who speed up, alright?

222
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,000
Can't stand you.

223
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,550
Ask you a question.

224
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,550
On the internal game,

225
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,950
Why did Huo Yao miss the hit?

226
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,425
If wasn't Zhao Yang, who wanted you to win,

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,575
played dirty behind to force Huo Yao,

228
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,250
will my brother Kong lose internal game

229
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,225
and drove away by you?

230
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:28,900
So everything

231
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,400
is Zhao Yang's conspiracy?

232
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,750
Do you really don't know all these?

233
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,450
I am telling you.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,325
If you are here for one day,

235
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,525
I won't let you stay well.

236
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,075
So this is why you hate me?

237
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,875
Or should I like you?

238
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,000
Weirdo.

239
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,550
Wait. Where have you been?

240
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,025
Wang Bin and Zhao Yang

241
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,600
is cleaning up the things of captain Ji.

242
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,075
I heard them say that

243
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,925
they will throw away captain Ji's trophy.

244
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:05,700
They are looking for a fight, aren't they?

245
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,050
Gosh!

246
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,525
Throw all these for me.

247
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:17,550
This one.

248
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,250
This.

249
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,200
And this.

250
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,025
OK.

251
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,200
Especially this photo.

252
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,275
This one.

253
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,150
What are you doing?

254
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,950
Leave him alone. Keep throwing.

255
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,800
What?

256
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,025
Who let you throw my brother Kong's things?

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,825
He already left.

258
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,200
Things are in the way here.

259
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:54,325
Lin Yixuan.

260
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,900
This is the company's decision.

261
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,750
Release me.

262
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,300
Dare you to move. Try it.

263
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:04,625
Lin Yixuan.

264
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:06,475
I just let Wang Bin

265
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,875
throw some garbage.

266
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,500
Is it really necessary to act like this?

267
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,375
Wang Bin. Keep throwing.

268
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,375
Why are you beating? I am going to call the police.

269
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,575
I am calling the police.

270
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:16,650
Did you hear me?

271
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,625
What are you doing? What are you doing?

272
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,075
Something wrong with you!

273
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,825
What are you doing?

274
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,750
Dare you insult him again. Dare you.

275
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,450
Pei Xi.

276
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,425
You are the captain.

277
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,575
Is this your teammate?

278
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:32,450
If he act like this again,

279
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,700
I can call the police to catch him.

280
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,625
Lin Yixuan. Don't act impulsively first.

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,400
Don't think I don't know that

282
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,500
you are in the same team with them.

283
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,950
You teamed up to drive my brother kong away.

284
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,225
Right now, you even throw his stuff.

285
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,650
Zhao Yang. You are a great bully.

286
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,350
You've gone too far. Do you know?

287
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,350
Lin Yixuan.

288
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,825
Things you don't know,

289
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,675
don't come up with a conclusion too soon.

290
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,750
You

291
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,225
find a place on the bench for one year.

292
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,975
Stay in the reserve!

293
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:15,700
Director Zhao.

294
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,300
It's not that serious.

295
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,825
I don't need you to say good words for me.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,100
Stay in the reserve, right?

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,250
Will do.

298
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:28,800
I am telling you.

299
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:31,200
The last thing I need is a Support.

300
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,800
Pei Xi.

301
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Pei Xi.

302
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,025
What are you doing?

303
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,600
I don't hope

304
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,075
when I leave the Legends,

305
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:49,350
all these will

306
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,700
be threw away by you like a garbage.

307
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:51,450
Not like that.

308
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,075
Pei Xi.

309
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:03,850
Director Zhao.

310
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,425
They.

311
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:06,550
They.

312
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,725
Are you alright?

313
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,950
Brother Nine.

314
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,725
I want another drink.

315
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,425
I haven't had enough.

316
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:19,725
This way. This way.

317
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:22,175
No. No.

318
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,650
My gosh!

319
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,825
OK. I am here. Here.

320
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,275
What's wrong with you?

321
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,450
Why call me here at the middle of the night?

322
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,275
I have been waited for you for an hour.

323
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,600
I am going to die if you don't come.

324
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,725
Keep on.

325
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,175
You seem in high spirits.

326
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,400
You won't die in a while.

327
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,275
Do you have any human feelings?

328
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,425
I am like this.

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,575
You are still being sarcastic.

330
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,250
You had a fight? It hurts!

331
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,625
Who beat you?

332
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,225
Let me revenge for you.

333
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:24,750
Being beaten?

334
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:27,175
Today, Zhao yang's assistant

335
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,275
threw my brother Kong's trophy away.

336
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,500
I beat him to kneel down on the ground and call，

337
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,750
"Brother Xuan. Brother Xuan. Don't beat me anymore.

338
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:32,525
It hurts. I am begging you.

339
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,350
Let me go."

340
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:34,650
And then what?

341
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,050
Say focal point.

342
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:38,725
And then.

343
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:42,600
And then, I've been

344
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,700
switched to the reserve.

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,150
This season,

346
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,100
I can't go on the stage anymore.

347
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:51,300
Are you being stupid? It hurts!

348
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:54,950
Don't you think

349
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,075
I shouldn't have this fight?

350
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,100
Of course.

351
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,075
Give me a drink.

352
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,175
You're hopeless. Too stupid.

353
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,700
He threw sway. Can't you just pick them back?

354
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,625
Just because of this,

355
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,500
you've been dropped to the reserve.

356
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,100
You are so stupid. Hurts!

357
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,650
By the way, why you and Qiu Ying

358
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,775
being so loyal to him?

359
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,150
What ecstasy did he give to you both?

360
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,225
Being like a fanboy all the time.

361
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,650
If wasn't brother Kong,

362
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:47,050
right now,

363
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,100
I am still being bullied at the street.

364
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,075
Sorry. Sorry.

365
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:50,875
It's on my treat.

366
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,200
Don't give negative feedback, OK?

367
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,350
I don't care.

368
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,125
That's your business.

369
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,500
You are late, then that's a late.

370
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,050
The meal is cold. How can I eat this?

371
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,525
Wait. Don't throw it if you don't eat.

372
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,725
Lost your job?

373
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,275
How's that your business?

374
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,275
Do you still remember, two days ago,

375
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,550
we had a game at The King.

376
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,375
You lost.

377
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,250
You have to call me brother.

378
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,375
I lost indeed.

379
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:49,100
But why should I call you brother Kong?

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,575
I can introduce

381
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,650
a more suitable job to you.

382
00:21:51,975 --> 00:21:52,475
How's that?

383
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,050
I don't want to be a network manager.

384
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,350
Who let you be a network manager?

385
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,575
Do you want to play the professional game or not?

386
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,975
The Legends.

387
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,050
Do you know?

388
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,200
The Legends?

389
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,000
Just take a hike.

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Leave me alone. I am at work.

391
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,250
Alright.

392
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,200
I am leaving then.

393
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,975
Wait a second.

394
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,500
Call me brother Kong or not?

395
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,325
Brother Kong. I am ready.

396
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:30,475
When is the training?

397
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:34,800
Brother Kong.

398
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:37,575
A toast to you.

399
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,500
Let me see.

400
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,175
Can't believe that

401
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,550
this liar

402
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,950
can be so chivalrous sometimes.

403
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,075
I, Lu Yiyi,

404
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,775
toast to you.

405
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,275
He is still alive.

406
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,000
How can you toast like this?

407
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:04,275
Then you toast to a photo.

408
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:05,250
What do you mean?

409
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,125
What do you mean?

410
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,275
Where's my phone? My phone?

411
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,200
Your phone.

412
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,825
You. You steal my phone.

413
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,525
My little Yingying

414
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,050
is calling me.

415
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,025
Hello. You. Where are you?

416
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,000
Have you drink alcohol?

417
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
I haven't.

418
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,850
Why are you drinking?

419
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,625
Drink less.

420
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,575
Send me your location.

421
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:42,425
I am picking you up now.

422
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,525
Come here. Come here to drink.

423
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:46,450
Stay away. Wait for me.

424
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,375
I am coming.

425
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:54,750
Thank you, master!

426
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,375
Qiu Ying.

427
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,075
Why are you here?

428
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,025
Lin Yixuan that guy is drunk.

429
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,075
I am picking him up.

430
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,775
What about you?

431
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,150
I am here to pick up Yiyi.

432
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,925
They stay together.

433
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,800
That's how it is.

434
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:17,600
Then I am relieved.

435
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,525
Let's go then.

436
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:20,550
Right.

437
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,400
The Rising Star competition.

438
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,675
How's your preparation going?

439
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,850
If you have any problem,

440
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,650
just ask me.

441
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:28,850
I'm just one call away.

442
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:30,775
Qiu Ying.

443
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,725
Wake up.

444
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:33,875
He just treats you as his brother.

445
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,975
Right now,

446
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,500
he and his ex-girlfriend are back together.

447
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,825
You have to keep distance from him.

448
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,300
No.

449
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,525
It's not necessary.

450
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,250
Aren't you preparing for the new season?

451
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
I am not going to bother you.

452
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,750
And right now, I work at MangLvRen.

453
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,800
There are many professionals at there.

454
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:50,900
They all can help me.

455
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,875
Why do you treat me as a stranger suddenly?

456
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,550
Did I offend you?

457
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,425
Or

458
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,700
you don't need me as your teacher.

459
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,850
Not like that. You think too much.

460
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:01,700
I just don't want to bother you.

461
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,125
You are too heavy.

462
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,850
You can't drink more than me.

463
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:08,075
Lu Yiyi, You can't drink more than me.

464
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,350
How much have you drunk?

465
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,475
Laughing like this. Brother Kong.

466
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,775
Brother Kong?

467
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:12,425
A toast to you.

468
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:13,425
That's my brother Kong.

469
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:14,900
You call me brother Kong?

470
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,725
That's my brother Kong.

471
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,550
Why have you drunk like this?

472
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,375
Qiu Ying.

473
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,150
Why are you still holding a microphone?

474
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,375
Qiu Ying. You are here.

475
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,425
I am here. I am here.

476
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:24,350
Why have you drunk like this?

477
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,175
You can't drink more than me, Lu Yiyi.

478
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,700
I am telling you.

479
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,000
Who can't drink more than you?

480
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:31,500
The great reporter Lu.

481
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,250
If I haven't got it wrong,

482
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,850
you just called me brother Kong.

483
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,175
Shouldn't I be a love rat in your heart?

484
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:40,375
Love rat.

485
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,300
Right.

486
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,950
You are a love rat.

487
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,250
Former sister-in-law.

488
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,725
You already have a girlfriend

489
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,300
and still play around with other girls.

490
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,300
If you are not a love rat,

491
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,275
then what you are?

492
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
She is drunk.

493
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,525
she doesn't mean this.

494
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:56,700
She has drank too much.

495
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:57,625
I am not drunk.

496
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,475
Former sister-in-law?

497
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,875
Playing around?

498
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,900
Shu Wen.

499
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,725
Lin Yixuan already told me.

500
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,125
Shu Wen is his

501
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,375
former sister-in-law.

502
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,025
Drink too much.

503
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:11,850
Wait. What do you mean?

504
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,125
No meaning.

505
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:13,800
She has drank too much.

506
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,675
I am not drunk.

507
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,100
Shu Wen.

508
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:28,850
It hurts.

509
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,925
The gossip of me and sister Wen online.

510
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,425
You even add more to it.

511
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,775
You guy, see how I am gonna deal with you.

512
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
See how I will deal with you.

513
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:39,150
No.

514
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,375
It's like this.

515
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:41,700
Sister Wen

516
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,225
is not only his former sister-in-law,

517
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:44,900
but also mine.

518
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,475
Sister Wen is my big brother,

519
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,500
Sun Zeyi's former girlfriend.

520
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,200
So the messy gossip online,

521
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,275
you thought it's real?

522
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,625
I finally figure it out.

523
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,050
That's why

524
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:01,250
you are so distant from me.

525
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,725
I am not being distant.

526
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:09,225
Also, the things online look real.

527
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,375
It's hard for me to not believe.

528
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,025
What if it's real?

529
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,575
So I need to keep some distance.

530
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,350
Of all my gossip girlfriend,

531
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:20,950
the one looks most real

532
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,725
is you.

533
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:26,175
Make some sense.

534
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,875
Lu Yiyi can't drink more than me.

535
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,000
Why are you so heavy?

536
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,975
Keep drinking.

537
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,225
Why have drunk like this?

538
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:42,550
Come. Don't fall down.

539
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:43,475
I want another drink.

540
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:47,875
What's wrong with you face?

541
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,075
Don't touch me.

542
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,625
I am telling you.

543
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,525
If you dare to touch my brother Kong's things again,

544
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:52,350
I am not done with you.

545
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,650
Not done with who?

546
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:55,850
Xiangkong.

547
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,275
Who is he not done with?

548
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:58,725
No.

549
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,375
Coach Luo told me that

550
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,050
Zhao Yang and Wang Bin

551
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,050
want to throw my trophy away.

552
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,100
He was so angry,

553
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,225
so he beat Wang Bin.

554
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,675
And then,

555
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,925
he has been switched to the reserve.

556
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
This punk,

557
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,200
sooner or later, will has this day.

558
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:18,275
He gets angry too easily.

559
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,050
Yes.

560
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:22,075
He still has two years of contract with Legends.

561
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,100
He can't leave there.

562
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,401
Coach Luo let me persuade him.

563
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,025
Who knows he drank this much.

564
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:28,600
Well, I

565
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,300
still have meeting tomorrow, this punk.

566
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,250
Then you go back first.

567
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,050
When he wakes up, I will talk with him.

568
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,575
Lu Yiyi can't drink over me.

569
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,625
Brother Sun. Sorry to bother you.

570
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't worry. Go back first.

571
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
Don't leave. Keep drinking.

572
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:50,000
Leaving.

573
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,725
Don't leave. Keep drinking.

574
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,650
Want some water or not? Are you thirsty?

575
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Who is Lu Yiyi?

576
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,825
Lu Yiyi is so beautiful.

577
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,975
Put your hands inside.

578
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,200
Lin Yixuan. Keep drinking.

579
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:05,275
Alright. Alright.

580
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:06,600
Go to sleep. Behave well.

581
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Can't drink more than me.

582
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,325
You are the best.

583
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,400
He can't drink over me.

584
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,425
Keep drinking.

585
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,275
Have you arrived home?

586
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:02,175
Yes.

587
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,775
Is Lin Yixuan doing well?

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,900
He is sleeping

589
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,975
like a pig.

590
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:11,950
Right.

591
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,125
Forget to congregate you

592
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,725
for entering the final of the Rising Star.

593
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,725
An accomplished disciple owes her accomplishments to her great teacher.

594
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,800
You are finally back to normal.

595
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:38,975
Go to bed early,

596
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:39,975
good night.

597
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,575
Good night.

598
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,100
Bunny.

599
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,075
Do you know

600
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:13,500
that Ji Xiangkong doesn't have a girlfriend.

601
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,275
Shu Wen and he

602
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,100
are not in relationship.

603
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:20,350
Restrain yourself.

604
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,925
Do you know restraint?

605
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,325
What is restraint?

606
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,125
I don't know.

607
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:32,925
Even though

608
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,325
Shu Wen is not his girlfriend,

609
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,650
he doesn't necessaryly like you.

610
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:44,125
I think he likes me.

611
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,150
Otherwise,

612
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,575
Why he explained this to me?

613
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,325
If this doesn't show his feeling,

614
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,300
then what will do?

615
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,300
Am I right?

616
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,375
Go to sleep.

617
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,450
Qiu Ying. Fighting.

618
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,700
You must become

619
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:15,300
the commentator of GDV.

620
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,025
We've promised

621
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,600
to walk towards World IConquer together.

622
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,675
Ji Xiangkong.

623
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,125
You have to wait for me.

624
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,400
The rising Star.

625
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,675
I can make it!

626
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,500
Fighting.

627
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,800
Something interesting.

628
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:10,950
What a pity. It's a waste.

629
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:23,250
Haven't slept yet？

630
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:29,900
Ready to sleep.

631
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:38,475
Good night. Good night.

632
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,875
OK. Good night.

633
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,675
This is rich!

634
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:54,675
Good morning, captain.

635
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:55,625
Morning.

636
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,200
The breakfast for Qi Yue and Shen Yue?

637
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,250
Do you want anything, captain?

638
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,450
No need.

639
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:06,075
Tong Wu.

640
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,225
You finally understand my point.

641
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,325
Today's meal is wonderful.

642
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,525
Meat bun?

643
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,850
I don't like meat bun.

644
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,950
Buy vegetable bun next time.

645
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,150
There is no next time.

646
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,025
Later on, Tong Wu has no time

647
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:24,900
to prepare breakfast for you.

648
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:26,350
This period of time,

649
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,700
he needs to do an hour of extra practice with me.

650
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:32,250
Ji Xiangkong.

651
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,525
You do this on purpose.

652
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,375
Qi Yue.

653
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,775
Do you know how people

654
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,675
talk about you?

655
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,850
How they talk about me?

656
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,175
They say you rely on your identity as president Li's apprentice

657
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:45,575
to bully the newcomers.

658
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,200
Who says that?

659
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:50,850
Let him see me.

660
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,825
Brother Qi.

661
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:53,850
Easy. Easy.

662
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,050
Alright.

663
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,275
Eat quickly.

664
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:57,700
Meet at half past ten.

665
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,075
Tong Wu.

666
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,575
The morning practice starts today.

667
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,125
Don't have any burden.

668
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,550
You are not worser than anyone.

669
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:39,100
Captain.

670
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,550
I have something to ask you.

671
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:46,900
Before I come to the team,

672
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:49,250
What happened to Ji Xiangkong?

673
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,875
Why after he losing the game,

674
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,100
he has to leave?

675
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,725
You really don't know?

676
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,625
What should I know?

677
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,750
This is what happened.

678
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,675
After Gu Fang's retirement,

679
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,500
captain Ji made promise

680
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,700
in front of the board of directors.

681
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,825
If we loose the internal game,

682
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:21,700
he will leave team.

683
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,775
But the one who made mistake during that game

684
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,950
is you.

685
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,700
From emotion to reason,

686
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,075
I should be the one to leave.

687
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,250
But Zhao Yang

688
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,425
made the decision to drive him away.

689
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,300
Plus,

690
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,325
the only condition for you

691
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,100
to join our team

692
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:45,675
is to be the captain.

693
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,975
Having no choice,

694
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,575
chairman Jing had to drive captain Ji away.

695
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,825
The only condition for me to join the team

696
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:55,675
is to be the leader.

697
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,250
Who says that?

698
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,000
Zhao Yang emphasizes this to us all the time.

699
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,200
This is the only condition for you to transfer here.

700
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,875
Brother Summer, good morning. Morning.

701
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,675
Brother Summer, morning.

702
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:13,300
Morning.

703
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,000
You did well in the preliminary contest.

704
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:19,800
How is it?

705
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Did you successfully become an apprentice?

706
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,850
Luo Tian, this guy.

707
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,500
You see, you look pretty

708
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,350
and also work hard.

709
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,800
I don't know what he is thinking about.

710
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:32,300
Maybe it's me

711
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,725
who is not professional enough.

712
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:35,750
You are not professional.

713
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:36,675
That means

714
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,050
my fellows at MengLvren are not professional.

715
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,150
When he arrives here, I need to ask him this.

716
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,575
Don't do that. Brother Summer.

717
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:42,950
I know you wan to help me.

718
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,725
But my professional skill is not enough,

719
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,450
There is no use for you to help me.

720
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:49,925
Alright.

721
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,500
You little girl has ambition.

722
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,550
Come here.

723
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:54,400
Tell me

724
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:55,725
how he refused you.

725
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:57,850
He told me

726
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,550
not to think about the short cuts all the time.

727
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,875
If I want to be a commentator,

728
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,525
I need to work towards the more professional field.

729
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,075
Saying these words

730
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,300
is not necessaryly a bad thing.

731
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Why is that?

732
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:13,425
This means,

733
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,175
you already successfully

734
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
attract his attention.

735
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,225
He thinks you are

736
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,425
a promising person.

737
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,000
So he treats you

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,975
more strictly.

739
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,725
Really?

740
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,475
Really. Trust your brother Summer.

741
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:23,675
Alright.

742
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,175
I will definitely work harder.

743
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,075
Fighting.

744
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,350
Right. Right. Right.

745
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,500
If you have any question,

746
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,225
just ask Pei Xi quickly.

747
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,250
He will definetly explain to you with great passion.

748
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:37,875
Fighting.

749
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:41,750
Pei Xi?

750
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,050
Why?

751
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,600
Brother Qi.

752
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't be angry.

753
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,025
Ji Xiangkong, this guy,

754
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:51,275
relies on sister Shu Wen.

755
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,825
He teaches lessons to whoever he wants.

756
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,075
The thing just now

757
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,425
will not end like this.

758
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:58,200
I am telling you.

759
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,125
The meeting later on,

760
00:38:59,125 --> 00:38:59,825
both of us don't attend.

761
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,900
Let's see what he can do.

762
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,925
Brother Qi.

763
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,575
If you lose your temper at this time,

764
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,575
we are trapped by Ji Xiangkong.

765
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:08,925
What trap?

766
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,600
He is aiming at us.

767
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,575
Can't you see that

768
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,075
he is isolating us?

769
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,900
He is cunning.

770
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,000
Firstly,

771
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:18,975
He left the single room alone

772
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,700
and stay at Lu Sheng's room.

773
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,700
Secondly,

774
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,925
he stood up for Tong Wu today.

775
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,075
What does this mean?

776
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,025
This means he want to break us down one by one.

777
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,225
Continue to develop like this,

778
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:29,575
VNG

779
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,450
has no place for you to stand.

780
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,250
OK.

781
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,725
He wants to play.

782
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
We play with him.

783
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,000
OK.

784
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:41,850
But

785
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,575
we cooperate with him on the surface,

786
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,050
Especially in front of sister Shu wen.

787
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,575
It's not early.

788
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:49,525
Let's go to the meeting.

789
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:55,300
Sorry. Sorry.

790
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:06,775
OK.

791
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,100
Everyone is here.

792
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,275
Let's discuss

793
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,675
how to prepare for the fall competition.

794
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,500
Xiangkong.

795
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:20,425
During this time, I organized

796
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:21,625
everyone's data from the last season.

797
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:22,825
And plan the training schedule

798
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:24,250
according to everyone's characteristics.

799
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:25,425
Shen Yue.

800
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:26,800
Your position is not changing.

801
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,725
You are still the support.

802
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:28,675
OK.

803
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,600
Tong Wu.

804
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:30,825
You play the top and bottom lane with me.

805
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,250
Qi Yue.

806
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,350
You gave all your resource

807
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,200
to Pei Xi before

808
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,675
and still have such beautiful data.

809
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:39,400
Without extremely strong ability,

810
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,350
you can't make this.

811
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:42,550
Play jungle.

812
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:45,150
You definitely rank in top three of the professionals.

813
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:46,125
So

814
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,100
your position is not changing.

815
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,900
My position is not changing?

816
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,025
Then who can be the Mid?

817
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:53,475
Lu Sheng.

818
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,900
You are the Mid.

819
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:56,725
Me?

820
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,725
Lu Sheng was the Top before.

821
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,175
He often defends three enemies at once.

822
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,500
But his death rate during the game

823
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,200
is extremely low.

824
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,550
This is not easy.

825
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,275
After Pei Xi's leaving,

826
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,625
VNG's Mid,

827
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,875
under the premise of guaranteeing carry,

828
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,775
also requires highly stress resistant.

829
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:14,450
I think

830
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,050
Lu Sheng is able to play Mid.

831
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,950
Then you should respect him

832
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,175
and ask for his opinion.

833
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
Mid can't be played by anyone.

834
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,425
All the eyes are on him.

835
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:25,050
Lu Sheng.

836
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,600
Can you handle this pressure?

837
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,200
I don't want to play Mid.

838
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:32,975
Why?

839
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,350
I can't make it.

840
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,600
You have such low confidence in yourself?

841
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,875
Let's brother Qi play Mid.

842
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,525
After Pei Xi's leaving,

843
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:42,700
brother Qi is the one who plays Mid all the time.

844
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,150
We already used to this.

845
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,000
There is no need to change.

846
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,950
What kind of material I am,

847
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,425
I know very well.

848
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:53,650
Xiangkong.

849
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,250
Your hope to change VNG's current situation.

850
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,925
we all can understand.

851
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,250
But,

852
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:02,725
the game is coming up.

853
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:04,450
Chaning posiiton temporarily

854
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,200
is a huge risk.

855
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:07,500
And what's more is that

856
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:09,600
Lu Sheng hasn't played this position before.

857
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:12,800
Even when the best Mid, Pei Xi, is here,

858
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,075
he is not able to guarantee

859
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,100
success in every game.

860
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:16,675
You can see how tactical cooperation is

861
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,125
more important than individual ability.

862
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,675
If all of you think this has risk,

863
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:22,075
then we use the new plan

864
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:22,925
for a month.

865
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,225
After a month,

866
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,900
let's decide

867
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,750
who will be the Mid.

868
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:26,625
How about this?

869
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,550
OK.

870
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,475
A period of one month.

871
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,725
That's a deal.

872
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,050
Shu Wen.

873
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:35,450
Lu Sheng.

874
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:37,575
Except from the normal training,

875
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,775
Starting from tomorrow,

876
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:40,500
you play one hour of basketball with me.

877
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,725
Playing basketball?

878
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,075
How could he come up with this?

879
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,175
How's this related to the competition.

880
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:45,400
Why don't let us

881
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,450
dance with you?

882
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,675
You are the captain.

883
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:51,850
You make the decision.

884
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,050
See you tomorrow.

885
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,650
Hey. Xiangkong.

886
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,550
Brother Sun.

887
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,650
How's Xuan?

888
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,100
He has been driven away by me.

889
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,900
I let him go back to the team to apologize.

890
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,825
He refused to do it.

891
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:26,950
He said that

892
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:29,025
he wants to stay at reserve for two years.

893
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,050
Xiangkong.

894
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,225
Your leaving

895
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,850
has great impact on him.

896
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,025
Right now, he looks like

897
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:35,300
there is nothing to lose.

898
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:37,850
That's his characteristic.

899
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:38,725
When he gets impulsive,

900
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:40,025
a bunch of cows can't stop him.

901
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,850
Professional player

902
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,075
doesn't play games for a long time.

903
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,675
The competitive condition can't come back anymore.

904
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,175
I know this point clearly.

905
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:48,575
I don't want him follow my old path.

906
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,275
I understand. Brother Sun.

907
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,200
I will fix this thing of Xuan first.

908
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:53,300
Hanging up.

909
00:43:59,075 --> 00:43:59,825
Quickly. Quickly.

910
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:00,525
No need to change shoes.

911
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:01,800
I am telling you.

912
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,600
I have to leave in a while.

913
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,475
Be quick.

914
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,300
Wait.

915
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:06,725
You call me here so rashly to…

916
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:09,575
Why are you standing at there?

917
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,775
So many words. Be quick!

918
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:17,725
Wait. Yiyi.

919
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,125
We. We. Aren't we two

920
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:21,050
a little bit

921
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,775
too, too soon?

922
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,150
I am not ready yet.

923
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,625
It's also my first time.

924
00:44:28,925 --> 00:44:29,900
First time?

925
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:31,375
Didn't you tell me

926
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,300
that you are a computer expert.

927
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:32,850
You can catch

928
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,700
any computer hacker behind?

929
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,400
Computer hacker?

930
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,875
You call me here to?

931
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,475
Investigate Zhao Yang!

932
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:44,400
We two made a deal that night, aren't we?

933
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,850
Right. Check on Zhao Yang. Come. Let's do it.

934
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,900
Or why do you think

935
00:44:48,925 --> 00:44:49,800
I am calling you to my home?

936
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,925
I am just here to investigate Zhang Yang.

937
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,200
Lin Yixuan.

938
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,275
What are you thinking?

939
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,700
I think of nothing.

940
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:01,300
Say it one more time.

941
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:02,550
Don't beat me. Don't!

942
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,475
You are such a rogue！

943
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:03,925
Don't!

944
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:05,450
Don't beat me!

945
00:45:07,025 --> 00:45:07,875
I will beat you to death.

946
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,450
Qiu Ying. She is not here.

947
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,475
I am here for you.

948
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,000
For me?

949
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:43,500
New product.

950
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,225
Try it for free.

951
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,100
Free again?

952
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,205
Don't you earn one yuan per year at VNG?

953
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,800
This one

954
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,900
is on my treat.

955
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,575
Please.

956
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,100
Even my annual salary is one yuan.

957
00:45:57,325 --> 00:45:58,875
A cup of coffee is still affordable.

958
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:06,875
Taste good.

959
00:46:09,075 --> 00:46:10,025
Let me get this straight.

960
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:12,050
I am here for you today

961
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,525
to talk about the thing of Lin Yixuan.

962
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,000
He beat people.

963
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,825
I can do nothing.

964
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:21,950
You are the captain of legends.

965
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:23,175
Then what?

966
00:46:24,175 --> 00:46:25,175
He doesn't listen to me.

967
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,525
I can't do anything.

968
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:27,225
The things of your teammates,

969
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,300
no matter big or small,

970
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,600
is related to the whole team.

971
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,425
You are the captain.

972
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:32,100
It's sure related to you.

973
00:46:33,775 --> 00:46:35,075
With the capability of Legends right now,

974
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,850
even Lin Yixuan leaves,

975
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:38,125
The next Support

976
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:39,475
will be found soon.

977
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:43,725
That's different.

978
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:45,275
Xuan's idea on Support

979
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:45,900
is very clear.

980
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:47,325
It is not an exaggeration to say that

981
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,725
of all the national professional players,

982
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:50,000
if he says he is the second,

983
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,450
No one dare to claim the first place.

984
00:46:51,925 --> 00:46:53,350
You switch him to reserve right now.

985
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:54,575
On the fall season,

986
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,100
will you have

987
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,975
a better substitude?

988
00:46:58,475 --> 00:46:59,125
Even

989
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,450
he is as good as you said.

990
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:02,150
A Support that doesn't listen to command

991
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
is no better than a reserve.

992
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:08,150
Xuan seems

993
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,250
to be a impulsive person.

994
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:10,625
But he is not a bad guy.

995
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,725
He has kind mind.

996
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:13,975
Legends has lots of things happened recently.

997
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,425
He needs some time

998
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,300
to adapt.

999
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,825
Do you hate me as he does?

1000
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,575
Hate is too serious.

1001
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:25,450
I would like to consider you as

1002
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:27,000
the most respective competitor at the game.

1003
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:32,175
Do you really think Legends

1004
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:33,725
needs Lin Yixuan?

1005
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,100
You are the captain.

1006
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,875
It's your business to make decision.

1007
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,600
I just tell you the truth.

1008
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,075
If you want to win the game,

1009
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,450
it's necessary to have him.

1010
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,050
Then aren't you afraid that,

1011
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,975
after I switching Lin Yixuan back,

1012
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,725
On the fall season,

1013
00:47:50,225 --> 00:47:50,925
you will lose to me?

1014
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:53,975
The stronger the competitor is,

1015
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,050
I feel more proud after winning the game.

1016
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,675
Wait. Why today's conversation becomes Q&A session?

1017
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,875
Any more questions?

1018
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,500
The last one.

1019
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,225
How do you think of me?

1020
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:10,450
A team with you is invincible.

1021
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,250
But

1022
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,725
only at the first six minutes.

1023
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,600
Only the first six minutes?

1024
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,675
I am not done yet.

1025
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,150
After the first six minutes,

1026
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,025
it depends on what kind of competitors you meet.

1027
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,475
If you are in bad luck,

1028
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,425
meeting me,

1029
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,525
then you will

1030
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:26,675
fall on the seventh minute.

1031
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,125
Arrogant.

1032
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,550
I will prove it to you.

1033
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,675
In this world,

1034
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,150
the one who can beat me

1035
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:37,125
is only myself.

1036
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,100
Drink water.

1037
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,400
How's that?

1038
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:51,900
Almost done.

1039
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,325
Investigation on Zhao Yang

1040
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,925
needs to start from the video of the airport.

1041
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,300
This is Qiu Ying's computer.

1042
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:02,575
If we can find out

1043
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,225
Who hacked her computer,

1044
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,650
We can find Zhao Yang.

1045
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:09,850
But,

1046
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:11,375
this computer

1047
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,650
doesn't seemed to be hacked.

1048
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,975
How's that possible!

1049
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,575
Then,

1050
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:17,950
that faked video of beating people

1051
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,900
is uploaded from this computer.

1052
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,550
Qiu Ying is not the one who sent it.

1053
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,225
Other than the hacker, who else can be?

1054
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:29,250
In this situation,

1055
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,200
normally, there is only one possibility.

1056
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:33,575
What possibility?

1057
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,150
Acquaintances commit the crime.

1058
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,900
It must be Qiu Ying's best friend,

1059
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,500
like you.

1060
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,450
What are you talking about?

1061
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:43,325
No. No.

1062
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,650
I just give yo an example.

1063
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,900
I didn't say it must be you.

1064
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,250
Wait.

1065
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,300
I think I know who that is.

1066
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,450
Who?

1067
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,650
Well. Coach Luo.

1068
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:06,650
Lin Yixuan.

1069
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,650
Come back for training.

1070
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:08,575
If you are late,

1071
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,725
I will punish you to be the reserve next game.

1072
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,625
I can attend compete again?

1073
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,100
Don't talk rubbish.

1074
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:15,750
Come back quickly.

1075
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:16,900
No. Caoch Luo.

1076
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,850
I am not OK.

1077
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,525
What’s happening?

1078
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,075
I. I have to go back first.

1079
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,375
I am leaving.

1080
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:27,200
You. Wait. Wait.

1081
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:28,725
Lin Yixuan!

1082
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,250
Acquaintances commit the crime.

1083
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,725
That's not possible.
