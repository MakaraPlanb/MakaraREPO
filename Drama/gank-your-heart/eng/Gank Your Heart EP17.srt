00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,980
the star tomorrow website's primary election，

5
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,540
needs to get a thousand questions right

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,780
in a hour.

7
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,060
Time is nervous,

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,490
even if you search online for the answer,

9
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,330
it wouldn't be enough.

10
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,210
Also,

11
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,330
one wrong answer,

12
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,690
you'll have to redo everything.

13
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,210
Do you have the confidence?

14
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,350
Even if don't have, I still need to have.

15
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,830
Start then.

16
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,990
Okay.

17
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,070

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,270
All the best.

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,670
Don't be nervous.

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,830
All the best.

21
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,870

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,020
It's correct.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,170
Amazing.

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,360

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,720

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,320

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,000
And then, choose A.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,560
Can,can.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
You have ten seconds for the last question.

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
How much is Jin Can's intial blood?

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,600
Last five second, hurry and choose.

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,520

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,360
One.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Choose C.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,070
Succeeded.

45
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,670
You're great.

46
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,150
Take a look,

47
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,550
what is the rules for the primary selection?

48
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,470
I see,

49
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,790
everyone that go in,

50
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,190
five in a group,

51
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
question and answer on the spot,

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,980
only one person will be selected.

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,900
You definitely don't have a problem.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,740
You even finished the thousand questions,

55
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,340
when you're at the venue,

56
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,210
you just have to relax and don't be nervous,

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,290
you definitely can smoothly get over it.

58
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,170
But the live questions

59
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,690
are definitely more difficult that thoe online.

60
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,970
Can you have some confidence?

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,970
Yes.

62
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,570
Start to take some test.

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,970
Okay.

64
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,050
I'll accompant you.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,040
Got selected,

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,480
and you didn't let your Teacher Ji know about it?

67
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,740
It's only primary selection,

68
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,100
you're so busy,

69
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,700
I don't want to disturb you.

70
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,220
Initially wanted to help you celebrate,

71
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,500
since you said this,

72
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,380
forget it.

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,810
Qiu Ying,

74
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,230
what are you looking forward to?

75
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,990
If not,

76
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,790
why did you feel

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,350
empty in your heart?

78
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,790
No matter how busy,

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,950
I still have time to drink

80
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,950
milk tea.

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,790
Ji Xiang Kong.

82
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,670
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,230
I miss

84
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,430
the strawberry milk tea here.

85
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,430
Who knows it will be of a coincidence,

86
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,220
just nice to meet some

87
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,500
heartless disciple.

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,900
No,

89
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,900
I was about to leave

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,060
for the pre-selection competition.

91
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm a little nervous,

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
so I came to see my notes.

93
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
No matter how busy,

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,840
you still have to take care of yourself.

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
You look haggard.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,240
For you.

97
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,440
You girls love to use this

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
mask.

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,640
Thanks.

100
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,830
You

101
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,110
doing last minute work,

102
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,510
can you remember?

103
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,990
Let me teach you a small secret.

104
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,110
Okay.

105
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,150
What secret?

106
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,020
This secret...

107
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,900
What?

108
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
Secret

109
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,380
can't seem to be spread,

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,620
forget it.

111
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,410
Just that few tactics,

112
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,530
who doesn't know?

113
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,130
The noble Iconcure Legends leader,

114
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,250
Gu Fang, once said,

115
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,130
this Ji Xiang Kong

116
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,890
no matter what hero he plays,

117
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,210
forever there's only four specific mode.

118
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,210
That is

119
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,370
pretend to not see it,

120
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,210
pretend to not shoot it,

121
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,170
pretend that you can't run away

122
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,530
and pretend there's someone behind.

123
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,720
In conclusion, it is

124
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
- just mean. - Say somemore.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
You say somemore.

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Asking for a beating.

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,880
Asking for a beating, I'm wrong.

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm wrong.

129
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,630
You...

130
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,670
why are you looking at me?

131
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,150
Can't I look at you?

132
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,510
Once you become the first commentary,

133
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,740
I can only look at you through the screen.

134
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,820
You don't joke with me already.

135
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,140
No matter if I can be

136
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,100
the first commentary,

137
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,620
so long as you want to see me,

138
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,500
I'll definitely come.

139
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,920
Also, you have already said,

140
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
we're brothers.

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,780
Ji Xiang Kong.

142
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,100
You and Wei Teng's Coach Shu Wen

143
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,420
have a good relationship?

144
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,020
To speak of,

145
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,780
already known for many years.

146
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,620
But,

147
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,860

148
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660

149
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,660
Then I'll hurry

150
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,580

151
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,210
Sure.

Thanks for sending me over.

153
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,670
Be careful on your way back.

154
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,990
I'll go in first.

155
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,390
Bye bye.

156
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,670
Wait,

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
your hair is messy.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,400
When you're in the competition,

159
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,560
don't be nervous.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,680
All the best.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,680
I look up to you.

162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll definitely do my best.

163
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,430
Bye bye.

164
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,130

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:23,730
Its fine.

166
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,880
Losing to me isn't embarrassing.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,320

But I heard,

197
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,480
this time,

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,060
can only rely on real ability

199
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,500
to get the championship,

200
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
there can't be any small actions.

201
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,740
Saying till here,

202
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm quite worry for you.

203
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,740
But its fine,

204
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,740
all the best.

205
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,620
I look up to you.

206
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,700
I've already send you the exam questions,

207
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,940
you're definitely the champion.

208
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,820
Great, Teacher Ah Can.

209
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,700
I know already.

210
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,820
Thank you.

211
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,650
Sill want to fight with me.

212
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,390
Lu Feng.

213
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,270
Lu Feng.

214
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,030
Lu Feng.

215
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,670
Helium.

216
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,290
Let me tell you, this is not counted.

217
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,170
What is not counted?

218
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,970
You're not counted as the winner.

219
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,610
I've already ran half the day.

220
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,130
Who's competing with you?

221
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
You did not compete with me,

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
then when I speed up, you speed up too.

223
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
What do you mean?

224
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,830
That's my normal running speed.

225
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,950
You're the one that's speeding up okay.

226
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,820
Can't take it.

227
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Let me ask you a question,

228
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,340
on the insider competition,

229
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,900
why did Huo Yao missed?

230
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,220
Is it to let you win, Zhao Yang

231
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,610
force Huo Yao to use such tactics behind?

232
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,410
My Brother Kong

233
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,410
left

234
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,370
because of the insider competition.

235
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,970
So everything

236
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,680
is Zhao Yang's motive.

237
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
Do you really not know?

238
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,420
Let me tell you,

239
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,500
so long as there's a day when you're around,

240
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,740
I'll will not let you live well.

241
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
Because of this,

242
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,300
so you hate me.

243
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,140
Is it I still have to like you?

244
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,380
Crazy.

245
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,620
No, where did you go?

246
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,380
Wang Bin and Zhao Yang

247
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,740
is clearing Ji Shuai's things.

248
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,220
I heard them say

249
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,140
they are throwing away Ji Shuai's trophy.

250
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,140
They finding trouble.

251
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,530
Oh no.

252
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,770
Throw those away.

253
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,650
This

254
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,570
and this.

255
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,530
Okay.

256
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,590
Especially this photo.

257
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,790
This.

258
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,710
What you doing?

259
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,350
Don't care about him, continue throwing.

260
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,430
Why?

261
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,630
Who ask you to touch my Brother Kong's things?

262
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,430
The person have left,

263
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,550
the things are just taking up space.

264
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,140
Lin Yi Xuan,

265
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,700
this is the company's decision.

266
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,440
Let go.

267
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,080
You dare to touch it, you try.

268
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,360
Lin Yi Xuan.

269
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,360
I only let Wang Bin

270
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,760
throw some trash.

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,320
Is there a need?

272
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,160
Wang Bin, continue throwing.

273
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Why are you beating someone up, I'm calling the police.

274
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm calling the police.

275
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,720
Heard that?

276
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,520
What are you doing?

277
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,270
Crazy.

278
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,910
What are you doing?

279
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,670
You try scolding one more sentence.

280
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,350
Pei Xi,

281
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,460
you're the leader.

282
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,660
This is how you lead your members.

283
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,460
He continue being like this,

284
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,740
I can call the police to catch him.

285
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,580
Lin Yi Xuan, don't be impulse.

286
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,490
You don't think I don't know

287
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,730
you together with him,

288
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,050
you work together to chase Brother Kong out.

289
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,370
Now you still want to throw his things.

290
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,610
Zhao Yang, you bully

291
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,570
till home already, do you know?

292
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,450
Lin Yi Xuan.

293
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,000
Things you're uncertain of

294
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,000
don't draw conclusion.

295
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,080
You..

296
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,630
are gonna be left out for a year,

297
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,190
go to the substitute side and wait.

298
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,030
Manager Zhao,

299
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,510
is there a need to be so serious?

300
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,150
I don't need you to say nice things.

301
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,340
Go be the substitute right?

302
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
I'll go.

303
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
Let me tell you,

304
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm least in need to support.

305
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,290
Pei Xi.

306
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,490
Pei Xi,

307
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,530
what are you doing?

308
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,290
I don't wish that

309
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,490
when I leave the Legends team,

310
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:56,850
all these will be

311
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,160
thrown away as trash by you.

312
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,120
No.

313
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,680
Pei Xi.

314
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,540
Manager Zhao.

315
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,060
They...

316
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,220
they...

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,300
are you fine?

318
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,620
Brother Nine.

319
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,500
I still want to drink.

320
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,060
I haven't finished drinking.

321
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,500
This way.

322
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,220
No.

323
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Oh my.

324
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,900
Okay, coming.

325
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,190
Are you crazy?

326
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,470
Call me out so late at night for what?

327
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,270
I've waited for you for an hour already.

328
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,750
If you still don't come, I'm going to die.

329
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,830
Continue.

330
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,350
I see that you're quite high singing.

331
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,430
You wouldn't die so fast.

332
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,350
Do you have humanity?

333
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,420
I'm already like this

334
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,500
and you're still saying those?

335
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,720
- You fought? - Pain.

336
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,840
Got beaten by who?

337
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
Sister will help you get revenge.

338
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
Got beaten?

339
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Today Manager Zhao's assistant

340
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,480
throw away my Brother Kong's trophy,

341
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,760
I beat him till he kneel and asked me

342
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,080
"Brother Xuan, stop beating"

343
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,920
"Pain, I beg you.

344
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
Let me go this time."

345
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,080
And then?

346
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,440
Main point.

347
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,040
And then,

348
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,990
and then I got

349
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,230
put into substitute.

350
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,390
This competition season,

351
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,590
I don't even need to think of playing.

352
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,820
- Are you dumb? - Pain.

353
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,420
Do you think

354
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
I shouldn't have fight?

355
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,580
Rubbish.

356
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,580
Take me a bottle of drink.

357
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,730
You're hopeless, dumb.

358
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,450
He throw them away, you can picked them back up,

359
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,090
because of this

360
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,250
you got changed to be the substitute.

361
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,920
-You're so dumb. -Pain.

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Why is it

363
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,800
that you and Qiu Ying

364
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,400
are so die heart for him?

365
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
He gave the both of you

366
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,270
what kind of medicine?

367
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,990
You follow him around like his disciple.

368
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,420
If not for Brother Kong,

369
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,660
I will now

370
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,020
still be suffering around the streets.

371
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,900
Sorry,

372
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,900
I'll treat this,

373
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,980
please dont leave a bad comment.

374
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,140
I don't care.

375
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,020
This is your problem.

376
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,500
You're late means you're late.

377
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,900
How do you expect me to eat when this is cold?

378
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,330
If you don't want to eat, don't throw.

379
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Lost your job?

380
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
What does it have to do with you?

381
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,460
Do you remember two days ago

382
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,220
at our The King,

383
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,900
we had a competition,

384
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,620
you lost

385
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620

I don't want to be a web carer.

392
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,570
Who asked you to be web carer?

393

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,900
You're so heavy.

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,540
You can't over drink me.

473
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,940
Lu Yi Yi, you can't over drink me.

474

Qiu Ying.

483
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,030
Why are you still holding on to the mike?

484
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,430

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,070

Who can't over drink you?

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,390
Reporter Lu.

491
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,030
I didn't hear wrongly just now,

492
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,630
did you call me Brother Kong?

493
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,110
In your heart,

494
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
am I not supposed to be the douchebag?

495
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,470
Douchebag?

496
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,350
Yes.

497
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,110
You're a douchebag.

498
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,350
Previous Sister-in-law,

499
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,750

500
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,420
still going around looking for girl.

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,180
You're no a douchebag,

502
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,300

503
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,060
She drank too much.

She mean nothing.

505
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,780
She drank too much.

506
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,780
I didn't drink much.

507
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,580
Previous Sister-in-law?

508
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,000
Going round looking for girls?

509
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,960
Shu Wen.

510
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,720
Lin Yi Xuan said it,

511
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Shu Wen is he's

512
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
previous sister-in-law.

513
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,280
Drank too much.

514
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,160
No, what do you mean?

515
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,200
Mean nothing.

516
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,080
Drank too much.

517
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,800
I didn't drink much.

518
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,200
Shu Wen.

519
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,030
Pain.

520
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,220
The gossip online about me and Sister Wen,

521
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,820
you still add on?

522
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
See how I'm going to settle you.

523
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,860
You see how I'm going to settle you.

524
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,460
No.

525
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,650
Its like this,

526
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,850
Sister Wen

527
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,530
is not onlt his previous Sister-in-law,

528
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,410
but also mine.

529
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,850
Sister Wen is my Brother,

530
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,970
Sun Ze Yi's ex girlfriend.

531
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,490
So everything that's spreading online

532
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,610
is all rumours.

533
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,690
You thought its real?

534
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,130
I finally understand.

535
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,490
No wonder,

536
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
you're so cold to me.

537
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,280
Since when I'm cold to you?

538
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Also, those said online

539
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,920
looks like there really is,

540
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,950
it's hard for me to not believe.

541
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,470
What if its real?

542
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,470
Then I'll have to

543
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
slightly avoid.

544
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,990
In my rumoured girlfriends,

545
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,700
the one that is most legit

546
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,300
is you already.

547
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,900
Make sense.

548
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,460
Lu Yi Yi can't over drink me.

549
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,660
Why are you so heavy?

550
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,780
Continue drinking.

551
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,090
Why did he drink till like that?

552
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,450
Come, don't press down.

553
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,490
I still want to drink.

554
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,690
What happen to your face?

555
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,730
Don't touch me.

556
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,560
I tell you,

557
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
don't touch Brother Kong's things.

558
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,400
I'll have no end with you.

559
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,440
No end with who?

560
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,640
Xiang Kong,

561
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,040
who does he want to have no end with?

562
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,000
No,

563
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,100
Coach Luo told me,

564
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,940
Zhao Yang and Wang Bin

565
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,980

566
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,060
he too angry.

567
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
He beat Wang Bin up.

568
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,580
In the end,

569
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
he got put to be substitute.

570
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
This rascals,

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,420

Yes.

574
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,140
He and Legends

575
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,100
still have two years of contract.

576
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,260
He can't leave.

577
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
Coach Luo ask me to talk to him.

578
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,140
Who knows he would drink so much?

579
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,780
I

580
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,570

583
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,530
Lu Yi Yi can't over drink me.

584
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,790

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,190

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,070
Lu Yi Yi looks good.

592
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,270

593
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,630

602
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,570
Is Lin Yi Xuan fine?

603
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,690
He's sleeping,

604
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,010
heavy like a pig's head.

605
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,890
By the way,

606
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,130

Rest early.

00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,030
Goodnight.

612
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,740
Goodnight.

613
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,490

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,800

617
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,480

621
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,420
I don't know.

622
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,340
Even if

623
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,980
Shu Wen is not his girlfriend,

624
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,140
he might not like you too.

625
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,820
I think he like me.

626
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,700
If not,

627
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,220
why did he try to explain?

628
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,940
If this is not liking me,

629
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,170

630
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,770

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,390

637
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,590
Ji Xiang Kong

638
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,110
you must wait for me.

639
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,990

640
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,590

00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,030

643
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,060
Too bad, wasted.

644
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,370
Still not asleep?

645
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,130
Preparing to sleep.

646
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,730
Goodnight, goodnight.

Leader, do you want to eat anything?

654
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,020

00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,580
Tong Long.

656
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,580
That's something human.

657
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,020
What you buy today, can.

658
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,020

659
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,180
I don't like meat bun,

660
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,740
next time get vegetable bun.

661
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,850
There's no next time.

662
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,850
Next time Tong Long don't have time

663
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:39,850
to prepare breakfast for you guys.

664
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:40,970
This time

665
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,570
he's going to have an hour extra trainig with me.

666
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,920
Ji Xiang Kong.

667
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,280
You're on purpose right?

668
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,120
Qi Yue.

669
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,560
Do you know

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,520

671
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,620
What are they discussing?

672
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,940
They said you're President Li's disciple,

673
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,340
and bully the new people.

674
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,940
Who said that?

675
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,940
Ask him to look for me.

676
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,820
Brother Qi.

677
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,660
Forget it.

678
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,140
Enough.

679
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,060
Hurry and eat,

Training starts from today.

683
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,170
Don't have pressure,

684
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,730
you're not any worst than anyone.

685
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,350
Leader.

686
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,790
I have something I want to ask you.

687
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,030
Before I come to the team,

688
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,590
what exactly happen to Ji Xiang Kong?

689
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,940
Why did he leave

690
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,700
after he lost the competition?

691
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,020
You really don't know?

692
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,000
What should I know?

693
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
What happen was

694
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,040
after Gu Fang withdraw its investment,

695
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,320
in front of the board of directors, Ji Shuai

696
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,240
command down.

697
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,400
If he lost the insider competition,

698
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,190
he will leave the team.

699
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,470
But the person take made a mistake during that competition

700
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,670
is clearly you.

701
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,260
Technical

702
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,700
the person that should leave is me

703
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,940
but Zhao Yang

704
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,020
wanted him to leave.

705
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,170
Moreover,

706
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,010
the only condition

707
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,850
for you to join to team

708
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,490
is to be the leader.

709
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,530
No choice.

710
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,330
Director Jin can only let Ji Shuai leave.

711
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,610
Who said that

712
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,570
my only condition to join to team

713
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,770
is to be the leader?

714
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,840
Zhao Yang have been emphasising to us.

715
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,160
This is the only condition you have.

716
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,750
- Morning Brother Xia Tian. - Morning.

717
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,510
Morning Brother Xia Tian.

718
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,270
Morning.

719
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,990
Your performance is not bad at pre-selection.

720
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,510
How is it?

721
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,660
Did you managed to get your Master?

722
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,780
Luo Tian really.

723
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,500
You say, you look good

724
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,340
and is hardworking,

725
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,100
I don't know what is he thinking.

726
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,420
But I'm

727
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,820
really not professional enough.

728
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,740
You're not professional

729
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,660
that means,

730
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,140
our Meng Yu Ren is not professional.

731
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,340
When he come, I'll ask him.

732
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,770
Don't, Brother Xia Tian.

733
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,210
I know you want to help me

734
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,250
but in my own profession,

735
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,970
I can't.

736
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,730
Even if you help me, its useless.

737
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,970
Okay.

738
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,840
You have some spirit.

739
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,960
Come.

740
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Tell me,

741
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
how did he reject you?

742
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
He told me

743
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,780
don't think of going short cuts,

744
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,020
if I want to be a commentary,

745
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,260
I have to go

746
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,020
and work hard toward that profession.

747
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,340
Saying this

748
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,820
might not be a bad thing.

749
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,140
Why?

750
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,820
This means

751
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,700
you have successfully

752
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,020
attracted his attention.

753
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,660
He thinks you

754
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,940
will work out.

755
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,660
So he is espcially strict

756
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,700
towards you.

757
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,300
Really?

758
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,020
Really, believe your Brother Xia Tian.

759
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,020
Okay.

760
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,500
Then I'll work harder.

761
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,660
All the best.

762
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,820
Yes,

763
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,850
If you have anything you don't know,

764
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,810
you have to go and ask Pei Xi.

765
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,290
He will definitely

766
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,850
explain to you.

767
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,410
All the best.

768
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,390
Pei Xi?

769
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,670
Why?

770
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,150
Brother Qi.

771
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,430
Don't be angry.

772
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,630
Ji Xiang Kong

773
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,030
think he have Sister Shu Wen to rely on,

774
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,270
he thinks he can reprimand

775
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,470
whoever he want.

776
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,670
Just now that thing,

777
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,870
wouldn't just end just that.

778
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,710
I tell you,

779
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,710
the meeting later,

780
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,630
the both of us shall not go.

781
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,790
See what can he do.

782
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,630
Brother Qi.

783
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,510
During this time,

784
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,310
being angry,

785
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,030
we would have

786
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,470
fall into Ji Xiang Kong's trap.

787
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,750
Fall into what trap?

788
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,540
He's against the both of us.

789
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,180
Can't you tell

790
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,940
he's isolating us?

791
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,780
He's smart.

792
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,860
Firstly,

793
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,900
there's an empty room he don't want to sleep in,

794
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,680
but he went to Lu Sheng's room.

795
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,520
Secondly,

796
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,880
he stand up for Tong Long today.

797
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,000
What does this say?

798
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
This means he want to make a stand,

799
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,160
if this continues,

800
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,480
Wei Teng

801
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,200
will not have a place

802
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,440
for you.

803
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,320
Okay.

804
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,720
He wants to play right.

805
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,920
We'll play with him.

806
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,040
Okay.

807
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,910
But

808
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,590
we have to look like we corporate with him.

809
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,470
Especially when in front of Sister Shu Wen.

810
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,470
Times not early,

811
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,590
let's go for the meeting.

812
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,340
Sorry.

813
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,970
Okay,

814
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,130
everyone is here.

815
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,570
Let's discuss

816
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,010
on the preparation of the Autumn competition.

817
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,810
Xiang Kong.

818
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,600
This time i have tidied

819
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,880
everyone's statistics from the previous match

820
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,080
and according to everyone's speciality

821
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,560
to do a training plan.

822
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,680
Sheng Hong,

823
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,080
your position have no change,

824
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,120
still the support.

825
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,200
Okay.

826
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,080
Tong Long,

827
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,190
you fight the up and down road with me.

828
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,390
Qi Yue,

829
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,830
you have previous gave

830
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,750
all the resources to Pei Xi

831
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,350
and still managed to

832
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,430
play such a beautiful statistics.

833
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,710
If you're not good enough,

834
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,740
you wouldn't be able to do it.

835
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,900
Juggling.

836
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,540
You can definitely go into the top three.

837
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,500
So,

838
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,540
you position have no change.

839
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,260
My position have no change?

840
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,540
Then who will be playing mid?

841
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,020
Lu Sheng.

842
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,340
You play mid.

843
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,100
Me?

844
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,410
Previously Lu Sheng as the Mid

845
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,890
often as one vs three

846
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,210
but he's death rates

847
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:21,970
are very low.

848
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,370
This is something not easy.

849
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,850
After Pei Xi left,

850
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,210
Wei Teng's mid

851
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,610
under definite damange,

852
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,560
there's is still a need to increased stress.

853
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,040
I think

854
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Lu Sheng can play mid.

855
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Then you should respect others

856
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,980
by asking for his opinion.

857
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,980
Not everyone

858
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,780
can play mid.

859
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,060
All eyes will be on him.

860
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:42,820
Lu Sheng,

861
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,300
can you take this stress?

862
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,100
I don't want to play mid.

863
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,820
Why?

864
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,140
I can't.

865
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,460
You're not confident in yourself?

866
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,660
Let's Brother Qi do it.

867
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,340
After Pei Xi left,

868
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,740
it's always Brother Qi playing it.

869
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,180
Everyone have trained till pretty smooth,

870
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
there's no need to change.

871
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,860
I'm of what standard,

872
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I know it myself.

873
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,690
Xiang Kong.

874
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,050
You want to change

875
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,250
Wei Teng's current situation,

876
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,010
everyone can understand,

877
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,150
but

878
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,790
the competition is round the corner.

879
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,550
Sudden changes in the position

880
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,150
I think its too risky.

881
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,310
Anything is,

882
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,310
Lu Sheng previously

883
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,670
have never play in this position.

884
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,750
Even if there is Pei Xi,

885
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,150
you cant guarantee

886
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,390
every competition to win.

887
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,870
Skill coorperation

888
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,310
is more important than

889
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,390
personal skills.

890
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,830
If you guys think that its too risky,

891
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,310
then we wil use a new method.

892
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,230
Try for a month.

893
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,030
After a moth,

894
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,150
we will decide

895
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,990
who to playmid.

896
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,910
How's that?

897
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,750
Okay.

898
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,390
In a month's time,

899
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,820
it will be decided.

900
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,500
Shu Wen.

901
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,700
Lu Sheng,

902
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,740
other than the normal training,

903
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,860
from tomorrow onwards,

904
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,580
everyday

905
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,840
you'll have to play an hour of basketball with me.

906
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,960
Basketball?

907
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,360
He can think of something like that?

908
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
What does this have to do with the competition?

909
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,880
Why not you let us

910
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,920
learn dancing?

911
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,840
You're the leader,

912
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,280
what you say is final.

913
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,480
See you tomorrow.

914
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:37,980
Hello Xiang Kong.

915
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,130
Brother Sun.

916
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,210
How's Ah Xuan?

917
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,450
I chased him away.

918
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,210
Asked him to go back and apologised to the team.

919
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,610
He can't do it.

920
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:45,650
Say what.

921
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,650
He want to remain on the substitute for two years.

922
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:48,890
Xiang Kong,

923
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,050
after you leave,

924
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,450
it affected him a lot.

925
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,770
He's now

926
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,250
just fallen hard.

927
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,490
His character is like that.

928
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,410
When he's reckless,

929
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,960
even a few cows can't pull him back.

930
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,640
Professional players

931
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,080
doesn't play long term,

932
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,640
you can't get the condition back.

933
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,080
This, you know it better than I do.

934
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,600
I don't want him to walk my old path.

935
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,880
I understand, Brother Sun.

936
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,030
I will go

937
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,070
settle Ah Xuan's matter.

938
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,390
Hanging up.

939
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,550
Faster.

940
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,460
Don't have to remove your shoes.

941
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,700
I'm telling you.

942
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,500
I still have to go out later,

943
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,420
make use of the time.

944
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,180
No.

945
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,660
You ask me here so urgently is...

946
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,620
Why are you still standing there?

947
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,740
You have a lot to say, hurry up.

948
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,540
No, Yi Yi,

949
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,290
the both of our development

950
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,090
is it a little

951
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,850
too fast?

952
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,330
I'm still not ready.

953
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,610
This is my first time.

954
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,090
First time?

955
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,560
Didn't you tell me

956
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,440
you're a computer expert?

957
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,080
What hacker?

958
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,000
You can lie about all this?

959
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,440
Hacker?

960
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,220
You ask me here is..

961
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,500
Check on Zhao Yang.

962
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,620
That day,the both of us

963
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,740
talked about it.

964
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,220
Yes, check on Zhao Yang.

965
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,180
If not, what do you think

966
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,020
I asked you to come to my house for?

967
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,300
I just want to check on Zhao Yang.

968
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,380
Lin Yi Xuan.

969
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,460
What are you thinking?

970
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,140
I'm not thinking of anything.

971
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,620
Say that one more time.

972
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,940
Don't do it. Don't hit.

973
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,620
You ganster.

974
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,380
You don't.

975
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,900
Don't do it.

976
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,220
I'll beat you to death.

977
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,070
Qiu Ying, she's not around.

978
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,030
I here to look for you.

979
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,550
Look for me?

980
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,990
New type,

981
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:04,950
free to try.

982
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:06,910
Free again?

983
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:09,630
Isn't your bonus in Wei Teng

984
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,940
a dollar?

985
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,260
This cup,

986
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,540
I treat.

987
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,180
Please,

988
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,540
even if my bonus is a dollar,

989
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,500
I can still afford to pay for a cup of coffee.

990
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,560
Not bad.

991
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,640
I'll just speak directly.

992
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,640
I looked for you today

993
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,400
is because of Lin Yi Xuan.

994
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,600
He beat someone up,

995
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,880
I can't help it too.

996
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:41,950
You're Legends leader.

997
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,030
So what?

998
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,870
He doesn't listen,

999
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,270
what can i do?

1000
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,190
About the members,

1001
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,190
no matter big or small,

1002
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,470
concerns the whole team.

1003
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,620
You're the leader,

1004
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,980
of course its related to you.

1005
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,300
Looking at Legends capabilities now,

1006
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,780
even if Lin Yi Xuan leaves,

1007
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,980
the next support

1008
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,740
can be found very quickly.

1009
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:03,610
That's different.

1010
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,250
Ah Xuan's knowledge on support

1011
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,170
is very clear.

1012
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,130
No exaggerating,

1013
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,930
our nations profession players

1014
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,130
he's second,

1015
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:11,610
no one dare to be first.

1016
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,410
You now change him to the substitute,

1017
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,730
during the autumn's competition,

1018
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,130
you guys have better

1019
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,210
chosen person?

1020
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,170
Even if

1021
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,640
he's as good as you say,

1022
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,280
a support that don't listen,

1023
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,280
is rather a substitute.

1024
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,240
Ah Xuan this person

1025
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,440
look like he have a bad temper,

1026
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,870
but he's not bad.

1027
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:31,990
He's heart is pure.

1028
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:33,350
Recently, many things happened

1029
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,510
in Legends,

1030
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,750
he needs some time

1031
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,750
to get use.

1032
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,070
Do you

1033
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,230
hate me like he does?

1034
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,860
Hate is too serious.

1035
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,780
I'm willing to take you as

1036
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,420
my most respected competitor.

1037
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,700
Do you really think Legends

1038
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,380
needs Lin Yi Xuan?

1039
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,380
You're the leader,

1040
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,290
how you arrange is your problem.

1041
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,210
I just

1042
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,330
telling you the truth.

1043
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,770
If you want to win,

1044
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,130
you can't not have him.

1045
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,330
Are you not afraid

1046
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,570
that I bring Lin Yi Xuan back,

1047
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,090
during the autumn's competition,

1048
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,680
you'll lose to me?

1049
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,400
A stronger competitor,

1050
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,440
makes it prouder when you win.

1051
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,800
No, why is it that today

1052
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,280
become you questioning and me answering?

1053
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,380
Still have any questions?

1054
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,260
Last one.

1055
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,260
How do you see me?

1056
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,500
A team with you is flawless,

1057
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:32,980
but

1058
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,500
only in front 6 minutes.

1059
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,420
Only the first 6 minutes?

1060
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,300
I haven't finished saying.

1061
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,660
After 6 minutes,

1062
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,620
you will have to see

1063
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,820
what kind of opponent you meet,

1064
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,220
if you unlucky,

1065
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,100
and you met me,

1066
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,260
you still

1067
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,580
last till the 7th minute.

1068
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,020
Crazy.

1069
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,370
I will prove to you

1070
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,290
that in this world,

1071
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,050
the only one that can defeat me,

1072
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,130
is myself.

1073
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,190
Drink water.

1074
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,270
How is it?

1075
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,790
Almost there.

1076
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,030
Want to check on Zhao Yang

1077
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,630
you have start from the videp.

1078
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,110
This is Qiu Ying's computer.

1079
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,790
If you can check out

1080
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,190
who hacked into her computer,

1081
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,670
then you can get Zhao Yang out.

1082
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:30,790
But,

1083
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,380
this computer

1084
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,860
have no signs of getting hacked.

1085
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,780
How is that possible?

1086
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,900
Then,

1087
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,180
that video that was faked

1088
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,180
is send

1089
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,400
from this computer.

1090
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,680
The person that send is not Qiu Ying.

1091
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,480
No hacking, then what is it?

1092
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,560
This kind of situation,

1093
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,320
there's only one probability.

1094
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,800
How is that possible?

1095
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,480
Familiar person doing it.

1096
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
It must be Qiu Ying's friend,

1097
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,910
for example you.

1098
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,590
What are you saying?

1099
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,670
No,

1100
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,950
I'm saying for example.

1101
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,230
I never say its definitely you.

1102
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,980
Wait,

1103
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,860
I think I know who it is.

1104
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,980
Who?

1105
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,130
Hello, Coach Luo.

1106
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,090
Lin Yi Xuan.

1107
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,010
Come back for training.

1108
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,090
If you're late,

1109
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:30,850
the next competition,

1110
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,210
I will punish you as substitute.

1111
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,890
I can compete again?

1112
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:36,650
Don't talk so much,

1113
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,530
hurry and come back.

1114
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:38,570
No, Coach Luo,

1115
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,450
I can't.

1116
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,920
What's the situation?

1117
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,440
I have to go back first.

1118
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,720
I'm leaving.

1119
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,120
You... Wait.

1120
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Lin Yi Xuan.

1121
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,030
Familiar person doing it?

1122
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,570
Cannot be.
