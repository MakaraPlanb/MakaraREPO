[Episode 30]

3
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,260
Sister Yi Yi, drink some coffee.

4
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,220
Cut this act.

5
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,370
Speak,

6
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,410
why did you ask me here?

7
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,610
Big problem.

8
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,370
What's inside

9
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,230
your bag?

10
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,430
Things that other can't see?

11
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,830
My trophy.

12
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,830
I thought its some heirloom.

13
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,710
You ask me here

14
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,510
just to show off

15
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,510
your trophy?

16
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,790
No.

17
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,630
Yi Yi,

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,070
you know many people,

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,750
can you help me

20
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,630
ask about

21
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,510
if anyone is willing

22
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,870
to buy trophies as collections?

23
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,670
No,

24
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,310
you pay plus your bonus

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,350
is not less right?

26
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,750
Are you crazy?

27
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,950
You actually want to sell your trophy?

28
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,220
Say,

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,380
who did you spend your money on?

30
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,860
No,

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,660
who can I spend it on?

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,540
My brother

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,900
got married in thr first half of the year,

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,340
I gave him the money

35
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,920
to buy a house.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
On me, other than my trophy,

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,720
I worth the most amount of money.

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Nobody can buy me,

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,440
why not you buy me?

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,320
I give you a 20% discount.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,800
Go away.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Then why do you need the money?

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,480
Did you

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,480
owe someone money?

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
I didn't own anyone money.

46
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,950
I'm rasing the penalty fees.

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,150
I want to leave this place

48
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,190
and go to Team Phoenix.

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,020
Relying on your trophies,

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,540
in which lifetime

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780
will you be able to raise the penalty fees?

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,060
Here

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,170
more or less

54
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,610
I still have some savings.

55
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,850
No,

56
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,450
I just don't understand,

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,570
what charm

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,650
does Ji Xiang Kong have

59
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,970
to let you not want to marry

60
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,290
and go to him?

61
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,850
I really don't understand.

62
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,370
No,

63
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,250
I still want to get married.

64
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,410
But now,

65
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,690
Yi Yi,

66
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,130
I beg you okay?

67
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,970
Please help me okay?

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,880
I treat you to coffee.

69
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,790
Xiang Kong.

70
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,230
You're back.

71
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,980
About Xia Ling,

72
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,020
don't give yourself too much stress.

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,020
I never expected

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,740
it to be so serious.

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,890
Now, he's like walking into the swamp,

76
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,650
the more he struggle,

77
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,810
the deeper he will sink.

78
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,050
Give him some time.

79
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,370
Slowly.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay, smile.

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Da Bao Bei is about to leave.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,680
Where is our

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Da Bao Bei going?

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,020
Somewhere far away

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,660
to see its new owner.

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
You sold him away?

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes.

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,780
No, this...

89
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,980
this is your favourite motorbike.

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,180
You bare to sell it away?

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,260
You can sell other things.

92
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,420
I have sold everything else.

93
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Lu Yi Yi told me,

94
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,130
Ah Xuan is currently selling his trophies to earn money.

95
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,370
No choice,

96
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,650
for Ah Xuan,

97
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,890
I can only sacrifice them.

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,150
Then

99
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,350
when we have money,

100
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,830
we'll definitely buy it back.

101
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,710
Fool,

102
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,790
even if i have nothing left,

103
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,470
its enough to have you.

104
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,830
Now the money raised is enough.

105
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,590
Tomorrow I'll go to Legends.

106
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,350
Come,

107
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,350
let's give Da Bao Bei one last

108
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,030
bathe.

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,640
Brother Sun,

110
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,360
let me accompany you.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
You accompany me?

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Isn't this the job of a sparring?

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
Come.

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

115
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,470
Let me restart.

116
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,470
Choose top.

117
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,070
Okay.

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,830
- I'll accommodate to you. - Okay.

119
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,430
The room is open.

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,540
Attack the leader of Hell.

121
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,170
Can't tell

122
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,410
you still have this strategy.

123
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,930
Isn't it better for you to

124
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,970
train pressure-resistant?

125
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,250
What is it?

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,010
What are you laughing at?

127
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,330
Nothing.

128
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,770
You'll know next time.

129
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,850
Let's go.

130
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,210
What a fierce play.

131
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,050
Not bad, Brother Sun.

132
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,010
Got caught by me already right.

133
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,410
Go back to the spring.

134
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,080
Coach Luo.

135
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,560
Take a seat.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,470
When Pei Xi left,

137
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,150
he told me

138
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,430
he want to go to your team.

139
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,390
At that moment, I didn't believe.

140
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,950
I never expected you

141
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,100
to build up

142
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,780
the team

143
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,700
in a span of a few days.

144
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,180
I just took this chance

145
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,820
to be determined.

146
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,420
Congrats.

147
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,420
But

148
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,700
you snatched away

149
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,500
my two general at one shot.

150
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,940
Coach,

151
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,300
no matter where,

152
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,900
we will never forget

153
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,650
we're once a member of Legends.

154
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,010
Xiang Kong,

155
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,370
look you guys

156
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,050
have a passion towards professional gaming,

157
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,850
don't have to get restricted by commercial

158
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,130
and can freely

159
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,680
fulfil your dreams.

160
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
From the bottom of my heart,

161
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
I feel happy for you.

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,320
Thank you Coach.

163
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,560
No need to thank me.

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
As a Coach,

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,640
I can only do this much,

166
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,220
the road after today

167
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,620
have to be walked by you, yourself.

168
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Brother Kong.

169
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,460
Coach Luo.

170
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,420
Why are you here?

171
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,300
What do you think?

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,380
Sign.

173
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,860
Why are you still dulling?

174
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,220
Sign.

175
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,490
Didn't you always

176
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,930
want to leave with your Brother Kong?

177
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,770
I haven't raised enough money.

178
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,410
Until you have raised enough,

179
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,150
the next competition season would be over.

180
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,510
I have already prepared the transferring fees.

181
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,710
Sign it.

182
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,870
Where did you get some much money?

183
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,830
You're not that expensive,

184
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,830
just a few motorbike's money.

185
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,790
You sold your bikes?

186
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
Are you signing it?

187
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,630
If you're not, I buying it back.

188
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,230
I sign.

189
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,600
Brother Kong.

190
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,760
Next time, I will

191
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
do anything for you,

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
go through water and tread on fire

193
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,510
with any complaints.

194
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,150
Enough.

195
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,830
Go back and pack your things.

196
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,110
Coach Luo and I

197
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,750
will settle the admin things.

198
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,460
That... Coach Luo,

199
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
I don't really know how to talk.

200
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,900
During this time,

201
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,980
I have given you a lot of trouble

202
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,620
and you have never blame me for it.

203
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,410
Although I'm leaving with Brother Kong

204
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,170
but

205
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,970
I will always remember your good.

206
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,050
I'm leaving.

207
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,560
Xiang Kong,

208
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,400
don't forget.

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,320
With you,

210
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
there's also my passion for professional gaming.

211
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,880
Team Phoenix,

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
don't disappoint me.

213
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,950
Don't worry.

214
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,430
Brother Sun, Qiu Ying, I'm here to report.

215
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,990
Ah Xuan.

216
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,830
This rascal,

217
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,940
sold your trophies already?

218
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,140
You guys know about it.

219
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,340
This Lu Yi Yi,

220
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,260
sooner or later I'll settle her.

221
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,620
Why are you here?

222
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,420
Inevitable clash between opposing factions.

223
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,180
I think so too.

224
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,090
This time the both of us are different.

225
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,570
I, Lin Yi Xuan,

226
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,170
is the official member of Team Phoenix.

227
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,970
You're at most just a sparring.

228
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
Even if I'm a sparring,

229
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm still better than you.

230
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,400
Youngster,

231
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,880
work harder.

232
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Strive for being the officia member

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
one day.

234
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,420
Don't be dis-hearted.

235
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,140
Okay, Ah Xuan.

236
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,540
There's 2 rooms here

237
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,380
that have already been packed,

238
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,540
choose one.

239
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,100
Where's Brother Kong's room?

240
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,420
He room is at level 2.

241
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,500
No problem,

242
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,540
I'll room with Brother Kong.

243
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,060
That room is mine.

244
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,060
Still have to talk about first come first serve basis.

245
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm already here.

246
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,490
You should

247
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,170
have some observations,

248
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,090
and more out quickly.

249
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,450
What's my relationship with Brother Kong?

250
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,050
We're brothers that goes through life and death,

251
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,250
you know?

252
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,270
You let him buy his bike back first.

253
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,710
I... this...

254
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,070
Ji Xiang Kong.

255
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,310
You say,

256
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,150
Is it me or him

257
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,510
that should stay in that room?

258
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,990
Brother Kong, I want to room with you.

259
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,950
You see he have already

260
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,870
moved in for a few days.

261
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,430
You just

262
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,630
don't cause anymore troubles.

263
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,830
Okay.

264
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,430
I, Lin Yi Xuan,

265
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,670
from today onwards,

266
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,350
will never take a step up level 2.

267
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,820
I'll sleep on the sofa.

268
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,180
Please.

269
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,780
Ah Xuan.

270
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
This two person

271
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,600
is enough to let us suffer.

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
Isn't it?

273
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,000
By the way,

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,040
recently, I've been looking for 409.

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,400
Pei Xi

276
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,760
have asked everyone in Meng You Ren,

277
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,080
there's really no one

278
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
that knows his identity.

279
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,040
Brother Sun,

280
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,870
then do you have any other suitable people?

281
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,350
Not at the moment.

282
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,940
Sometimes, Ah Xuan

283
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,340
talks without going through his mind,

284
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,540
don't mind him.

285
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,620
I don't mind.

286
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,260
What he said is true.

287
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,020
Actually recently,

288
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,330
I have been playing with Brother Sun.

289
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,450
I realised

290
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,970
actually me playing top

291
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,810
is not bad too,

292
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,690
I can aid other team members

293
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,530
at different position.

294
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,320
This experience,

295
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,760
I have never felt it

296
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,920
when I'm in other teams.

297
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,960
Don't play mid,

298
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,340
don't do 4 protecting 1,

299
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
you can accept it?

300
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,940
I want to enter Phoenix,

301
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,460
I want to change myself.

302
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Previously,

303
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,300
I purely thought

304
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,420
Ji Xiang Kong's tactics

305
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,700
are very strong.

306
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,860
But recently,

307
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,100
when he's at Wei Teng,

308
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,940
I saw a miracle.

309
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,820
Tong Wu,

310
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,060
Lu Sheng,

311
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,250
each of them

312
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,330
looks like they have changed into another person.

313
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,770
Xiang Kong just

314
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,930
dug out their potential only.

315
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,710
Yes.

316
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,910
So I believe he

317
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,990
can lead Phoenix,

318
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,990
lead all of us

319
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,390
towards world championship's

320
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,590
awarding stage.

321
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,230
You see how cute you were when you're young.

322
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,500
Only cute

323
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,500
when I'm young right?

324
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,700
You still kept this photo?

325
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,420
This.

326
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,100
Its father that kept it.

327
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,480
This is us

328
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
at the theme park right?

329
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,200
Yes,

330
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,680
I remember what is that called.

331
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Cycling in midair.

332
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,510
Half way through riding,

333
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,350
it suddenly stopped.

334
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,070
Its so scary.

335
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,390
I cried out immediately.

336
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,310
When you're young, you're really

337
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,790
timid.

338
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,740
Why are you back so early

339
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,780
today?

340
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,660
Tomorrow,

341
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,860
I want to bring our son for rehabilitation.

342
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,610
There's still many things to prepare.

343
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,370
Who's here?

344
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,410
So happily chatting.

345
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,850
Ying Zi is here.

346
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,810
What is she doing here?

347
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:00,810
Shu Min.

348
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:04,890
Ying Zi,

349
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,130
your Auntie Xia is back.

350
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,440
I'll go back first,

351
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll come see you on other days.

352
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,950
Sister,

353
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,430
didn't you say

354
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,750
you want to bring me to see your team?

355
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,990
If you want to come,

356
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,180
you can come anytime.

357
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,540
It will be now then.

358
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,100
Get going.

359
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Go out and have some fun.

360
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,180
Don't always stay at home,

361
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,940
it'll be boring too,

362
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,900
right?

363
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,180
I'll take good care of him.

364
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Beware of safety.

365
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,660
What?

366
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,170
Don't be so agitated okay?

367
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,690
What do you mean?

368
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,210
Didn't you say,

369
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,210
what do you mean?

370
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,610
What can I mean?

371
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,210
I just want Ying Zi to come

372
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,600
enlighten Xia Ling.

373
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
You don't wish to see our child

374
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
so depressed everyday right?

375
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,480
You see,

376
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
after Ying Zi come,

377
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,280
you see Xia Ling

378
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,440
smile more happily.

379
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,560
What have happened,

380
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,700
don't always put it to heart.

381
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,980
Let it pass.

382
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,500
What is there

383
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,260
more important than our child getting better?

384
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,460
You...

385
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,620
Right?

386
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,740
Next time she comes,

387
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,740
you have to let me know.

388
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,180
Defnitely.

389
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,980
Definitely.

390
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,500
I think this two

391
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,420
can take a look.

392
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,780
Look at Zhou Wen Jie's first.

393
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,220
He took part in university's league,

394
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,650
the results are still not bad.

395
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,690
There's a video of his operations.

396
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Take a look.

397
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,710
Be careful.

398
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,430
It still not bad right?

399
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,110
I'm back.

400
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,470
I brought a new friend.

401
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,670
My brother,

402
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,670
Xia Ling.

403
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,110
Hello Xia Ling.

404
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,710
Hello Brother.

405
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,510
You're Ji Xiang Kong?

406
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,870
Many people said you're

407
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,470
the master of deception,

408
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,620
but even more

409
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,780
say you're the professional industry's

410
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,220
cripple.

411
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,220
Xia Ling.

412
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,840
That's right,

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,560
I am that

414
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,720
legendary cripple.

415
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,760
By the way,

416
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,040
Xia Ling plays Iconquer too.

417
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Just nice, everyone's a pro today.

418
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,520
Why not

419
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,520
you guys can learn from one another.

420
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,960
Come one Brother.

421
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
Brother Xuan will leave you into getting points.

422
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,480
Come, sit.

423
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,600
Where's the fun playing with you?

424
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
A Support.

425
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,350
Looks like,

426
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,910
Xia Ling have a certain level of understanding

427
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,670
about everyone.

428
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,390
By the way,

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,740
this is Brother Sun.

430
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,620
Previously Kai Shi Zhe's leader.

431
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,540
One of the top 5 best player.

432
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,130
I want to play a round with him,

433
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,610
can?

434
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,010
You want to play a round with Pei Xi?

435
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,210
Xia Ling said before,

436
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,770
Pei Xi is his idol.

437
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,250
Pei Xi.

438
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,090
Can?

439
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,160
Play what w him?

440
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,120
He's the trainee

441
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,840
here.

442
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,120
If you want to play, play with me.

443
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
I only want to challenge the strongest.

444
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,110
Can.

445
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,950
I accept your challenge.

446
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
Indeed the number 1 mid.

447
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,680
I've learn.

448
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,220
Actually,

449
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,620
you're not bad playing too.

450
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,220
Losing to the number one mid is not embarrassing,

451
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,580
let's work harder.

452
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,900
You're the one that should work harder.

453
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,380
I'll work hard.

454
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,060
Do you guys think

455
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,780
Xia Ling's way of playing

456
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,180
is like someone?

457
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,460
Indeed alike.

458
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,100
No, why are you guys

459
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,420
keeping people on tenterhooks?

460
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,260
Once the mango is out,

461
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,980
after all using consumable goods

462
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,370
to keep your energy.

463
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,090
Using high damage at the start,

464
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,490
at the same time boost the skill

465
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,370
to press on the opponent.

466
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:05,890
This is

467
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,130
the same

468
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,490
as 409's

469
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,030
special thought.

470
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,310
That's right.

471
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,670
He just started attacking,

472
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,830
I already feel

473
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,430
there's a situation.

474
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,950
Wait a moment,

475
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,190
you guys are saying he

476
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,590
is

477
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,230
the national costume genius 409

478
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,670
that you guys are looking for, Brother.

479
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,750
I don't know what are you guys talking about?

480
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,430
I think Xia Ling is not like.

481
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,470
His operation level

482
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,030
at most can fight passer-bys.

483
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,220
This is already very well played.

484
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,180
Only look like 409.

485
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,260
Actually just now

486
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,260
when I play with him,

487
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,060
I only use 2 percent of my skill

488
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,780
and easily win him.

489
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,140
Boosting, boosting again.

490
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,160
I think

491
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,240
at most its only 409's

492
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,320
imitator only.

493
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,480
Xiang Kong,

494
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,080
don't go overboard.

495
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,520
How am I punching?

496
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
He still punch me just now.

497
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,800
I just saying the truth.

498
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,400
He needs to have an understand

499
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,200
on his own standard.

500
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,000
You think

501
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,360
you understand 409?

502
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,870
Didn't you lost to him too?

503
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,750
How do you know

504
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,390
the both of them

505
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,870
battled before?

506
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,100
Looks like I don't stimulate you,

507
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,340
you wouldn't admit,

508
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,260
right?

509
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Played not bad.

510
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,900
409.

511
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,020
He's really 409?

512
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,410
Xia Ling.

513
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,410
Sister, I want to go back.

514
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,370
Xia Ling,

515
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,610
are you willing to join Team Phoenix?

516
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,210
Not interested.

517
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,850
I will send him.

518
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,810
Slowly.

519
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
This is our

520
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
unexpected gain.

521
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,440
He send himself to our doors.

522
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,860
Xia Ling.

523
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,860
Whenever you're unhappy

524
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,700
when you're young,

525
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,260
you would always ask for ice cream.

526
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,340
Be happier.

527
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,690
I never expected

528
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,370
my Brother to be 409.

529
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,770
You played so well.

530
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
I know what you guys mean,

531
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
you want me to join the team

532
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,520
for me

533
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,800
to have something to do.

534
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,260
I bring you out

535
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,580
is to let you walk out

536
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,380
and not stay at home everyday.

537
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,460
That

538
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,500
I didn't expect

539
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,980
you to be 409.

540
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,620
Just now Ji Xiang Kong

541
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,060
invited you to join the team,

542
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,500
he's sincere about it.

543
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,740
You don't know

544
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,940
how hard is it for us to look for you.

545
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,060
You get Ji Xiang Kong to give up.

546
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,460
Sister,

547
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,100
you and them

548
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,220
is working toward championship,

549
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,580
pulling a unprofessional cripple

550
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,620
like me,

551
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,970
what's the point?

552
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,970
Xia Ling,

553
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,690
I disagree to you saying something like that about yourself.

554
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,370
Sister, you quite busy too.

555
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,290
You go back first.

556
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,630
Let me do it myself.

557
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,550
Xia Ling,

558
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,390
told you to not be so hard on yourself.

559
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,310
Let's take it slow.

560
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,750
You see that?

561
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,630
Now I'm just like that.

562
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,140
Hello.

563
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,500
How did the chat go?

564
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,860
I saw him

565
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,700
but look at how he is now

566
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,260
even if I came,

567
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,020
I might not be able to convinced him.

568
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,080
Are you sure he is the person

569
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Phoenix needs?

570
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,440
As of now,

571
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,240
no one is more suitable.

572
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
I don't want to miss him.

573
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,720
Since he's now deep under,

574
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,800
then we will let him see

575
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,760
some lights.

576
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,200
I want him to know

577
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
his meaning and worth.

578
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,790
What do you mean?

579
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,750
I want to give him a strong medicine.

580
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,230
Hello.

581
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,350
Xia Ling,

582
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,710
you amazing.

583
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,790
Brother, enthusiastic.

584
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,670
You are the legendary

585
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,510
sweep the floor.

586
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,510
You've hide too deep.

587
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,900
Exactly.

588
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
I say pro, I seek you to bring me next time.

589
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,420
Brother, this time

590
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
you're famous through the whole school.

591
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,180
Just now, someone

592
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
asked me for your WeChat.

593
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,620
Go to the school's discussion board to see,

594
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,940
its all the news about you.

595
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,620
Yes, Xia Ling hurry take a look.

596
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
Xia Ling from the basketball class

597
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,720
is actually university's top player.

598
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,720
Amazing.

599
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,400
Deeply hidden.

600
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,320
Never expected

601
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Xia Ling to be 409.

602
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,020
Its a waste not entering the professional team.

603
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,140
I heard he got injured

604
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,420
and no longer play basketball.

605
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,300
He was good at basketball last time.

606
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,060
What happen now?

607
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,060
By the way,

608
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
university number 6, Xiao Hei,

609
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,380
have contacted me.

610
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,220
He said he's willing to join us.

611
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,620
Then we'll find a time

612
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,530
to meet him.

613
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:43,770
No,

614
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,810
is it just him.

615
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,250
If not?

616
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,210
Let's just wait.

617
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,710
I believe Xia Ling

618
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,910
will come and look for us.

619
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,030
Let's eat.

620
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,710
Xia Ling.

621
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,110
Why are you here?

622
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,270
Come.

623
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,750
Just nice its time to eat.

624
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,430
Slowly.

625
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,350
Pei Xi, you're amzing.

626
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,470
Are you guys the one that

627
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,630
posted the video online?

628
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,830
This...

629
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,230
What happen?

630
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,270
This have nothing to do with them,

631
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm the one that posted the video.

632
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
What gives you the rights to do it?

633
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,840
Exposing that you're 409,

634
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,720
I apologise to you

635
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,400
but I'm doing this

636
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,000
is to let you know

637
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
you're not useless.

638
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm not useless?

639
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Now the whole school knows

640
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,920
my leg is useless.

641
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,400
Xia Ling, no.

642
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,470
Now the whole school knows

643
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,270
you're the one

644
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,670
that spend half a month's time

645
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,870
to enter university number 4, 409.

646
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,750
You have so much courage

647
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,190
to challenge Ji Xiang Kong and I.

648
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,230
409.

649
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,420
Xia Ling.

650
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
Actually, other than yourself,

651
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,900
nobody thinks you're useless.

652
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,140
Exactly.

653
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,500
We...

654
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,620
other than playing basketball,

655
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,180
there's many other things you can do,

656
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,050
right?

657
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,650
If you're willing,

658
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,130
you can excel

659
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,130
in all areas,

660
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,570
just like Iconquer.

661
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,010
In such a short period of time,

662
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,410
you enter top 4 in university.

663
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,210
You can play for professional competition too

664
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,330
and make the country proud.

665
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,410
Who do you think you are?

666
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,610
Is there a need for you to care about me?

667
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,730
Xia Ling.

668
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,010
That's right,

669
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,250
I'm just an outsider.

670
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,440
If you're not Qiu Ying's brother,

671
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,280
I wouldn't even bother about you.

672
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,560
Ji Xiang Kong.

673
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,350
Against your happenings,

674
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,470
if I said I felt the same,

675
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,670
you would definitely think I'm fake

676
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,790
but the guilt, self-blame and worry

677
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,790
Qiu Ying have for you,

678
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,340
I see it in my eyes everyday.

679
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,660
Ever since she know

680
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,100
you can't play basketball anymore,

681
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,860
you can't eat and sleep everyday.

682
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,140
Thinking of ways everyday

683
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,300
to make you a little happier.

684
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,260
Including your parents,

685
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,820
coax you everyday,

686
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,140
afraid that you might be sensitive,

687
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,020
afraid that you might not think straight.

688
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,620
In front of you,

689
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,340
even the world 'run'

690
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,300
they dare not mention.

691
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,780
Everyone do this,

692
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,290
is not treating you as a useless person

693
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,650
but to let you

694
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,170
face life positively.

695
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,650
Xia Ling.

696
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,920
You're already 20 years old,

697
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,320
do you intend to stay at home your entire life?

698
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,080
Pei Xi.

699
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,080
Take the depressed attitude of yours

700
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,420
to torture people around you,

701
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,780
everyone.

702
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,380
Or you stand up again

703
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,140
and use your hands

704
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,820
to get back what is yours.

705
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,420
You can consider it wisely.

706
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,420
Enough.

707
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
I don't need you guys to care.

708
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,540
Xia Ling.

709
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,980
Iconquer's transfer window

710
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,940
is about to close.

711
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,220
We are willing to wait for you

712
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,140
till the last moment.

713
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,050
I cause the trouble, I'll solve it.

714
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,530
Xia Ling.

715
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,550
Can you

716
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,110
stop following me?

717
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,030
About the video,

718
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,390
I apologise to you.

719
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,950
Who wants you to apologise?

720
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,470
This is my personal actions.

721
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,150
If you think

722
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,070
I cause hurt to you,

723
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,870
you can hate me

724
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,900
but this have nothing to do with them.

725
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,740
Then I hope you guys

726
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
can stop caring about me in future.

727
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,420
No,

728
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,600
I wouldn't not care about you.

729
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,920
Your sister wouldn't too.

730
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
The whole Phoenix

731
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,320
wouldn't not care about you.

732
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,720
Even if you guys are like that,

733
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,120
I wouldn't join Phoenix too.

734
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
No matter how much I want you

735
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,480
to join Phoenix

736
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,360
but

737
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
this is still your own choice.

738
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,920
I only hope now

739
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,680
that you can stand up again.

740
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,040
Your sister told us before

741
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,160
you were one a

742
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,550
sunshine boy.

743
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,950
But now?

744
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,390
But how I was once

745
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,550
have got nothing to do with you.

746
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,510
Stand there,

747
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,590
I don't want you to become

748
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,790
how I was like last time.

749
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,740
I just don't want

750
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,780
others to pity me

751
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,290
so I rather stay alone.

752
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,130
I'm afraid others will look at me

753
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,250
as a weirdo.

754
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,250
So once,

755
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,890
I also rather be alone.

756
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:46,850
You...

757
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,610
Who dare to say that of you?

758
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,330
Almost everyone that

759
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,290
have worked with me.

760
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,450
I never care

761
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
what others were doing.

762
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
Even during competition,

763
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
I rather off the mike

764
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,480
and listen to music,

765
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,560
I never communicate with my team members.

766
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,510
Even if others said

767
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,710
Pei Xi 1 vs. 9,

768
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,310
Pei Xi is selfish

769
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,230
and don't have team spirit.

770
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,350
I'm fine with anything.

771
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,060
But you still won.

772
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,580
You're the first mid player.

773
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,020
No,

774
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,300
I have never entered

775
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,740
the world's semi-finals.

776
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,140
Talk about being first?

777
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,460
Iconquer

778
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,260
was never

779
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,540
a solo sports.

780
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,730
I recently

781
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,010
understand this point.

782
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,650
So,

783
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,250
I regretted.

784
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,520
Regret what?

785
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,320
I regret

786
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,720
I once shut myself up,

787
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,800
I want to mixed with everyone

788
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
and have the feel of a team

789
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,800
yet afraid

790
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,420
those weird eyes people look at me.

791
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,580
I don't have the courage to take the step out,

792
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,420
also because of this

793
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,260
during my free time,

794
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,540
I dare not stay with the team.

795
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,980
I rather stay at Meng You Ren

796
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,460
and make coffee for strangers.

797
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,220
This

798
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,700
is my first time saying these out.

799
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
Because

800
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,380
I don't wish

801
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,060
you're like me,

802
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,450
covering yourself up tightly.

803
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,410
Actually, I'm jealous of you.

804
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,650
During your tough times,

805
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,750
there are so many people willing to help you.

806
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,390
So Xia Ling,

807
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,510
promise me,

808
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,230
don't reject the care others give you.

809
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,150
You are very talented,

810
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,590
Icoquer and basketball

811
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,870
are extreme sports.

812
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,550
We

813
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,350
who do extreme sports

814
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,030
are not willing to stop.

815
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,270
Then

816
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,230
why are you willing to go Phoenix

817
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,470
to be sparring?

818
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,260
What I gain at Phoenix,

819
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,820
I can never

820
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
gain it anywhere else.

821
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
What did you gain?

822
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,880
Want to know?

823
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,000
Try joining Phoenix,

824
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,240
find your own answer.

825
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,760
Is there any reaction?

826
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,120
Numb.

827
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,270
Be ware of your strength.

828
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,190
I know.

829
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,990
The acupuncture point we said last tim,

830
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,670
what point is it?

831
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,630
Tong Quan.

832
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,310
How many times have I said, can't you remember?

833
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,820
Why not you lie down and let me do it?

834
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,620
How many days have you practice?

835
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,740
You remember how many points?

836
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,220
You have no light and heavy,

837
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,900
by the time,

838
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,020
our son wouldn't be able to take it.

839
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,090
Our son is back.

840
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,570
Have you eaten?

841
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,050
Yes.

842
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,730
Our son is finally smiling.

843
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,190
Why,

844
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,700
still worry over Xia Ling's matter?

845
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,340
Yes.

846
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
I want to call him

847
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,220
but I don't dare.

848
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,540
I'm afraid it might affect his emotions.

849
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,980
Hope that Pei Xi's method

850
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,020
will let him stand up again.

851
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,460
Actually,

852
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,220
Pei Xi have a heart with passion,

853
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,660
he's just too good at hiding.

854
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,530
Yes.

855
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,490
But now

856
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,970
he don't have to hide anymore.

857
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,690
Through Xia Ling's matter,

858
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,930
I know a

859
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,770
different Pei Xi.

860
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,480
I believe he will shine

861
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,960
at Phoenix.

862
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,400
Whatt you mean is...

863
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,820
Xia Ling,

864
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,820
we miss you.

865
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,980
Wait til your leg recover,

866
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,620
we will accompany you play a match,

867
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,620
right?

868
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,460
Yes.

869
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,460
Xia Ling.

870
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,500
I know your

871
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,460
that sense of hate,

872
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,380
only you have it,

873
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,940
damn cool.

874
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,020
Xia Ling.

875
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,570
I know you wouldn't fall down.

876
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,810
In life where there's a competition,

877
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,730
go towards it.

878
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,610
Xia Ling.

879
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,170
Our class look up to you,

880
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,610
there's nothing you can't go over.

881
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,890
Xia Ling, look.

882
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,990
Look who's this.

883
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,110
Xia Ling.

884
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,750
That 1 vs 1, I've watched.

885
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,710
You still the same like before,

886
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,270
where there's you, you're the winner.

887
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,790
I don't wish

888
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,910
you're like me,

889
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,550
covering yourself up tightly.

890
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,060
Actually, I'm jealous of you.

891
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,380
During your though times,

892
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,420
there are so many people willing to help you.

893
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,080
So Xia Ling,

894
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,720
promise me

895
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,320
don't reject the care others give you.

896
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,310
I don't know if our son is awake.

897
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,860
Son, eat.

898
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,370
Dad, Mom,

899
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,170
I'm preparing to go back to school.

900
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,290
Going back to school?

901
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,850
Go back to school for class?

902
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,530
You guys

903
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,290
don't have to research on what

904
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,090
acupuncture point.

905
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,920
I will go to the hospital

906
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,160
to do recovery treatment.

907
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,680
You're thought through?

908
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,240
Hurry and have breakfast.

909
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,630
Let's eat.

910
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,710
You mom and I

911
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,710
will send you to school.

912
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,510
Son,

913
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,460
Mom will send you to th hostel.

914
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Just now I can explain to your friends

915
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,020
to take good care of you.

916
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,060
Its fine.

917
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,300
You guys will go back first.

918
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,700
I've already tell my friends

919
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,740
to wait for me downstairs.

920
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,740
You,

921
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,460
only know how to worry for our child,

922
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
for what?

923
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,060
If you're not used to it in school,

924
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,900
come back home and say.

925
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,860
Give.

926
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,660
What missing, let me know.

927
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,730
I will send over for you.

928
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,250
Okay.

929
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,170
I'll go first.

930
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,570
You guys hurry and go back.

931
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,010
I better send you,

932
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,960
this is too heavy.

933
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,120
Let him do it himself.

934
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
Xiao Ling can do it.

935
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,850
We really want that

936
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,050
Xiao Hei to come?

937
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,010
Why not

938
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,390
we wait awhile more for Xia Ling?

939
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,750
We really don't have time

940
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,990
to continue waiting.

941
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,830
Listen,

942
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,230
Ying Zi,

943
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,230
Brother when went back to school.

944
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,870
Your Auntie Xia and I

945
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,230
want to thank you

946
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,430
during this time

947
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,980
to enlighten your brother.

948
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,340
Its really hard for you.

949
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,580
This time Xia Ling

950
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,700
is really not coming already.

951
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,960
Okay,

952
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,800
let's contact Xiao Hei.

953
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,680
Xia Ling.

954
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,150
Xia Ling.

955
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,890
No, Xia Ling, you...

956
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,330
Didn't you go to school?

957
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,450
I've already arrange

958
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,570
with the school.

959
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,490
I have a question,

960
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,690
coming here,

961
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,050
will we be able to get champion?

962
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,810
If everyone works hard,

963
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,050
its possible.

964
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,650
