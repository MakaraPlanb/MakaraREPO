00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:34,325
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,350
Episode Twenty-Four.

3
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:46,975
This is so cool.

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,025
That's for sure.

5
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,225
They're all designed by my brother Sun.

6
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:52,800
This one. Look out!

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,875
Be careful not to break it.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,825
Brother Sun.

9
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,850
Qiu Ying.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,700
Yes.

11
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:05,700
Xiangkong mentioned you a lot to me.

12
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,500
I didn't. 

13
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:10,375
I am hungry.

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:10,950
Let me find something to eat.

15
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,625
Wait a second.

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,450
Are you a starving ghost before you were born?

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,175
I haven't introduced myself yet.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
No need. I know who you are.

19
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,700
You are one of the five ancient masters,

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,100
Sun Zeyi.

21
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,475
He told you that, right?

22
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,300
No.

23
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,325
I watched all of your competitions.

24
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,250
You are the leader and tactical commander,

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,375
almost like the soul of the team.

26
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:32,850
I am embarrassed by your

27
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,200
girlfriend's praise.

28
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,375
You guys take a sit

29
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,200
and chat for a while.

30
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,475
Let me cook something tasty for you.

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Thanks, brother Sun.

32
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:46,875
What are you thinking?

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,950
No.

34
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,450
No…Nothing. 

35
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,400
Show your competition analysis to me.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,600
OK.

37
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,750
Then.

38
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,000
Looks good.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
You have improved.

40
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,100
Well.

41
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:42,650
You look me like that.

42
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:44,600
I can't...

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,025
can't concentrate.

44
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,275
Are you thirsty?

45
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,100
Let me grab a bottle of water for you.

46
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,100
Yiyi. I am back.

47
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,475
You are back.

48
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,100
Come here.

49
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,150
Why are you so happy?

50
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:29,450
Well, I am

51
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,375
looking at your 

52
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,875
uploaded competition analysis. 

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,475
It's wonderful!

54
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,375
Already saw it in such a short time?

55
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,900
It has became a trending topic. 

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,150
Can't I see it?

57
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,175
But I just post it on Weibo.

58
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,675
How could it becomes trending?

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,350
Because, today afternoon,

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,400
Qiao Xin

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,100
also posted a competition analysis.

62
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:49,700
The netizens 

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,775
compared you two's papers.

64
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,450
They all say that

65
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,650
you are the better one.

66
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:56,750
Let me see.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,650
Here you are.

68
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,450
You see.

69
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,600
I guess this Qiao Xin

70
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,700
is blowing up right now.

71
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,125
Really.

72
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,050
Your competition analysis 

73
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:10,950
really

74
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,425
slapped her in the face.

75
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,500
Nice work!

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,100
Here.

77
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,325
This Qiao Xin,

78
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:18,925
all day long,

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,750
only knows how to put on a show

80
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,925
Actually,

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,500
she just hired a ghostwriter.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,050
She deserves a harsh slap on face.

83
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,675
ghostwriter?

84
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,975
Then.

85
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:28,825
That means 

86
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,075
all of these were not written by herself?

87
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,650
It's clear that Can is ghostwriting for her.

88
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,525
You see

89
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,300
the style and word choice.

90
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,975
It's Can for sure.

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,200
The reason why I am telling you this

92
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,625
is to remind you to

93
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,475
be careful of Qiao Xin and Can.

94
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,775
Right now, they work hand in glove with each other.

95
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,975
You need to be on guard.

96
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,450
I know.

97
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,075
But, right now, 

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,025
I don't have time to think about them.

99
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,250
Let them be.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,575
Right. Don’t think about them.

101
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,525
Here.

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,475
Are you hungry?

103
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,650
Eat a piece.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,775
After all, Zi Hai Guo is the best.

105
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:03,375
Let me have another bowl.

106
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,500
You just sit here.

107
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:05,875
I already prepared for you.

108
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,525
Let me take it for you.

109
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,375
Love you.

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,875
There is a package on the desk.

111
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,625
You just open it and take a look.

112
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:21,450
Here you go.

113
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,950
It's hot。

114
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,075
Move this to the other side.

115
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,125
Move. Move.

116
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,025
Here. Here. Here.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,525
What is this?

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,725
Tickets to Miya's new song release meeting.

119
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:34,775
Who gives these to you?

120
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,300
Miya gives them to me.

121
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,775
She gives to you?

122
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,850
At the final game of the Rising Star,

123
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,975
She asked me

124
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,150
to her meeting.

125
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,175
Also, able to visit the backstage.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Can't believe she really sends me. 

127
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:47,450
Hard to believe

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,275
there is such a good thing.

129
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:51,925
Then, when can we go?

130
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,800
Just eat. Eat first.

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,575
Happy. Happy.

132
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,350
Tomorrow afternoon five p.m.

133
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,075
Do you have time?

134
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I have a surprise for you.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,825
OK.

136
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:19,825
As for the candidate to cooperate Ads shooting,

137
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:21,800
why don't you consider Qi Yue?

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,125
In this season, he is the player

139
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,450
who won the most MVP awards.

140
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,000
Xiangkong is here.

141
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,675
Let me introduce.

142
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,350
This is our VNG's captain,

143
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,300
Ji Xaingkong.

144
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:43,800
Hello.

145
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,375
Hello.

146
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,650
I've been concerned about VNG's competition all along.

147
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,350
I also admire your tactics.

148
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,150
Actually, I am a fan of IConquer.

149
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,075
Hope there is a chance

150
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,625
We can play duo together.

151
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:00,025
It's my honour.

152
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,650
But miss Miya is so busy,

153
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,075
also you are a public figure,

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,675
you need to pay attention to your words and acts.

155
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,350
I am afraid your chances to play Iconquer

156
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,450
are very limited.

157
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,825
That might be the situation before,

158
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,700
but I already

159
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,925
talked with my agency.

160
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,325
My work focus

161
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,225
is transferring to domestic.

162
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,875
Especially the crossover cooperation with Iconquer.

163
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,700
This is what happening.

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,725
Miss Miya

165
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,250
endorsed lots of brand recently.

166
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,893
She asked to cooperate with our VNG.

167
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,850
VNG is my favourite team.

168
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:31,925
Hope I can bring better resource to everyone.

169
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,125
Ans let you be more focused on games.

170
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,375
As for the candidate to cooperate Ads shooting,

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
I hope it's Ji Xiangkong.

172
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,475
I don't know

173
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,675
if you are willing to.

174
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,725
Our captain

175
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,825
is your big fan.

176
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,400
He must feel overwhelmed.

177
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,050
Xiangkong.

178
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:02,850
Say your opinion.

179
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,525
Hope to corporate pleasantly.

180
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,900
Why don't you

181
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,450
say anything along the way?

182
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,325
Is it because 

183
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,550
my visit to your team

184
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:37,850
which makes your unhappy?

185
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,225
No.

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,525
I am thinking about other things.

187
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,150
Go back quickly.

188
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,525
Xiangkong.

189
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,800
I was too selfish before.

190
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,300
Only let you

191
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,875
cooperate with my career development.

192
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:54,825
But forget that

193
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,450
you are also at the career slump

194
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,600
and need someone's company too.

195
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,550
That won't happen anymore.

196
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,350
This time, I come back,

197
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,575
hoping to use everything I accumulated these years

198
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,725
to be your strong support.

199
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,425
Help you achieve your dream.

200
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,725
If two people want to achieve high,

201
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,550
It's not necessary to let one 

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,650
sacrifice for another.

203
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,250
What's needed are company

204
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:31,575
and accomplishment of each other.

205
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,925
Your success today 

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,050
is not because of me.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,775
So,

208
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,550
there is no need to consider compensation。

209
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,325
When I see you standing on the stage radiantly，

210
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,675
I know my decision at that time

211
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,175
was not wrong.

212
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,850
But I regret it.

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,525
The peak of my dream which I once thought.

214
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,425
When I really

215
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,375
get there, I found that

216
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,550
no matter how pretty the scenery is,

217
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:03,200
it's meaningless without your company.

218
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:09,950
Xiangkong.

219
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,900
Could you do me another favour?

220
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,125
Wait me for a second.

221
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,425
Don't leave.

222
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,125
Xiangkong.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,825
Do you still remember this guitar?

224
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:40,100
This Tylor

225
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,475
followed me for lots of years.

226
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,350
It looks old,

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,875
but the tone is perfect.

228
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:47,525
You see, 

229
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,525
could I make instalment payments?

230
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,625
Or I can work for you.

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,375
Tylor guitar!

232
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,000
Where do you get the money

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,350
to buy such an expensive guitar?

234
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:01,550
Actually,

235
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,100
it's not as expensive as you think.

236
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,850
It's a second hand guitar.

237
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,125
But the tone is pretty.

238
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,150
You listen.

239
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,350
It's tone is good indeed.

240
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,775
Just a little old.

241
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:12,600
It's hard to tune.

242
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
But don't worry.

243
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,500
I already learnt from the shopkeeper.

244
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,425
Later on,

245
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:16,675
before your every play,

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,100
I will tune it for you.

247
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:19,325
Then I need to

248
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,050
play this guitar throughout my life.

249
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,975
So you can be my

250
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,075
full-time tuner forever. 

251
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,175
How do you think?

252
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,425
OK.

253
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:31,700
You said 

254
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,575
you will tune it for me for a lifetime.

255
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Right now, could yo still

256
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
tune one more time for me?

257
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,725
OK.

258
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,725
Xiangkong.

259
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:10,750
Sorry.

260
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,475
I forget how to tune.

261
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,075
I am leaving first.

262
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,125
Xiangkong.

263
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,525
The monsoon blows to the sea.

264
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,975
Beyond the sky.

265
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,225
You think birds 

266
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,600
don't know tired, just go ahead.

267
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,250
And one day,

268
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:06,800
We both know we're in love.

269
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,425
Go back to the tree and take off your pride

270
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,650
Stay low.

271
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:16,250
The monsoon blows to the sea.

272
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,125
Beyond the sky.

273
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,850
You act wilfully.

274
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,600
To help Ji Xiangkong,

275
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,725
you persist to get that few endorsements.

276
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,700
What's the result?

277
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,050
Did he thank you after knowing what you did?

278
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,200
Not important.

279
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,850
I already made the decision.

280
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,125
Xiangkong.

281
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,075
How long he used to wait for me,

282
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:46,975
I will use duplicate time 

283
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,950
to compensate him, to get him back,

284
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,925
until he is willing to accept me.

285
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,950
Your characteristic of stubbornly insisting on your idea.

286
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,875
You will regret someday.

287
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:03,975
Didn't you choose me 

288
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,075
because of my insistence

289
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,775
at that time?

290
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,950
And company me through all difficulties

291
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,000
till this day.

292
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Tony.

293
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,325
Don't stop me.

294
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,250
Even it's a moth into the fire, 

295
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:30,950
Please let me crazy one more time! 

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,075
OK?

297
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,500
Miya.

298
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,425
Some people are not coming back,

299
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,750
even you are willing to wait.

300
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,625
Ji Xiangkong said

301
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:48,800
You two are 

302
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,350
not the ones before.

303
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,625
What's more,

304
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,350
he has the girl

305
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,925
called Qiu Ying besides.

306
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,475
Qiu Ying is just a substitute of me.

307
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,300
I can see myself in her.

308
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,175
So,

309
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,925
today's new song release meeting,

310
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,175
you arrange her to meet you at the backstage

311
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,925
to lay your cards on the table？

312
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,250
Tell her

313
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,600
you past with Ji Xiangkong.

314
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,375
Let her leave voluntarily.

315
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,825
Thanks.

316
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,725
Teacher Can.

317
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,600
I'm not the one who is petty.

318
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:47,700
We just

319
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,350
wrote a competition analysis.

320
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,750
Qiu Ying followed with another one.

321
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,975
You say, what she means?

322
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,700
Newcomer.

323
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,400
Try everything to come forward.

324
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,500
That's understandable.

325
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,475
But right now, people online say that

326
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:05,025
her competition analysis

327
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,825
is accurate and professional.

328
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,750
Instead, they say ours

329
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,650
is not up to standard.

330
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,075
What's happening?

331
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,050
My paper is not up to standard?

332
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:19,000
When I came to GDV,

333
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,850
she didn't know what commentary is.

334
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,425
I am not good enough?

335
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:24,800
Teacher Can.

336
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:26,000
Actually,

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
you don't have to be so angry.

338
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,050
It's clear that Qiu Ying

339
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,500
buy the compliments.

340
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,525
When she was in UXStar before,

341
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,650
she also did this.

342
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,225
She really likes to attack others 

343
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,175
to build up herself.

344
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:38,925
Alright.

345
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,200
Right now, this newcomer,

346
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:42,850
acts so disgracefully

347
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,000
before stepping into the commentary box.

348
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,075
I need to let her know

349
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,225
what is respect for seniors.

350
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,400
Teach her a lesson.

351
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,275
Thanks. You’re welcome.

352
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,400
Chairman Guo. Are you looking for me?

353
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:14,550
Take a seat.

354
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:24,950
Is the paper on Weibo

355
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,525
written by you?

356
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,150
Yes. I wrote this.

357
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,575
What's the problem?

358
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,400
There is no problem with the paper.

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,925
But Qiu Ying,

360
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:35,700
you are still a newcomer,

361
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,475
not that familiar 

362
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:38,475
with the situation of GDV.

363
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,475
We GDV can go so far to this day

364
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,150
relies on cohesion.

365
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:43,400
I don't want someone

366
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,125
to destroy the relationship between colleagues.

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,275
No. Chairman Guo.

368
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,650
I don't understand your words.

369
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,475
This paper was written by me.

370
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,225
But I am not destroying 

371
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:58,600
the relationship between colleagues.

372
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,225
Qiu Ying.

373
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,100
You can't be so eager for quick success

374
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:06,725
To show off yourself,

375
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:07,975
write paper to step on colleague,

376
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,450
how would others think of GDV?

377
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,375
Teacher Can.

378
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,125
I just made a conclusion on the regular season.

379
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't mean to step on others.

380
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:18,825
Alright. Alright.

381
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,350
No need to explain yourself.

382
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:22,775
When Qiao Xin's paper came out,

383
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,025
you posted another one

384
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,200
with almost the same angle of analysis.

385
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,550
It's too obvious to make it like a contest.

386
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,675
Internal friction，

387
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want to see this for a second time.

388
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,100
Do you understand me?

389
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:36,425
Chairman Guo.

390
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,050
Chairman Guo, the information you want.

391
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,000
I am sorry.

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,050
I just happened to hear 

393
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,075
your conversation.

394
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,975
Why I don't feel

395
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:49,725
Qiu Ying's paper

396
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,000
means to attack anyone?

397
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,450
Qiao Xin posted her paper.

398
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,925
So others can't post another one?

399
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:55,600
Do you mean 

400
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,200
Qiu Ying's paper

401
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,375
is better than others

402
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,475
which means to attack someone?

403
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,700
Chairman Guo.

404
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,050
Our GDV,

405
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,475
including interns,

406
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:03,900
has seventeen commentators in total.

407
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,325
If you want to stand on the commentary stage,

408
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,025
you need to show your true ability.

409
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,275
Moreover,

410
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,700
this paper of Qiao Xin

411
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,050
is indeed under the standard.

412
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,300
Can.

413
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,875
From professional angle,

414
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,200
what do you think?

415
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:20,350
Teacher Luo.

416
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,075
Everything you said is right.

417
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,750
Alright.

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,375
Don't mention this again.

419
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:28,500
Do your work.

420
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,825
Brother Kong.

421
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,650
You say, we are not easy

422
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,575
to take few days off.

423
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,050
Why don't ask Qiu Ying out

424
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,625
for things like Karaoke?

425
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,975
If you want to ask Lu Yiyi out,

426
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,025
Then do it by yourself.

427
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,050
Don't bother me here.

428
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,775
Who says I want to ask her out?

429
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,400
I am worried for you.

430
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,825
Pei Xi already confessed his love.

431
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:15,600
Secret Garden.

432
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,275
Isn't this the most popular 

433
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:19,225
confession restaurant online?

434
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,800
Are you going to confess to Qiu Yang?

435
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,800
My brother Kong finally grows up.

436
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,875
I am telling you. This is not easy.

437
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:25,575
Go away.

438
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:26,425
Help brother Sun do some works.

439
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:28,400
Don't close the web page.

440
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,525
This is really hard to book.

441
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,975
They only release the seats that night

442
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,175
at three p.m. everyday.

443
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,175
Do it quickly, or it might be sold out.

444
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,050
Stay aside.

445
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:37,925
Don't bother me at here.

446
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,575
One computer might not be enough.

447
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,475
Well, then.

448
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:40,950
Bros.

449
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:43,700
That Cheng Qimeng, Chai Haowei.

450
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,675
Today.

451
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,025
Whoever help my brother Kong

452
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,450
book the seats of Secret Garden,

453
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,525
free in the King for three days.

454
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,325
It's that OK, brother Sun?

455
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,600
I agree.

456
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,425
You see.

457
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:54,300
Captain Ji,

458
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,975
who are you dating with?

459
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,850
Is it Qiu Ying?

460
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,600
Tell you a good news,

461
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,850
teacher Luo told me that 

462
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,275
I can stand on the commentary stage.

463
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,450
That's wonderful.

464
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,775
I prepare a big meal for you at night.

465
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,525
This sour smell of love.

466
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,250
Go away.

467
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,575
Didn't you say that you are going to help me?

468
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,300
Be quick.

469
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,250
OK.

470
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,175
You scared me to death.

471
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,850
What time is it? You dare to be late.

472
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,075
Late?

473
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,350
I am not late.

474
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,300
Exactly half past six.

475
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,100
Neither more or less.

476
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:44,400
Anyway, you need to

477
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,375
arrive earlier than me.

478
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:49,075
What did you buy?

479
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:50,750
A present for you.

480
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,275
For me?

481
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,625
Let me see.

482
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,450
But you can't unwrap it now.

483
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,650
Why can't I? 

484
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,800
You can't unwrap it anyway.

485
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,150
Otherwise, I will be angry.

486
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,375
Let's go.

487
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:03,450
You haven't told me

488
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,500
what to see today.

489
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,775
Forget it.

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,932
Be quick. So many people!

491
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:09,725
This way. This way.

492
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:10,675
Isn't that the opening?

493
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:11,900
Don't care about this. Just follow me.

494
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,075
You stepped on me.

495
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,100
Ok.

496
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,250
Ladies and gentlemen，

497
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,350
good afternoon.

498
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,975
Right now, I am standing at

499
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:20,500
the new song release of

500
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,175
Miya's first domestic album, 

501
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:23,150
Beyond the Sky.

502
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,400
Be quick.

503
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,125
What's the activity?

504
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:27,925
Act so mysteriously.

505
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,000
Even let me walk in through the back door.

506
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,350
You can finally meet

507
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,350
the one you dream of.

508
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,825
Is this a big surprise?

509
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,975
Are you sure you know

510
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,225
who is the one I'm dreaming of?

511
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,525
Sure.

512
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,550
You see.

513
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,775
How is it?

514
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,300
You take me to Miya's….

515
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:04,475
Today is Miya's 

516
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:05,600
new song release meeting.

517
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,525
She gave me two VIP tickets.

518
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,025
We can also meet her at the backstage

519
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,250
and ask for a sign.

520
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,025
I am going out for a while first.

521
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:14,700
See how embraced you are.

522
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,800
Let's go. Go there quickly.

523
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,250
Don't be shy. Here.

524
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,125
Get in there quickly.

525
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:26,325
Xiangkong.

526
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,500
Why don't tell me you are here?

527
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:30,825
Or have you received 

528
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,150
my message to you?

529
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,775
Qiu Ying.

530
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,475
You two.

531
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,650
Have you 

532
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,050
known before?

533
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:07,050
Here.

534
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,375
Do you remember,

535
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,400
at the Rising Star,

536
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:11,450
I told you

537
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,925
a friend of mine

538
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:16,000
who likes e-sport really much.

539
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,950
He is Xiangkong.

540
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:20,900
Also,

541
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,775
we can say that 

542
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:24,075
we grow up together.

543
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,375
Right, Xiangkong?

544
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,150
Miya.

545
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,425
Let me introduce to you.

546
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Qiu Ying.

547
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,775
She is my girlfriend.

548
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,650
Xiangkong.

549
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,700
Are you still blaming me

550
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,450
for not holding on to our love at that time?

551
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,850
The reason why you choose Qin Ying.

552
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,325
Is it becasue

553
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,525
you see me in her?

554
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,725
Is it beacasue

555
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:35,425
she looks exactly like me five years ago.

556
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,975
Is it?

557
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,900
She looks like you indeed.

558
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,275
But…

559
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,925
Enough.

560
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,325
The love story between you two 

561
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,425
is not related to me.

562
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,475
Please don't

563
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:53,900
involve me in this anymore.

564
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,025
I don't want to be

565
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,325
the tool of you two

566
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,200
to test each other's feelings.

567
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:05,650
Qiu Ying. Xiangkong.

568
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,500
Xiangkong.

569
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,600
Give us one more chance.

570
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,575
Let's start again, OK?

571
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,850
Sorry.

572
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,325
I already have my loved one.

573
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,525
Qiu Ying. Hear my explanation, Qiu Ying.

574
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,175
Qiu Ying. 

575
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,675
Sorry.

576
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:27,625
Listen to my explanation.

577
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,625
You are Miya's first lover, right?

578
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,425
The song of Beyond the Sky

579
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:36,400
is for you.

580
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,950
Right?

581
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:40,900
The one who hugged her besides the pool

582
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,275
is not Ren Xu at all.

583
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,025
It's you, right?

584
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,700
Why don't you tell me?

585
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,350
Why do you embarrass me?

586
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:00,300
Qiu Yang. I am sorry.

587
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,300
But,

588
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,350
it's not what you think.

589
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,700
Why do you tell her

590
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,075
I am your girlfriend?

591
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,450
Who do you think I am, Ji Xiangkong?

592
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,500
You can't forget her.

593
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,000
Why still give me this illusion?

594
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,175
Let me think you like me.

595
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,425
Qiu Ying. I really like you.

596
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,825
I want you to be my girlfriend.

597
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,375
really.

598
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,600
But, I really can't 

599
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,625
trust all these.

600
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,325
Ji Xiangkong.

601
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:26,675
You can't forget her.

602
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,225
You make friend with me,

603
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:29,550
only because 

604
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,625
you see her in me.

605
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,025
I am just a substitute.

606
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Qiu Ying. It's not what you think.

607
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,325
Hear my explanation.

608
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:35,700
Release me. Release.

609
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't want to hear your explanation.

610
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Qiu Ying.

611
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:14,250
I am waiting for you at the Secret Garden.

612
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:16,000
Give a chance to explain.

613
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,625
Sorry.

614
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:20,275
The subscriber you dialed is power off. 

615
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:30,325
Sir.

616
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,525
Sir.

617
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:34,775
Your meal.

618
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,000
Should we offer it later?

619
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:40,050
Thanks.

620
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,125
OK.

621
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,475
Ji Xiangkong.

622
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:21,225
I believe you will definitely 

623
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:22,750
stand on the stage of World IConquer.

624
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,050
Then I hope at that day,

625
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:26,625
it's you

626
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,225
the one who stands on the commentary stage

627
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:29,475
to announce to the whole world

628
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,900
that our Chinese team

629
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,275
wins the world champion.

630
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,575
Deal.

631
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,900
Deal.

632
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:57,100
Thanks for riding me

633
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,000
through those dark days.

634
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,800
If this is written in destiny,

635
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,675
I hope I can hug you tightly.

636
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,525
Company you to the peak of IConquer.

637
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,100
Qiu Ying.

638
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:37,925
You need to pull yourself together.

639
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,725
Finish preparing this note.

640
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,150
Everything happened today,

641
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,675
just forget them all.

642
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,000
From tomorrow on,

643
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,450
it's a new day.

644
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:13,500
It’s so late. What are you doing?

645
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,850
Teacher Luo.

646
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:18,875
Why do you make yourself

647
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,675
like this?

648
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,175
Then, I am leaving first.

649
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,100
Wait.

650
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,125
I am taking you home.

651
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,000
Sir. 

652
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,650
I am sorry.

653
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,600
We

654
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,750
are closing.

655
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:02,250
OK.

656
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:07,525
Sir. Sir.

657
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,975
The deposit you paid

658
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:10,950
includes our restaurant's

659
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,450
special Secret garden cake.

660
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:13,650
If your friend

661
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,850
can't come today,

662
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,113
We can make another one for you next time

663
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:22,350
Thanks.

664
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,000
There is probably no next time again.

665
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,550
Always,

666
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,150
forget to

667
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:07,225
say thank you.

668
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,850
I like the bottle really much.

669
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,250
Sorry.

670
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,050
Teacher Luo.

671
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,625
Let you see me like this.

672
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:22,825
It's fine.

673
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,950
Everyone has unhappy times.

674
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:28,200
But

675
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,100
I still hope 

676
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,925
you can adjust your mood soon.

677
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:32,875
How crude the commentary stage is,

678
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,350
this time of you being an intern,

679
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,200
you should know in heart.

680
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:38,150
The playoffs later on,

681
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,425
If you can't do it,

682
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:40,975
I'm afraid you 

683
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:41,925
won't even have the chance 

684
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,150
to send information anymore.

685
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,775
I understand.

686
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:49,800
Teacher Luo.

687
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,475
Is here, right?

688
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,900
Thanks. Teacher Luo.

689
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:14,775
Sorry for bothering you.

690
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,050
You are welcome.

691
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I am going up.

692
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,325
Right.

693
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,025
This.

694
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:27,675
You take it.

695
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,225
Take the pills after going back.

696
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,250
If you really catch a cold,

697
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,775
then

698
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,450
how should you face the camera and the audience?

699
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,400
Thanks.

700
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,500
Good bye, teacher Luo.

701
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,925
Bye.

702
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:57,875
You are finally back.

703
00:38:58,525 --> 00:38:59,050
I thought you

704
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,400
have been abducted by Ji Xiangkong.

705
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,000
Tell me quickly.

706
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,750
What did you two do today?

707
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,700
What happened?

708
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,950
Why are you in a mess?

709
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:16,400
Give me your bag.

710
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,675
What happened?

711
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,550
It's fine.

712
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,300
It's rainy.

713
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,975
I forget to bring the umbrella.

714
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,675
Then what Ji Xiangkong is doing?

715
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:29,100
Let you be like this?

716
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,125
I am going to take a shower.

717
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,600
Qiu Ying.

718
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,375
You tell me.

719
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,125
Is Ji Xaingkong bullying you?

720
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,900
You tell me.

721
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,475
If it's true, I will teach him a lesson.

722
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:41,425
No.

723
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,825
Yiyi.

724
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,350
I am so cold.

725
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,875
I am going to take a shower first.

726
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,650
That's not right.

727
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:05,700
There must be something.

728
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,500
Hello. The great reporter Lu.

729
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,725
You are willing to call me.

730
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,450
Do you want to go out for a midnight snack.

731
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,050
What midnight snack?

732
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,225
I am asking you.

733
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,050
Tonight,

734
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,650
did your brother Kong

735
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:34,600
date with Qiu Ying?

736
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:35,775
Yes.

737
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,175
I booked the restaurant for him.

738
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:38,025
Secret Garden.

739
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:39,050
It's really hard to book.

740
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,750
That's a restaurant designed for confession. 

741
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:41,925
Confession?

742
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,700
Don't you know that?

743
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,400
Right. Right. How is it?

744
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,925
Did they have…

745
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Can your brain 

746
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,925
think something clean all day?

747
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,600
After Qiu Ying came back,

748
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,975
she was soaking wet all over

749
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,025
and in really bad mood.

750
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,075
I.

751
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,925
I saw her like that.

752
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,075
I was afraid to ask.

753
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,575
You say.

754
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:01,925
Did your bother Kong

755
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,375
bully my Qiu Ying again?

756
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:04,925
That's not possible.

757
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:07,175
My brother Kong is very gentle with girls.

758
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,675
How is it possible to bully Qiu Ying?

759
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:14,100
Is it possible that

760
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:16,475
Qiu Ying refused my brother Kong?

761
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,725
Qiu Yang likes him so much.

762
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,700
It's not possible to refuse him.

763
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,225
Wait. Wait. wait.

764
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:21,975
What? What? What?

765
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:23,600
Alright. I am not talking to you.

766
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,425
It's useless to ask you.

767
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:25,800
Hang up. Bye.

768
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:53,950
You are such a big boy.

769
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,225
Don't know how to take care of yourself.

770
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,850
Drink a bowl of ginger soup to induce perspiration.

771
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:07,900
That's why

772
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,750
Miya fell down on her new song release meeting.

773
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,550
Didn't you see the news?

774
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:40,450
It seems like

775
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,275
Miya won't give up easily.

776
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,225
Brother Sun.

777
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,200
What should I do right now?

778
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,075
Qiu Yang this girl,

779
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,500
although I only met once,

780
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:00,675
but I can see that

781
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,025
she is a person who 

782
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,464
can't tolerate the existence of any sand 

783
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:06,525
in relationship.

784
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,700
She doesn't listen to my explanation right now.

785
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,275
Right now, both of you need

786
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,375
to calm down. Calm down.

787
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:20,575
After few days,

788
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:21,475
the offplays will begin.

789
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,050
This is important for both you and Qiu Ying.

790
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,725
No matter think for yourself

791
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:28,150
or be responsible for each other,

792
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,800
you should all put your energy

793
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,900
on the offplays first.

794
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,000
But I hope 

795
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,725
you can adjust your mood soon.

796
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,750
The playoffs later on,

797
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,925
If you can't do it,

798
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:41,450
I'm afraid you 

799
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,475
won't even have the chance 

800
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:43,225
to send information anymore.

801
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:53,625
Hello.

802
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,100
I am sorry.

803
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,675
I know this call 

804
00:44:57,675 --> 00:44:58,900
is abrupt.

805
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,425
But I really want to see you.

806
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:03,375
Can you come?
