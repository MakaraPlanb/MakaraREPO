1
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,000
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:38,200
Episode Eight

3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,625
You want me to transfer to Legends?

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,824
Your contract with VNG

5
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:45,857
is about to expire.

6
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:48,075
If you come to Legends,

7
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:51,625
I will give the best resources all on you.

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,100
Make you the king of the IConquer, better than Gu Fang.

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,645
Today, I come with one hundred percent of sincerity.

10
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,025
As long as you like，

11
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,100
I can accept everything. Really.

12
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,500
Who will be the captain?

13
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,850
Ji Xiangkong?

14
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,750
As you say,

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,225
we can sign Pei Xi for sure?

16
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,550
Of Course. I handle this personally，

17
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,250
with your strength and prestige in the field.

18
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,575
That’s certainly not a problem.

19
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:24,875
Indeed.

20
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,900
Now, the star players who can replace Gu Fang is very limited.

21
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:29,800
True.

22
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,700
Then harry up.

23
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,250
There is one problem.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,078
He wants to be the captain.

25
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,550
It’s the only condition for him to get signed.

26
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:45,175
Chairman Jing.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
I think，

28
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:48,850
this Pei Xi，

29
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,975
no matter from ability, reputation, to development prospect，

30
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,500
is a hundred times stronger than Ji Xiangkong.

31
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,825
As you just said,

32
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,300
Pei Xi might be the next Gu Fang.

33
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,025
You don’t know.

34
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,151
This…

35
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,275
Ji Xiangkong.

36
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:09,275
When the news of him being the acting captain came out,

37
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,275
the crowd was booing.

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,825
People doubted us.

39
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:17,850
But, this thing about captain,

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,800
we already promised to Gu Fang.

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,450
As long as Ji Xiangkong

42
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:22,900
wins the new close beta test,

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,075
he will become the formal captain.

44
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,050
We can’t take our words back，right？

45
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:30,725
Chairman Jing.

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,750
Gu Fang has gone.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,250
We can’t take care of his feelings all the time,

48
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:39,699
influencing our team’s development and future. Right?

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,267
Instead of having Pei Xi as such a strong competitor,

50
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,000
it’s better to turn him into our man.

51
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,650
What do you think？

52
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,100
OK. OK.

53
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:56,300
Ok. President Zhao.

54
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,750
Just leave this thing to me.

55
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,675
Bye.

56
00:03:58,775 --> 00:03:59,450
Sister Xin.

57
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,198
Your coffee.

58
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:03,775
Thanks!

59
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,150
Today's temperature is quite comfortable.

60
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,125
It also tastes good!

61
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,950
If you like, I can buy you coffee everyday.

62
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,425
I just got a call from my friend in an advertising company.

63
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,075
They need to find a model to shoot underwear ads.

64
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,650
I remember you’ve done commercials before, right?

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
You should be quite suitable.

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Underwear ads?

67
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,325
Pay this much.

68
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,075
Three thousands yuan?

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,975
With only three thousand yuan,

70
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,275
how could I introduce it to you?

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,500
Right now, all the host in the company,

72
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,900
are about to transit to the IConcquer version.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,900
You should know the situation of Qiu Ying.

74
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,125
The ranking of her show has plummeted.

75
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,175
It is a rough road.

76
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:56,450
Your situation will only be worser, right?

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,275
I heard that your bonus has been deducted till next year.

78
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,600
I truly need money in urgent.

79
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,625
As the saying goes, no matter how close a friends is,

80
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,500
if she can't help you when you are in need,

81
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,170
then that's not a real friend.

82
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,350
Yanyan.

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,225
I am just a straightforward person.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,875
People who don’t know me

85
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,550
think I have a bad temper.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,431
But, actually, I'm very, very chivalric.

87
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,975
Well, you call me sister Xin, right?

88
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,475
If you have any trouble in the future,

89
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:37,025
tell me, I will definitely help you.

90
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,050
Thanks, sister Xin!

91
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,775
Not a problem. Don’t mention it.

92
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,200
Let’s go!

93
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,350
Using creator,

94
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,675
without extremely fast APM,

95
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,500
it’s almost impossible to complete this series of moves.

96
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,950
It seems like Summer’s cousin

97
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,975
is even better than Summer.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
I am Pei Xi.

99
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:37,800
What do you think?

100
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,400
Are you interested in joining VNG？

101
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,350
Why should I join？

102
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,600
Because you need a real strong team

103
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,475
to help you win the world champion.

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,925
If it’s because of Summer,

105
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,325
I don’t need.

106
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,325
I always let my work speak for itself.

107
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:03,200
I am not going to ruin VNG out of my respect for Summer.

108
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,325
True strength is not just individual ability.

109
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:28,175
After all, this is a team game.

110
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
So these years,

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,125
VNG always missed the champion, right?

112
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:00,600
So late？

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,525
Who is it？

114
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,075
It’s me. Yanyan.

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,275
Coming.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,325
Yanyan？Coming. Coming.

117
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,000
Come. Coming. 

118
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,775
Why do you come so late?

119
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,625
What’s going on?

120
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,125
No need to change shoes. Coming. Coming.

121
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:24,725
I… I had a fight with my boyfriend.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,175
Nowhere to go,

123
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,650
so I come here to see you.

124
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,625
He bullied you？

125
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,875
Why don‘t you call me？I can pick you up.

126
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,200
No worry, just stay with me tonight.

127
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:34,525
Sit. Sit. Sit.

128
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,050
Do you feel cold wearing so little?

129
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,125
Are you hungry?

130
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,375
Haven't you eaten yet?

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,775
Do you want me to cook something for you?

132
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,986
Fine. Just sit there.

133
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,111
I will cook noodles for you.

134
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,225
Qiu Ying.

135
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,300
I am sorry.

136
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,325
I have no alternative.

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Yanyan！

138
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,325
Do you eat spicy？

139
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,375
Sure.

140
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:26,200
I remember that.

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,650
Then, I will put more chilli in.

142
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,400
OK.

143
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,325
Yiyi.

144
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,925
You've been here for a while.

145
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,800
Your heart is still not calming down.

146
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:26,850
Director.

147
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,950
I, I really want to follow the news.

148
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,750
I have told you,

149
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,625
gathering information about competitors,

150
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,075
finding an unique view is enough.

151
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:38,100
This is also a skill.

152
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,275
But…

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,150
Besides, how can those breaking news

154
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,600
be reported by a small magazine like ours?

155
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,050
Oh my God!

156
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,475
Director!

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,350
There is a breaking news!

158
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,775
Pei xi’s main champion, Creator,

159
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,225
can pentakill three times at most in one game.

160
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:05,675
I have tried this champion’s abilities before.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,225
It can release enormous power instantly,

162
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,050
sunstrike on the whole map，

163
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,700
and kill low HP heroes anywhere anytime.

164
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,975
Such a powerful champion！

165
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,750
Or let me practice this champion.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,875
Come on you！

167
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,525
You are not Pei Xi.

168
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,500
I think I and Pei Xi will go fifty-fifty.

169
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,425
In terms of personal strength,

170
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,425
none of us is his opponent.

171
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,975
That’s right. So guys,

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,075
no matter who meet him,

173
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:31,150
don't think about anything.

174
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,525
Run quickly!

175
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,525
The best Mid.

176
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,175
I don’t believe there is no way we can get him.

177
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:39,525
There is a way.

178
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,500
As the best Mid,

179
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,675
a team with him is truly hard to beat.

180
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,675
But there is also one weakness.

181
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,525
You know what that is?

182
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,525
Brother Kong.

183
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:49,925
You know?

184
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,100
I don’t know. Come here see this.

185
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,125
Come. Come.

186
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,800
The second half of this video is fake!

187
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,175
Who made this?

188
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,500
What is this?

189
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:00,775
Isn’t this me?

190
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,025
Is me besides！

191
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,900
You were not there. This is not the actual case.

192
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,500
At that time, we…

193
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,050
Stop laughing!

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,450
The close beta test is about to start.

195
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,100
Uploading this kind of video at this time,

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,150
I'm afraid it's not that simple!

197
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,575
It makes sense.

198
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
Hey, Yiyi.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,550
Big sis, did you just wake up? Do you know what time it is?

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
I stayed up all night yesterday.

201
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,350
So you must don't know what's going on right now！

202
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,775
What happened？

203
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,175
Now, you search the keywords，

204
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,200
Ji Xiangkong, quickly!

205
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,400
This full version!

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,425
Who sent this?

207
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,625
Right now, people online say that you uploaded this video.

208
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,100
How could this be possible?

209
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,475
I was there at the hotel parking lots.

210
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,600
This is totally different from what I saw.

211
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,550
Different?

212
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,000
What do you mean?

213
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,175
I didn’t see Ji Xiangkong beating anyone.

214
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,350
How could this video…

215
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,700
Are you sure?

216
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:41,275
Think it over!

217
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,875
I am pretty sure.

218
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:45,825
At that time, Ji Xiangkong just grabbed Jeffrey's collar.

219
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,825
Then, it seems like someone tries to frame Ji Xiangkong.

220
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,683
It may not be a bad idea.

221
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,750
This fraud. He picked on you so hard before.

222
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,050
This is a self-inflicted result.

223
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:58,300
Evil people are trapped in their own sins.

224
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,650
What’s going on?

225
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,675
These netizens really goes too far.

226
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:09,850
See this one.

227
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,725
Qiu Ying, get out of e-sports community!

228
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,725
Don't come out and harm people again！

229
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
God!

230
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,325
It’s so mean！

231
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,925
What do you think of this one？

232
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,375
This one is vicious！

233
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,100
As expected,

234
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,025
director Zhao's action has such an extraordinary impact.

235
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:27,150
It seems like we’ve all reached ours minor goals.

236
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,325
It's mainly about working with beauty Qiao seamlessly.

237
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,775
But then again,

238
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,800
these netizens believe that Qiu Ying is the one to blame right now.

239
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,750
Director Zhao,

240
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,283
don’t you think this lesson

241
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,575
is too light for her?

242
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,479
Great minds think alike.

243
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,650
The attorney letter for her

244
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:00,575
has been prepared long ago.

245
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,450
Director Zhao, impressive!

246
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,125
Well, later on,

247
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,025
how about going out for dinner?

248
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,125
Right. We must celebrate for this!

249
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,900
Yeah!

250
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,050
But, today, director Zhao.

251
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,375
Aren’t you supposed to go back first

252
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,275
to master the situation?

253
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,875
Should I?

254
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,175
Yeah. Sure.

255
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,200
Come on. Let me send you there!

256
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,612
You are very welcome! Come on!

257
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,500
Director Zhao. Just say what's going on.

258
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,025
Chairman Jing.

259
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,600
What？What’s the matter?

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
Well.

261
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,450
Here we go.

262
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:01,375
The source of that video has been found.

263
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,700
It’s the hostess of UXStar

264
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:08,425
who had conflict with Xi Xaingkong and Jeffery

265
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:10,300
in the last live streaming, Qiu Ying.

266
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,375
Director Zhao.

267
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,275
Is this your guess or there is real evidence?

268
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,400
Chairman Jing. Take a look.

269
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,950
The IP address of this video

270
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,225
and the IP of Qiu Ying's online streaming

271
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:30,250
come from the same place.

272
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:34,119
I already confirmed this. It’s the same.

273
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,375
What does she want?

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,325
What's wrong with this person?

275
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,125
Does she has hatred against us?

276
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,500
My phone was blessed up at noon today.

277
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,925
Everyone came to me and asked

278
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:01,183
what’s the relationship between commander Ji and Qiu Ying?

279
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,800
Besides, it’s spreading outside

280
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,850
that… our commander Ji

281
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:11,100
played with the girls’s feelings.

282
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,300
Stop it!

283
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,375
Right, I don’t believe it either!

284
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,375
I remember that

285
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,875
you and that Qiu… Qiu What?

286
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:19,750
Qiu Ying.

287
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:20,375
Right.

288
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,825
Didn’t you play duo together before？

289
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,100
Yes. I trapped her.

290
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,200
That’s why!

291
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,750
You trapped her.

292
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,548
She definitely will revenge, right?

293
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,625
Maybe.

294
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,050
Well then,

295
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,950
let’s arrange a media conference immediately.

296
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:43,900
You apologize for the conflict in person.

297
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:44,675
And

298
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,525
clarify your relationship with Qiu Ying.

299
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:48,450
Xiangkong,

300
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,725
you have to protect your image

301
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,575
in case of rumor spreading.

302
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,575
Do you understand？

303
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,150
Everyone was there at the scene.

304
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,475
Why should I apologize for something I didn’t do?

305
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,400
And that video is obviously fake.

306
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:01,700
Director Zhao,

307
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,025
if you have evidence,

308
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:04,150
sue Qiuying directly.

309
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,525
Let her prove my innocence.

310
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,550
I think Xiangkong is right.

311
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,500
This thing should be resolved by legal means.

312
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,800
Otherwise,

313
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,475
it will only dig a deeper hole.

314
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,525
Chairman Jing.

315
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I have training.

316
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,400
If there is nothing else, I'm leaving.

317
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,500
Brother Xuan.

318
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,850
How is it? Is Qiu Ying?

319
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,825
It’s her.

320
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,075
I heard that the legal department has sent her the attorney letter.

321
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,250
Yixuan.

322
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,475
Do you think captain Ji and Qiu Ying have something…

323
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,400
I don’t know.

324
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm going out for a while.

325
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,075
I know who to ask for.

326
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,800
Brother Xuan! There are full of fans at the door!

327
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:49,800
It’s fine! I have a way!

328
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,375
Gosh!

329
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:02,125
What's the situation? So many people！

330
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,800
Whatever. Let me take a shot first.

331
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,475
Or I can trick Lin Yixuan that fool out

332
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,675
for some inside information

333
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:18,750
Brilliant!

334
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,200
Lin Yixuan.

335
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,125
I

336
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,100
Quick! Go! What are you doing?

337
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,425
Release! Release!

338
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:34,650
Are you crazy?

339
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,725
What?

340
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,800
What’s wrong with you?

341
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,825
What’s that look?

342
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,925
I tell you. I can’t bear this!

343
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:48,775
Yes.

344
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,900
The duo play before,

345
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,575
it’s Brother Kong’s fault trapping her in game.

346
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,475
But Qiu Ying’s revenge is unacceptable!

347
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,400
Wait a second！

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,075
Why are you yelling？Hands off!

349
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,625
What are you shouting for? Don’t fight!

350
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:01,700
What revenge?

351
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,525
My Qiu Ying did nothing!

352
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,350
Ji Xiangkong bullied people

353
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,250
and discredit Qiu Ying!

354
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,975
You tell me.

355
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,225
What revenge? Revenge for what?

356
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,175
Let me tell you what is revenge.

357
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,050
Speak!

358
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,925
I say…

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,225
Qiu Ying

360
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,925
want to ride Brother Kong’s coattails, right?

361
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,000
Not succeed, so she bites back.

362
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,275
This is revenge.

363
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,775
Dare you say another word!

364
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,925
You! You hit me again!

365
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,650
Today you! You ask for it!

366
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
Hands off!

367
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,150
Hide from me? Leave me alone!

368
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,025
Step on you!

369
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:30,875
Hurt, hurt, hurt!

370
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,475
You hide! Hide!

371
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,875
Trample on you!

372
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,075
Listen carefully!

373
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,500
My Qiu Ying

374
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,975
doesn’t give a damn about your liar brother Kong’s free ride.

375
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,075
She will never revenge with such an underhanded trick.

376
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,700
She's the kindest girl I've ever seen in the world.

377
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:48,250
If you dare to slander her again.

378
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:49,250
careful!

379
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:50,675
Be more careful or I will kill you!

380
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,375
Wait! You stop…

381
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,025
You! What do you want to do?

382
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:57,775
You even…

383
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,600
No! No! No!

384
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,250
I don’t mean it!

385
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,025
No! No! Don’t fight!

386
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,525
No! I have evidence, OK?

387
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,075
The IP of the video is the same as Qiu Ying’s online streaming.

388
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,450
What?

389
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,650
The lawyer of Legends just left.

390
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,875
Take a look for yourself.

391
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,025
The IP of the video is the same IP of your live streaming at home.

392
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,125
They provide irrefutable evidence.

393
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,050
President Liu. This is impossible!

394
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,900
This is definitely a setup!

395
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,075
And even if I want to,

396
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,350
I know better than to use my own computer.

397
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,750
But your explanation can’t solve any problem.

398
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:46,925
No. President Liu.

399
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,775
Please give me some time,

400
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,325
I will definitely get to the bottom of this.

401
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,775
To investigate what?

402
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,900
Right now, all the evidence points to you.

403
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,200
This had a very bad impact

404
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,500
on company’s public image.

405
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,275
You know what.

406
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,650
I really have no choice.

407
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,875
President Liu.

408
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,750
You… are going to fire me?

409
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,475
If we can’t solve this,

410
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,900
Legends will never cooperate with us anymore.

411
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,450
We are in transition.

412
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,550
Offending the best team in the country at this time.

413
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,425
If you are me,

414
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:17,600
what will you do?

415
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,825
I am so sorry, Qiu Ying.

416
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,475
I will ask the finance to pay your salary this month.

417
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,200
We pay an extra month for compensation.

418
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,800
Sorry, President Liu.

419
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,425
I’m sorry to trouble the company.

420
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,700
Sister Xin.

421
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Revenge after breakup.

422
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:12,725
She doesn’t know what kind of person herself is,

423
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,050
and whether or not she has the advantage.

424
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:18,425
I heard that Ji Xiangkong is not a good person either.

425
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,100
Birds of a feather flock together.

426
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:22,850
Perfect match!

427
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,425
Let’s go!

428
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:06,301
Captain.

429
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,676
You've come! Brother Yao.

430
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:10,800
Still practicing?

431
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,950
I am really getting old.

432
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,250
After only two hours,

433
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,250
I can't bear it.

434
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,200
You are the most hardworking person among us.

435
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,650
We should all learn from you.

436
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:26,225
Right.

437
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,400
How do you deal with that matter?

438
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,825
Don’t let it affect your performance in the close beta test.

439
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,325
Sorry.

440
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,125
Causing such trouble before the close beta test.

441
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,875
After Gu Fang retiring,

442
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:44,850
I am the oldest member of the team.

443
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,175
You know,

444
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,750
the golden age of professional e-sports players like us

445
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,150
is very limited.

446
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,125
To me, the chance of competition

447
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,600
is counting down.

448
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,450
Captain Ji.

449
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,850
The last hope of 

450
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,575
winning the championship in this life

451
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,225
rests on you.

452
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,100
You and that Qiu Ying…

453
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,375
Brother Yao,

454
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,425
there is nothing between us.

455
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:25,575
I promise to you.

456
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,875
I won’t let anything influence the competition.

457
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,475
Let me practice with you for a while.

458
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,325
Come on.

459
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:54,375
Now, the news about Ji Xiangkong is all over the place.

460
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,900
These netizens are really mean.

461
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:58,325
But it's quite right.

462
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,775
Ji Xiangkong has such a bad luck.

463
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,225
What bad luck?

464
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,825
Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you.

465
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,875
He deserves it!

466
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,100
The day has eyes, the night has ears.

467
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,125
Look at this netizen. He said,

468
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,775
you've disgraced the whole China IConquer.

469
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,975
The legendary team is in a mess now.

470
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,350
This thing is getting bigger and bigger.

471
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:21,000
I guess it's hard to end.

472
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:23,200
Hard to believe that

473
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:26,300
this Ji Xiangkong will fall into the hands of a woman.

474
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,275
Isn’t that perfect?

475
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,275
The game is coming in two days.

476
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,800
The worser their situation is, the better.

477
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,075
We can win in a breeze.

478
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Look at this man.

479
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,162
He said he is disabled during the game

480
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,712
and makeup by playing dirty afterwards.

481
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,700
And this one. This.

482
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:45,400
I was speechless after watching.

483
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,325
These netizens are amazing!

484
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,650
We're interrupting captain Pei's training.

485
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,550
The training room is not a place for gossip.

486
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:58,650
It's six o'clock. It's time.

487
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,375
Let's go!

488
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,050
Hot pot is my treat.

489
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,275
Bros!

490
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:07,025
We have training game at nine.

491
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,300
Four guarantee one.

492
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
We already familiar with the procedure, captain.

493
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,025
You just solo the whole game. Isn’t that enough?

494
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:13,400
Thanks brother Qi!

495
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,625
We haven’t eaten hot pot for a while.

496
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,100
Let’s go, Lu Sheng!

497
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:25,125
Captain, we will be back before the training game.

498
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:26,875
Let’s go, Tong Wu!

499
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,875
Don’t disrupt captain Pei’s training!

500
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,975
Drink. Drink. Drink.

501
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:37,850
No need. No need.

502
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,350
The video has been exposed for so many days.

503
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,450
The person concerned is still hiding.

504
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,375
We are the biggest sponsor of Legends.

505
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
We invest so much money. Who do you think we are?

506
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,350
Right. Right. Right.

507
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:50,700
President Bai. Xiangkong is playing the training game.

508
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,850
What training games are they playing at this time? Training game?

509
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,375
Not like that president Bai. This…

510
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,775
We are preparing for the close beta test.

511
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,650
Ji Xiangkong is the acting captain.

512
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,025
Who made him the acting captain?

513
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,550
I want a captain with an optimistic and healthy image.

514
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,375
This is Ji Xiangkong.

515
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:13,950
Trying to put on airs?

516
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:17,075
What’s your relationship with Qui Ying?

517
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,350
People online say that you

518
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,425
played with her feelings,

519
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,300
so she revenges on you.

520
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,675
President Bai.

521
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:26,125
I don’t have any improper relationship with Qiu Ying.

522
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:28,825
Sorry.

523
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,275
Due to my careless,

524
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,125
the team and everyone suffered great trouble.

525
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:33,550
I am sincerely sorry!

526
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:37,625
Today, I come here,

527
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:39,750
hoping to solve the problem.

528
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,058
How are you going to solve this?

529
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,600
What I want is to settle this down as soon as possible.

530
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,675
The video of me beating people is clearly fake!

531
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
We can ask the person concerned to clarify this.

532
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,575
I am afraid Qiu Ying will not…

533
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:57,425
I am not talking about Qiu Ying

534
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:58,575
but Jeffery.

535
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:00,875
Jeffery?

536
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,575
Right!

537
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,400
If we explain this, people might not believe.

538
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,775
If Jeffery is willing to explain this in person.

539
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,100
The video collapses of itself.

540
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:12,850
Yes. Beating him is fake，

541
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,575
but having conflict with him is real.

542
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,500
We already offended him.

543
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,875
Why should he clarify the rumour for us.

544
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:21,525
Am I right?

545
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:22,775
Jefferey is proud and arrogant.

546
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,125
If he knows that the public think he was bullied by me,

547
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,325
he will deny it.

548
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,400
And he's just coming to China these two days.

549
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,000
Is it?

550
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,775
Wonderful! Right?

551
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,700
President Bai. You may rest assured.

552
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:46,450
I'm sure to take the most sincere apology from our company

553
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,950
to Jefferey and ask him to clarify.

554
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,975
Don’t be angry. Easy. Easy. Don’t worry.

555
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:54,875
Will please you！

556
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,200
It is my duty.

557
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,225
Director Zhao.

558
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:58,900
My pleasure. You are welcome.

559
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,850
Close the door! Close. Close.

560
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:15,500
When will Jeffrey arrive?

561
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:16,150
Check it.

562
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,900
I already checked. Tomorrow.

563
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,900
Tomorrow?

564
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,200
This ghost in the machine!

565
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,475
Director Zhao. Do you think Jeffrey

566
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,925
will come out to clarify?

567
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,400
I don’t know.

568
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,775
What should we do?

569
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,675
Director Zhao.

570
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:40,950
Listen to me.

571
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,575
You arrange more training games for them.

572
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,350
If Ji Xiangkong goes to Jeffery,

573
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:50,075
do whatever you can to stop him!

574
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,800
Do you hear me?

575
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,175
Yes.

576
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,275
Let me escalated this online first.

577
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:04,875
After a month,

578
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:07,475
even if Jeffery comes out to clarify,

579
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,150
there is no way to settle it down.

580
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,850
Brilliant!

581
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,900
Director Zhao, try this new tea.

582
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,700
No. No. No.

583
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:26,800
It will be OK.

584
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,975
I am here for you.

585
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:29,925
Let’s wait for lawyer Chen.

586
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,500
There must be a way to solve this.

587
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,884
Who is that? Why don’t you check it?

588
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,050
Xia Ling.

589
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,825
Your little brother?

590
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:53,975
He is not my brother.

591
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,525
Even you're not genetically related,

592
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:00,900
he's still your legal brother.

593
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,650
Just check it. Maybe there is something emergent.

594
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,100
Sister,

595
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,625
I saw the blogs online.

596
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:19,425
Are you doing alright?

597
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,775
I am worried about you.

598
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:22,500
Dad is also worried about you.

599
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:27,000
See, your brother cares a lot about you.

600
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,550
Right, really care about me.

601
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,425
If it wasn't them,

602
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,775
I wouldn't be like this right now.
