1
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,340
You want me to transfer to Chuan Qi.

2
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,540
Your contract with Wei Teng is about to be up.

3
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,780
If you could come to Chuan Qi,

4
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,450
I will give all the best resources to you,

5
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,170
and turn you into a Dian Feng king who’s stronger than Gu Fang.

6
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,470
Today, I come with 100% sincerity to discuss with you.

7
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,030
As long as you’re willing, I will accept anything. Really.

8
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,510
Who will be Team Lead?

9
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,630
Will it be Ji Xiang Kong?

10
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,070
According to you,we can go ahead and sign Pei Xi.

11
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,430
Of course. I closed it myself.

12
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,590
Plus your reputation and power in the field, it won’t be a problem.

13
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,910
Indeed.

14
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,790
Candidates who can replace a star

15
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,830
player like Gu Fang are few and far between.

16
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,830
Yeah.

17
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Quickly get on it.

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,260
There’s one problem. He wants to be Team Lead.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,840
This was his only condition for signing with us.

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
President Jin.

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,800
I think that this Pei Xi,

22
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,880
regardless of ability or reputation or future potential,

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,720
is a hundred times stronger than Ji Xiang Kong.

24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
You said it yourself.

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
Pei Xi may very well be the next Gu Fang.

26
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,230
You don’t know this,

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,390
but once the news

28
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,350
of Ji Xiang Kong taking up the deputy Team Lead

29
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,270
role spreads,

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,180
the others will talk and think badly of us.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,060
But the matter of Team Lead has been discussed

32
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,140
and agreed with Gu Fang.

33
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,850
If Ji Xiang Kong

34
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,410
wins the new inner competition, he will join us.

35
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,610
We can’t go back on our word.

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,210
President Jin.Gu Fang has left.

37
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,850
We can’t keep on protecting his feelings

38
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,170
if it affects our team’s growth and future.

39
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,290
Am I right?

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Instead of keeping Pei Xi as a mighty opponent,

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,400
we should turn him into one of us.

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,230
What do you think?

43
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,710
Okay.

44
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,910
Alright, President Zhao.

45
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,350
Leave this matter to me. Bye.

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,820
Sister Xin! Your coffee.

47
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,460
Thank you.

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,900
Today’s temperature is perfect.

49
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,860
It tastes pretty good too.

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,340
If you like it,

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,740
I’ll buy coffee for you every day.

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,820
Earlier on, a

53
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,020
friend from an advertising company gave me a call

54
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,890
to ask for a model for a lingerie shoot.

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,330
You’ve shot commercials before, right?

56
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,410
You could be suitable.

57
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,370
A lingerie shoot?

58
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,280
This is your remuneration.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Three thousand?

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,000
I wouldn’t introduce you to a job

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
that pays a measly three thousand.

62
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,580
Now, all of the hosts in the company

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,980
are gearing up to the Dian Feng version.

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,860
You should know

65
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
about the Qiu Ying situation.

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,220
The show’s ratings have fallen through.

67
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,260
It’s a tough road ahead.

68
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,460
Your situation would only be worse than hers.

69
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
I heard that your prize money

70
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,300
has been deducted till next year.

71
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,780
I do urgently need money.

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,690
We always say that even the best of friends

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,450
are useless when you need help the most.

74
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,330
Those aren’t your real friends.

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,530
Yan Yan.

76
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,310
I am someone who tends to speak her mind.

77
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,950
People who don’t know me

78
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,590
think I have a bad temper.

79
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,590
Actually, I have a huge sense of justice.

80
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,270
I mean, you even call me Sister Xin. Right?

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,670
If you face any trouble in the future,

82
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,430
let me know. I’ll definitely help you out.

83
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,310
Thank you, Sister Xin.

84
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,910
You’re welcome.

85
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,110
Don’t be so polite with me.

86
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,070
Let’s go.

87
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,390
The Creator, without lightning speed,

88
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,150
will not be able to complete this combo attack.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Looks like Xia Tian’s cousin

90
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,700
is even stronger than Xia Tian.

91
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,260
I’m Pei Xi.

92
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,700
So?

93
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,500
Are you interested to join Wei Teng?

94
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,210
Why do I have to go?

95
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,210
You need a truly strong team

96
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,930
to help you win the world championships.

97
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,130
If this is because of Xia Tian, I don’t need it.

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,330
I’ve always spoken with my abilities.

99
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,930
I won’t risk the entirety of

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,280
Wei Teng because of Xia Tian.

101
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,460
Being strong alone isn’t strength.

102
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,420
After all, this is a team game.

103
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,620
All these years,Wei Teng has brushed the

104
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,300
shoulders of the winners.

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,780
So late? Who’s there?

106
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,340
It’s me. Yan Yan.

107
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,740
Coming.

108
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,780
Yan Yan!

109
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,860
Come in.

110
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,740
Come.

111
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,420
Why are you here

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,020
so late? What’s wrong?

113
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,900
Don’t change your shoes.

114
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,580
Come.

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,700
I -

116
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,140
I fought with my boyfriend.

117
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,220
I had nowhere to go, so I came to find you.

118
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,450
Did he bully you? Why didn’t you ring me?

119
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,450
I could have picked you up.

120
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,850
You could stay here tonight.

121
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,370
Sit. Sit.

122
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,650
Aren’t you cold dressed so thinly?

123
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,770
Are you hungry?

124
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,990
You haven’t eaten, right?

125
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,310
Shall I make you something to eat?

126
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,430
Alright, just sit there.

127
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,550
I’ll make you some noodles.

128
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,950
Qiu Ying.

129
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,270
I’m sorry.

130
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,230
I really had no choice.

131
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,000
Yan Yan. Do you eat chilli?

132
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
Sure.

133
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,080
I remembered that you did.

134
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,480
I’ll put in more for you!

135
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
Sure.

136
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,970
Yi Yi.

137
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,400
You’ve been with us for some time.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
You still can’t quiet your heart.

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,960
Director.

140
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,240
I really, really want to do news.

141
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,230
Haven’t I told you?

142
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,150
Reorganise the other

143
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,550
news and find a unique angle.

144
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,750
This is a skill, too.

145
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,980
But -

146
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,740
Plus, the headliners won’t fall to small

147
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,300
magazine firms like ours.

148
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,740
My goodness.

149
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,100
Director.

150
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,660
There’s a headliner!

151
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,770
Pei Xi’s Live Hero -

152
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,370
Creator can achieve at least

153
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,090
three 5-kills in one game.

154
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,490
I’ve tested this hero’s abilities.

155
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,890
Its sudden explosions are powerful.

156
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,730
It can release heaven fire on the whole map

157
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,520
and harvest blood heroes.

158
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,800
This hero is really so powerful.

159
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
Why don’t I train on this hero?

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,280
Enough. You’re not Pei Xi.

161
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,180
I think Pei Xi and I are 50-50.

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,340
None of our individual capabilities are a match for him.

163
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,740
Yeah. That’s why,

164
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,620
no matter

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,940
which of us will meet him,

166
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,260
we shouldn’t think of anything.

167
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,500
Just run.

168
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,460
The strongest single?

169
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,100
I don’t believe we have nothing against him.

170
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,500
We do have something.

171
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,620
As the strongest single, teams against him

172
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
have a hard time winning.

173
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,580
But there’s a weakness too.

174
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,860
Do you know what it is?

175
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,860
Brother Kong.

176
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,020
You know?

177
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,170
I don’t, but come see this.

178
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,290
Come.

179
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,930
The later half of this video is fake.

180
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,330
Who made this?

181
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,650
What’s that?

182
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,990
Isn’t that me?

183
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,230
That’s me next to you!

184
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,030
You weren’t there.

185
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,230
It wasn’t like this at the time.

186
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,550
At that time, we were -

187
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,230
Stop laughing.

188
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,630
The inner competition is about to begin.

189
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,430
A video like this being released now

190
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,630
isn’t as simple as you think.

191
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
That makes sense.

192
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
Hello, Yi Yi?

193
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,000
Have you only just woken up?

194
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,480
I stayed up all night last night.

195
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,640
So you definitely don’t know

196
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,880
what’s happening right now.

197
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,120
What’s happening?

198
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
Quick, search for the keyword

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Ji Xiang Kong. Hurry.

200
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Who sent this complete version?

201
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,340
So many netizens are

202
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,290
saying that you uploaded the video.

203
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,970
How is this possible?

204
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,210
I was at the hotel parking lot.

205
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,330
This is different from what I saw.

206
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,610
Different?What do you mean?

207
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,970
I didn’t see Ji Xiang Kong hitting anyone at all.

208
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,130
Why would this video -

209
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,040
Are you sure? Think carefully.

210
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
I’m very sure.

211
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,640
Ji Xiang Kong only grabbed the collar of Jeffrey.

212
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,840
Looks like someone intentionally

213
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,030
framed Ji Xiang Kong.

214
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,550
That’s fine. This liar bullied you before.

215
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,070
He’s asking for it.

216
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,230
There’s karma for bad people.

217
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,620
What’s happening?

218
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,700
These netizens are so mean.

219
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,820
Look at this.

220
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,940
Qiu Ying, get out of the e-sports industry.

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,780
Don’t harm anyone anymore.

222
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,220
That’s harsh.

223
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,860
What about this?

224
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,540
He’s completely over the line.

225
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,410
Indeed,

226
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,130
once Manager Zhao attacks, the results are amazing.

227
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,410
Looks like we’ve achieved each other’s small goal.

228
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,760
Most importantly, it was seamless working with you, beautiful Qiao.

229
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,760
Then again, these netizens

230
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,060
think that the culprit is Qiu Ying.

231
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,100
Manager Zhao.

232
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,100
Don’t you think that her punishment is too light?

233
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,740
Great minds think alike.

234
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
I’ve already prepared her lawyer’s letter for her.

235
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,740
You’re brilliant, Manager Zhao.

236
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,460
Ah, yes. If you’re free,

237
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,690
shall we go for a meal later?

238
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,570
Of course. This is a cause for celebration.

239
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,570
Yeah.

240
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,810
But, Manager Zhao,

241
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,910
shouldn’t you head back to control the situation today?

242
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,390
Should I?

243
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,710
Yeah, you’re right.

244
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,630
I’ll send you back.

245
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,110
Don’t be so polite. Let’s go.

246
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,230
Manager Zhao.

247
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,190
What is it? Spit it out.

248
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,820
President Jin.

249
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,500
What happened?

250
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,700
Well -

251
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,340
It’s like this.

252
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,360
I’ve found the source of that internet video.

253
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,520
It’s the female host of You Xing,

254
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
the one who live streamed

255
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,200
Ji Xiang Kong and Jeffrey’s fight. Qiu Ying.

256
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,200
Manager Zhao.

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Is this your guess, or is it backed by evidence?

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,430
Take a look, President Jin.

259
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,070
The video’s IP address

260
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,340
and Qiu Ying’s live stream IP address are the same.

261
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,140
I’ve confirmed it. They’re the same.

262
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,300
What does she want? What’s wrong with her?

263
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,290
Does she have something against us?

264
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,570
My phone has been exploding with calls today.

265
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,810
Everyone’s asking me

266
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,400
what relationship Mr Ji and Qiu Ying have.

267
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,280
Plus, it’s heavily rumored outside that our Mr Ji

268
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,430
has played with her feelings.

269
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,750
Stop.

270
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,670
I didn’t believe it.

271
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,150
I remember you and Qiu -

272
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,070
Qiu what?

273
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,030
Qiu Ying.

274
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,940
Yeah.

275
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,380
Haven’t you played doubles with her?

276
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah. I brought her down.

277
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,500
No wonder.

278
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,260
You brought her down.

279
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,100
She would take revenge, right?

280
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,780
Perhaps

281
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,650
Look. We’ll arrange for a press conference.

282
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,370
Apologise for the scuffle.

283
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,130
Also, clarify your relationship with Qiu Ying.

284
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,080
Xiang Kong, you have to protect your image against rumors.

285
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Understood?

286
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
Everyone was present.

287
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,280
I didn’t hit anyone. Why apologise?

288
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,060
Plus, the video was clearly falsified.

289
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,540
If you have proof, Manager Zhao,

290
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,740
then sue Qiu Ying.

291
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,140
Let her prove my innocence.

292
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,180
I think Xiang Kong is right.

293
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,780
These issues should be solved by the law.

294
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,420
Otherwise, it’ll get more complicated.

295
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,300
President Jin.

296
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,420
I still need to go practice.

297
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,940
If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.

298
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,300
Brother Xuan.

299
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,820
How was it?

300
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,780
Was it Qiu Ying?

301
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,740
Yeah.

302
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,930
I heard that Legal has sent her a lawyer’s letter.

303
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,170
Yi Xuan.

304
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,650
Don’t you think that Ji and Qiu Ying

305
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,330
are a little -

306
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,350
I don’t know.

307
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,830
I’m going outside. I know who to ask.

308
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,750
Brother Xuan. It’s full of fans outside.

309
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,910
I have a plan.

310
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,830
My goodness.

311
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,310
What’s happening?So many people.

312
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,790
No matter what, let me take a shot first.

313
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,260
I should somehow get Lin Yi Xuan

314
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,740
outside for some insider news.

315
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Clever.

316
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,520
Lin Yi Xuan.

317
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,440
I -

318
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
-Let’s go. -What?

319
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Let go!

320
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,000
Are you crazy?

321
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,150
No.

322
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,270
Are you crazy? What expression is that?

323
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,350
Let me tell you. I can’t take this anymore.

324
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,230
Yes.

325
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,390
Before, during the doubles,

326
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,020
it was Brother Kong’s fault for disconnecting.

327
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,020
But why would Qiu Ying take revenge like this?

328
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,580
Wait. -Why are you yelling? -Don’t push.

329
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,010
-Why are you yelling? -Don’t touch me.

330
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,170
What revenge? Our Qiu Ying did nothing of the sort.

331
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,170
Ji Xiang Kong bullied her,

332
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,850
and now he wants to frame her too?

333
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,730
Tell me. What revenge? What revenge?

334
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,850
Let me tell you what revenge is.

335
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,570
Tell me.

336
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,530
I’ll tell you. Qiu Ying wanted to use Brother Kong.

337
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,880
When she failed, she took revenge. That’s revenge.

338
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Try saying it one more time.

339
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,800
Stop hitting me!

340
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,880
Today, you’re asking for it.

341
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,760
Don’t hit me.

342
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,760
-Stop hiding! -Stop hitting me!

343
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,760
-Stomp! -Ouch!

344
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,750
Ouch!

345
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,270
Stop hiding!

346
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,590
I’ll stomp on you!

347
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,390
Listen up. Our Qiu Ying doesn’t want to rely

348
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,470
on your liar Brother Kong!

349
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,620
She definitely won’t use these

350
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,980
stupid methods to take revenge.

351
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,620
She’s the kindest girl I’ve ever seen in this whole world.

352
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,060
If you dare to slander her again, watch out.

353
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,820
I might kill you!

354
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,340
Stand there!

355
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,980
What are you doing?

356
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,540
You -

357
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,420
No -

358
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,220
I didn’t mean that.

359
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,250
Don’t hit me.

360
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,530
No. I have proof, okay?

361
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,650
The IP address of the video uploader

362
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,130
is Qiu Ying’s live stream IP address.

363
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,290
What?

364
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,760
Chuan Qi’s lawyer has just left.

365
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,200
Look at it yourself.

366
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,700
The video uploading IP address

367
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,460
is the live stream IP address at your place.

368
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,060
They’ve got iron-clad proof.

369
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,540
That’s impossible, President Liu.

370
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,980
This is a setup.

371
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,500
Plus, even if I wanted to,

372
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,660
I wouldn’t be stupid enough to use my own computer.

373
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,220
You saying this doesn’t help solve the issue.

374
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,780
No, President Liu. Give me some time.

375
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,650
I’ll get to the bottom of this.

376
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,170
What’s there to check? All evidence points to you.

377
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,050
This is creating a very bad image of our company.

378
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,530
Do you understand? I am at my wit’s end.

379
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,430
President Liu.

380
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,510
You’re -

381
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,070
firing me?

382
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,030
If we don’t resolve this issue,

383
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,390
Chuan Qi will never work with us again.

384
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,910
We’re restructuring,

385
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,110
and we offend the strongest team in the mainland?

386
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,590
If you were me, what would you do?

387
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,510
I’m sorry, Qiu Ying.

388
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,150
I’ll ask Finance to send you this month’s salary.

389
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,710
We’ll throw in a month of severance.

390
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,100
I’m sorry, President Liu.

391
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,900
I’ve caused trouble for the company.

392
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,430
Sister Xin.

393
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,430
Taking revenge when dumped.

394
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,740
She doesn’t know what she looks like,

395
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,020
or if she has the capital.

396
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,380
I heard that Ji Xiang Kong isn’t a good person.

397
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,890
Birds of a feather. A perfect match.

398
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,770
Let’s go.

399
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,660
Captain.

400
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,900
You’re here, Brother Kui.

401
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,100
You’re practising.

402
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,260
I’m getting old.

403
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
I couldn’t take it after only two hours.

404
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,690
You’re the hardest worker amongst all of us.

405
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,170
We should all learn from you.

406
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,730
Oh, yes.

407
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,810
How did your problem go?

408
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,090
Don’t let it affect

409
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,360
your inner competition participation.

410
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,680
Sorry.

411
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,560
I’m causing trouble before the competition.

412
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,140
Ever since Gu Fang left,

413
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,380
I’m the oldest in the team.

414
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,620
You know, people like us

415
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,140
are in the golden age of professional e-sports players.

416
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,900
It only lasts a few years.

417
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,580
For me, it’s one fewer

418
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,260
competition every time I join one.

419
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,180
Ji.

420
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,380
I’m putting my life’s final hope to win

421
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,010
entirely upon you.

422
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,770
You and Qiu Ying -

423
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,290
Brother Kui.

424
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,310
There’s nothing between us.

425
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,230
I promise you

426
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,830
that I won’t let anything affect the competition.

427
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,430
Let me train with you.

428
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,190
Let's do it.

429
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,420
Ji Xiang Kong’s news are everywhere.

430
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,780
These netizens are so vicious.

431
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,300
But they’re right.

432
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
Ji Xiang Kong is so unlucky.

433
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,200
Unlucky?

434
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
If he didn’t ask for it, this wouldn’t have happened.

435
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
He asked for it.

436
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,880
If you don’t want people to know, don’t do it.

437
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Look at what this netizen said.

438
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,880
China Dian Feng’s face is completely lost by you.

439
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,120
The Chuan Qi team is a complete mess.

440
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
It’s getting complicated.

441
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,230
Looks like resolution is tough.

442
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,110
I didn’t think that Ji Xiang Kong

443
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,630
would be fallen by a woman.

444
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,470
Isn’t that good?

445
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,700
The competition is in two days.

446
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,060
The fiercer the fight, the better.

447
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,340
We’ll win silently.

448
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,940
Look at this person

449
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,740
Handicapped in the competition, punching someone after.

450
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,850
And this -

451
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,890
I was speechless after reading it.

452
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,410
These netizens are heartless.

453
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,130
We’re interrupting Captain Pei’s training.

454
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,970
The training room isn’t a place for you to gossip.

455
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,210
It’s 6PM. Time’s up.

456
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:11,800
Let’s go.

457
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,400
Steamboat is on me.

458
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
Brothers.

459
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
There’s a training match at 9PM.

460
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,800
Four protect one.

461
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,320
We’re familiar, Captain.

462
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,630
You can win all by yourself, can’t you?

463
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,030
Thanks, Brother Qi.

464
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,190
We really haven’t had steamboat in a long time.

465
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,670
Let’s go, Lu Sheng.

466
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,700
Captain, we’ll be back before the training match.

467
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,340
Let’s go, Tong Wu.

468
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,540
Don’t disturb Captain Pei’s training.

469
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,540
Drink up.

470
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,540
No.

471
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,130
The video has been online for days.

472
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,210
He’s still hiding.

473
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,250
We’re Chuan Qi’s biggest sponsor.

474
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,210
We’ve put in so much money.

475
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,410
What do you take me for?

476
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,290
Yes.

477
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,130
President Bai,

478
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,760
Xiang Kong is in a training match.

479
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,840
At this hour, what training match is there?

480
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,400
No, President Bai.

481
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,560
They’re preparing for the inner competition.

482
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
Ji Xiang Kong is deputy captain.

483
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,110
Who let him be deputy captain?

484
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,500
I wanted a captain with a healthy image!

485
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,380
Isn’t this Ji Xiang Kong?

486
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,900
You’re really something.

487
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,020
What’s your relationship with Qiu Ying?

488
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,540
The net says you toyed with her feelings

489
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,580
and caused this revenge.

490
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,780
President Bai.

491
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,460
There’s nothing untoward between Qiu Ying and me.

492
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,900
Sorry.

493
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,570
Due to my carelessness, I’ve brought trouble to

494
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,450
the team and the company.

495
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,730
I’m deeply sorry.

496
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,690
I’m here today

497
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,010
in the hopes of resolving the problem.

498
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,350
How do we resolve the problem?

499
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,910
I want this issue to die down quickly!

500
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,110
The assault video on the net is clearly fake.

501
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,710
We can clarify it with the involved party.

502
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,950
I’m afraid Qiu Ying won’t -

503
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,110
I don’t mean Qiu Ying, but Jeffrey.

504
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,830
Jeffrey. That’s right.

505
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,750
If we tried to explain this ourselves,

506
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
the rest won’t believe it.

507
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,070
If Jeffrey can step up to explain it himself,

508
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,390
the video has nothing to stand on.

509
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,260
Yes, the assault was fake.

510
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,380
The conflict, however, was real.

511
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,980
We’ve already offended them.

512
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,440
Why would they step up to clarify matters with us?

513
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,240
Right?

514
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,200
Jeffrey is a very proud person

515
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,640
If he knew that everyone thought I could bully him,

516
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,880
he would step up to deny it.

517
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,080
Plus, he’s coming to China in a few days.

518
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,560
Really?

519
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,480
That’s great! Isn’t it?

520
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,390
Don’t worry, President Bai.

521
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,150
I’ll bring along my company’s most sincere apologies

522
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,790
to invite Jeffrey out to clarify it for us.

523
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,980
Calm down. Relax. Don’t worry.

524
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
We’ll have to trouble you then.

525
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,180
Of course, Manager Zhao.

526
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,740
Don’t mention it.

527
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,770
Shut the door.

528
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,210
When is Jeffrey coming? Check it out.

529
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,570
I’ve checked. Tomorrow.

530
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,010
Tomorrow?

531
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,560
Another obstacle suddenly surfaces.

532
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,280
This -

533
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,960
Manager Zhao, do you think Jeffrey will really step up?

534
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,430
I can’t say.

535
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,750
What should we do? Manager Zhao.

536
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,900
Let’s do this.

537
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,660
Go arrange more training matches for them.

538
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,540
If Ji Xiang Kong looks for Jeffrey,

539
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,220
no matter what you do, you have to stop it.

540
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,020
Got it?

541
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,460
Got it.

542
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,570
I’ll blow up the news on the internet.

543
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,130
A month later,

544
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,490
even if Jeffrey steps up to clarify things, it’ll be too late.

545
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,200
Clever.

546
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,160
Try this new tea, Manager Zhao.

547
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,280
No.

548
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,300
It’ll be okay.

549
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,500
I’m here.

550
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,420
We’ll wait for Lawyer Chen.

551
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,100
We’ll find a way to solve this.

552
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,300
Who is it? Why didn’t you read it?

553
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,940
Xia Ling.

554
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,410
Your brother?

555
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,690
He’s not my brother.

556
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,550
Even without blood relations, he’s still legally your brother.

557
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,310
Look at it. Maybe it’s urgent.

558
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,550
Sister. I saw the threads on the internet.

559
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,150
How are you doing?

560
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,350
I’m worried, and Dad is worried too.

561
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,830
See. Your brother cares about you.

562
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah. He does. If not for them,

563
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,700
I wouldn’t have become like this.
