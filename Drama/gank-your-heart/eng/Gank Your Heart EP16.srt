00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,020
Tong Long, help me to food.

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,180
Hurry up.

5
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,410
Looks like

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,030
you another tough battle to fight.

7
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,710
Sister Wen, you signed me in,

8
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,030
isn't it to let me battle?

9
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,550
Moreover, these players,

10
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,470
we have already cross swards

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,030
with one another so many times on the playing field.

12
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,110
No worries, I have the confidence.

13
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,790
Why not you stay in room two.

14
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,230
Since Pei Xi left,

15
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,550
the room have since been empty.

16
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,030
Sister, is there joint rooms?

17
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,420

but, he's

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,640
character is a little solitude.

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Its fine, I'll sleep with him.

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
I can communicate with him usually.

23
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Then I'll bring you in.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
No need, I'll go myself.

25
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Hello Lu Sheng, I'm Xiang Kong,

26
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,090
we'll be roommate in future.

27
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,090
Okay.

28
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,950
What you doing?

29
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,300
What are you doing here?

30
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,580
I am Legend's new leader.

31
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,940
Next time,

32
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,300
this will be my room.

33
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,660
I don't allow you to stay here,

34
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
heard that?

35
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,610
Why did you take Brother Kong's note?

36
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,450
He left it in this room,

37
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,010
isn't it just for me to see?

38
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,370
No, I say you're so tall,

39
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,450
can you have some face?

40
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,450
Give it to me.

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Giving stregth is it?

42
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,440
Give it.

43
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,800
You're so tall.

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Lin Yi Xuan, what are you doing?

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
What happen?

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,860
Stealing, stealing Brother Kong's notebook.

47
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,020
Give it to me.

48
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,020
Enough, stop arguing.

49
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,940
Why not let's compete one round?

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,820
Sure, I'm not afraid of you.

51
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Compete on?

52
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,100
You decide.

53
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,740
Heard that?

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
I'll decide what to compete on.

55
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,620
This place is so small,

56
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,260
I'll wait for you in the practice hall.

57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,490
Everyone's here.

58
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,930
There's no other meaning,

59
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,570
I just to let everyone

60
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,930
be the witness,

61
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,570
if case some people

62
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,050
isn't convinced that he lost.

63
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,630
Afterall, he is the leader.

64
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,910
Don't come up with any underhand.

65
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,350
No.

66
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,630
Compete on what I'll decide,

67
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,270
this is what Leader Pei Xi said.

68
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,430
I just wanted to

69
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,430
come up with a good idea

70
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,350
to let you

71
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,430
play happily and have a great time.

72
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,070
Anything.

73
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,510
Start.

74
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,150
All competition

75
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,350
is friendship first,

76
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,270
competition second.

77
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,700
Today we will have

78
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,980
a friendly smile competition.

79
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,700
In one minutes,

80
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,460
who make make the other person laugh,

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,500
will win. How's that?

82
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,180
Isn't too much right?

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,960
Start now.

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,530
Pei Xi, is your facial nerve paralyse?

85
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,850
Is it very funny?

86
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,890
It's my turn.

87
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
I win.

88
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,810
Where's Li Gan?

89
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,650
Master said he have stomachache,

90
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,530
he wouldn't be coming.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
Okay, then we'll start first.

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to announce to everyone,

93
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
from today onwards,

94
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,000
Ji Xiang Kong will be joining Wei Teng.

95
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,940
Everyone welcome.

96
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,940
Entering the team,

97
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,540
everyone please show come care.

98
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,060
Ji Xiang Kong

99
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,300
isn't only a team member

100
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,620
but also your new leader.

101
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,140
Sister Wen,

102
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
such an important matter on the leader,

103
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,220
should you

104
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,780
communicate a little with my Master?

105
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,580
I am your Coach,

106
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
my decision

107
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,580
is also Wei Teng's decision.

108
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,980
Sister Wen,

109
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,450
its a good thing that there's doubt,

110
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,330
it means everyone is serious about the team,

111
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,890
just nice this can drive everyone.

112
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm an airborne leader.

113
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,050
Stop saying nice words,

114
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,170
I have more rights than you

115
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,050
- to be Wei Teng's leader. - Qi Yue.

116
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,910
If you are capable, let's battle one round.

117
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,470
Okay, you form a team.

118
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,150
I will lead the substitute players.

119
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,910
This is what you said, don't get smack right in the face.

120
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,030
If I lost,

121
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,710
I will call you the leader.

122
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,430
What happen if you lost?

123
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,150
I will leave.

124
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,430
Sister Wen, this is what he said.

125
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,110
Everyone wouldn't disagree right?

126
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,420
Okay, let's do as you guys arranged.

127
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,620
Brothers, let's go.

128
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,740
Prepare a little.

129
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
I will demonstrate to him

130
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,460
what is a leader.

131
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,560
Don't worry.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
It will be the same later, four protecting one.

133
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,800
The mid-way juggling

134
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,760
will all be mine.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
You guys just have to follow up,

136
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
understand?

137
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Brother Qi, don't worry.

138
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
We will fully assist you.

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,510
A cripple with four substitute player,

140
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,710
what's there to be arrogant?

141
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,550
How to play this?

142
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,990
There's no way to fight Qi Yue,

143
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,110
definitely can't win.

144
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,550
Qi Yue will definitely use the four protecting one,

145
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,790
then we will use the double call technique.

146
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,620
Double call?

147
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
Simply said, its to let us

148
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,340
go top and damage,

149
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,460
faster development.

150
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,580
Form an Ace with the opponent

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,860
to form a balance.

152
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,460
Qi Yue will definitely go the mid-way.

153
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,740
Then we will use the side way

154
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,620
to fight.

155
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,530
Even if Qi Yue is that strong, there's no use.

156
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,850
Come on, relax.

157
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,130
Listen to my command.

158
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,970
Aren't you not feeling well?

159
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,610
I'm better.

160
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,930
That's good then.

161
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,360
This is

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,560
Qi Yue and Ji Xiang Kong's duel?

163
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Qi Yue isn't convinced,

164
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,110
Ji Xiang Kong called four substitute players

165
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,990
to battle a around with him.

166
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,630
Ji Xiang Kong let go of his Mid turret,

167
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,950
it's dangerous.

168
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,190
I think it might not be,

169
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,580
Ji Xiang Kong and his teammates

170
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,500
split into two ways,

171
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
one turret exchanging for three.

172
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,820
Its not a lost at all,

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,340
and Qi Yue's postworm?

174
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,620
Now its only relying on team embrace.

175
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,900
Unlike Ji Xiang Kong,

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,340
four person with one pushing, playing with an advantage.

177
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,780
It can not only avoid attack but also push the line.

178
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,210
This round our battle array is stronger,

179
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,410
fighting them at the start.

180
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,730
I'm at the mid-way.

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Mid-way juggling developing.

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
I will assist right away,

183
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,800
becareful on your way.

184
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,920
Jungler have went over.

185
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,780
Assist, towars the river for more.

186
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,660
Let me tell you guys first,

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,660
if anyone touch my jungler,

188
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,980
try it.

189
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,980
Okay.

190
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,780
Looks like there no more suspense.

191
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,860
Qi Yue have no developed yet,

192
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,380
but Ji Xiang Kong's

193
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,180
two way preparation

194
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,180
have already formed.

195
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
His tactics

196
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,860
have won Qi Yue's four protecting one.

197
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,380
Looks like what you said is right.

198
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,820
I hope you can understand

199
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,780
everything that I've done

200
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,060
is for Wei Teng.

201
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,650
Take a look.

202
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,250
Ji Xiang Kong's contract.

203
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,770
One dollar?

204
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,470
He said he want to advance and retreat together with Wei Teng.

205
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,830
Li Gan,

206
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,070
I believe Ji Xiang Kong

207
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,710
wouldn't disappoint us.

208
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,590
Okay.

209
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,350
In awhile I'll go

210
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,670
submit the request to the website.

211
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,670
Thank you.

212
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,670
Continue doing damage,

213
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,870
stress them back home,

214
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,860
speed push the crystals.

215
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,700
Clear the troops.

216
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,540
What is this?

217
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,540
What are you playing?

218
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,000
Who looked for you?

219
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,800
- What are in thinking in your mind? - Qi Yue.

220
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,360
Master, let me have anoher round with him.

221
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm not convinced.

222
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Are you over it yet?

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,560
- Master. - Shut up.

224
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Good win.

225
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
Okay,

226
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,120
a competition's of win and lose,

227
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,830
can't tell much

228
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,390
but I hope

229
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,270
you guys can see

230
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,270
the tactics.

231
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,710
Especially during competition,

232
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,150
tactics are very important.

233
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,950
Qi Yue,

234
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,220
this time you should know

235
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,460
where you lost at right?

236
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,580
Is there still anyone not convinced?

237
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:26,970
Okay.

238
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,290
The from today onwards,

239
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,410
Ji Xiang Kong will be your leader.

240
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,090
You guys still have to listen to his command.

241
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,770
Train according to his tactics,

242
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,210
understand?

243
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,050
Xiang Kong,

244
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,290
both your fight was great

245
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,810
but the tactics.

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,120
I will go persuade him.

247
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,710
Qi Yue, stand right there.

248
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,380
Master, I don't want to battle anymore.

249
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,780
I'm just not convinced.

250
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,580
Last time when Pei Xi is around,

251
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,500
let me play four protecting one.

252
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I'm willing.

253
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,700
Now you're asking me to call Ji Xiang Kong leader?

254
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,020
I can't.

255
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,340
His solo game can win me?

256
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,020
The match just now already proved

257
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
although your personal skill is strong,

258
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,660
but Ji Xiang Kong

259
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,580
is more suitable to be leader.

260
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,660
Iconcure talks about team spirit.

261
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,530
Master, why even you

262
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,730
are siding that cripple?

263
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,610
Keep quiet.

264
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,210
If you have lost the competition, admit it.

265
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,170
Your arrogance

266
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,970
needs to know when to stop.

267
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
You are my disciple

268
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
and also Wei Teng's veteran,

269
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,240
take out some heart

270
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,420
and responsibility.

271
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,660
I hope you can let go of the miscellaneous,

272
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,100
compete well.

273
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Don't because you're doing well once

274
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,420
and ruin your good career in front of you,

275
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,500
life is still long.

276
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,860
If you want to prove that you

277
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,740
are stronger than Ji Xiang Kong,

278
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,420
prove it during the competition.

279
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,820
Understand?

280
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,210
Why are you here?

281
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,150
What happen?

282
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,150
Who bullied our Master Qi?

283
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,790
Who else?

284
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,990
Ji Xiang Kong,

285
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,230
once day I'll let him leave.

286
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,550
I heard that your leader position

287
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,430
is snatched.

288
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,230
If not for Sister Wen protecting him,

289
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,870
what is he?

290
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,630
You say this Ji Xiang Kong,

291
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670
where is he from?

292
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,110
He can come as he want.

293
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,670
Who knows?

294
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,180
Ji Xiang Kong

295
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,380
snatched my leader position,

296
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,580
I wouldn't let him live well.

297
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,740
Annoying, let's not talk about this.

298
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Accompany me for a ride okay?

299
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,740
You messed up my styling.

300
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,560
Why? Going to see Pei Xi?

301
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Your handsome boyfriend is here,

302
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,560
you don't want to accompany,

303
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,560
you want to look for other guys?

304
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,360
What are you saying?

305
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,560
Those online,

306
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,080
you believe what those netizens said?

307
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,440
Moreover,

308
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,320
not like you don't know

309
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,320
about the double row.

310
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,640
About the double row？

311
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,760
About the double row

312
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,760
is me taking his account

313
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,320
with your double row to teach Qiu Ying a lesson.

314
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,470
In the end,

315
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,270
my girlfriend

316
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,150
became Pei Xi's rumoured girlfriend.

317
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,220
Okay,okay,

318
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,260

319
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,220

How?

324
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,850
Today I really can't.

I've asked before already,

359
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying is not a thing.

360
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,260
How do you know?

361
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,020

I,

382
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,350
tomorrow I have an interview to do.

383
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,780
Then you come back at night

384
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,740
to help me, give me the information,

385
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
send it to me later, can?

386
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay.

387
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,540
Thanks.

388
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,020
Yi Yi, I'll leave first.

389
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
- Okay, byebye. - Byebye.

390
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,780
See you tomorrow, slowly.

391
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,600
Lu Yi Yi, I...

392
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
Do you have a problem?

393
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,520
Did I scare you?

394
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I have to treat you to a meal,

395
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,320
- let's go. - That...

396
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,760
I know one

397
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
super good Si Chuan Restaurant.

398
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,760
Trying to bride me?

399
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,680
No.

400
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,350
Speak, why are you looking for me?

401
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,230
I.. I want to treat you to a meal

402
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,110
means I have something?

403
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,230
Do I look like someone like that?

404
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,030
No.

405
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,940
I do have something looking for you,

406
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,700
I... I want to let you

407
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,580
help me check on Zhao Yang.

408
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Check on him?

409
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,090
He's indeed not some one good

410
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,890
but am I close to you?

411
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,730
Why should I help you?

412
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:15,970
I'm leaving.

413
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,890
No, you come back.

414
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,850
That...

415
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,170
Aren't you a great

416
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,970
reporter?

417
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,170
Kind and justice,

418
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,920
isn't it reporter's job?

419
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,400
Moreover,

420
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
checking Zhao Yang's

421
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,920
personal life clearly,

422
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
it will shock the whole industry.

423
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,880
That's so good.

424
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
What a good chance.

425
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,800
This chance,

426
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,520
I can give it to anyone.

427
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,470
I have to give it to you.

428
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,350
Don't.

429
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,590
I can't take this.

430
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,590
You saw it already,

431
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,590
I

432
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,710
am just a small periodical office‘s editor,

433
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,710
I don't have such a big responsibility.

434
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,940
Byebye.

435
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,660
No,no.

436
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,260
Grandfather Lu, Grandmother Lu.

437
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,060
Beautiful Ms Lu.

438
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,300
Beautiful Ms Lu can?

439
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,580
Are you asking for a beating?

440
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,020
Let me tell you, if you still follow me,

441
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,020
I will call the police.

442
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,260
Even if you call the police, its useless.

443
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,140
When I come out,

444
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
I will still follow you.

445
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,380
You..

446
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,810
okay.

447
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,050
Take it as I'm afraid of you, okay?

448
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,530
I'll help you.

449
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,170
Justice.

450
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:16,930
Let's go eat,

451
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,930
let's eat and discuss.

452
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
That Si Chuan Restaurant is great.

453
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,000
The queue is very long.

454
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,520
By the way,

455
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,760
are you familiar with Wei Teng's Shu Wen?

456
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,700
Shu Wen, of course familiar.

457
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,940
That's my previous sister-in-law.

458
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,940
Sister-in-law?

459
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes.

460
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,940
Ji Xiang Kong, that slag man.

461
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,700
No.

462
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
What's there to do with my Brother Kong?

463
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,660
What's the situation?

464
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,500
No, why did you hit me?

465
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,900
Are we eating, Lu Yi Yi?

466
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,660
Coming.

467
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Look at me later.

468
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,500
Hello, both of your coffee.

469
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,460
Come, becareful.

470
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,810
Isn't this Qiu Ying?

471
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,530
That's weird.

472
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,810
You're perfectly good,

473
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:03,930
why are you here

474
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,050
to be a waitress?

475
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,170
Previously online

476
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,530
is spreading you and Ji Xiang Kong's matter.

477
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,170
The both of us are really curious,

478
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,270
whether is it true?

479
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,830
You guys don't have to care.

480
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,110
No, don't go.

481
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,030
Don't touch me.

482
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,030
Ji Xiang Kong have Shu Wen,

483
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,470
did you get desolate?

484
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,710
This small booklet, you still gave it to me.

485
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,070
What you doing?

486
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,270
We don't welcome you guys here.

487
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,510
Get out.

488
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,550
Isn't this Pei Xi?

489
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,030
What's so amazing?

490
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,110
I'm asking you guys to get out.

491
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,790
Let's go. People is chasing us out.

492
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,110
Let's go, let's not play anymore.

493
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,680
Ji Xiang Kong's.

494
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,320
Thanks.

495
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,440
If there's any problem in future,

496
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,000
you can ask me directly.

497
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
So long as I'm here,

498
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
nobody can bully you.

499
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,380
Previous sister-in-law.

500
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,540
Lin Yi Xuan told me personally.

501
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,210
Shu Wen is his previous Sister-in-law.

502
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,570
Ji Xiang Kong is his Brother Kong's.

503
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,210
This relationship,

504
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,810
do you know?

505
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,170
She will go to Wei Teng

506
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,330
definitely because of

507
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,570
wanting to get together with Shu Wen.

508
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,810
This liar.

509
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,410
Yi Yi,

510
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,530
can you not

511
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,650
get all this information

512
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,890
from Lin Yi Xuan?

513
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,760
I get all this information from Lin Yi Xuan

514
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,080
isn't it because I'm afraid you got lied at?

515
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
You're so dumb,

516
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
since you havent give everything in,

517
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,840
I have to hurry.

518
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,390
- Hurry. - You're thinking too much.

519
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,030
Now, I

520
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,790
don't have the strength to think of all these.

521
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,790
I still have the house loans to pay

522
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,190
and preparing for the star tomorrow's competition,

523
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,460
and being a waitress for Meng You Ren.

524
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,460
I know very well

525
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,820
what I'm doing everyday.

526
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,740
Whether I can become a professional commentary,

527
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,740
there is only this one chance,

528
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,820
I have to go all out.

529
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,900
I can't waste a minute.

530
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,580
Okay.

531
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,780
Let's not talk about it

532
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,540
but promise me,

533
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,220
don't see him in future anymore.

534
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,290
The most important thing now

535
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,890
is the peacefully

536
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,250
preparing for the competition.

537
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,010
Don't worry.

538
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,370
You're tired for a day already,

539
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,490
hurry go bath and sleep.

540
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,800
Okay.

541
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
You sleep early too.

542
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,140
You're back.

543
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,820
You play basketball too.

544
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,820
Don't play anymore.

545
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,490
This have been there for very long already.

546
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,730
I'll put in air for you.

547
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,490
No need.

548
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,890
I intended to throw it away.

549
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,710
Okay.

550
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,430
By the way, I have a question

551
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,710
I want to communicate with you.

552
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,470
Okay, you say.

553
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:45,990
Recently, I

554
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,150
looked at the statics,

555
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,230
and realised that you played

556
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:48,910
every position before

557
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,150
and you played very well.

558
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,590
Then do you think

559
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,590
your current position

560
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,550
is suitable for you?

561
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,350
What do you mean?

562
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,950
What you mean is

563
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,710
my current level

564
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,500
can't play my current position.

565
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,180
What you mean is

566
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,420
I'm pulling my teammates behind?

567
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,660
Please

568
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,660
take a good look at the statics.

569
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,620
Which one did I not play well?

570
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,360
No, that's not what I mean.

571
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,360
Maybe I did not

572
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,240
explain clearly,

573
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,680
what I mean is...

574
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,040
I want to say

575
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,160
all your position

576
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,400
and every round's play

577
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,560
is very stable,

578
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,800
its even like a straight line.

579
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,910
So from another angel

580
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,750
to understand,

581
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,830
you do have

582
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,750
a very big potential

583
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,030
to exert.

584
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,180
You just came to be the leader of Wei Teng,

585
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,900
you want to open tables

586
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
I can understand

587
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
but I'm someone like that,

588
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,420
very direct.

589
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,780
I don't like to beat about the bush.

590
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,100
So i advice you

591
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,770
to not waste your energy on me,

592
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,370
care about yourself.

593
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,610
I just looked at the statics

594
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,250
and wanted to speak to you.

595
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,010
I think you

596
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,010
have a very big space to improve.

597
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,970
Of course, if you do this others will.

598
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,330
Now is rest time,

599
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,210
can I sleep?

600
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,210
Okay, sorry.

601
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Good night.

602
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,970
Tong Long,

603
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,090
why are you eating so much on your own?

604
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,570
This is Brother Qi and Brother Shen's.

605
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,800
Morning.

606
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,800
Morning.

607
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,940
Its this three again?

608
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Can you have some creativity?

609
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,180
Buy some buns next time.

610
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,980
I want meat bun.

611
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,820
Okay.

612
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,100
Morning leader.

613
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,180
Morning.

614
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,420
Not eating something?

615
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,060
How do you have strength

616
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,020
to fight me?

617
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Anyways, you will also get bashed.

618
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,620
You know the search engine tomorrow

619
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,380
is what?

620
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,940
Prince Dian Jin

621
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,740
bashing cripple Ji Xiang Kong.

622
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,460
Morning Sister Wen.

623
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,460
- Morning Sister Wen. - Morning.

624
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,780
Breakfast is very full.

625
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,290
Sister Wen.

626
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,410
Let's go out for a chat.

627
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,210
Okay.

628
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,710
Eat slowly.

629
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,990
Go out for a chat?

630
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,950
What's there to chat about early in the morning?

631
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,230
I'm not eating anymore.

632
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,270
You just came to the team,

633
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,390
you need to give them some time

634
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,270
to get used to you.

635
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,510
But Qi Yue this person

636
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,390
is more rush,

637
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,310
sometimes he's very direct when he speaks.

638
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,100
Qi Yue is an veteran, arrogant.

639
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,860
Probably when Pei Xi is around,

640
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,060
he's also not convinced.

641
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,340
Shen Hong this person have some backbones,

642
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,200
he's currently together with Qi Yue

643
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
but I might not be able to convinced him.

644
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,200
What about others?

645
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,160
Lu Sheng skills is very all rounder

646
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,840
but he

647
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
see through the world of mortals.

648
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,080
He only ask for stability, not improvement.

649
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,000
Tong Long is the youngest,

650
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,000
and also the least daring.

651
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,200
But in all,

652
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,480
their skills are all still good.

653
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,270
You can, its just a few days

654
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,270
and you already know the character

655
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,710
of these people clearly.

656
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,590
Autumn's competition is starting,

657
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,620
time is precious,

658
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,140
but

659
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,020
I have already looked through

660
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
their statics,

661
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:07,900
next up,

662
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,380
is to go according to their specility

663
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,140
and plan their practice.

664
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,810
You will have to spend a bit more thoughts into it.

665
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,730
If not when you execute the plan,

666
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,690
there might be difficulties

667
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,210
but don't worry, if there's any problem,

668
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,330
I will be first

669
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,330
to help you solve it.

670
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,130
Thanks Sister Wen.

671
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,490
I know what I'm supposed to do,

672
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,170
it might be  certain risk

673
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,370
but don't worry Sister Wen.

674
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,930
No matter what I do,

675
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,490
please allow me to preserver on.

676
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,840
Since I looked for you to come,

677
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,120
I will definitely support you fully.

678
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,080
Master, this Ji Xiang Kong

679
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,150
is a attractive young man,

680
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,390
Sister Wen trust him so much,

681
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,550
I believe he definitely

682
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,030
did something to Sister Wen.

683
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,430
You actually believe

684
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,310
something without evidence?

685
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,740
Master, you really not worry?

686
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,700
Sister and Ji Xiang Kong...

687
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,780
Enough.

688
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,620
What kind of a person is Shu Wen,

689
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,860
I know it better than anyone.

690
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,460
Master.

691
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,220
Why do you have to tolerate all this?

692
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,060
Qi Yue.

693
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,460
My problem, you don't have to care.

694
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,300
You just have to

695
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,580
practice properly for competition.

696
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,860
Taking out some real capabilities

697
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,290
is more important.

698
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,290
Don't forget

699
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,530
what I told you in the past.

700
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,650
Okay, I know Master.

701
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,200
I'll go practice already.

702
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,720
Get going.

703
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,940
Pei Xi.

704
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,340
Pei Xi, I send you messages,

705
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,460
why did't you reply?

706
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm not free.

707
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,540
Pei Xi, I know you're busy

708
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,700
so I came early

709
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,660
to see you.

710
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,420
Why not, let's have a chat?

711
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,410
Have you eaten?

712
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,610
Don't disturb me from my job.

713
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,250
I came this time

714
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,370
to is learn.

715
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,610
I came to listen

716
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,610
to Teacher Luo Tian's compound.

717
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,070
Ain't you a host?

718
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,550
What does compound have to do with you?

719
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,790
How is there no relation?

720
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,830
Definitely there is.

721
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,070
I joined

722
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,550
the star tomorrow's competition.

723
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,350
I'm prepared to be a professional commentary

724
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,910
from a host.

725
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,270
Like this,

726
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,270
next time we can

727
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,030
meet each other on matches.

728
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,150
You also want to be a commentary?

729
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,350
Yes.

730
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,230
Who else?

731
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,990
Who else is there other than me?

732
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Waitress.

733
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,140
What happen to the computer?

734
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,060
It can't be turned on.

735
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,180
Qiu Ying.

736
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,780
Waitress.

737
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
Coming.

738
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,120
Okay, I'll get it for you immediately.

739
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Hello.

740
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,680
What do you want to order?

741
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,870
I'm thirsty.

742
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,630
What's there to drink

743
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,590
here?

744
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,790
You introduce me.

745
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,990
Just nice, take a look yourself.

746
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,790
This menu's words are too small,

747
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,660
why not, you read to me?

748
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,940
This is tea, juice,

749
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,220
plain water,

750
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,460
what do you need?

751
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,220
Just this little things.

752
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,770
Is there coffee?

753
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,130
Yes, cappuccino.

754
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,650
Okay.

755
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,170
Then I want a cup of

756
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,290
cappuccino.

757
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,090
Wait..

758
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,370
I want to be a commentary recently

759
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,810
so the water temperature should not be too hot.

760
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,370
My vocals will not be able to take it.

761
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,000
Also, my stomach is not good,

762
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,560
the water temperature should not be too low as well.

763
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
Somemore,

764
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,680
I'm recerntly

765
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,990
on diet,

766
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,630
so I don't want milk and sugar.

767
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,270
Remember that?

768
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,390
No milk

769
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,140
it will become Americano.

770
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,020
But what I ordered is

771
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,300
cappuccino.

772
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,700
I'm sorry,

773
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,580
cappuccine without milk

774
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,300
we don't make.

775
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,020
What kind of attitude is this?

776
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,260
Be careful, I'll complain you.

777
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,780
Pei Xi, did you see that?

778
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
That's too much.

779
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,740
Today there's only a type of coffee,

780
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,090
latte, give you.

781
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,760
Pei Xi,

782
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,440
thank you for helping me.

783
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,360
You're thinking too much.

784
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,300
I did not help you.

785
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,700
There is already short of people here.

786
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,700
There's still a lot of customers waiting.

787
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,980
Remember,

788
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,180
you just have to do your thing right.

789
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,180
I know.

790
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,500
Waitress,

791
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,420
where's the compound?

792
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,380
This way, this way in.

793
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Let's go.

794
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,620
Waitress.

795
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,140
Coming.

796
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,860
You come here and take a look.

797
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,740
What is happening to my computer?

798
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Okay.

799
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,830
Is it very hard to choose?

800
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,670
I don't know what you mean.

801
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,830
You have to at least choose one

802
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,350
so I can help you,

803
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,190
right?

804
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,910
I don't need your help.

805
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,310
I think you're really very bored.

806
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,230
Or is it you want both?

807
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,390
Can, rascal.

808
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,820
Yo're like me last time.

809
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,220
Do you want me to give you some suggestions?

810
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,220
I said already, I don't need.

811
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,360
Good child, you're a grown up,

812
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,040
learn to think on your own.

813
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,520
Do you want

814
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
me as an experienced person,

815
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,840
give you some suggestions?

816
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Are you very free now?

817
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,840
The bar is lack of people,

818
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,440
there is not enough people.

819
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,440
Do you want to help?

820
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,440
You look at me now

821
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,440
looks very free?

822
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm doing this for your happiness.

823
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm thinking so much for you.

824
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,400
Teacher Luo.

825
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,990
Teacher Luo, you're here.

826
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,510
This child run faster than anyone else.

827
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,710
What have you done to Pei Xi?

828
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,750
Shy, youthful times.

829
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:44,910
You're gossiping about others again?

830
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,740
Private life.

831
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,060
How can you consider this as gossip?

832
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm a brother,

833
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,620
shouldn't I have the responsibility on an older one?

834
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,420
What time is it?

835
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,650
It's time. Let'sgo in.

Today, I'm giving everyone

871
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,680
compound is

872
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,920
insider game's finals.

873
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,320
This competition is Wei Teng

874
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,200
as a two vs. zero's advantage

875
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,980
and won Legends.

876
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,780
Because its to test the new updates

877
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,500
insider game,

878
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,540
both teams have to choose

879
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,220
at least one new hero

880
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,940
but in this competition

881
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,220
Legends as one vs. zero

882
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,620
as a losing situation

883
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
choose two

884
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,060
new heros to play.

885
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,820
Come,

886
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,820
this competition base on its scale

887
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,220
actually Legends

888
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,420
is at an advantage.

889
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,620
Through assistance,

890
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
the deep sea control

891
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,140
Lu feng's balance.

892
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,820
It's useless.

893
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,580
What?

894
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,130
You copying notes down,

895
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,450
it's useless.

896
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,770
Then what is useful?

897
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,130
You asking Luo Tian directly.

898
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,130
This is a up front professional

899
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,970
right in front of you,

900
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:56,990
ask him directly.

901
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,070
Its ten times more useful than copying notes.

902
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,190
Makes sense.

903
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,390
Just this brain of yours,

904
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,910
still want to be a commentary?

905
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,910
Of course, the key

906
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,310
isn't this tactics.

907
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,990
Can anyone see

908
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,310
anything from the middle?

909
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,670
Teacher Luo Tian, I have a question.

910
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,430
Very hardworking.

911
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,710
Yes.

912
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,910
I want to become

913
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,140
a commentary like you in future.

914
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,220
So I have to

915
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,460
learn more from you.

916
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,060
Okay, then can you see

917
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,940
anything from it?

918
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,220
It should be Ji XIang Kong's entrance

919
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
can make damage,

920
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
after dying, the team members

921
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,360
did not cooperate.

922
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,240
So it cause the lost.

923
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,280
Is there anyone else

924
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,880
who have a different view?

925
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Teacher Luo Tian,

926
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,710
I think this round key lost

927
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,230
is the tactics.

928
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,030
I think the wrong doesn't lie in Ji Xiang Kong

929
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,910
but his team members

930
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,790
did not assist well,

931
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,030
causing to not control well,

932
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,700
Wei Teng damage the marksman

933
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,100
causing an anti-kill.

934
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,260
That's right.

935
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,420
The real reason is

936
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,300
Huo He's mistake.

937
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,500
During the crucial moment,

938
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,540
release his skills.

939
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,490
Legends assistance here

940
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,530
every round is with

941
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,570
Pei Xi's hell angel

942
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,090
conducting a life taking battling method,

943
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,090
is isn't as simple as a mistake.

944
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,370
Not a very good position,

945
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,290
this is for the back

946
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,650
Legends lost

947
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,170
doing a protector.

948
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,930
Today's compound commentary

949
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,010
will end here.

950
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,170
After today, I'll be at Meng You Ren

951
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,930
bringing more competition

952
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,730
compound commentary,

953
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,440
I hope everyone can show some support.

954
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Our Iconcure competition.

955
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,880
Thank you everyone.

956
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,080
Thank you Teacher Luo Tian.

957
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
Can I take a photo with you?

958
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,230
I want a photo too.

959
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,030
Thanks.

960
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,900
Its my turn.

961
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,140
Teacher Luo Tian.

962
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,180
Thanks Teacher Luo Tian.

963
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,620
Thanks Teacher, all the best.

964
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,540
Step on me.

965
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,100
Teacher Luo, hello.

966
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,420
Just now Brother Xia Tian said

967
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,540
he would be waiting for you at the Bar.

968
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,500
Okay.

969
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,620
Teacher Luo, I'll bring you

970
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,780
to the rest area to wait.

971
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,780
He should be here soon.

972
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,090
Come.

973
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:18,930
Just sit here.

974
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,080
Teacher Luo.

975
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Do you want to drink anything?

976
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
We have everything here.

977
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,840
No need. Go get busy.

978
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,080
When he finished his things,

979
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,080
you can come let me know,

980
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,840
that's enough.

981
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,700
Teacher Luo.

982
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,020
You want a signature?

983
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,660
You're my idol.

984
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,740
I not only want a signature,

985
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,580
I still have a lot of questions

986
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,620
regarding commentary

987
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,580
to ask you.

988
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,300
This is my notes.

989
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,820
Did we meet anywhere before?

990
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,690
Luo Tian, how do you see?

991
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,330
All trainees now

992
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,410
are so random ?

993
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,330
I remember now,

994
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,350
Ji Guang video's commentary room.

995
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,950
Teacher Luo, I

996
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:22,990
I'm sorry.

997
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,910
It wasn't on purpose that day.

998
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,510
A person that don't even dare to raise their head,

999
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,830
how can you let me believe

1000
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,790
you are confident to speak on the commentary stage?

1001
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,630
Okay.

1002
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,750
I know.

1003
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,430
No problem.

1004
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,860
Just do as I said.

1005
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,180
Okay.

1006
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,980
Sure.

1007
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,580
I...

1008
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,500
I'll not talk to you anymore, someone is here.

1009
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,660
Okay, I know.

1010
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,260
I know.

1011
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,180
Okay.

1012
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,640
Byebye.

1013
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,240
Teacher Luo.

1014
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,880
Your Meng You Ren's waitress

1015
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,880
all have dreams.

1016
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Got found out.

1017
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,160
I admit

1018
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,640
I purposely arranged it.

1019
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,670
I don't to let think think

1020
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,110
I look like I using the back door.

1021
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,310
This isn't called using the back door.

1022
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,950
But, is there a way to convince you

1023
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,540
to give her a chance.

1024
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,500
Coming close to me,

1025
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,700
looks like she have some tactics.

1026
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,180
That girl doesn't have tactics.

1027
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,220
She's really hardworking.

1028
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,940
You know?

1029
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,460
Because we want to come here and learn,

1030
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,530
in one month

1031
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,530
she fight into the area's first.

1032
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,010
Everyday, she come the earliest and leave the latest.

1033
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,330
How rare?

1034
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,090
This can convince you to help her?

1035
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,970
This kind of host,

1036
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,690
I've see too much.

1037
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,450
On the outside, they look hardworking,

1038
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,370
but in the end,

1039
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,570
they still rely on looks and skills

1040
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,410
to get fans.

1041
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,370
She think of ways to get famous,

1042
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,290
this kind of vase,

1043
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,880
we commentaries don't want.

1044
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,160
I understand your concern,

1045
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,160
I just

1046
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,640
want to provide her with a chance.

1047
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,520
Whether its a success a not,

1048
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,840
its up to her hard work.

1049
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
But i dare to give you the ticket,

1050
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,270
this girl definitely isn't

1051
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,230
the kind of person you say.

1052
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,470
You're so sure?

1053
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,990
Xia Tian,

1054
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,750
its been long since I seen you

1055
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,460
so nice to someone already.

1056
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,300
I really admire her.

1057
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,780
You say this girl

1058
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,500
look not bad too.

1059
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,820
She can rely on her face

1060
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,900
but she want to use talent.

1061
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,020
This girl

1062
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,380
is currently very less.

1063
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:30,980
Didn't you always say

1064
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,980
you are lack of people?

1065
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
Truth is?

1066
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,650
Its Pei Xi.

1067
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,170
You know, Pei Xi

1068
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,450
like that girl.

1069
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:46,730
Say earlier.

1070
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,200
So its actually your future Sister-in-law.

1071
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,040
Its not sister-in-law.

1072
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
The numbers have no counted yet.

1073
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:52,760
Main thing is

1074
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,080
I admire her.

1075
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,480
But you got to know

1076
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,480
my standards are very high.

1077
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,040
Not anyone

1078
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,280
can enter my eyes.

1079
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,120
I know.

1080
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,580
You're such a professional one, right?

1081
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,140
Professional person is

1082
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,300
different from normal people.

1083
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,820
You can bring anyone,

1084
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,620
that is great.

1085
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,380
Okay, come.

1086
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,180
I will toast with you tea instead of wine.

1087
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,100
Sure.

1088
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,020
Phony.

1089
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,420
Hello, Yi Yi.

1090
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,100
You say if now i dash over

1091
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
to look for Teacher Luo,

1092
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,180
is it a little

1093
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,620
too rush?

1094
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,020
Let me tell you

1095
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,420
you can only make big things with thick skin.

1096
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,300
Okay then.

1097
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,500
Go.

1098
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,260
They're out.

1099
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,250
I'll talk to you when I'm home, byebye.

1100
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,570
When are you coming the next time?

1101
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,170
- I'll call you. - Okay.

1102
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,570
Teacher Luo,

1103
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,090
Teacher Luo,

1104
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,630
I'm sorry.

1105
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,230
I know just now

1106
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,430
my performance was horrible,

1107
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,430
but I really want to

1108
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,870
become a professional commentary.

1109
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,990
Probably you think I'm currently

1110
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,870
a little rackless,

1111
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,990
but I will definitely

1112
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,030
press on to do this.

1113
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,230
So

1114
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,030
So

1115
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,230
So what?

1116
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,990
So

1117
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,300
I want to ask you to be my Master.

1118
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,100
Anyone can shout this,

1119
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,480
will can be set by anyone.

1120
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,000
Then tell me,

1121
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,760
what's so special about you?

1122
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,760
Okay, if there's nothing,

1123
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,440
I'll leave first.

1124
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,520
You...

1125
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,040
You...

1126
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,240
Drive slowly.

1127
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,590
Okay, its fine.

1128
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,550
He's usually strict with others.

1129
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:48,270
But,

1130
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,030
he have never taken in any disciples.

1131
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,460
You're really daring.

1132
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,140
Then

1133
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,340
do I not have a chance anymore?

1134
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,460
Isn't that you don't have a chance.

1135
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,100
I think

1136
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,490
what he meant was

1137
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,610
don't keep saying the catchword,

1138
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,210
take out some legit actions

1139
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,410
to prove that you're special.

1140
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,530
- Is it like that? - Yes.

1141
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,770
I've known him for many years.

1142
