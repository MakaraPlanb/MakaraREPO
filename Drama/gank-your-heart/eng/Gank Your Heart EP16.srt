1
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,450
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,425
Episode Sixteen

3
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,175
Tong Wu. Buy me the meal.

4
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,350
Be quick!

5
00:01:59,125 --> 00:01:59,625
It seems like

6
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,075
you have a tough fight.

7
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,800
Sister Wen. Don't you sign me

8
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,850
to fight?

9
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,794
Besides, these players

10
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,250
have competed with me in the games for lots of times.

11
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,975
It's fine. I can handle this.

12
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,825
Well, you live in room number two.

13
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,075
After Pei Xi's leaving,

14
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,400
The room has been left out. 

15
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,925
Sister Wen, does anyone need a roomate?

16
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,950
Lu Sheng's room has an empty bed.

17
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,025
But, he

18
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:41,625
is a little reclusive.

19
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,900
That's OK. I will live with him.

20
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,200
We can communicate sometimes.

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,725
Then I lead you in.

22
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,750
No need. Let me do this.

23
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,875
Hello Lu Sheng. I am Xiangkong.

24
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,375
We are roommates later on.

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,575
OK.

26
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,025
What are you doing?

27
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,475
Why are you here?

28
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,700
I am Legends' new captain.

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,175
Later on,

30
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,375
this is my room.

31
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,875
I don't allow you to live here.

32
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you hear me?

33
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:21,925
Why are you holding my brother Kong's notebook?

34
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,550
He left this in the room.

35
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,050
Doesn't he mean to show me this?

36
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:27,525
No. I say you grow so tall.

37
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:28,475
Can you save some for your face. 

38
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:29,425
Give it to me.

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
You think it's fun, right?

40
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,350
Give it to me.

41
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,025
You are so tall. You.

42
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,875
What are you doing, Lin Yixuan?

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,050
What's going on?

44
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,725
He is stealing. He stole brother Kong's notebook.

45
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,000
You give that back to me.

46
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,025
Alright. Alright. Stop that!

47
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,525
Or, let's have a competition.

48
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,750
Ok. I am not afraid of you.

49
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,925
What do you want to compete?

50
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:52,775
You decide.

51
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,500
You all heard that.

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,150
I decide what to compete. I decide.

53
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:00,550
This is a small room.

54
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:02,100
I will wait for you at the training hall.

55
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,200
Everyone is here.

56
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,425
Nothing important,

57
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,350
just want you guys

58
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:15,700
to be the witnesses.

59
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,325
In case someone 

60
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,925
doesn't convinced to lose.

61
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,450
After all, he is the captain.

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
Don't use some underhanded tricks.

63
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,250
No.

64
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,350
I decide what to compete.

65
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,900
This is what captain Pei Xi said.

66
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,100
I just want to

67
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,075
give a brilliant idea.

68
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,075
Let you

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,025
have fun and be happy.

70
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,750
Doesn't matter.

71
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,150
Let's begin.

72
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,775
Ok. All the competitions

73
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,875
encourage friendship first, 

74
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,825
competition second.

75
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,125
Let's have a 

76
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,575
friendly smiling competition.

77
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,325
In one minute,

78
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,975
who can make another one laugh,

79
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,075
who is the winner. What do you think?

80
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,650
Not too much, right?

81
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's begin.

82
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,650
Pei Xi. Do you have facial paralysis, Pei Xi?

83
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,950
Do you think is funny?

84
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:53,650
It's my turn.

85
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:12,775
I win.

86
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,525
Where is Li Gan?

87
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,500
Master says that he has stomach sick.

88
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:47,925
He is not coming.

89
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,350
Ok. Let's start first.

90
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,650
Let me announce.

91
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,925
From today on,

92
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,750
Ji Xiangkong officially joins VNG.

93
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,250
Let's welcome him.

94
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,550
I'm new here.

95
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,025
I honestly appreciate your guidance。

96
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:10,650
Ji Xiangkong

97
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,925
is not only one of VNG, 

98
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,075
but also your new team captain.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,900
Sister Wen.

100
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,100
Such an important position as the captain,

101
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,275
should you discuss with my master first.

102
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,025
I am your coach.

103
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:23,800
My decision

104
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:25,800
Is VNG's decision.

105
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:29,650
Sister Wen.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,025
Is good thing to have question.

107
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,700
This means that everyone cares about the team.

108
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,125
It's also a good time to encourage

109
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,325
me, the outside captain.

110
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:36,450
Don't talk nice words.

111
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,600
I am more qualified than you to be VNG's captain. 

112
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,375
Qi Yue!

113
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:45,150
Dare you play a round with me?

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,650
OK. You group as a team.

115
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
I lead the reserve players.

116
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,000
You said that. Don't smash your own face.

117
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,225
If I lose,

118
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,900
I will call you captain.

119
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,700
What if you lose?

120
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,150
I quit.

121
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,350
Sister Wen. He said that by himself.

122
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,125
You guys don't have disagreement, right?

123
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,525
Ok. Do whatever you want.

124
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,925
Bros. Let's go.

125
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,225
Let's do some preparation.

126
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,250
Let me show him

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,550
what is captain.

128
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,575
Don't worry.

129
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,250
Later on, we do the same. Four guarantee one.

130
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,875
Mid lane jungle's money

131
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,775
is all mine.

132
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,425
You guys just follow.

133
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,225
Do you understand me?

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,525
Brother Qi. Don't worry.

135
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,750
We will do whatever we can to support you.

136
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,175
One clumsy hand with four reserves.

137
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,625
What is he being proud of?

138
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,650
How to fight?

139
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,000
We can't fight against Qi Yue.

140
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,000
We can't win.

141
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,275
Qi Yue must use four guarantee one.

142
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:49,550
Then we will use dual core strategy.

143
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,600
Dual core?

144
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,550
In short, it's to let our 

145
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,375
top and carry

146
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,025
farm quickly.

147
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:54,100
Forming a dual core

148
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,325
which able to compete with their ace.

149
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,350
Qi Yue will definitely put all force on mid lane

150
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,300
Then we destroy the sideway.

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,175
No matter how powerful he is, he can't do anything.

152
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,825
Come on. Take it easy.

153
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:03,750
Listen to my command.

154
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,800
Aren't yoy feeling sick?

155
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,375
It's better now.

156
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,500
Good to know.

157
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:23,050
This is…

158
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,050
the fight between Qi Yue and Ji Xiangkong?

159
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,975
Qi Yue refuses to accept.

160
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:30,350
Ji Xiangkong called four reserves

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
to join him for this round.

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,050
Ji Xiangkong is releasing the second tower.

163
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,600
It's very dangerous.

164
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,325
I don't think so.

165
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:41,950
Ji Xiangkong and his teammates

166
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:42,900
split into two groups.

167
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,050
One tower for three towers.

168
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:46,100
Didn't lost anything.

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,650
But Qi Yue's warm queen

170
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,050
relies on team.

171
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,175
Unlike Ji Xaingkong's,

172
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,750
four and one split, having the advantage over.

173
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,950
Not only able to hide from war, but also push lines.

174
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,675
This round, we have strong line-up.

175
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:02,700
We blow them in the early game.

176
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,975
I am at the mid. Middle. Middle.

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,325
Mid lane farm fast.

178
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,375
On my way. 

179
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,050
Top lane be more careful. 

180
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,275
The jungle is coming.

181
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Support. Aid the riverside,

182
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:22,125
Let me tell you first.

183
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,950
Whoever touch my jingle.

184
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,925
Have a try!

185
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,225
Alright.

186
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,900
Seems like there is no doubt about the result.

187
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Qi Yue hasn't farmed yet,

188
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,500
but Ji Xiangkong's

189
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,274
two core equipments already formed.

190
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,425
His tactics

191
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,850
Defeat Qi Yue's four guarantee one throughly.

192
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,375
It seems like you are right.

193
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,850
I hope you understand

194
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:45,675
that all I did 

195
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,000
is for VNG.

196
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,725
Take a look.

197
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:51,825
Ji Xiangkong's contract.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,650
One yuan?

199
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,075
He said he will advance and retreat together with VNG.

200
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,525
Li Gan.

201
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:06,900
I trust Ji Xiangkong

202
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,650
won't let us down.

203
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:16,500
OK.

204
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,275
I will submit the transfer application on the official website later on.

205
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,475
Thank you.

206
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,575
ADC continue to carry.

207
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,825
Push them home.

208
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,400
Destroy the inhibitor quickly.

209
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,400
Minions. Minions. Minions.

210
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,125
What is this?

211
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,125
What are you doing?

212
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,475
Who find you?

213
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,625
What are you thinking? Qi Yue!

214
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,150
Master. Let me have another around with him.

215
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:45,950
I am not convinced.

216
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:46,900
Are you through?

217
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,125
Master. Shut up.

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,050
Nicely win.

219
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,300
Alright.

220
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,600
The lost and win of one game

221
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,725
can't represent anything.

222
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,850
But what I hope

223
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,550
all of you see

224
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,600
is tactic.

225
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,175
Especially during the game,

226
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,275
The tactics are even more important.

227
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,225
Qi Yue.

228
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,500
Right now, you should know

229
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,900
why you lost.

230
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:17,750
Anyone else wants to challenge?

231
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,050
OK.

232
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,800
Then, from now on,

233
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,600
Ji Xiangkong is your captain.

234
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,400
You need to listen to his commands.

235
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,125
Training according to his tactics.

236
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:29,425
Do you understand?

237
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,100
Xiangkong.

238
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:35,475
You are doing really well.

239
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,225
But at the aspect of tactics…

240
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Let me talk to him first.

241
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Qi Yue. Stop there!

242
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,350
Master. I don't want to play anymore.

243
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,700
I am not convinced.

244
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Before, when Pei Xi is here,

245
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,600
he let me play four guarantee one.

246
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,975
I am willing to do that.

247
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,775
But right now, let me call Ji Xiangkong captain.

248
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,225
Not possible!

249
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,400
Can he win me in solo?

250
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,825
The competition lately already proved.

251
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,525
Although you have strong personal ability,

252
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:15,775
but Ji Xiangkong

253
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,450
Is more suitable than you to be the captain.

254
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,200
Iconquer is about team spirit.

255
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,300
Master. Why even you

256
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,500
talk for that clumsy hand.

257
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,225
Shut up.

258
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,925
If you lose, you need to commit.

259
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,200
Your proud and arrogant

260
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:29,700
need to have a limit.

261
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,125
You are my apprentice,

262
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,825
also the founding member of VNG.

263
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:38,900
You need to be more broad-minded

264
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,875
and responsible.

265
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:48,400
I hope you can put down your distracting thoughts.

266
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:49,675
Play well in the competition.

267
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,625
Don't destroy your future because of a moment of success.

268
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,125
There is a long way in front.

269
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,575
Want to prove yourself

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,300
better than Ji Xiangkong.

271
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,275
Then prove to him in the game.

272
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,200
Do you understand?

273
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,575
Why are you here?

274
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,625
What's going on?

275
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,425
Who bullied our Qi young master?

276
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,125
Who else can be?

277
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:31,375
Ji Xiangkong.

278
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,600
I will kick him out someday.

279
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,850
I heard you position as the captain 

280
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,675
has been replaced by him.

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,525
If wasn't sister Wen protecting him,

282
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,850
what he can do?

283
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:43,800
You say, this Ji Xiangkong.

284
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,150
What's his background?

285
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,325
Come without a word.

286
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,050
Who knows.

287
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,225
Ji Xiangkong.

288
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,450
Taking over my position as the leader.

289
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,825
I won't let him have any good day.

290
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:54,825
Bothersome！Don't talk about this.

291
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:55,850
Would you like going for a ride with me?

292
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,825
You are messing up my hair.

293
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,700
What? Are you going to meet Pei Xi again?

294
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,350
You have such a handsome boyfriend here.

295
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,675
You don't spend time with me, but go for other men.

296
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,650
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,975
Why do you believe the words of netizens?

298
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:12,425
And

299
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:13,325
You should know

300
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,200
the thing about duo que.

301
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,650
The thing about duo que.

302
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:16,975
The thing about duo que is that

303
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,725
I used his account 

304
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,375
to duo play with you and teach Qiu Ying a lesson.

305
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,375
And what's the result?

306
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,375
My girlfriend

307
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,875
becomes Pei Xi's gossip girlfriend.

308
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,150
Alright. Alright. Alright.

309
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,175
My Qi young master is the best.

310
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,150
OK?

311
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,400
How about this? tomorrow.

312
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,550
My time tomorrow

313
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,575
only belongs to you.

314
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,200
How about that?

315
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,600
Today, I am really not available.

316
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,375
I have to meet

317
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,675
the organizer of the Star of Tomorrow.

318
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:45,350
You are going to the competition?

319
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:48,725
I have someone familiar at GDV.

320
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,650
I make a call for you.

321
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,700
No need. No need.

322
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,700
I already find a way.

323
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,700
It's not early. I have to leave first.

324
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,850
Bye bye.

325
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:17,850
Look good.

326
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,125
You look formal.

327
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,175
OK. Let me introduce

328
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,650
our working procedure at here.

329
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,850
Anyway, it's early and late shifts.

330
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,100
Early starts at ten.

331
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,050
Later starts at two.

332
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,825
There is one hour of break between.

333
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:29,950
Rotation system.

334
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,025
That's all, basically.

335
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,325
Ok. I know.

336
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,150
Fine. Let me find someone

337
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,275
guide you through here.

338
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,250
OK.

339
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,525
Pei Xi.

340
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:42,525
Pei Xi.

341
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,625
Come here.

342
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,075
Come Quickly. Come.

343
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,700
Show the newbie around.

344
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:58,700
I am busy.

345
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,750
What? What are you busy at?

346
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,425
I am really busy.

347
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,075
I am creating an opportunity for you.

348
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,625
What opportunity?

349
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,850
I already asked.

350
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,150
Ji Xiangkong and Qiu Ying are not couple.

351
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,775
How do you know that?

352
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,825
Ji Xiangkong told me in person.

353
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,325
Then, I know.

354
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,450
What do you mean by opportunity?

355
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,500
Is there water inside your head?

356
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,550
Just listen to me.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,100
Let's go. Go. Go.

358
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,975
Well. Sorry to trouble you.

359
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,875
Go.

360
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,500
No.

361
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,175
Why I have to do this?

362
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:47,800
Because I am the boss.

363
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,325
You are the staff. You have to listen to me.

364
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,050
Go. Go quickly. Go with him

365
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:53,850
Thanks boss!

366
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,625
You are welcome. Bye bye.

367
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,350
Let's go.

368
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,450
Or forget it.

369
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,300
I can do it by myself. This is the procedure.

370
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,775
I

371
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,225
need to go for another interview tomorrow.

372
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,825
Then, when you bak home lately,

373
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,325
send me the information

374
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:13,800
and email to me. It's that alright?

375
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,450
OK. OK.

376
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,900
Thanks!

377
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,025
Yiyi, I am leaving first.

378
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,025
Bye bye. OK. Bye.

379
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,700
See you tomorrow. Take it slow.

380
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,150
Lu Yiyi. I.

381
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,725
What's wrong with you?

382
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,150
I scared, scared you?

383
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,425
I need to buy you dinner for compensation.

384
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,925
Let's go. That.

385
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,450
I know a very good Sichuan restaurant.

386
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,575
Trying to buy me off?

387
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,375
Not like that.

388
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,125
Tell me. Why are you here for?

389
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:43,850
I. I invite you to dinner

390
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,725
means I have something to bother you.

391
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,525
How can I? Am I that kind of person?

392
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,675
No.

393
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,400
Actually, there is something.

394
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,275
I. I. I want you 

395
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,200
investigate on Zhang yang for me.

396
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,400
Investigate him?

397
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,550
He is indeed not a good person.

398
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:04,425
But am I that familiar with you?

399
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,200
Why should I help you>

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
I am leaving.

401
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,175
Wait. Come back.

402
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,225
Aren't you a great reporter?

403
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Punish the evil, promote the good, deliver the justice.

404
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,475
Aren't these the responsibility of reporters?

405
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:21,750
And what's more.

406
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,025
Checking the underhand business of Zhang Yang clear.

407
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,800
This will shock the whole industry.

408
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,425
What a nice chance to make a name for yourself.

409
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,175
This chance

410
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:29,975
I can't give to others

411
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:30,625
but you.

412
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,775
Stop. Stop. Stop.

413
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,050
I can't take this.

414
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,775
You already seen.

415
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:38,200
I am just an editor of a small magazine company.

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,525
I don't have that such huge responsibility

417
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:41,350
Bye bye.

418
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,825
No. No.

419
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,375
Grandpa Lu. Grandma Lu.

420
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,075
Beauty Lu.

421
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,550
Beauty Lu, alright?

422
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:46,825
Are you looking for a fight?

423
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,350
I am telling you, if you follow me anymore,

424
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,400
I will call the police.

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,175
There is no use to call the police.

426
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,300
After I coming out,

427
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,025
I will still follow you.

428
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,425
You.

429
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,600
OK.

430
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,150
I am afraid of you. OK?

431
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
Help you. Help. Help.

432
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,375
chivalrous!

433
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:07,975
Let's go for dinner.

434
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,875
We talk while eating.

435
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,025
That Sichuan restaurant is wonderful.

436
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:12,025
There is a long line for it.

437
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,400
Right.

438
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,825
Are you familiar with Shu Wen in VNG?

439
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:20,600
Shu Wen, of course.

440
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,775
She is my former sister-in-law.

441
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,875
Former sister-in-law?

442
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:24,675
Right.

443
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,725
Ji Xiangkong. This scumbag。

444
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,550
Wait.

445
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,750
How's that related to my brother Kong?

446
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,375
What happened?

447
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,475
Wait. Why do you hit me?	

448
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:33,501
Do you eat or not, Lu Yiyi?

449
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:36,450
Here she is. Here she is.

450
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,150
Look at me later on.

451
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,275
Hello. These are your coffees.

452
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,175
Here you go. Be careful. It's hot.

453
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,675
Isn't this Qiu Ying?

454
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,425
That's weird.

455
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,675
Why are you here being a waitress?

456
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,225
The news about you and Ji Xiangkong online before,

457
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,750
We are really curious.

458
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,800
Is that true?

459
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,225
It's none of your business.

460
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,600
Wait. Don't go.

461
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Don't touch me.

462
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,625
Ji Xiangkong has Shu Wen now.

463
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:09,975
Are you being left out?

464
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,100
Bring a little notebook. You give that back to me.

465
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:19,550
What are you doing?

466
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,725
You are not welcomed at here.

467
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:21,675
Get out.

468
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,250
Isn't this Pei Xi?

469
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:24,700
What are you being proud of?

470
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:25,500
I ask you to leave.

471
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,150
Let's go. They drive us out.

472
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,625
Let's go. Don't play anymore.

473
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,900
Ji Xiangkong's.

474
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,500
Thank you.

475
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,825
If you have any trouble in the future,

476
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,425
You can ask me directly.

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,700
If I am here,

478
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,300
No one will bully you.

479
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
Former sister-in-law!

480
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,925
Lin Yixuan told me personally

481
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,425
that Shu Wen is his former sister-in-law.

482
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,625
Ji Xiangkong is his brother Kong.

483
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,150
The relationship between these.

484
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,750
Do you get my point?

485
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,200
He must joine VNG

486
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,771
to reunite with Shu Wen.

487
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,775
This liar.

488
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,325
Yiyi.

489
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,450
Later on, can you

490
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,775
not ask something like this from Lin Yi Xuan?

491
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:42,925
I asked these things from Lin Yixuan,

492
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,050
because I am afraid you've been cheated.

493
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,750
You are so silly.

494
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,975
Before you trapping in this,

495
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:50,125
I have to…

496
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:51,200
You overthink.

497
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:52,950
Right now, I

498
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,400
Don’t have time to think about these things.

499
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,375
I sold my house to pay the loan,

500
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:58,450
preparing for the competition of the Star of tomorrow,

501
00:23:58,825 --> 00:23:59,725
being waitress at MengLvRen.

502
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,025
I am very clear

503
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,225
what am I doing everyday.

504
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,450
Can I become a professional commentator or not.

505
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:06,375
This might be the only chance.

506
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:08,675
I have to try my best.

507
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,450
I can’t waste a single minute.

508
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:14,375
OK. OK. Ok.

509
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Don't talk about this now.

510
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:17,375
But you have to promise me

511
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,175
not seeing him later on.

512
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,950
The most important thing for you now

513
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,850
is to prepare well for this competition.

514
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,775
Don't worry.

515
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,825
You have been worked all day long.

516
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:30,225
Take a shower and go to sleep.

517
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:31,225
Alright.

518
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:32,675
You also need to sleep early.

519
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,200
You are back.

520
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,100
You play basketball?

521
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,050
Not anymore.

522
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
It has been here for a while.

523
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:13,950
Let me help you pump it up.

524
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,625
No need.

525
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,150
I want to throw this anyway.

526
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:20,750
OK.

527
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,725
Right. I have a problem

528
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,675
that I want to talk with you.

529
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:32,525
        Ok. Speak.

530
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,175
I recently looked up at your data record.

531
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,025
Discovering that you have played every position in game.

532
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:38,800
And you all played really well.

533
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,750
Then what do you think

534
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,475
is your position right now

535
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,425
suitable for you.

536
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,150
What do you mean?

537
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,025
You mean that

538
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:48,725
My level right now

539
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,050
can't play my position.

540
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,225
You mean that 

541
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:52,100
I've holden the team back.

542
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,900
Do you mean that?

543
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,400
Please check the data more carefully.

544
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,400
Which game I played has a problem?

545
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:00,075
No. That’ not what I mean.

546
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,025
Maybe I didn't

547
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:01,850
say it clear.

548
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:03,550
My point is that…

549
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,700
I want to say

550
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:14,850
Your every position

551
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,025
and every performance

552
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:17,075
is very stable.

553
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,625
Even like a straight line.

554
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,650
So from the other point of view,

555
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,925
does this means that you still have great potentials?

556
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,900
You just came to VNG as the captain.

557
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:32,550
You want to open the situation,

558
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,575
I understand deeply.

559
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
But I am this kind of person,

560
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,050
Very straightforward.

561
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,375
I don't like circling around.

562
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:39,750
So I advise you

563
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,500
don't spend energy on me.

564
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,750
Take care of yourself.

565
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:44,900
I just checked the data

566
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,850
and want to chat with you freely.

567
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,725
I think you

568
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:48,725
Still have great room for development.

569
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,550
Of course, how you tell others…

570
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,825
Right now, it's free time.

571
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,475
Can I go to sleep?

572
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:58,450
OK. Sorry.

573
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,875
Good night.

574
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,025
Tong Wu.

575
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,125
Can you eat all of these?

576
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
It' s also for brother Qi and brother Shen.

577
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,125
Good morning.

578
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,825
Morning.

579
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,050
You always buy these three.

580
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,925
Can you be more creative?

581
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,000
Buy buns next time.

582
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:04,900
I want meat buns.

583
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:06,600
OK.

584
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,150
Good morning, captain.

585
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:11,975
Morning.

586
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,275
Don't eat anything.

587
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,150
How can you have the strength

588
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,800
to fight with me?

589
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,525
Anyway, you will be beaten by me.

590
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,075
You know what tomorrow's most searched hashtags?

591
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:19,817
Prince of e-sports

592
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,650
beat clumsy-handed Ji Xiangkong.

593
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,450
Sister Wen. Good morning.

594
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:25,050
Sister Wen. Good morning.

595
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:28,825
Your breakfast is really rich.

596
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:32,875
Sister Wen.

597
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,425
Go out for a talk.

598
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,825
OK.

599
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,400
Take your time.

600
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,825
Go out for a talk.

601
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,625
What are they talking about in the morning?

602
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,125
I am not eating.

603
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,900
You just came to the team.

604
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,725
You need to give them some time

605
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:05,675
to adapt you.

606
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,100
But Qi Yue, this person

607
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,325
easily get excited.

608
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,825
Sometimes, he speaks too straightforward.

609
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:13,700
Qi Yue is the founding member. He is proud and arrogant.

610
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,400
I guess when Pei Xi is here,

611
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,675
he also doesn't listen to him.

612
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,875
Shen Yue is a slippery fellow.

613
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
He is on the same side with Qi Yue right now.

614
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:23,500
But not necessarily being convinced by him.

615
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,775
What about others?

616
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,250
Lu Sheng's skill is well-rounded,

617
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,925
But he seems 

618
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,325
to be disillusioned with the mortal world.

619
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,375
He only asks for stability, but not going forward.

620
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,425
Tong Wu is the youngest.

621
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,400
He is also the one with least courage.

622
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,600
But all in all,

623
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,950
they have strong ability.

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,630
Good job. Only after few days,

625
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,227
You already figured out these people's characteristics and tempers.

626
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,100
The autumn season game is coming soon.

627
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,375
Time is limited.

628
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:54,000
But I already analyzed all their datas.

629
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,300
Later on,

630
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:56,750
It's to make the proper training plan

631
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,075
according to their characteristics.

632
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,050
Then you need to try harder.

633
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:03,900
Or it's hard to employ your training plan. 

634
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,325
But don't worry. If you have any problem,

635
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,125
I will fix for you in the first place.

636
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:09,925
Thanks sister Wen.

637
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,450
I know what to do.

638
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,250
It's might be a little risky,

639
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:15,425
But don't worry, sister Wen.

640
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,071
No matter what I do,

641
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,375
Please let me go through it.

642
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,850
Since I find you here,

643
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:22,975
I will give full support to you.

644
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:30,100
Master. This Ji Xiangkong

645
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,025
is a gigolo.

646
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,325
Sister Wen trusts him so much.

647
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,950
I think he must bewitched sister Wen.

648
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,175
It's all made up by the media.

649
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,975
You actually believe that?

650
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,350
Master. Don't you worry that

651
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,500
Sister Wen and Ji Xiangkong…

652
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:42,425
Stop.

653
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,625
What kind of person Shu Wen is,

654
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,575
I know better than anyone does.

655
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,400
Master.

656
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,050
Why are you bearing this?

657
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:53,675
Qi Yue.

658
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,150
My thing is none of your business.

659
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:58,225
You just work hard on training and take the competition seriously.

660
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,275
Coming up with some real stuff

661
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,975
is more important than anything else.

662
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,025
Don't forget

663
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:04,025
what I've said to you before.

664
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,425
OK. I know, master.

665
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:12,100
I will go training now.

666
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:13,075
Go.

667
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,350
Pei Xi.

668
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,675
Pei Xi. Why don't you rely

669
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,100
my text message to you.

670
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:39,350
I don't have time.

671
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,025
Pei Xi. I know you are busy.

672
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,250
So I come in advance 

673
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,225
to see you.

674
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,850
Or, let's have a chat?

675
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,925
Have you eaten yet?

676
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,800
Don't disturb my work.

677
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,625
I come here

678
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,625
to study this time.

679
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,850
I am here for 

680
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,850
Teacher Luo Tian's commentary.

681
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:02,650
Aren't you a hostess?

682
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,850
Why is game commentary related to you?

683
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:04,925
How come not related?

684
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
It's related to me for sure.

685
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,325
I attend

686
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,900
the Star of Tomorrow competition.

687
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,325
I decided to transfer from hostess 

688
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,000
to profissional commentator.

689
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:13,500
In that way,

690
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,650
later on, we can

691
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,075
meet very often at the game.

692
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,100
You also want to be a commentator.

693
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:20,200
Right.

694
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,150
Who else want to be?

695
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,025
Who else besides me?

696
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,975
Waitress. Waitress.

697
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,250
What’s wrong with this computer.

698
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,975
It’s powered off.

699
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:37,900
Qiu Ying?

700
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:40,175
Waitress.

701
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:41,250
Coming.

702
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,025
Ok. I give bring it to you in a moment.

703
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,075
Hello.

704
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,525
What do you want?

705
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,775
I am a little thirsty.

706
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,350
What do you have for drink?

707
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:03,850
Please introduce to me.

708
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,650
Right. Take a look by yourself.

709
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,850
The text on the menu is too small.

710
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,325
Or, how about reading to me?

711
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,500
We have scented tea, juice,

712
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,150
Nongfu Spring, and Scream.

713
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,975
What do you want?

714
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,975
Only these few things?

715
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:21,475
Do you have coffee?

716
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:23,975
Yes. Cappuccino.

717
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:26,400
OK.

718
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,950
Give me a cup of Cappuccino.

719
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,525
Wait a second.

720
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,075
I need to do commentary recently.

721
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,375
So the water temperature can't be too high.

722
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,075
My throat can't stand that.

723
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,225
Also I have a bad stomach.

724
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,950
The temperature can't be too low.

725
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,400
Also. Also. Also.

726
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,375
I, recently,

727
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,750
am on a diet,

728
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:56,325
So I don't want milk or sugar.

729
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:57,975
Do you remember that?

730
00:33:58,825 --> 00:33:59,975
If you don't want milk.

731
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,625
It can only be American.

732
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,550
But I ordered Cappuccino.

733
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,050
Sorry about that.

734
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,650
We don't know how to make

735
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,675
a cup of Cappuccino without milk.

736
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,300
What's your attitude?

737
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,450
Be careful. I will complain this.

738
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:15,225
Pei Xi. Did you see that?

739
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,475
That's an outrage.

740
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,050
We only have one kind of coffee today.

741
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:22,025
Latte. It's free.

742
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:34,000
Pei Xi.

743
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:35,750
Thanks for helping me out.

744
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,550
You think too much.

745
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:39,850
I am not helping you.

746
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:43,000
We have limited staffs at here.

747
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:44,600
There are so many customers waiting.

748
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,000
Remember.

749
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,850
Do your business well.

750
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,375
I know.

751
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:58,375
Waiter. Where is the commentary section?

752
00:34:59,025 --> 00:35:00,675
Here. This way please.

753
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's go.

754
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,600
Waitress.

755
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:04,775
Coming.

756
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,850
Come here to see what's wrong with my computer?

757
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,700
OK.

758
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,975
Is it hard to choose?

759
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,825
I don't know what you mean.

760
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:36,725
You have to choose one,

761
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:38,050
so brother I can help you.

762
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:40,350
I don't need your help.

763
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,350
I think you are too bored.

764
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,600
Or, do you want both of them?

765
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,950
Alright. Bad boy.

766
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,425
You have my grace before.

767
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,950
Do you want some advices?

768
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,850
I said, I don't need.

769
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,000
Good boy. You finally grow up.

770
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:02,550
Learn to think by yourself.

771
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,750
Do you want me to advice you

772
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,525
as one who has been through the experience.

773
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,225
Are you free now?

774
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,725
The bar is short of people.

775
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,050
Do you want to help?

776
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:13,850
Do I look free to you?

777
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,550
I am overwhelmed by your settlement.

778
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:19,975
Teacher Luo.

779
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,100
Teacher Luo is here.

780
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,050
He is running faster than anyone else.

781
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,000
What did you do on Pei Xi?

782
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,125
He's shy. Adolescence

783
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,525
You are gossiping on his personal life again, right?

784
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,525
How can this be gossip?

785
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,650
I am his brother.

786
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,050
I have the responsibility as an elder member of the family.

787
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,850
What time is it?

788
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,850
It's time. Go in there.

789
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,350
What a show!

790
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,775
We've devote much thoughts on this.

791
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,325
Come on. Lots of people are waiting for you.

792
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,150
Here.

793
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,750
Teacher Luo.

794
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,450
Teacher Luo is here.

795
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,700
You are so famous. Teacher Luo.

796
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,475
Every summoner,

797
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,275
Good afternoon.

798
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,550
This is 

799
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,300
the famous commentator 

800
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,125
in our e-sports field,

801
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,000
teacher Luo Tian.

802
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,375
I believe everyone knows him.

803
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,150
Yes.

804
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,450
Teacher Luo Tian

805
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:20,025
is the first time here at MengLvRen.

806
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,400
From now on, every week,

807
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,275
teacher Luo Tian

808
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:23,950
will come to MengLvren

809
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,625
to do commentary on past games.

810
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,725
Let's welcome him.

811
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,825
Teacher Luo.

812
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,175
I the hostess at UXStar Iconquer version, Qiao Xin.

813
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:34,875
I really really admire you.

814
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,050
Thanks!

815
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,400
I also admire you.

816
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:39,775
Go there. Talk nicely.

817
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,725
It's all on you.

818
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:45,250
Hello everyone, I am Luo Tian.

819
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,750
Welcome to attend

820
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,250
     my offline commentary on past games.

821
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,575
Today, I will do commentary on 

822
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:51,850
the final game of internal test.

823
00:37:55,875 --> 00:38:01,675
This game is VNG winning Legends overwhelmingly as two versus zero.

824
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,125
Because this is the new internal test.

825
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,200
Every team must choose

826
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,075
at least one new version champion.

827
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:09,550
But during this game,

828
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:12,050
Legends chose two new champions,

829
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,750
in one versus zero, a losing situation.

830
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:16,525
See.

831
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,325
This round of competition, from line-up,

832
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,675
Legends was actually the one in advantage.

833
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:22,250
By supporting 

834
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,125
The fixed-point control of the deep sea prisoner.

835
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,675
Lu Feng’s balance…

836
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,550
It's useless.

837
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,075
What?

838
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,575
Writing notes so crazily

839
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:32,800
is useless.

840
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Then what is useful?

841
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,775
You ask Luo Tian directly.

842
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,775
Such an close professional

843
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,600
in front of you.

844
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,500
You ask him directly

845
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,325
is ten times better than writing notes.

846
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,925
It makes some sense.

847
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:50,525
With such a brain,

848
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,150
you want to be a commentator.

849
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:57,100
Of course, the key 

850
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,400
is this team fight.

851
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:01,150
What can you 

852
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,550
see from this?

853
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,025
Teacher Luo Tian. I have a question.

854
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,850
Very active.

855
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:07,975
Right.

856
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,450
I want to be a commentator like you in the future.

857
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,300
So I will definitely

858
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,100
study hard and learn from you.

859
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,025
OK. So, what can you

860
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,000
see from this?

861
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,600
I think Ji Xiangkong entered first,

862
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,300
not able to carry.

863
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,650
After his death, he can't cooperate with his teammates.

864
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,550
That's the reason for the lost.

865
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,575
Anyone else

866
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,875
has a different opinion?

867
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:36,200
Teacher Luo.

868
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,800
I think the key of the lost

869
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,325
is on this team fight.

870
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:45,075
I think it's not Ji Xiangkong's fault,

871
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,850
But his teammates

872
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,950
who didn't backed him up well.

873
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,575
This caused the bad ADC of VNG

874
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,250
and the counter killing.

875
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:54,400
That's right.

876
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,200
The real reason is

877
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,300
Huo Yao's fault.

878
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,200
At the most important moment,

879
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,450
he missed the skill.

880
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,200
The support at Legends

881
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,600
fought with Pei Xi's Hell Angel

882
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,700
every time

883
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,975
with fiercely fighting style.

884
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,975
Not as simple as a mistake.

885
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:07,025
Very negative position.

886
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,150
This lead to 

887
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,925
the later failure of Legends.

888
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:14,550
Today’s commentary on past game

889
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,750
is over.

890
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,625
Later on, I will

891
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,800
present more competition

892
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,500
commentary at MengLvRen.

893
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,025
Hope everyone can continue to support

894
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:22,150
our IConquer Competition!

895
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,150
Thanks so much!

896
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,775
Thanks teacher Luo.

897
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:27,675
Can I take a photo with you?

898
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:31,950
I want to take too!

899
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:39,625
Thanks!

900
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,500
It's my turn. My turn.

901
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:41,275
Teacher Luo Tian.

902
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:43,825
Thanks teacher Luo Tian.

903
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:44,700
Thanks teacher, fighting!

904
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,000
Step on me!

905
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,500
Teacher Luo, nice to meet you.

906
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,500
Brother Summer just said

907
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,925
he will wait for you at the bar section.

908
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,850
OK.

909
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,925
Teacher. Let me lead

910
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,025
you to the resting area.

911
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,475
He will be here soon.

912
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,425
Here. Then.

913
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,250
I just sit here.

914
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,325
Teacher Luo.

915
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,525
Anything to drink?

916
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:13,475
We have everything here.

917
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,125
No need. Go ahead and do what you need to.

918
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:18,000
Just find me whenever he is done with his business.

919
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Teacher Luo.

920
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:34,100
Do you want me to sign?

921
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,000
You are my idol.

922
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:38,850
I not only want get signed,

923
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,650
I also have

924
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,625
lots of questions on being a commentator

925
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,700
for you.

926
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,250
This is my notebook.

927
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,650
Have me met before?

928
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:52,600
Luo Tian. What do you think?

929
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:54,175
The trainer's practice right now

930
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,475
is so informal?

931
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,450
I remembered you.

932
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,350
GDV's commentary room.

933
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:03,725
Teacher Luo. I.

934
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:05,225
I am so sorry.

935
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:07,025
I don't mean it that day.

936
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,450
A person who can’t even left his head.

937
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,675
How can you convinced me that

938
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:16,375
you have confidence at the commentary table?

939
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,200
Ok. Ok.

940
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,475
I know. I know.

941
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,600
Not a problem.

942
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:31,600
Do whatever I said.

943
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,975
Alright. Alright. Alright.

944
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,875
OK. OK. OK.

945
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:35,450
I. I. I.

946
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,675
I am not talking to you. Someone comes.

947
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,825
OK. I know that.

948
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:39,600
I know.

949
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,275
All right.

950
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:41,125
Bye bye.

951
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,200
Teacher Luo Tian.

952
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,750
Your waitress at MengLvRen

953
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:50,275
has high idea.

954
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,325
You have discovered.

955
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:56,925
I admit.

956
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,350
I arranged that on purpose.

957
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,100
I don't want you to think

958
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,625
That I get her in through backdoor.

959
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,800
This is not called backdoor?

960
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,700
But, if she can convince you

961
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,225
to make opportunity for her 

962
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:12,000
to get closer to me,

963
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,900
She has got a way.

964
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,625
She doesn’t use any method.

965
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,825
She works really hard.

966
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:18,350
You know?

967
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,925
To study at my place,

968
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
in one month,

969
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,975
she became the first place in the district.

970
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,300
She comes the first and leaves the latest everyday.

971
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,550
It's hard to see a girl like this.

972
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,525
You can be convince to help her by these?

973
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,050
I met too many amateur hostess like her.

974
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,775
They work really hard on surface,

975
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:32,975
But after all,

976
00:43:32,975 --> 00:43:34,825
they need to attract fans with beauty and talent shows.

977
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,825
She tries whatever she can to take advantage of other's popularity.

978
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,650
This kind of girl with nothing but a suit.

979
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,125
We don't need her in our commentary circle.

980
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,550
I understand your worries.

981
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:44,450
I just

982
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,850
give her a chance.

983
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,775
Whether it works or not,

984
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:47,875
depends on her hardworking.

985
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,550
But I can promise you

986
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,600
that she is definitely not

987
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,375
the kind of person you just said.

988
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:52,625
How can you be so sure?

989
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:56,900
Summer.

990
00:43:57,575 --> 00:43:58,850
I haven't seen you be so keen

991
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,450
to someone for so many years.

992
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,250
I really appreciate her.

993
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,825
You say, this little girl

994
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,525
looks pretty.

995
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:07,975
She can rely on her beauty,

996
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,050
but she want to rely on talent.

997
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:10,000
This kind of girl

998
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,200
is very limited now.

999
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,325
Isn't you the one who always say

1000
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,125
you are in short of people there.

1001
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:13,800
Tell me the truth.

1002
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,775
It’s Pei Xi.

1003
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,075
You know. Pei Xi

1004
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:25,875
likes her.

1005
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:28,125
Why didn't you say it earlier?

1006
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:31,150
It's future sister-in-law.

1007
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,825
Is she my future sister-in-law or not,

1008
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't know yet.

1009
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:33,900
What's more important

1010
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,850
is that I appreciate her too.

1011
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:36,075
But you know,

1012
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:37,175
I have a high demand.

1013
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,075
Not anyone

1014
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,025
can be appreciated by me.

1015
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:39,950
I know.

1016
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,275
That’s why you are the superior.

1017
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:44,107
Superior is different than normal person.

1018
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,500
You can lead anyone.

1019
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,300
Very impressive.

1020
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,975
Ok. Ok. Come.

1021
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:47,825
I toast you in tea instead of wine.

1022
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:48,575
Right. Right. Right.

1023
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,675
Pretending to be true.

1024
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,125
Hey, Yiyi.

1025
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,800
You say, if I rush in there now

1026
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,950
to find teacher Luo.

1027
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,100
Am I seemed to be too eager for success.

1028
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,875
I am telling you,

1029
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:04,200
Thick skin can do big thing.

1030
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,125
OK.

1031
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:06,950
Go for it.

1032
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,075
They are coming out.

1033
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,025
I tell you later on at home. Bye!

1034
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,175
When will you come next time?

1035
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,150
I call you. OK.

1036
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:14,900
Teacher Luo.

1037
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:18,975
Teacher Luo.

1038
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:22,350
I am sorry.

1039
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:23,525
I know I might 

1040
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,075
behave really bad just now.

1041
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,900
But, I rally want to

1042
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,450
be a professional commentator.

1043
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,000
Maybe, you think I am

1044
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,225
too rush right now.

1045
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,525
But I will

1046
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:33,600
keep on doing this.

1047
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:34,800
So,

1048
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,325
So…

1049
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,375
So what?

1050
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,500
So

1051
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:51,325
I want to be your student.

1052
00:45:58,246 --> 00:45:59,250
Everyone can say slogans.

1053
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,525
Everyone can make determination.

1054
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,150
Then tell me,

1055
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,800
what's special about you?

1056
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,775
It's fine. Nothing else.

1057
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:11,350
I am leaving first.

1058
00:46:12,025 --> 00:46:12,625
You.

1059
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,000
You. You. You.

1060
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Drive slow on your way home.

1061
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,875
Alright. It’s fine.

1062
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,725
He is very strict about others all the time.

1063
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:28,575
But,

1064
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,050
he never accept any students.

1065
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,425
You are so brave!

1066
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,075
Then,

1067
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,500
does that means I don't have a chance anymore?

1068
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,650
It's not out of chance.

1069
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,375
I think

1070
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,425
what he says by that means

1071
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,475
don't say slogan everything,

1072
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:45,100
do some practical work,

1073
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:47,225
and prove your speciality.

1074
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,375
Does he mean that? Yes.

1075
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:51,550
I have known him for so many years.

1076
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,350
He has always been like this.

1077
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:55,325
Then. That means

1078
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:56,425
I still have a chance?

1079
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,400
Yes, you do. But chance

1080
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,700
need to be earned by yourself.

1081
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:04,616
Tell a secret to you.

1082
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:05,875
The Star of Tomorrow.

1083
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,425
Teacher Luo Tian will be the main examiner.

1084
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,725
Didn't you sign up for it?

1085
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,125
Show your efforts in front of him.

1086
00:47:12,425 --> 00:47:14,050
Then. Will he be there at the scene?

1087
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Don’t tell people I said this.

1088
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:18,325
Thanks boss! Thanks boss!

1089
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:19,575
I will try my best.

1090
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,475
OK. Don't call me boss anymore.

1091
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,225
Call me brother Summer.

1092
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,725
Thanks! Brother Summer.
