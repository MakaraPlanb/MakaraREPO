Episode 19

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,740
Manager Zhao, where are you going?

3
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,660
Yes, where are you running to?

4
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,580
Aren't you very smart?

5
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,580
Don't touch me.

6
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,300
Don't move, where are you going?

7
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm telling you, don't touch me.

8
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,700
Why are you running?

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,690
Where are you going?

10
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,810
- Where are you going?

11
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,810
Don't touch me.

12
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,490
Don't touch me.

13
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,050
Anyway, today none of you touch me!

14
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,130
Why are you shouting?

15
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,130
Stop.

16
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,970
What are you guys doing?

17
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,790
Are you guys rebelling?

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,950
Stand properly.

19
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,430
Do you see this?

20
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,710
These are the people you taught.

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,270
Is it necessary

22
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,430
to eradicate me?

23
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,910
Go.

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,910
Coach.

25
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,220
Manager Zhao,

26
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,900
Be careful of your step, Manager Zhao.

27
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,540
Manager, if we're fated, we'll meet again.

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,240
You guys grew abilities?

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
- No.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
No, Coach.

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,240
We were just joking.

32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,280
Shut up.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
The few of you

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,600
including you

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,600
report to the field.

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,640
Each one of you will run 50 rounds as punishment.

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,800
Now.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,110
Immediately.

39
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,670
50 rounds.

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,710
Right now.

41
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,950
Go.

42
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,660
They seem very energetic.

43
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,180
Is 50 rounds too little?

44
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,850
Let's rest for a while.

45
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,490
Let's rest for a bit, I can't run anymore.

46
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,290
Yao ge, about today...

47
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,250
We'll still be good brothers in future.

48
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,650
The thing that I've kept secret

49
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,930
is finally out.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,880
We did hit fox Zhao well today.

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,040
But today,

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Pei Xi blocked Zhao Yang's loftiness.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
It's as if he had vengeance against him.

54
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,470
Let me tell you.

55
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,670
If they didn't bicker,

56
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,670
then Pei Xi

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,390
is hitting he who's down.

58
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,470
Pei Xi, Pei-

59
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,380
Coach Luo asked us to run as punishment,

60
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,740
what's it to do with you?

61
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,620
I was the one who

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,020
caused him to fall.

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,460
He did it?

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,620
Let's go.

65
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Leader, you're good.

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,840
Leader, look.

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
[Breaking insider news!] Gaming industry's pest Zhao Yang framed Legends' ex member, Ji Xiang Kong.

68
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,320
[Breaking insider news!] Gaming industry's pest Zhao Yang framed Legends' ex member, Ji Xiang Kong.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,380
Serves Zhao Yang right for being caught.

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,900
Serve him right.

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Makes people happy.

72
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,380
Yes.

73
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,660
I didn't expect Legends' Zhao Yang

74
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,740
to be so mean.

75
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,820
Lu Yi Yi's article is written

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,740
- That's of course.

77
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,740
really well.

78
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,260
Look how supportive our Lu Yi Yi is.

79
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,740
Finally,

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,180
we got our revenge for Kong ge and Qiu Ying.

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,260
Serves Zhao Yang right.

82
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Well done.

83
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,460
Good.

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,810
It was done decently.

85
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,890
Really?

86
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,130
That's good.

87
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,170
Then, tomorrow I'll show this to Teacher Luo.

88
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,690
Oh right.

89
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,610
Tell me.

90
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,970
How did you capture the

91
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,750
high and mighty Teacher Luo?

92
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,750
What do you mean capture?

93
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,470
You don't even know

94
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,750
how badly he scolded me.

95
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,870
I'll imitate it for you.

96
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,030
He went like this.

97
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,190
"Qiu Ying's commentary

98
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,750
is completely not a commentary.

99
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,030
You

100
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,750
are just repeating

101
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,990
what others see.

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,910
In future,

103
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,030
don't let me see such

104
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,270
useless things again."

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,750
You're good.

106
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,030
You imitated him pretty well.

107
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,750
He already scolded you like that.

108
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,270
You still want to show him the video?

109
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,980
As long as he's willing to watch it,

110
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,540
it's doesn't matter how badly he scolds me.

111
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,620
Why not we do this?

112
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
I'm pretty familiar

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,800
with Teacher Luo.

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,360
Do you want me to use my relations?

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,080
Who was the one who said

116
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
this industry of ours

117
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,760
to take short cuts?

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,760
doesn't need pretty people who wants

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
Who? Who is so blind?

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
Saying such superficial and childish words.

121
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
If I knew,

122
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,680
I wouldn't forgive you.

123
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,230
Sorry.

124
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
I'll interrupt for a bit.

125
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,550
We are only left with a cake.

126
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,230
Since the two of you are a couple,

127
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,630
why don't you share it?

128
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,390
No.

129
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,820
You misunderstood.

130
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,540
We aren't a couple.

131
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,020
It's okay.

132
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,820
you're not a couple.

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,820
You can still share a cake even if

134
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,700
Enjoy.

135
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,140
Thank you.

136
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,610
Why not

137
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,170
you eat it?

138
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,370
This is a strawberry cake.

139
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,610
You like those.

140
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,130
Then, you should eat it.

141
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,330
I'm a grown man, how can I

142
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,570
let the girl starve?

143
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,850
Why not we do this?

144
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,690
Just like he said,

145
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,450
the two of us

146
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,850
enjoy it together?

147
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,530
I'm done cutting it.

148
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,970
What are you laughing at?

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm done cutting the cake.

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,320
Let's eat.

151
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,040
This-

152
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,060
A heart was cut into two by you.

153
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,180
If not, how should I cut it?

154
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,460
Cut it horizontally?

155
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,220
Here.

156
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,540
Teacher Ji.

157
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,460
Are you free tomorrow?

158
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,100
I'll bring you to somewhere fun.

159
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Where are we going?

160
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,420
to cheer me on?

161
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,420
Are you looking for somewhere

162
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,660
That's right.

163
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,110
It's so crowded here today.

164
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,670
Look, there's a castle there.

165
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,230
There's also so many

166
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,070
cartoon shops here.

167
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,950
There's balloons there too.

168
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,510
Too pretty.

169
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,430
You also like it?

170
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,310
Let's take a picture together.

171
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,030
Come, stand here.

172
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,110
Flaunt in front of everyone.

173
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,950
Three, two, one, come.

174
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,580
Come, let's take a selfie.

175
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,360
Okay, let's go play with something else.

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,480
Xiang Kong.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Over there. There's a dumbo,

178
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,880
Peter pan and Winnie the pooh.

179
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
There's not much queue.

180
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Why don't we-

181
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
Wait a minute.

182
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,950
You brought me here today.

183
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,510
In order to cheer me on.

184
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,110
You at least have to ask me

185
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,230
what I like to play right?

186
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,670
I know.

187
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,950
But,

188
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,070
we have a lot of time today.

189
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,140
Don't worry.

190
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,180
As long as it's what you like,

191
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,460
I'll accompany you on it.

192
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,860
You said it yourself.

193
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,900
I want to ride that.

194
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,340
Tron lightcycle power run.

195
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,900
I heard it's really exciting and fast.

196
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,810
I know this ride.

197
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,810
Isn't it like a roller coaster?

198
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,970
But, I feel that

199
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,970
we already entered the park.

200
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,610
Isn't it too exciting?

201
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,530
You're the one who suggested coming here.

202
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,290
You can't be scared right?

203
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,850
What's there for me to fear?

204
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,600
Don't worry.

205
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,920
We're here to relieve your boredom today.

206
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,680
I'll play everything

207
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
that you like with you.

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,040
Loyal enough.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
Let's go.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,560
What's wrong?

211
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
That-

212
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,390
Let's go play some milder

213
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,110
games first.

214
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Tron lightcycle power run

215
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Then, I'll play the

216
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,790
with you, okay?

217
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,630
Okay.

218
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,670
As long as you're willing to accompany me,

219
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,430
we can play anything.

220
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,410
This is fun.

221
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,650
Let's ride this.

222
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,060
All your dishes are served, enjoy.

223
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,620
- Thank you.

224
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,620
Thank you.

225
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,180
These dishes are so cute.

226
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,300
Thankfully, it isn't crowded at this time today.

227
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,940
We played so many games the whole afternoon.

228
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,010
After we finish our lunch,

229
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,330
let's go ride Tron lightcycle power run.

230
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,450
What's wrong?

231
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,890
You definitely can tolerate that standard.

232
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,830
But I didn't expect that,

233
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,510
I could play so well with you today.

234
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,510
It was really beyond my expectations.

235
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,070
Really?

236
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,870
Then, as long as you're happy,

237
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,470
I'm willing to do anything.

238
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,150
Let's eat quickly.

239
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,750
Oh right.

240
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,350
Today, I saw that there were tourists

241
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,430
participating in "the first" event.

242
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,470
Share the interesting moments

243
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,060
in the theme park online.

244
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,820
Really?

245
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,300
I feel that's pretty meaningful.

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,860
Then we

247
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,660
took so many photos,

248
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
let's participate too.

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,060
Okay.

250
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,440
I think this picture is not bad.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
Let's name it

252
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,560
"The First fairy tale that was lighted".

253
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,880
Okay, okay, let's use this.

254
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
Okay, let's have a look at others.

255
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,750
I think this is really good too.

256
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,510
Your eyes are closed too.

257
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,510
Let's use this.

258
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,830
Name it

259
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,700
"The first time it was so bright,

260
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,700
my eyes couldn't open."

261
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,780
You want to post my ugly photo?

262
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,340
You have some too, okay?

263
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,700
Show it to me.

264
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,330
I have many.

265
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,970
Let me ask you

266
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,090
when you're playing in these entertainment facilities

267
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,890
are you really not afraid?

268
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm not.

269
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,490
I already said I'm not afraid.

270
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,930
You said that you're not afraid.

271
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,240
Look at this shot of you.

272
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,240
I feel like you're so nervous.

273
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,040
You still dare to say you didn't close your eyes.

274
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
You also closed your eyes okay?

275
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,680
This is coincidental.

276
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,630
You also closed your eyes here

277
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,670
coincidentally.

278
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,550
Okay.

279
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Actually,

280
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,060
you're not as brave as

281
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,180
you think you are.

282
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,500
wanted to accompany me.

283
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,500
You're riding because you

284
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,780
It's also not entirely true.

285
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,530
Ji Xiang Kong.

286
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,210
Thank you.

287
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,730
Because you're here

288
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,650
I have the strength to

289
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,650
ride those rides that I'm always

290
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,280
interested but scared to play.

291
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,360
Besides,

292
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
you're accompanying me.

293
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,780
When I was screaming,

294
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,900
I felt like

295
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,220
I was set free.

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,420
All my troubles

297
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,740
are gone in one wipe.

298
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,340
I hope it can be the same for you.

299
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,980
Taking on the upcoming

300
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,500
competition with some fighting spirit.

301
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,260
You're already so afraid.

302
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,380
Yet, you still want to accompany me.

303
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,500
Because you wanted to cheer me on.

304
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,940
Qiu Ying,

305
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,900
I should be thanking you.

306
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,210
Wait for me a while.

307
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,210
Where are you going?

308
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,470
Mickey.

309
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,190
Oh gosh.

310
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,070
I-

311
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,910
Can I get a picture with you?

312
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,590
Too awesome.

313
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,590
Then, teach me how to pose.

314
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,820
Fighting!

315
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,700
Thank you, Daisy Duck.

316
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,800
Thank you.

317
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
It's literally too perfect today.

318
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Could take pictures

319
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,800
with so many Disney friends.

320
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,320
Bye bye.

321
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
This way it's perfect.

322
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,710
Your princess dream is too simple.

323
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,270
Oh god.

324
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,140
Are these for me?

325
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,380
once you entered,

326
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,380
You were staring at these balloons

327
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,900
I saw it.

328
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,780
Thank you.

329
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,650
This too.

330
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,530
Today,

331
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,560
my princess dream is fulfilled completely.

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,600
Princess Qiu Ying,

333
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,680
your princess dream

334
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,000
just started.

335
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,630
Follow me.

336
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,900
Carousel.

337
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,460
Princess Qiu Ying.

338
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,770
Your carriage is already prepared for you.

339
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,210
Follow me.

340
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,970
Let's go.

341
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,940
Qiu Ying.

342
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,780
That expression...are you

343
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,260
imagining of things again?

344
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,380
I didn't.

345
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm just thinking

346
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
we played so many exciting rides

347
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
it was pretty fun.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,840
Why not...

349
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
we ride the Tron lightcycle power run.

350
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,560
I don't want you to have regrets.

351
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,320
Aren't you scared?

352
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
Don't force yourself.

353
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,040
As long as I have you

354
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,350
I have nothing to be afraid of.

355
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,230
Knight Ji Xiang Kong.

356
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,900
This is a order of Princess Qiu Ying.

357
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,060
I obey your command.

358
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,660
I'm not scared!

359
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,110
Princess Qiu Ying.

360
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,830
Is your wish fulfilled

361
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,710
today?

362
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,990
Not yet.

363
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,710
I hope that you

364
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,350
can go for the competition without worries.

365
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,180
Fighting.

366
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,260
Don't worry.

367
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,060
I will definitely get the champion trophy.

368
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,180
Ji Xiang Kong.

369
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,740
You are forever the best.

370
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
What are you doing?

371
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,340
I- about that

372
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,580
I was pondering about life.

373
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,980
No wait a while.

374
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,060
That-

375
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
Let's talk.

376
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,900
Quickly talk.

377
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,380
Don't waste my sleeping time.

378
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,100
That-

379
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,860
Thank you.

380
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,620
Don't be mistaken.

381
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,220
I'm not thanking you

382
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,140
for allowing me to rejoin the team.

383
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,570
I don't cherish it.

384
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,570
If it's not because Coach Luo-

385
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,050
What do you exactly want to say?

386
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,530
I heard that

387
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,830
about Zhao Yang,

388
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,830
you did a lot behind the scenes too.

389
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,990
Thank you for being rightful,

390
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,110
and placing righteousness before family.

391
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,830
Placing righteousness before family?

392
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,550
No.

393
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,070
I just want to apologise to you.

394
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,910
I misunderstood you previously.

395
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,190
like Zhao Yang.

396
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,190
I thought you were someone

397
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,790
So,

398
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,110
you admit that you're blind.

399
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,870
You're the one who's blind.

400
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,910
But,

401
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,430
this doesn't mean we've reconciled.

402
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,230
Do you understand?

403
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,230
An eye for an eye.

404
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,510
Besides, my Kong ge

405
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,860
left because of you.

406
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,100
I can't ever forgive you for this.

407
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,940
Do you know?

408
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,220
Let's not offend each other in future.

409
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,380
You-

410
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
For you.

411
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,280
Thank you.

412
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,120
Lu Yi Yi.

413
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,000
Because of the article that you've written,

414
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,600
now the whole company

415
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,600
has become so busy again.

416
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,310
What should I even say to you.

417
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,950
What's the use of saying sorry?

418
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,660
Chairman Ren.

419
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,580
Lu Yi Yi is from your department isn't it?

420
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,500
Yes.

421
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,140
She wrote the article this time too right?

422
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,860
Yes.

423
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,330
It's Lu Yi Yi again.

424
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,410
I feel that

425
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,690
This article is pretty good.

426
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,210
funds for you guys.

427
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,210
We have decided to provide more

428
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,490
For the convenience of your investigations.

429
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,410
Really?

430
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,810
Okay.

431
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,410
We'll definitely be cautious.

432
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,530
Okay.

433
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,930
Bye Chairman Ren, okay.

434
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,360
Director Shi.

435
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,600
It's all my fault.

436
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

437
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,510
You're going to bear it?

438
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,910
How are you going to?

439
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,910
I-

440
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,700
Why?

441
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,140
by leaving?

442
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,140
You want to end the trouble you caused

443
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,540
Who's going to care for your mess?

444
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,220
Then what do you want to-

445
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,660
Just now,

446
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,820
Chairman Ren

447
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,850
specially commended your article.

448
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,730
He said it received good feedback in the industry.

449
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,290
He wants us act fast.

450
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,610
On the next magazine,

451
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,850
he wants us to a special report.

452
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,560
And,

453
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,800
the company will give us some funds.

454
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,560
Specifically for interviews and

455
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
going to the news site.

456
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,960
Really?

457
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,140
Thank you Directore Shi.

458
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,020
Come, hold on to it.

459
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,260
If it wasn't for you,

460
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,940
continued doing nothing.

461
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,940
our company would have just

462
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,580
And wouldn't have survived after a few years.

463
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,860
We'd close and that'd be the end.

464
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,820
Our future

465
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
depends on you guys.

466
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,420
Don't worry Director.

467
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,060
It was always on us anyway.

468
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,300
We will work hard.

469
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:21,730
Fighting.

470
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,850
Fighting.

471
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,670
What are you doing?

472
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,590
That 8 minutes 45 seconds

473
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,430
team battle.

474
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,870
Three opponents were injured badly.

475
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,990
Your condition and position were very good.

476
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,670
Why didn't you chase them?

477
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,390
They entered the tower.

478
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,390
If I crossed the tower, I would have died.

479
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630
Are you so terrified?

480
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,390
To me,

481
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,350
this is just a job.

482
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,070
Why do you have to be so serious?

483
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,590
Yes.

484
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,830
Why do you have to be so serious?

485
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,750
You played basketball with me for half a month,

486
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,950
you didn't even score a single goal.

487
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,300
You are the leader.

488
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,300
I can only accompany you if you want to play.

489
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,900
I overestimated you.

490
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,480
Do you really think

491
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
I can't win you?

492
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,040
I know.

493
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,960
During a competition,

494
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,680
you didn't listen to the command.

495
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,440
Crossed the tower and kiled strongly.

496
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,750
In the end, you lost.

497
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,870
Got kicked out of the team.

498
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,470
After that, you changed four teams.

499
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,470
No team allowed you to be mid-solo.

500
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,060
I can't play that anymore.

501
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,820
Can't play anymore.

502
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
The chance is right in front of you.

503
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,300
It's just whether you'll play or not.

504
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,730
Hello to all the audiences here.

505
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,050
I am your host for today,

506
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,170
Luo Tian.

507
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Hello everyone.

508
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,560
I am your host for today,

509
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,800
Ah Can.

510
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
After a short team ordering,

511
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,350
Conquer's 2018 Spring conventional competition

512
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,870
is here as promised.

513
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,590
This competition

514
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,070
our strong teams have gathered once again.

515
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,830
It'll also means that

516
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,630
they will experience

517
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,940
a very intense weaponed fight.

518
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,020
The conventional competition

519
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,060
will continue to use accumulated point system.

520
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,820
The top 4 teams

521
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,420
will enter the after season festival

522
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,180
and compete for the final winner.

523
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,460
The team that wins championship

524
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,380
will receive

525
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,380
tickets to Vancouver worldwide finals.

526
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,020
Is everyone already anticipating?

527
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,930
Let us invite the two unveiling teams

528
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,450
radiant and brilliant

529
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,730
Polaris team.

530
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,410
And,

531
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,690
the team that never gives up

532
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,210
Legends team.

533
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,970
Welcome them.

534
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,940
I won't say much.

535
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,340
We declare that

536
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,580
the competition officially begins.

537
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,060
Next,

538
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
we'll be going against Polaris team

539
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,620
for our first circulation competition.

540
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Everyone share

541
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,020
your opinions.

542
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,660
Following our old rules,

543
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,780
four protecting one.

544
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,980
I'll play mid solo.

545
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,460
It's assuring and there's certainty.

546
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,140
Legends did the same thing.

547
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,220
They won.

548
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,810
Tong Wu, what do you think?

549
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,450
I have no problem.

550
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,110
Lu Sheng?

551
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,830
I want to hear the leader's opinions first.

552
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,110
We couldn't even practice his tactic within a month.

553
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,230
What's the use of listening?

554
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,070
I won't go on stage to embarass myself.

555
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,190
I feel that when we go against Polaris,

556
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,190
we have to focus on selecting the heroes.

557
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,030
Why?

558
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,030
The initial period of the Spring competition,

559
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,510
majority of teams would use

560
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,630
the previous heroes.

561
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,150
If we use new heroes,

562
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,150
paired with the team,

563
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,430
they'll not be sure of our tactics.

564
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,220
They will play very safe.

565
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,060
At the start, let's gather and take the side path.

566
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,460
When they seek help,

567
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,980
we'll go for a speed push in mid field.

568
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,380
Qi Yue.

569
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,860
how's the Ah Xin practice?

570
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,320
Wen jie.

571
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,160
I insist on not using the new heroes.

572
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
This is Spring competition.

573
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,640
Not the internal trial competition.

574
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,480
Besides, everyone is still not familiar

575
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,400
don't take my career as a joke.

576
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,240
Even if I really take it as a joke,

577
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
I won't gamble with VNG.

578
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,400
We must use the new heroes.

579
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,550
Paired with the new grouping.

580
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,670
If we still use the old trap,

581
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,910
we might not win.

582
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,390
If we lost it's because you've bad hands.

583
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,190
The leader is right.

584
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,380
I feel that

585
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,220
using the new heroes earlier,

586
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,620
will have more pros than cons.

587
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,860
And even if this round

588
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,340
Polaris didn't choose the new heroes,

589
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,140
It's hard for you to gurantee

590
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,660
other teams won't choose it the next round.

591
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,170
If it's this case,

592
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,690
we'll lose on the starting line.

593
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,690
Why do you say so much nonsense recently?

594
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,210
Care for yourself.

595
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,050
If you don't dare to use Ah Xin,

596
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,810
to play mid solo,

597
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,930
then just let me do it directly.

598
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,810
What do you mean?

599
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,050
Okay.

600
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,370
All of you sit down.

601
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,170
Qi Yue,

602
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,890
Sit down.

603
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,240
Choosing the new heroes quickly

604
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,070
definitely has more pros than cons.

605
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,510
This time, we'll follow Xiang Kong's plan.

606
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,630
And carry out the practice.

607
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,950
What now?

608
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,820
You're teaming up against me right?

609
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Wen jie.

610
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,260
You are a professional coach.

611
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
This is a shitty strategy.

612
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,740
Can't you tell?

613
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,020
You're willing to

614
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,860
watch VNG lose face at the start?

615
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,180
Why do you say that?

616
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,980
Qi Yue.

617
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
This isn't your individual competition.

618
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,130
and I'll invite you to

619
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,010
practice your new hero well first.

620
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,250
Before discussing with me

621
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,370
if it'll be embarassing.

622
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,290
Remember.

623
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,250
You are a professional player.

624
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,600
Dismissed.

625
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,980
Leader,

626
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,180
we'll go practice now.

627
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,860
Thanks.

628
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,380
Don't be so polite, bro.

629
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,470
Shu Wen.

630
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,190
Don't be angry anymore.

631
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,550
I will rush Qi Yue to practice.

632
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,310
I finally understood

633
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,790
that in VNG,

634
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,750
he only listens to you, his master.

635
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,910
Qi Yue was a little overboard just now.

636
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,030
But don't you feel that

637
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,470
you trust Ji Xiang Kong too much?

638
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,670
I've worked with you for so many years.

639
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,910
Don't you understand my style?

640
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,870
I

641
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,470
have no doubts when using people.

642
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,470
But it's too risky this time.

643
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,830
It isn't our team's style.

644
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,070
Sorry.

645
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,110
It is now.

646
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,830
No, Shu Wen.

647
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,820
From now on,

648
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,940
VNG

649
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,260
is giving up on using safe ways to win.

650
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,020
This is also what I wish for.

651
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,320
Shu Wen.

652
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,360
I have to work now.

653
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,300
Sleep early.

654
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,780
tomorrow morning.

655
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,780
We're having our first round

656
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,650
I'll look for a little while more.

657
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,290
Besides, tomorrow is the first round.

658
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,010
Don't have to put yourself under so much pressure.

659
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,170
No one will blame you if we lose.

660
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,490
Sleep.

661
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,210
Condition is the most important.

662
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,850
Okay.

663
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Thank you.

664
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,420
What are you thanking me for?

665
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,100
The competition isn't only your problem.

666
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,780
Sleep firmly.

667
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
I'm sleeping.

668
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
Hello to all the audience here.

669
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,640
I am the old friend you guys are familiar with,

670
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,680
Luo Tian.

671
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:58,940
Hello everyone.

672
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I am your old friend,

673
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,940
Ah Can.

674
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,940
The teams that are competing today

675
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,940
are VNG and Polaris.

676
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,300
The VNG team

677
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,300
also went through

678
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,900
huge member changes.

679
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,900
Their trump card and mid solo, Pei Xi,

680
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
is replaced by

681
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,820
Ji Xiang Kong who's widely discussed.

682
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,860
Will the departure of their mid solo

683
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
cause VNG to

684
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
fail forever?

685
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,380
Or will it the battleground fraudster's

686
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,900
addition cause

687
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,860
to be revived?

688
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,930
Let us wait and see.

689
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,930
Welcome the two teams on stage.

690
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,930
Please.

691
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,910
Our audience are very passionate.

692
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,630
Let's not say much.

693
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,590
The competition officially begins.

694
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,990
Okay.

695
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,830
Let invite the members to have a seat.

696
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,870
Fat Cat,

697
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,100
which team will win?

698
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,900
It's not easy to tell.

699
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
We have to see what heroes they choose.

700
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,180
I feel that

701
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
Ji Xiang Kong will win.

702
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,720
Because his tactics are constantly changing.

703
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,920
There are very little people like him in the industry.

704
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,280
That's not true.

705
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,280
Watch and see.

706
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,520
Pei Xi.

707
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Now, both teams are at

708
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,560
the selecting phase.

709
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,560
Let us see

710
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,070
what everyone is choosing.

711
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,430
Okay, let's see.

712
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,630
For VNG,

713
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,110
Qi Yue

714
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,430
chose to use Ah Xin.

715
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,430
This is a little different

716
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,670
from his past styles.

717
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,380
Exactly.

718
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,380
Usually, he won't really choose-

719
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,340
They're losing.

720
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,340
How's that possible?

721
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,420
It's only up till here.

722
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,140
Pei Xi is never wrong.

723
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,740
Wait and see.

724
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,410
Let everyone be surprised.

725
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,850
Don't you still have a competition later?

726
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,570
Why aren't you going to practice?

727
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,490
I'm preparing right now.

728
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,000
Lu Sheng, instigate a little.

729
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,080
Instigate a little, don't fight with them.

730
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,760
Okay.

731
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,400
Shen Yue, take the mid route and support Qi Yue.

732
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
There are two people opposite.

733
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,760
I will drag them.

734
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,600
Hurry Shen Yue.

735
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,080
Okay.

736
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,710
Qi Yue, observe your field of vision.

737
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,710
Shen Yue.

738
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,630
Shen Yue.

739
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,620
Why didn't you come earlier?

740
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,820
Sorry Qi ge.

741
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,180
Right now, Polaris

742
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,300
has started pushing the crystal.

743
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,010
In the end, Polaris pushed VNG's crystal.

744
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,730
Nice.

745
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,010
Let us congratulate Polaris.

746
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,970
the conventional competition.

747
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,970
For getting the first victory of

748
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:01,970
Once again, congratulations.

749
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,130
Too quick, this round.

750
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,120
I feel that this round was beyond our imaginations.

751
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,280
It's a little short.

752
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
Yes, I feel that everyone is still not satisfied.

753
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,200
And it already ended.

754
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,280
Now are you satisfied?

755
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,520
I hope that VNG can adjust

756
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,080
their condition for the second round.

757
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,100
And be able to give everyone...

758
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,100
show a better competition for everyone.

759
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,420
You need to wear in for the first round.

760
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,620
Pei Xi won the first round though.

761
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,860
What has that got to with you?

762
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,660
Exactly.

763
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,780
I think Ji Xiang Kong doesn't

764
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,500
value the victory or defeat of the competition.

765
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
What do you mean?

766
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,260
I have to go.

767
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,900
Watch and see my double win.

768
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,330
Pei Xi.

769
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,290
Fighting.

770
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,250
Qi ge.

771
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,370
Qi ge, don't be angry anymore.

772
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,950
Are you okay, Kong ge?

773
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,350
What can happen to me?

774
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,710
I merely lost a competition.

775
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,190
It's about to be you guys later.

776
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,630
Fighting.

777
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,550
Xiang Kong.

778
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,590
Play seriously.

779
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,110
We're waiting for you to reverse the situation.

780
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,990
Definitely.

781
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,100
Pei Xi.

782
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,060
You played well this Spring competition.

783
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,020
Thank you Wen jie.

784
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,560
Fighting.

785
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,480
Let's go.

786
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,240
Fighting.

787
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,280
One competition can't determine anything,

788
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,840
I trust in you.

789
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,510
Don't worry.

790
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,400
What's going on?

791
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,320
They lost again.

792
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,510
Too regretful.

793
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,190
What's wrong with VNG today?

794
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,590
Since the new competition season started,

795
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,430
they've already lost 4 consecutive rounds.

796
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,150
They were second place last year.

797
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,700
Exactly.

798
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,220
If they continue losing like this,

799
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,020
the after season competition.

800
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,020
there's no hope for them to get into

801
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,460
Sun ge.

802
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,820
What's wrong with VNG today?

803
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,820
They lost 4 rounds consecutively.

804
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,140
What's this?

805
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
Worry about yourself.

806
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,580
No, Sun ge.

807
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,380
This-

808
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,490
Ji Xiang Kong.

809
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,730
Both your hands and brain are weak.

810
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,610
because of your nonsense strategy.

811
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,610
We lost 4 consecutive rounds

812
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,890
dare to lay a hand on you?

813
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,890
You really think that I don't

814
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:24,810
What are you guys doing?

815
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,730
Can fighting solve the problem?

816
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,340
Ji Xiang Kong.

817
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,340
We already lost 4 rounds.

818
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,500
Now, we are currently last place.

819
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,780
If we continue losing,

820
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,100
we might not even be in the general round.

821
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,180
reasonable explaination?

822
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,180
Shouldn't you give everyone a

823
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,580
We lost a few rounds.

824
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,380
is not necessarily a bad thing.

825
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,940
I did my calculations

826
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,340
on our new strategy.

827
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,450
Everyone's statistics are increasing rapidly.

828
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,330
Tong Wu's-

829
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,850
statistics...

830
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,210
What's the use of a good statistic?!

831
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,170
Didn't we still lose?

832
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,690
Because of you.

833
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,410
Everyone isn't at the best position!

834
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,910
The mid route needs one to develop at the start.

835
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,150
In order to cause major harm at the end.

836
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,030
But you?

837
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,630
You always venture and catch others at the start.

838
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,150
Don't even suit being a mid solo.

839
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,630
So, for the next round,

840
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,630
I will put Lu Sheng as the mid solo.

841
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,790
At the same time,

842
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,910
I'll reboot the double moon team.

843
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:43,870
What?

844
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,430
Double moon team.

845
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,710
You didn't get it wrong did you?

846
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,260
Let me tell you again!

847
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,860
don't have the abilities.

848
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,860
Don't think of ideas if you

849
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,100
Who doesn't know that the double moon team

850
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
has already been seperated?

851
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,840
I'm talking about a new double moon team.

852
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,280
Use the new hero to capture.

853
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,640
Shen Yue will help you invade the area quickly.

854
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,160
Lu Sheng will be in the mid route.

855
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,560
In order to force the opponent nearer to us.

856
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,560
At the same time,

857
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,880
the double moon team will retreat to mid route.

858
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,720
And rid of them.

859
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,000
benefit within 4 minutes.

860
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,000
This way, we will have a major

861
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,640
I feel that you thought of it too logically.

862
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,720
I feel that Ji Xiang Kong's tactic

863
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,350
is doing one thing under the cover of another.

864
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,750
This tactic is a little risky.

865
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,790
But when it comes to playing,

866
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,910
it suits every member better.

867
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,860
Before Pei Xi entered VNG,

868
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,500
the double moon team has always

869
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,660
been our secret card to victory.

870
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,020
Qi Yue.

871
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,820
I have faith in how you guys handle it.

872
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,210
the new heroes tactic,

873
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,210
Besides, this time we're adding

874
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,490
I agree to rebooting the double moon team.

875
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,850
Wen jie.

876
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,050
Even if it's really so,

877
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,890
do you think Lu Sheng can play mid solo?

878
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,210
I can.

879
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,490
The competition is nearing.

880
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,080
Suddenly switching the members position,

881
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,600
and playing differently,

882
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,280
this is too risky.

883
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,600
Chairman Li.

884
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,590
Legends than me.

885
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,590
No one is more familiar with

886
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,030
better than you guys.

887
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,030
and no one understands Pei Xi

888
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,670
Do you really think that

889
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,870
we don't have the chance to win?

890
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,550
Don't speak too boldly.

891
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,580
If we lose,

892
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,420
you won't be able to handle.

893
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,020
If we lose,

894
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,420
I'll let go of the leader position.

895
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,920
Is it okay if we let Lu Sheng play mid solo?

896
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,840
And the double moon team, we-

897
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,800
Li Gan.

898
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,440
I know what you're worried about.

899
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,380
but it's a very important moment now.

900
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,380
As mentors, the two of us

901
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,900
must have more confidence

902
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,420
in the members.

903
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,500
But, Shu Wen,

904
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,940
we can't lose anymore.

905
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,220
If we continue losing,

906
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,540
all your hardwork for the past half a year,

907
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,500
would go to waste.

908
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,860
We can't afford to lose anymore.

909
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,300
So many problems have already came,

910
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,780
yet you don't have confidence

911
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,460
for one conventional competition?

912
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,770
I can't seem to understand

913
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,650
your confidence in Ji Xiang Kong.

914
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,930
Where did it exactly come from?

915
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,290
Is it because

916
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,170
Sun Ze Yi thinks highly of him.

917
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,490
What do you mean?

918
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,950
Nothing.

919
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,750
I'm just worried that-

920
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,590
if you've already decided,

921
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,550
then let's follow your plan.

922
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,230
I'll head home first.

923
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,670
Head home earlier.
