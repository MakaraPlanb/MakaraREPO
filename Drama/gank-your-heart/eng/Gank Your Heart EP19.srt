1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,319
GANK YOUR HEART

2
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,439
Episode Nineteen

3
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,959
Manager Zhao  Where are you going

4
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,879
Yeah Where are you running

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,800
You were quite powerful

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Don’t touch me

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,519
Don’t move Where are you going

8
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,600
I tell you not to touch me

9
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,839
Why are you running

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,119
Where are you going

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Where are you running

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,879
Don’t touch me   Where do you want to go

13
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,560
Don’t touch me

14
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,079
None of you can touch me today

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,239
What are you yelling

16
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,239
Stop

17
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,079
What are you doing

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
want to rebel

19
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,000
Stand still

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,360
You see

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
This is what you teach

22
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,239
Is it necessary

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,319
Do you really have to be so ruthless

24
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,759
Get out

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,839
Coach

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,000
Manager Zhao

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
Be careful

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
Manager  Goodbye

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you guys get stronger

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
No sir no no

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
We are just kidding

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,879
Shut up

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,639
You guys

34
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,200
Including you

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,319
Go to the playground

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Everyone runs fifty laps

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,439
Now

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,759
Right away

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,239
Fifty laps

40
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,319
Now

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,360
Let’s go

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
So energetic

43
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,720
Maybe fifty laps are not enough

44
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
Let’s take a rest

45
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,920
Can’t run anymore

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Yao  Today’s issue

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,519
We’re still good brothers

48
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,959
The anger in my heart

49
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,319
is finally released today

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,119
That old fox Zhaoyang was beaten

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,119
so hard today

52
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,280
But today

53
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,159
The manner that Xipei fights against Zhaoyang

54
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,400
looks like he has a grudge against him

55
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,680
I tell you

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,920
It’s not because they have a grudge

57
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,920
It’s that Peixi

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,639
kicks Zhaoyang when he’s down

59
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,680
Peixi  Pei

60
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,560
Mr. Luo punishes us to run laps

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,920
It's none of your business

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,759
it's me

63
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,159
that made him fall

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
It’s him

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,639
Let’s go

66
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,560
Our captain is great

67
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,800
Captain  Look

68
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,280
Zhaoyang deserves to get caught

69
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,800
He deserves it

70
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,280
Excellent

71
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,239
Yeah

72
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,759
I haven't expected that

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,519
Zhaoyang from Legend Team

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,519
could be so bad

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,560
This article written by LuYiyi

76
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,519
is very great   Of course

77
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,079
Look our LuYiyi is so cool

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Finally

79
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,920
The revenge of brother Kong and Qiuying is taken

80
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:03,959
Zhaoyang deserves it

81
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,159
Good job

82
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,079
Good

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,439
It's a good work

84
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,479
Really

85
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:12,800
That’s so great

86
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,560
I will bring it

87
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,839
to teacher Luotian tomorrow

88
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,319
Right

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,200
Tell me

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,639
How did you capture

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,319
the overwhelming teacher Luotian

92
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,319
There’s no capture

93
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,039
You have no idea

94
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,239
how badly he scolded me

95
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,479
Let me imitate him

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,439
He’s like this

97
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,720
Qiuying’s commentary

98
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,239
is not commentary at all

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,560
You

100
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,319
just retell

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,360
what others

102
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,439
have seen

103
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,319
In the future

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,479
Don’t make me see

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
things that are so meaningless

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Great

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,479
You imitate him quite well

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
He scolded you like that

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,639
You still show him the video

110
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,319
As long as he is willing to watch

111
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,920
He can scold me whatever he likes

112
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,000
What about this

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,079
I have a close relationship

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
with Mr. Luo

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
What about helping you pull a few strings

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Who told me that

117
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,360
In our industry

118
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,000
There is no need to gain advantage by trickery

119
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,079
Who  Which one is so blind

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,360
that say such superficial

121
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,200
and naive words

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,519
If I knew this person

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
I would never let him go

124
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,360
Excuse me

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Sorry to interrupt

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
There’s only one piece of cake left

127
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,400
You are a couple anyway

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,759
You can eat together

129
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,560
No no no

130
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
You misunderstood

131
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,600
We are not a couple

132
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,079
It’s okay

133
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,280
Though you are not a couple

134
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,879
you can still have this cake together

135
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,720
Enjoy yourself

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,159
Thank you

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,560
What about

138
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,119
You  you eat it

139
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,439
This is

140
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,319
a strawberry cake

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,560
which is your favorite

142
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,079
so you eat it

143
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,680
I’m a man

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,319
How can I

145
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,560
make girls hungry

146
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:56,759
What about this

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,639
Just like what he said

148
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,360
Two of us

149
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,720
can share together

150
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,039
The cake is cut

151
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,519
Why are you laughing

152
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,119
The cake is cut

153
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,800
Let’s eat

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,560
Well

155
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
A whole heart

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,519
is divided into two halves

157
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,560
Otherwise how to cut it

158
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,839
Cut it horizontally

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,839
Mr. Ji

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
Are you available tomorrow

161
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,479
Take you to a nice place

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,239
Where

163
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,639
Don’t you want to find a place

164
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,720
to cheer e up

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,879
No

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
It’s so crowded today

167
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,800
You see that's a castle

168
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,360
and there are so many

169
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,200
Cartoon shops

170
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,079
And there are balloons over there

171
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,600
So beautiful

172
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,479
You like it too

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Then take a photo together

174
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,079
Come  Stand here

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,039
Everyone shows off

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,360
moment

177
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,879
Three Two One Okay

178
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,039
Every breath around you

179
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,519
Come let's take a selfie together

180
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,680
Forever

181
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,239
Okay

182
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,239
Let’s go play something else

183
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,680
The second hand moves slowly

184
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,639
A little more every day

185
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,319
Xiangkong

186
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,680
I see there are Dumbos

187
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,639
Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooth over there

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,959
And looks like we don't need to wait in line

189
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,479
Shall we

190
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,720
Wait  wait

191
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,680
You bring me here today

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,119
to cheer me up

193
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,759
You have to ask me anyway

194
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,839
what I like to play

195
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,360
I know

196
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,680
but

197
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
We have plenty of time today

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,759
Don't worry

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,800
As long as you like

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,159
I will play with you

201
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,519
You promise

202
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,439
I want to play this

203
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,959
TRON Lightcycle Power Run

204
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,720
Heard that it’s very exciting

205
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,479
and very fast

206
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,319
I know this

207
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,360
Just like roller coaster

208
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,560
But I think

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
we just entered the park

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,039
Will it be too exciting

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,079
It’s your suggestion to come

212
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,280
Are you

213
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,759
getting afraid now

214
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,239
I have nothing to fear

215
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,000
Don’t worry

216
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,280
I come out with you to relax today

217
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,119
As long as you like

218
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
I will play with you

219
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,519
Loyal enough

220
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,720
Let’s go

221
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,039
What's wrong

222
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:29,800
Well

223
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,759
Let’s play some

224
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,360
light projects

225
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,200
Then I will play TRON Lightcycle Power Run

226
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
with you

227
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,200
Is it okay

228
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:37,039
Fine

229
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,039
As long as you’re willing to accompany me

230
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,720
I don’t care what I play

231
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,119
Moment

232
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,519
It’s funny  It’s funny

233
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,839
Let’s play

234
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,680
Every breath around you

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,479
becomes sweet

236
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,159
Forever

237
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,720
is not so far

238
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,360
The second hand moves slowly

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,759
A little more every day

240
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,560
Love

241
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,959
Your dishes are ready  Enjoy yourself please

242
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,600
Thanks thanks

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,159
These dishes are so cute

244
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,200
Fortunately

245
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,200
there are not many people at this time today

246
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
We have played so many games

247
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,720
this morning

248
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,879
After we finish the meal

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
Let’s go play TRON Lightcycle Power Run

250
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,200
What’s wrong

251
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
You can make it

252
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,519
But I didn't expect that

253
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,360
I can have such a good time

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,159
with you today

255
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,159
That really exceeds my expectations

256
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,800
Really

257
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
As long as you are happy

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,959
I will do anything

259
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Go eat

260
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,360
Right

261
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,319
Today

262
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,800
I saw some tourists took part in

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,959
the first-time activity

264
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,039
They share all interesting moments

265
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:30,479
on the internet

266
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,280
Really

267
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,759
Sounds interesting

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,360
Well we

269
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:36,159
have also shot so many photos

270
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,439
Let’s take part in as well

271
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,280
Sure

272
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,800
I think this one is great

273
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
Let’s call it

274
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,800
Light up the fairy tale world for the first time

275
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,200
Good good  use this one

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay see more

277
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,079
I think this one is also good

278
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,639
You even closed your eyes

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,800
choose this one

280
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,079
call it

281
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,879
Too light to open the eyes for the first time

282
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,959
You want to show my ugly photo

283
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
You also have ugly photos okay

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,920
You  show me

285
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:21,400
So many

286
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,959
I ask you

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Are you really not afraid

288
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,000
to play all these games

289
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,400
I’m not afraid

290
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,400
I have told you I’m not afraid

291
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,959
Said not to be afraid

292
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,319
You see this photo

293
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,159
I can feel that you’re so nervous

294
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,039
You said I closed my eyes

295
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,239
You also closed your eyes

296
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,639
It's just an accident

297
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:51,519
Eyes also closed in this one

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,600
An accident

299
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,400
Fine  Fine

300
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,000
Actually

301
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,839
You are not as bold as

302
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,119
you said

303
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,319
It’s because you want to accompany me

304
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,280
Not all because of you

305
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,239
JiXiangkong

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Thank you

307
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,400
It is because you are here

308
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,360
making me have courage

309
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,400
to play so many

310
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,879
games that I was yearning but fear to play for the first time

311
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,039
Besides

312
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
You are here with me

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,239
The moment I cry

314
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,439
I feel the whole body

315
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,759
has been released

316
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
All of my worries

317
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,239
are swept away

318
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,839
I hope you can feel it too

319
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Gather all energetic

320
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,920
to face the games in the future

321
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,639
You were so scared

322
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,720
but still here with me

323
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,920
because you want to cheer me up

324
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,360
Qiuying

325
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,239
It is me that should say thank you

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,439
Wait for me

327
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,479
Where are you going

328
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
Mickey

329
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,439
God

330
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,360
May I

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,079
take a photo with you

332
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,759
Great great

333
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,800
Well  You teach me how to pose

334
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,759
Come on

00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,800
Thank you  Thank you

337
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
It’s a perfect day

338
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,119
I can take photos

339
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,759
with so many friends in Disneyland

340
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,159
Byebye

341
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,360
Is it perfect

342
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,400
Your princess dream

343
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,439
is so small

344
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,119
God

345
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,039
These

346
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,959
Are these all for me

347
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,000
The moment you entered Disneyland

348
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,039
You stared at these balloons

349
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
I saw it

350
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,479
Thanks

351
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,280
and this

352
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,119
Today

353
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,839
My princess dream

354
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,039
completely comes true

355
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,079
Princess Qiuying

356
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,200
Your princess dream

357
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,479
just starts

358
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,879
If I say

359
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,079
Follow me

360
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,560
Time

361
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,920
It’s worth wasting

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,560
As long as I am with you

363
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,119
If I say

364
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,839
I can’t be alone

365
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,239
Carrousel

366
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,119
That is you

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,720
Princess Qiuying

368
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,720
Your ride

369
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,120
is ready

370
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,400
Follow me

371
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,239
Let’s go

372
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,079
Why it doesn’t rain on a sunny day

373
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,519
Why the desert is full of flowers

374
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,159
Because of you

375
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,680
How lucky I am

376
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,479
to meet you

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,720
Time freezes

378
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,479
for this moment

379
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,159
Indelible moment

380
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,800
How unforgettable

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,879
to become so close to you

382
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,439
Then discover it is too much

383
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,720
to hug

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,560
Staring at each other

385
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,879
is enough

386
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,200
If I say

387
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:02,479
I can’t be alone

388
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,920
It is you

389
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,479
that do it to me

390
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,600
I accept you interrupt me

391
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:11,560
Qiuying

392
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:12,639
Your look

393
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,439
tells me that

394
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,759
you are thinking at random again

395
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,000
I  I am not

396
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,759
I’m thinking

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,600
We have been

398
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,000
playing so many exciting games

399
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:25,959
It’s really great

400
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,239
how about

401
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,720
Let’s go play

402
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,680
TRON Lightcycle Power Run

403
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,959
I don’t want you to regret

404
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,759
But you are afraid

405
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,239
Don’t force yourself

406
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,519
As long as you are here

407
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,680
I have nothing to fear

408
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:47,639
Knight JiXiangkong

409
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,159
This is order from Princess Qiuying

410
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,360
Yes Princess

411
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,959
I  I'm not afraid

412
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,920
So close to you

413
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,720
Then discover it is too much

414
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,959
to hug

415
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,720
Staring at each other

416
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,479
is enough

417
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,039
Princess Qiuying

418
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,839
Has your dream

419
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:33,759
come true today

420
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,920
Not yet

421
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,720
I wish you

422
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,319
join the competition with no worries

423
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,079
Come on

424
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,200
Don’t worry

425
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,759
I will definitely get

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
the championship back

427
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,159
JiXiangkong

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
You’re always the best

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,519
Freeze

430
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,759
Indelible moment

431
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,879
How unforgettable

432
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,119
to become so close to you

433
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,680
Then discover it is too much to hug

434
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,000
What are you doing

435
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
Well I

436
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,280
I’m thinking about life

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,600
Well wait wait

438
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,680
Well

439
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,080
Let’s chat

440
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,479
Make it quick

441
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Don’t delay me to sleep

442
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,560
Well

443
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Thank you

444
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,200
No  no

445
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,119
I didn’t mean it

446
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:48,759
I’m not thanking you

447
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,680
to allow me go back to the team

448
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,000
I was not willing to come back

449
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,000
If It is not Mr. Luo

450
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,479
What do you want to say on earth

451
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:58,920
I heard that

452
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,239
You help a lot secretly

453
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,280
about Zhaoyang’s issue

454
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,439
So thank you to fight for justice

455
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,479
and sacrifice your interest

456
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,079
Sacrifice my interest

457
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:11,920
No

458
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,400
I just want to apologize

459
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,239
I misunderstood you before

460
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,360
I thought

461
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,439
You are the same with Zhaoyang

462
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,079
So

463
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,319
You admit that you're blind

464
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,079
You are blind

465
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,119
But

466
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,680
It doesn’t mean I reconcile with you

467
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,400
Do you understand

468
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,439
That's another thing

469
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,720
After all brother Kong left

470
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,039
because of you

471
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,759
I will never forgive you

472
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,239
because of this

473
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,119
You know

474
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,360
In the future

475
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,319
we still mind our own business

476
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,560
You

477
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,959
It’s for you

478
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,360
Thank you

479
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,079
LuYiyi

480
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,360
You see

481
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,039
On account of your article

482
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,639
Now the whole magazine

483
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,639
is busy again

484
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,280
What should I say to you

485
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,639
Sor  sorr

486
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,879
Sorry for what

487
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,479
Master Ren

488
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,479
Well LuYiyi

489
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,519
works in your place  right

490
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,439
Yes yes

491
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,079
The script this time

492
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,000
is written by her  right

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Yes yes yes

494
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,119
It’s LuYiyi again

495
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,200
Well I think

496
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,400
the script is great

497
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,519
We have decided to

498
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,039
ppropriate more funds for you

499
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,280
It’s more convenient for you

500
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,159
to make inverstigation

501
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,080
Really

502
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,519
Okay okay okay

503
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,319
We must pay attention

504
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,079
we must

505
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,239
Okay okay

506
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,639
Goodbye Master Ren  Okay

507
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,000
Chief Shi

508
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,319
It’s all my fault

509
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,400
I’m willing to take responsibility

510
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,079
You want to take

511
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,439
How to do it

512
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,479
I

513
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,280
Well

514
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,519
You brought the trouble

515
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,639
and now you want to just go away

516
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,879
Then who copes with this disaster

517
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,519
Well then you want

518
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,119
Just now

519
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,200
Master Ren

520
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,319
especially praised your article

521
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:23,159
and said in this industry

522
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,119
it has aroused consistent praise

523
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,639
asked us to hurry up

524
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,959
In the next issue

525
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,159
we will make a cover story

526
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:30,759
Besides

527
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,319
The bloc will appropriate

528
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,159
some funds to us

529
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,879
for interview in specialty

530
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,759
go to the scene

531
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,159
Really

532
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,319
Thanks  Chief Shi

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,080
Well  Take this

534
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,400
If there was not you

535
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:50,720
Our magazine

536
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,000
might be like this

537
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,039
and has nothing to do

538
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,639
When we can’t run it a few years later

539
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,000
It will be closed

540
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,920
The future of the magazine

541
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,560
depends on you

542
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,479
Don't worry Chief

543
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,079
The future is up to us

544
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,400
We will work hard

545
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,759
Come on

546
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,759
Come on

547
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,600
What are you dong

548
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:28,560
That team fight in

549
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,319
Eight minutes and forty-five seconds

550
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,720
There were three seriously injured in the opposite team

551
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:31,639
Your condition

552
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,800
and position were great

553
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,479
Why didn’t you chase

554
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
They entered the tower

555
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,239
I would have died if I crossed the tower.

556
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,479
Are you a wimp

557
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,280
For me

558
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,080
It is just a job

559
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:41,879
Why are you so serious

560
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,319
Yes

561
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:44,639
Why so serious

562
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,479
You have played basketball with me for half a month

563
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:47,720
you never scored a goal

564
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:49,839
You are the captain

565
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,000
I can only stay with you if you want to play

566
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,560
I overestimated you

567
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,159
Do you really think

568
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,360
I can’t win

569
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,519
I know that

570
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,519
In a competition

571
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,239
you didn’t follow the command

572
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,039
crossed the tower to kill enemies

573
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
and lost the game in the end

574
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,400
You were kicked out by the team

575
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,000
Later you changed four teams

576
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,000
There’s no team

577
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:24,920
allowing you to hit the mid

578
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,479
I can’t do it

579
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,280
can’t do it anymore

580
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,119
The chance is right in front of you

581
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,800
It depends on whether you choose to seize

582
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,000
Hello everyone

583
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,319
I‘m the host today

584
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,400
Luotian

585
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,720
Hello everyone

586
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm the host today

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,039
Acan

588
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,280
After a short rest period

589
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,639
The 2018

590
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,479
Peak Fall Regular Season

591
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,039
comes as scheduled

592
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:14,720
In this competition

593
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,280
Our strong teams

594
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,239
will gather again

595
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,000
They are destined

596
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:18,800
to experience

597
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,959
very fierce fighting

598
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,119
The Regular Season

599
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,159
will continue to use the point system

600
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,920
The top four

601
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,479
will enter the playoff

602
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,239
to compete

603
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
The team that win the championship

604
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,439
will directly get

605
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,560
the tickets to

606
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,360
Vancouver Global Finals

607
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:35,879
Is everyone

608
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,039
already looking forward to it

609
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,720
Let’s have two teams

610
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,800
with opener

611
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,400
The glorious

612
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,680
Polaris Team

613
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,400
and

614
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,639
Never Give-up

615
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,080
Legend Team

616
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,879
Welcome

617
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,759
Let’s cut the crap

618
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,079
We announce that

619
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
the game officially starts

620
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Next

621
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,800
Our first round-robin match

622
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,319
will fight against the Polaris Team

623
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,639
Tell me

624
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,759
your ideas about it

625
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,400
Old rules

626
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,439
Four guarantees one

627
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,600
I hit the mid

628
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,039
It’s both safe and secure

629
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,800
The Legend is four guarantees one just now

630
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:25,800
and they win

631
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,439
Tongwu What’s your opinion

632
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,959
I  I have no opinion

633
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:41,560
What about Lusheng

634
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,360
I wang to hear from the captain first

635
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,360
His strategy

636
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,600
We haven’t practiced for a month

637
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:50,639
No need to hear

638
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,519
I will not lose face on the stage

639
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,639
I think we should focus on

640
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,600
the choice of heroes when against the Polaris

641
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,400
What's your point

642
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,360
In the early period of Fall Season

643
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,800
Most teams must use

644
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,000
the previous hero system

645
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,519
If we adopt a new

646
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:06,479
hero combination

647
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,879
They will not be clear about

648
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,800
our tactical intentions

649
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,519
so they will have a conservative strategy

650
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,360
In the early stage we unite and play the sidewalk

651
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,720
when they have support

652
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,239
then push the mid

653
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:16,560
Qiyue

654
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,119
How is your practice in Axin

655
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:25,519
Sister Wen

656
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
I firmly oppose the use of new heroes

657
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
This is Fall Season

658
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,800
not the Test Match

659
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,560
Besides  we're not familiar with the new heroes

660
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:32,959
Don't

661
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,560
joke about my career

662
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,519
Even if I really

663
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,439
joke about your career

664
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,039
I won’t bet on Weiteng

665
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:39,600
We must use new heroes

666
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,560
to make new combinations

667
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
If we still adopt the old routine

668
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,000
we may not win

669
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,439
You lose because of your poor skills

670
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,200
Captain is right

671
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,400
I think

672
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,239
The advantages of using new heroes as soon as possible

673
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,600
far outweigh the disadvantages

674
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,920
Even in this round

675
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,400
the Polaris doesn’t choose new heroes

676
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,159
It’s very hard to assure

677
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,639
that other teams won’t choose next round

678
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,119
If this is the case

679
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,600
we lose from the start

680
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,479
Why you have

681
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
so much bullshit recently

682
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,119
Mind your own business

683
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,959
If you’re afraid to use Axin

684
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,720
to hit the mid

685
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,839
Say it and let me play

686
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,639
What do you mean

687
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,800
Alright

688
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,200
Sit down

689
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:16,959
Qiyue

690
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,600
Sit down

691
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
The advantages of choosing new heroes as soon as possible

692
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,759
indeed outweigh the disadvantages

693
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,519
This time

694
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,159
We perform training

695
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,360
according to Xiangkong's plan

696
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,680
Well now

697
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,639
You unite against me

698
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
Right

699
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,439
Sister Wen

700
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,920
You are a professional coach

701
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,360
The strategy is a shit

702
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
Can’t you judge it

703
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:46,639
Are you really willing to

704
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,519
see Weiteng lose face on the stage

705
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,720
Mind your manners

706
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,519
Qiyue

707
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,720
It is not your game

708
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,639
and please practice your

709
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,439
new hero first

710
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,759
Then come talk to me

711
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,800
about the issue of shame

712
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Remember

713
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,639
You are a professional player

714
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:13,959
Dismiss

715
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,319
Captain

716
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,519
We’re about to go trianing

717
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,079
Thanks

718
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,600
You’re welcome bro

719
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,479
Shuwen

720
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,239
Take it easy

721
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,639
I will urge Qiyue to practice

722
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,360
Now I get it

723
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:09,839
In Weiteng

724
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,680
He only listens to you

725
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,879
Qiyue was a bit too much just now

726
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,000
But don’t you think

727
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:16,319
You believe

728
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
JiXiangkong too much

729
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,639
I’ve been working with you for ages

730
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,879
Don’t you understand my style

731
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,759
I'm the person

732
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,319
that have no doubt about my choice

733
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
But it’s too risky this time

734
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,759
It’s not our style

735
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,000
Well  sorry

736
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,959
Now it is

737
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,680
Shuwen

738
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:30,639
From now on

739
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Weiteng

740
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
gives up conservative to win

741
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,879
This is also what I hope

742
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,039
Shuwen

743
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,039
I’m about to work

744
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,839
Sleep early

745
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,319
We have first round tomorrow morning

746
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,159
Few more minutes

747
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,720
It’s the first round after all

748
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,479
Don’t push yourself too hard

749
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,680
No one will blame you if you lose

750
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,800
Sleep

751
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,720
Condition is the most important

752
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,200
Okay

753
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Thank you

754
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,519
What for

755
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,000
The game is not

756
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,159
your own issue

757
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,879
Sleep well

758
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,079
Goodnight

759
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,119
Hello  everyone

760
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,560
I’m your old friend

761
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:39,639
Luotian

762
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:43,839
Hello everyone

763
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,000
I’m your old friend

764
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,839
Acan

765
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,839
The upcoming game is

766
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,800
Weiteng versus Polaris

767
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,119
The team Weiteng

768
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,080
has experienced

769
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,680
major personnel changes

770
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,759
Their main player changes from Mid Peixi

771
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,519
to

772
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,639
JiXiangkong

773
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,600
We will see whether

774
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,800
Weiteng collapses

775
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,039
due to Peixi's departure

776
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,119
or

777
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,720
gains a new life

778
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,639
because of the joining of battlefield fraud

779
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:09,479
Let us

780
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,600
wait and see

781
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,639
Welcome the two teams

782
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,560
Welcome

783
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,519
Our audiences are very passionate

784
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,239
I will cut the crap

785
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,600
Next our game

786
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,159
starts

787
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,560
Great

788
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,319
Please have a seat

789
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,360
Fat cat

790
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,439
Which side do you think can win

791
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:51,319
Hard to say

792
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,839
It depends on which hero they choose

793
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:57,639
I think

794
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,720
JiXiangkong will win

795
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,159
Because his strategy is mysterious and flexible

796
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,239
It’s very rare in this coterie

797
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,639
That might not be

798
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,600
Wait and see

799
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:14,759
Peixi

800
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,920
Now the two teams have reached

801
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:18,839
the selection stage

802
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,839
Let us see

803
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,319
everyone's choice

804
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,639
Okay  let us have a look

805
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:23,839
In Weiteng

806
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,280
Qiyue

807
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,600
chooses Axin

808
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,639
It’s different

809
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,920
from his previous habit

810
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:30,479
Yes

811
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,479
He is less likely to choose

812
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,239
Lose

813
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,439
How come

814
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,560
It’s just the beginning

815
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,239
What he says will not be wrong

816
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:39,800
Wait and see

817
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,400
Make everyone's eyes brightened

818
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,879
Don’t you have a game later on

819
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,560
Why don’t you go to get prepared

820
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,560
I am preparing

821
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:00,800
Lusheng  don’t be so brave

822
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Hold back  don’t fight against them

823
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,680
Okay  okay

824
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,280
Shenyue  go to the mid to support Qiyue

825
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,759
There are two people opposite

826
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,680
I obstruct them

827
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:07,479
Hurry up  Shenyue

828
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,920
Okay

829
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,479
Qiyue watch out your view field

830
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,479
Shenyue

831
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,319
Shenyue

832
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,360
Why don’t you come quickly

833
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,600
Sorry brother Qi

834
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,839
Now the Polaris

835
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,000
begins to push the crystal

836
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,439
Finally the Polaris

837
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,600
pushes Weiteng's crystal away

838
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:41,319
Excellent

839
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,560
Let’s congratulate the Polaris

840
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,519
win the first game

841
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
of Regular Season

842
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Congratulate again

843
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,639
So fast  so fast  this round

844
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,839
I think  this game is

845
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,680
beyond out expectations

846
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,759
It’s too short

847
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,039
Yes  it seems that everyone

848
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,800
hasn’t enjoyed it enough

849
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,759
and it’s over

850
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:56,839
Now you are satisfied

851
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,000
Hope next round

852
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,639
Weiteng can adjust the state

853
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,560
and be able to

854
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,759
bring a better game

855
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,600
to audiences

856
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,800
Just the first round

857
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
But Peixi

858
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
won the first round

859
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,239
Go away  none of your business

860
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,079
Yeah

861
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
JiXiangkong doesn’t

862
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,720
care about losing this round

863
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,079
What do you mean

864
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:26,560
I’m leaving

865
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,239
Wait and see

866
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,200
my two winning streak

867
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:30,519
Peixi

868
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,519
Fighting

869
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,439
Brother Qi

870
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,600
Take it esay

871
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,000
Are you alright  Brother Kong

872
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,479
I’m good

873
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,800
Just lost a game

874
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,280
It’s your turn later

875
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,600
Fighting

876
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,560
Xiangkong

877
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:03,639
Play hard

878
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,159
We’re waiting for you to win

879
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:07,920
You have my word

880
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,000
Peixi

881
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:14,959
Well done in the season

882
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,959
Thanks Sister Wen

883
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,360
Fighting

884
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,360
Let’s go

885
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,959
Come on

886
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,079
A game can’t explain everything

887
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:37,600
I believe in you

888
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,239
Don’t worry

889
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:27,879
What happened

890
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,800
Lose again

891
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,560
What’s going on in Weiteng today

892
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,000
After the new season begins

893
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,800
Lose four games in series

894
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,439
They were runners-up last year

895
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,079
Yeah

896
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,560
If they lose again like this

897
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,000
There’s basically no hope

898
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:44,360
to enter the playoff

899
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,759
Brother Sun

900
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,159
What’s going to in Weiteng

901
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,000
Lose four games continuously

902
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,360
What the hell

903
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,519
Mind your own business

904
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:56,800
No  Brother Sun

905
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Well

906
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,639
JiXiangkong

907
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,879
You are hand-damaged and brain-damaged

908
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:03,839
Lose four games in series

909
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:04,759
Because of your rubbish arrangement

910
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Do you really think

911
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,079
I dare not beat you

912
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:06,959
What are you doing

913
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,800
Can fight solve the problem

914
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,280
JiXiangkong

915
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,000
We have

916
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,319
lost four games

917
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,439
We’re last one in the standings

918
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:36,720
If we lose again

919
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,920
We have no possibility

920
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,959
of promotion

921
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,720
Should you give

922
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,000
a reasonable explanation to everyone

923
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,439
It might not be a bad thing

924
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,200
to lose a few games

925
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,800
I made a survey

926
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,239
Our new arrangement

927
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,079
Everyone’s statistics

928
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,239
has increased substantially

929
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,079
Tongwu's

930
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,600
data  data  data

931
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
They are useless

932
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,000
We still lose the game

933
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,479
Just because of you

934
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,200
Everyone is not

935
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,159
in the most suitable position

936
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,600
It requires early development in the middle road

937
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,000
Then cause great damage in the late stage

938
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:02,680
But you

939
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,319
always wander and catch people in the early stage

940
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,959
You’re not suitable for mid position at all

941
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,200
So next round

942
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,280
I will transfer Lusheng to mid position

943
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,400
In the meantime

944
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,400
restart bimonthly group

945
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,360
What

946
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,079
Bimonthly group

947
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,079
Are you kidding

948
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,800
I tell you again

949
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,519
Don’t come up with bad ideas

950
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,400
without skills

951
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,439
Who doesn’t know

952
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,680
that out bimonthly group has been cracked

953
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,319
What I mean is new bimonthly group

954
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:41,720
You use the new hero to jungle

955
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,319
Shenyue supports you to invade

956
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,079
the enemy field

957
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,560
Lusheng is in the mid

958
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,000
push enemy to join

959
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,080
Meanwhile

960
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,360
The bimonthly winds back to mid

961
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,119
to harvest

962
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,720
This four minutes

963
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,400
We will take a huge advantage

964
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:55,879
I think you

965
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,959
take it for granted

966
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,200
But I think this strategy

967
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,800
is smart

968
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,079
It is indeed a risky strategy

969
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,119
but this skill

970
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,239
is more suitable for our player

971
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,039
Before Peixi entered Weiteng

972
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,680
This group has always been

973
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,759
our magic weapon

974
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:15,200
Qiyue

975
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:16,759
I have faith in

976
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,959
your skills

977
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,159
And this time

978
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,360
we add new hero strategy

979
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,600
I agree to restart this group

980
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,039
Sister Wen

981
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,239
Even so

982
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:29,920
Do you really think Lushen can play mid

983
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,959
I can

984
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:39,680
The game is coming

985
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:42,319
change the positions suddenly

986
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,600
adopt new strategy

987
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:46,360
I’m afraid it’s too risky

988
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:47,600
Boss

989
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,159
No one

990
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,439
knows Legend better than me

991
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,800
and no one

992
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,039
knows Peixi better than you

993
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,720
Do you really think

994
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:55,839
we have no chance to win

995
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:58,600
Don’t say too much

996
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
If we lose

997
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:02,400
You can afford it

998
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,959
If we lose

999
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,159
I give up this position

1000
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,519
Is it okay to let Lusheng play mid

1001
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,519
Besides

1002
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,600
The bimonthly group  we

1003
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,159
Ligan

1004
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:39,200
I know what you are worried about

1005
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,119
but now it’s the key moment

1006
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,959
As two leaders

1007
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:45,639
We have to give our players

1008
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:47,079
more confidence

1009
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,319
But Shuwen

1010
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,800
We can’t lose anymore

1011
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,759
If we lose again

1012
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,200
the whole effort of half the year

1013
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,159
will all be wasted

1014
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,600
We have nothing to lose

1015
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:56,879
We have overcome

1016
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,079
all the difficulties

1017
00:44:58,839 --> 00:44:59,519
Just a Regualr Season

1018
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:00,720
You have no faith

1019
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,280
I just don’t understand

1020
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,039
Where do you get the faith

1021
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,280
towards JiXiangkong

1022
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,720
Just because

1023
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,280
SunZeyi focuses on him

1024
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:19,920
What do you mean

1025
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
Nothing

1026
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,000
I’m just worried

1027
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,119
If you have decided

1028
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,680
Then follow

1029
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:26,879
your plan

1030
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,519
I’m coming home

1031
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:30,839
You should come home early
