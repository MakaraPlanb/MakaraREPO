00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,060
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,730
Your current server ranking is 735.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,570
Don't remind me about that.

5
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,770
Judging from my standard,

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,010
Don't talk about

7
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,450
being the champion of the 'Next Rising star',

8
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm not even qualified to be a waitress

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,830
at 'Dream Traveller' PC room.

10
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,550
All I can say is.

11
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,510
Good to be ambitious.

12
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,950
But reality is harsh.

13
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,310
Do you want to reconsider your participation?

14
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,910
Nope.

15
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,390
I can do it!

16
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,550
Are you serious about it?

17
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,950
Since when was I joking?

18
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,630
To faster gain gaming knowledge,

19
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,950
I must play the game hands-on.

20
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,260
Start!

21
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,980
Start what?

22
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,640
Train my player!

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Hey, it's already 12:30.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Crazy! You're really crazy.

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Fine. Go on practicing.

26
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Time for my sleeping mask.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm gonna sleep.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Goodnight.

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,260
For you.

30
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,780
Your favourite pistachios.

31
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,020
Thanks.

32
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
Your skills are mediocre.

33
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,430
Are you referring to me?

34
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,150
Try switching your player to Wizard.

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,590
Wizard?

36
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,590
Why?

37
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,660
Honestly, I think..

38
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,420
I'm not playing smoothly with the Sniper.

39
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,660
But if I do as you suggest,

40
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
which Wizard should I select?

41
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,220
I know you're an expert in this.

42
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,420
Can you give me a few recommendations?

43
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,260
The ones that are easier to control.

44
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,420
The main problem is

45
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,020
if I were to use Wizard,

46
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,460
I'd have to start training it all over again.

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
How should I arrange its profile statistics?

48
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,780
What about the gaming gears

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,330
from the early and late game?

50
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,090
For me?

51
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,290
Thanks.

52
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Puppy? So cute.

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
Why did you give me a lollipop?

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,960
You talked too much. Eat it.

55
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,980
Sort out your problems.

56
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,180
Show me when you're done.

57
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,060
Wizard?

58
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,020
I remember Pei Xi used Creator before.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,740
Whatever. I shall try first.

60
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,700
Look, what time is it now?

61
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,660
Not turning in yet?

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,140
Trying to be friends with panda?

63
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,170
Not much time left to the competition.

64
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,250
I must make good use of the time left.

65
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,250
Fine..

66
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,210
I'm turning in first.

67
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,010
Don't stay up too late.

68
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,670
Sleep first, good night.

69
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
Impressive.

70
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Teacher Pei Xi.

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
I have sorted out all my doubts

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
related to the 'Creator'.

73
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Please kindly advice.

74
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,780
Watch me.

75
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
I mean watch how I play.

76
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,720
Now I see the difference between

77
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
an expert and mediacore.

78
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,790
Understand how this works?

79
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,110
Teacher Pei Xi..

80
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,550
Your hands worked too fast.

81
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,510
As if you're playing the piano.

82
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,630
I was confused just by looking at it.

83
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,020
Or..

84
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Can you do it again?

85
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,020
Watch the playback.

86
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,380
Pei Xi...

87
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,100
Hang on...

88
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,700
To show my gratitude towards your coaching,

89
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm willing to stay here to help you

90
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,330
with the chores as a waitress.

91
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,450
You don't have to pay me.

92
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,770
I can do many things.

93
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,650
You didn't rank first in the game server.

94
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,520
You are not qualified to be the waitress here.

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,920
Pei Xi.. I..

96
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
I am really capable.

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
Shifting the tables,

98
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor..

99
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
I really..

100
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Thanks.

101
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,780
We're here.

102
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,740
Xiang Kong.

103
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,820
Coach.

104
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,780
Xiang Kong.

105
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,300
Done with the materials?

106
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,380
Let's begin.

107
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,410
Where is Huoyao?

108
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,050
I was eating with him earlier.

109
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,930
He said he had something on.

110
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,930
He left awhile ago.

111
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,930
Where did he go?

112
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,610
He didn't say.

113
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,470
Let's begin first without him.

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,470
Everyone is aware that

115
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,710
VNG is best at using 4-1 strategy.

116
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,750
If we can prevent Peixi from leveling up,

117
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,310
there will be a chance for us to win this.

118
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,950
I have compiled all Peixi's gaming videos.

119
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,990
Let's take a look.

120
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,230
Huoyao, you're here.

121
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,220
Sorry, guys.

122
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,180
I'm late.

123
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,140
Let's watch the video.

124
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,560
Your condition looks good these days.

125
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,960
Your..

126
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
Your contract is expiring in 2 months.

127
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
Here is the following year's contract.

128
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Thanks, Manager Zhao.

129
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,220
Who thinks for the team,

130
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,700
who is capable,

131
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,980
who performs well,

132
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,810
The board and I will definitely show recognition.

133
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,250
Huoyao.

134
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,410
What are your thoughts about

135
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,090
the appointment of the Captain?

136
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,490
After the competition,

137
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,570
isn't Xiang Kong going to be our new Captain?

138
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
You, Ji Xiang Kong,

139
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,920
Lin Yi Xuan, Lu Feng.

140
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
Among the four of you,

141
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
I think you have the most potential.

142
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
If it wasn't Gu Fang's persistence

143
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
in recommending Ji Xiang Kong as the Captain,

144
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,230
I'd definitely appoint you to the Board.

145
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,310
Manager Zhao.

146
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,300
Honestly, my skills are average.

147
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,060
It's not about the skills.

148
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,540
Huoyao,

149
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,340
let me be honest with you.

150
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,340
Time doesn't wait.

151
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,540
You're clearly aware.

152
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,170
The prime period of a gamer is limited.

153
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,770
President Jin has also been skeptical

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,890
about your existence in the team.

155
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,010
If...

156
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,410
If you were to stay with Ji Xiang Kong,

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,280
I can't help you either.

158
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's be straightforward.

159
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,660
You're a smart person.

160
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,420
If you get where am I coming from..

161
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,580
Do you want to be the Captain

162
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,340
or do you want to be

163
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,620
eliminated out of the team?

164
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,100
It all depends on your performance at the competition.

165
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,660
Don't disappoint me.

166
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,500
I have something on. I'll make a move first.

167
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,890
Pei Xi likes to battle on his own.

168
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,970
Lack of team spirit.

169
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,810
He doesn't go in group with his team in the game.

170
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,390
This is a loophole for us to attack them.

171
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,350
We have to divert Peixi's attention at the early game.

172
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,190
Great.

173
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,870
Huoyao, any thoughts?

174
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,150
Huoyao?

175
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,470
Any thoughts?

176
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,670
Sorry, Coach.

177
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,790
I'm feeling unwell today.

178
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,630
Huoyao, are you running a fever?

179
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,870
I'm fine.

180
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,190
If you're feeling unwell,

181
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,430
head back and rest.

182
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,030
Okay, I'll head back to rest.

183
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,230
Let me know when the strategy has been formed.

184
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,540
I'll practice it tonight.

185
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,780
Sorry.

186
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,940
Go ahead.

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
This is so tough.

188
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,380
Why? Shocked to see a handsome guy?

189
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,210
You.. Why are you here?

190
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,450
Lin Yi Xuan told me

191
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,370
you've been here recently.

192
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,170
I happened to pass by

193
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,450
so I came to take a look.

194
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,890
And you're here indeed.

195
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,330
Neglecting your sleep and skipping your meals?

196
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,890
I only neglected my sleep.

197
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,090
I didn't skip my meal.

198
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,530
What are you looking at?

199
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Peixi's strategy seems plausible.

200
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,670
How do you know it's done by Peixi?

201
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,950
It's easy to tell from these moves.

202
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,670
Why are you seeing this?

203
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,110
He is teaching me how to play Mid Lane.

204
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,820
That is out of your league.

205
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,740
He is obviously showing off his skills.

206
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,660
A mediocre like you

207
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,660
will not be able to learn it.

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,260
I.. Maybe I might figure it out myself.

209
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,900
Aren't you the one who say?

210
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,540
If I can do it, I will definitely make it.

211
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,060
So that's why

212
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,980
you came here to practice?

213
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,890
I want to be a live narrator

214
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,290
and I want to take part in

215
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,370
the 'Next Rising Star' competition.

216
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,130
There are so many strong players here.

217
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,130
I can level up quickly here.

218
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,880
Don't rub your eyes.

219
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,500
Have you been staring at the screen for a long time?

220
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,420
Stop looking at his lousy strategy.

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,260
You wouldn't get it.

222
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,780
Let's go. Let's go somewhere.

223
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,260
Let's go.

224
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,580
Did someone speak bad about me?

225
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,090
Thank you.

226
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,530
How great. To receive flowers.

227
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,710
Don't you think today is a perfect day?

228
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,310
Why?

229
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,710
Because you're walking the streets

230
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,830
with a handsome guy like me.

231
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,350
Why are you being such a narcissist?

232
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,950
Hey, I have a million fans, okay?

233
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,230
Let me ask you seriously.

234
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,430
The final competition is nearing.

235
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,350
Are you nervous?

236
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,750
Nervous?

237
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,990
Of course not!

238
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,750
Initially, I can get 90 points.

239
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,390
In addition of my million fangirls,

240
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,110
I'll be able to get 99 points.

241
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,860
You're still lacking 1 point.

242
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,100
You! If you were to come,

243
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll get full marks.

244
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,860
Perfect.

245
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,840
Am I only worth 1 point?

246
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,440
1 point is considered alot.

247
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,200
You're considered my number 1 fan.

248
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
If that's the case, Teacher Ji..

249
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,800
Can you give your number 1 fan a free tutorial?

250
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
No problem.

251
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,400
A strictly confidential tutorial.

252
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
You will become an elite player after this.

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,480
Come with me.

254
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,710
You.. Why did you bring me here?

255
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,630
You will know later.

256
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:38,980
Welcome.

257
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,100
Welcome to BESTORE.

258
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,260
We sell more than hundreds of high-end snacks.

259
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,220
Thank you.

260
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
Didn't you say you're going to coach me?

261
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,410
What elite player?

262
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,210
I think you meant elite shopper.

263
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,810
Just now,

264
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,850
you've seen Pei Xi's gaming operation.

265
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,970
What's his motto?

266
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,410
Fast. Accurate. Ruthless.

267
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,570
Exactly.

268
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,810
Besides strategy, what makes professional gamers

269
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,050
different from usual gamers

270
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,410
is the gaming operation.

271
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,050
That's basic.

272
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,570
But I didn't learn this from scratch,

273
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,520
can I do it?

274
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Why not?

275
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,560
You didn't play ICONQUER

276
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
to join a game competition.

277
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
You're just trying to understanding gaming better.

278
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
You need to know how this works

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,240
by playing hands-on.

280
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,030
Teacher Ji, teach me the way

281
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,630
you trained other professional gamers.

282
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,150
Sure.

283
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,550
We'll begin our first lesson today.

284
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,070
Let's practice your speed and reaction.

285
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,940
Okay.

286
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,940
5 packets of dried mangoes.

287
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,540
4 boxes of pistachios.

288
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
Pistachio, strawberry jelly.

289
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,820
Catch this.

290
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Instant scallops.

291
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,650
5 boxes of dried mangoes. Quickly.

292
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,290
Coming..

293
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,850
- Quick. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

294
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,040
Every fighter

295
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,560
has his strengths and weaknesses.

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
When one meets a tough situation,

297
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
his team mates have to lend him a hand.

298
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,980
Why do I feel like you're fooling me around?

299
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
Don't you think I made sense?

300
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,620
Fine. You're Ji Xiang Kong.

301
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,940
You're a gaming expert.

302
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,300
Whatever you've said is right.

303
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,860
2 bottles of orange juice.

304
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,060
Your speed and reaction today are pretty good.

305
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,130
Practice more.

306
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,810
Next time, let's play Whac-A-Mole.

307
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,010
Is that effective?

308
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,090
I think it's effective for you.

309
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,250
We've reached my place.

310
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,510
Here will do. You may go.

311
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,550
This is for you.

312
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,110
For me?

313
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,710
Girls like these snacks, don't you?

314
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,230
Don't eat too much.

315
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,430
Fattening.

316
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,470
Thanks.

317
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,030
What do you like to eat?

318
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,270
I'll treat you some other time.

319
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,910
I..

320
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,830
I like to drink milk tea.

321
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,030
Strawberry milk tea.

322
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,670
What?

323
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,190
A grown-up man like you

324
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,630
likes strawberry milk tea?

325
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,980
That's so unexpected of you.

326
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,500
Up to you to believe.

327
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,580
Anyway, thank you.

328
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,580
Welcome.

329
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,460
If you face any problems in future, ask me.

330
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,660
I'm a walking encyclopedia.

331
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,360
If you ask..

332
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
that self-centered Pei Xi,

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
it's useless.

334
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,040
Really?

335
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
But I remember..

336
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
during the Q&A game session,

337
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
you got all 6 questions wrong.

338
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,760
- Pei Xi... - That was a misunderstanding.

339
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,440
How about this?

340
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,600
To compensate you,

341
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,430
I've got 2 invitation tickets to the competition.

342
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,990
Hope you can make it.

343
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,310
I'll go and support you.

344
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,550
I've said before

345
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,620
All my fans support are worth 99 marks.

346
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,180
The last mark lies on you.

347
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,140
It's getting late.

348
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,180
Go home.

349
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Return safely.

350
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,050
Bye.

351
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,530
Oh goodness.

352
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,810
Why is my heartbeat beating so quickly?

353
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,090
I can feel a burning sensation on my cheeks.

354
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,650
Don't overthink.

355
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,930
Don't think too much.

356
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,120
Qiuying, chill.

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,600
Calm down.

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,430
Yiyi..

359
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,750
Where is she?

360
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,310
My goodness.

361
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,660
You scared me.

362
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,780
Why are you sitting here?

363
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,460
I saw it.

364
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,700
What did you see?

365
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,340
What do you think?

366
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,100
He even gave you flowers?

367
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,580
He sent me home out of convenience.

368
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,410
You believe such crap?

369
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,050
He was just being nice.

370
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,490
It's dangerous to be alone at this hour.

371
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,290
Afterall, I'm too pretty.

372
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,160
What happens if I meet a pervert?

373
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Right?

374
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
I think he is the biggest pervert.

375
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,740
Ji Xiang Kong gave 2 tickets to the competition.

376
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,100
Want to go together?

377
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,780
I don't buy this!

378
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,220
Let me tell you.

379
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,020
With me around,

380
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,660
I won't allow him to lay a finger on you.

381
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,140
Yiyi,

382
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,220
this is a reknown gaming event.

383
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,020
Are you sure you're not going?

384
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,060
No! Not going!

385
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,220
Dealing a playboy like him,

386
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,930
three dont's to take note of.

387
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,210
Don't react.

388
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:01,930
Don't get hooked on.

389
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,370
Don't accept.

390
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,210
Exactly.

391
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,570
The tickets are useless anyway.

392
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,710
In your company,

393
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,110
for such a huge event,

394
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,910
all you need to do is to copy and paste the updates.

395
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,270
Where's the dustbin?

396
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,550
Throw it..

397
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,030
Hang on.

398
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,030
Come to think of it.

399
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,630
If I don't go,

400
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,790
Ji Xiang Kong

401
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,230
will stand a better chance hooking you up.

402
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,110
No way! For your sake,

403
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,550
I have to go.

404
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,030
Don't be angry.

405
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,950
Let me tell you.

406
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,790
I've not forgiven you.

407
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,110
My dear angel.

408
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,070
I'm not your angel.

409
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,820
I've bought your favourite dried mangoes.

410
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,040
Fine, I'll forgive you.

411
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,320
Unwilling to come?

412
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,960
Look at how excited you are right now.

413
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,390
Since I'm already here,

414
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,670
I should conveniently take a few photos.

415
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,670
I'll go there and take a look.

416
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,710
Lu Yiyi!

417
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,900
Lin Yixuan?

418
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,860
What you're wearing?

419
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,140
Dress something nicer

420
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,500
since you're here to support me.

421
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,650
Like a night gown.

422
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,170
What does my attire has got to do with you?

423
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,170
I'm here to watch the competitioin

424
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,050
Not to see you.

425
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,010
Stop being a narcissist!

426
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,250
Talk properly. Show some respect.

427
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,730
I'm gonna bash you!

428
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,170
Don't! Stop!

429
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,890
My fans are all here.

430
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,250
There are many of them. Got it?

431
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,490
I'm not watching anymore.

432
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,090
Hey! You have to watch it!

433
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,050
I've reserved a seat for you.

434
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,920
Lu Yiyi!

435
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,280
- Lu Yiyi! - Go away!

436
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,520
How lively!

437
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,680
They are a bickering pair.

438
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
They'll be back later.

439
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,030
Don't forget your purpose here today.

440
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,630
That is FOX's board director.

441
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,070
Light Media's Senior Executive.

442
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,310
And Luo Tian.

443
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,660
The key figures of the industry are here.

444
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,500
Try socialising with them?

445
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,300
I don't know anything.

446
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,620
I don't have the guts to talk to them.

447
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,500
Strangers at first.

448
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
Accquaintances at the second.

449
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,700
You'll get used to it eventually.

450
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,380
If I were to do it this way,

451
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,980
people might label me as someone pretty but useless.

452
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,500
I don't want that to happen.

453
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,290
That might defeat the purpose of my invite.

454
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,210
Thanks for your invitation.

455
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,410
But..

456
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,010
Okay, I understand.

457
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,560
Do it your way.

458
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
I'm off to prepare for the competition.

459
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,120
Cheer for me!

460
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Definitely! All the best!

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,480
I'll do my best!

462
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,580
Where did Yiyi go?

463
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,620
What is your relationship with Ji Xiang Kong?

464
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,780
What?

465
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,460
I'm asking you.

466
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,180
What is your relationship with Ji Xiang Kong?

467
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,020
I..

468
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,580
We are just friends.

469
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,060
Why are you asking this?

470
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,500
Just curious.

471
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,390
I'm a little nervous.

472
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,550
It's just a beta competition.

473
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,670
What are you nervous about?

474
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,070
How can I not be nervous?

475
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,030
This competition decides

476
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,190
your position as our Captain.

477
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,510
Seriously.

478
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,270
I'm more nervous than you.

479
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,630
Enough.

480
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,590
Just chill and play. Don't be nervous.

481
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,070
Easier said.

482
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,620
Huoyao, what are you thinking?

483
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,940
Are you as nervous as Lin Yixuan?

484
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,300
Nope.

485
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm just feeling unwell.

486
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
Drink some water.

487
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,920
Why are you in a daze?

488
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll help you with the cap.

489
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,720
I.. I can do it myself.

490
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,670
He seems thirsty.

491
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,190
Maybe because I didn't sleep well last night.

492
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
I..

493
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,540
I'll be okay after washing my face.

494
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,450
1st row Seat 11.

495
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,430
Such a good seat.

496
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,790
Did he..

497
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,230
specially arrange this for me?

498
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,780
The competition is starting soon.

499
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,570
Perform well.

500
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,850
I'll make sure you get what you want.

501
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Good evening, everyone!

502
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,100
Welcome to "ICONQUER" new beta competition.

503
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,660
I'm the host tonight,

504
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,420
Luo Tian.

505
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,380
Hi, everyone.

506
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm the host tonight, Qiuying.

507
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,250
Qiuying!

508
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,010
One day,

509
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,570
I'll definitely make it on stage.

510
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,230
I can do it!

511
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,750
Firstly,

512
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,670
let me introduce

513
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,270
the newly released character of ICONQUER,

514
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,510
Heavenly Warrior.

515
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,150
Look at the screen.

516
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,270
These are the 5 fighters newly created for all China players.

517
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,030
They are namely Yu Bang,

518
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,070
Ah Xin, Zhi Heng, Jin Can

519
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,710
Gongxi Changqing.

520
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,670
They belong to the following elements

521
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,790
metal, wood, water, fire and earth.

522
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,430
They are all associated with each other.

523
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,740
That's right.

524
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,940
The design was inspired by China's art and design.

525
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,180
The story of each character was derived from a Chinese mythology.

526
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,260
Specially for all China players.

527
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,920
That's right. "Heavenly Warrior" series

528
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,320
is a historical creation of ICONQUER.

529
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,960
Today,

530
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,000
Legends and VNG will be having

531
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,000
their first battle of the new beta version on stage.

532
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,270
Is everyone excited?

533
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,310
Excited!

534
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,230
Alright. Up next,

535
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,230
let's welcome both teams up on stage.

536
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,110
Welcome, Legends.

537
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,700
VNG!

538
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Next. We'll thereby announce

539
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,270
new beta competition shall begin now!

540
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,110
Both teams, get ready.

541
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,940
All the best!

542
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,060
I just analysed..

543
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,180
70% of the audience

544
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,410
should expect Pei Xi to win.

545
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,450
Of course.

546
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,250
Why?

547
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,170
Legends..

548
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,680
was the runner up of the finals at Vancouver.

549
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,200
Gu Fang's existence in Legends

550
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,680
makes a huge difference.

551
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,060
Legends' teamwork was great.

552
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,340
The attack was shot in a second!

553
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,180
Without teamwork and trust,

554
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,140
a strong Mid Laner like Pei Xi

555
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,420
is tough to be defeated for Legends.

556
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,380
Didn't you just said that

557
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,220
Gu Fang's existence in Legends

558
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,660
makes a huge difference?

559
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,620
Did I?

560
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,140
Alright.

561
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,820
As Pei Xi was defeated just now,

562
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,450
VNG chose to camouflage themselves!

563
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,450
But Legends managed to clear the vog.

564
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,090
Legends is getting ready to attack!

565
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,730
Let's see.

566
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,930
Who will succeed?

567
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,190
They are nearing each other.

568
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,910
Both teams are fighting!

569
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,550
Oh no..

570
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,630
Huoyao? What's happening?

571
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,910
He made a huge attack but at the wrong direction!

572
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,110
What a pity!

573
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,470
What's wrong with Huoyao?

574
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,150
Xiang Kong.

575
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,990
Let's disperse. Protect ourselves.

576
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:29,790
Let's disperse.

577
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,510
Do not attack.

578
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,150
Retreat.

579
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,670
Retreat..

580
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,830
Huoyao, retreat..

581
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,070
Huoyao, what are you..

582
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,190
Alright, I'm retreating..

583
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,150
Why is Legends lacking today?

584
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,180
We're going to win this..

585
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,860
We can do it!

586
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,180
Can we change?

587
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,460
We can't win this.

588
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,440
We can see that VNG is attacking Legends.

589
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,080
Seems like VNG is winning this.

590
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,360
VNG is getting close to the jewel!

591
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,560
Huoyao, what's wrong with you today?

592
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,710
Wake up! It's a competition!

593
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,070
We're at the finals!

594
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,900
Something unusual with Huoyao.

595
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,130
Xuan..

596
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,210
The second round is about to begin.

597
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,210
Cheer up.

598
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,930
Huoyao, what's wrong with you just now?

599
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,050
Why didn't you attack?

600
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,210
Huoyao..

601
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,290
Huoyao.

602
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,120
We had a strong advantage.

603
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
Chances of winning for the previous game was 90%.

604
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
Sorry, everyone.

605
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,390
I didn't sleep well last night.

606
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,950
Just now..

607
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,790
[Something unusual with Huoyao.]

608
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,150
Maybe I was too nervous.

609
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,790
I was out of the condition.

610
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,860
Please buck up for the next round.

611
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,020
If we lose again..

612
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,020
This is a beta competition, Huoyao.

613
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,660
We are playing against VNG.

614
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,980
How many times have we won them?

615
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,820
We have been playing for a long time.

616
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,220
Since when were you nervous?

617
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,340
If we lose again, Xiangkong is out of the team.

618
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,140
Can you please buck up?

619
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,860
It isn't the right time to argue now.

620
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,890
Huoyao, get your condition right.

621
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
Hi professionals!

622
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,280
What's wrong with you guys?

623
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,280
Can you guys play this properly?

624
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,440
Don't wish to win?

625
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,200
Is there any problem?

626
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,820
Manager Zhao, relax.

627
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,820
There is nothing wrong.

628
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,780
Huoyao,

629
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,660
what are you nervous about?

630
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,180
Is there any issue?

631
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,140
Nope.

632
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,860
Relax.

633
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,020
Play well.

634
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,620
The second round depends on you.

635
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,530
All the best, guys!

636
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,210
Alright.

637
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,530
The next round is starting soon.

638
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,530
Let's go.

639
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,510
Huoyao.

640
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,310
It's okay. We only lost one round.

641
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,430
There is still chance in winning the next round.

642
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,500
Don't stress yourself.

643
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,100
The role of the Captain doesn't matter to me.

644
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,940
Most importantly,

645
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,620
to battle the game with the team.

646
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
Captain, rest assure.

647
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,960
I will not make any mistakes this time.

648
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,400
[Ji Xiang Kong: I've known him for 2 years]

649
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,520
[I trust him.]

650
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,190
Alright.

651
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,670
Both teams are ready for Round 2.

652
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,590
Selection round begins.

653
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,580
I wonder which character will they choose.

654
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,420
Xuan, I'll help you to choose.

655
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Choose Gongxi Changqing.

656
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,660
Okay.

657
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,700
Let's take a look.

658
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,740
Legends chose

659
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,020
Gongxi Changqing.

660
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,530
They chose Gongxi Changqing. Damn it!

661
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,570
They're trying to help Lin Yixuan--

662
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,090
They snatched our aide!

663
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,570
They chose a strong aide.

664
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,770
Choose Jin Can.
