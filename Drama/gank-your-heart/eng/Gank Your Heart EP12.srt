1
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,100
Your current district server ranking is 735

2
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,796
You don't have to remind me

3
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,141
According to my current level

4
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,946
let alone the champion of Tomorrow's Star

5
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:01,872
I am not qualified to be a waiter 

6
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,973
in MengLvRen

7
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:07,816
I just want to say

8
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:09,723
 the ideal is full

9
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,109
the reality is very harsh

10
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,986
Do you want to think twice about 

11
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,342
taking part in the competition?

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,871
No, I don't

13
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:17,533
I can do it

14
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,643
No, are you serious about this?

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,008
When have I ever made a joke?

16
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,271
If I want to improve 

17
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,729
my professional knowledge quickly

18
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,911
I must acquire it in practice

19
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:37,119
Start

20
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:38,944
What are you going to start?

21
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,494
Practicing the hero

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,530
Sister, it's half past twelve

23
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,741
Crazy, really crazy

24
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,545
All right, you do it

25
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:54,463
I'll put on a mask 

26
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,136
and go to bed

27
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:56,777
Sleep!

28
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,006
Here you are

29
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,240
Your natural delight

30
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:19,738
Ok, thank you

31
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,257
You suck at video games

32
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:51,866
Are you talking about me?

33
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:55,475
Try the mage

34
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,055
The mage? 

35
00:03:59,075 --> 00:03:59,951
Why?

36
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,010
Actually, I don't think 

37
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,672
I'm good with shooters either

38
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,936
But if I use a wizard

39
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:07,170
which one?

40
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,566
I know you're the first mage

41
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:12,492
Or you can recommend some to me

42
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,624
The main thing is that 

43
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,327
 if I practice the mage,I have to start from scratch

44
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,733
So how do I fit the early inscriptions?

45
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:18,661
And you know what? 

46
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,915
To the early and late stages

47
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,577
you say this outfit...

48
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,339
Is this for me?

49
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:28,480
Thank you

50
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:32,966
Puppie is so cute

51
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:35,454
Why did you give me a lollipop?

52
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,879
You talk too much.Eat!

53
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,049
Sort out the questions 

54
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,130
and send them to me

55
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,043
The mage?

56
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:55,448
I think Xi Pei 

57
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,977
used Zaowuzhe

58
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,598
Anyway, try it first

59
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,604
Sister, what time is it?

60
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,491
You haven't gone to sleep yet

61
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,071
You want to be friends with the panda?

62
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:10,457
I don't have much time left

63
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:12,057
before the game

64
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,117
I must hurry up

65
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,053
All right, all right

66
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,174
Then I'll go to bed first

67
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:19,929
Don't stay up too late

68
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:22,376
Go to sleep. Good night

69
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,469
You're amazing

70
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:02,517
XiPei teacher

71
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,271
These are all the questions 

72
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:07,707
abot the Zaowuzhe that I'd like to ask you

73
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:31,953
Look at me

74
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,457
Look at the computer,not at me

75
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:06,742
That's the difference 

76
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,026
between a pro and a rookie

77
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:10,759
Do you understand?

78
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,123
No, teacher XiPei

79
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,428
You were moving your hands too fast,

80
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,570
like playing the piano

81
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:19,629
and I was dazzled

82
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,362
Could you repeat it for me?

83
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:24,921
Watch the replay for yourself

84
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,070
XiPei, XiPei, XiPei

85
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,833
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

86
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,524
In order to thank you for your guidance

87
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,298
I would like to stay in MengLvRen 

88
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:41,234
to help you make coffee,do chores

89
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,111
 and do other chores

90
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,303
And I don't want a salary

91
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:45,496
I'm capable

92
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,413
You are not the first in the district

93
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,085
You are not qualified to be

94
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:50,085
 a waiter of MengLvRen

95
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,481
XiPei, XiPei, I really...

96
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:53,643
I can do anything

97
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,070
Move the table

98
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:56,824
clean the table, sweep the floor and so on

99
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,119
 I really...

100
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,350
Thank you 

101
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:21,294
Here we come

102
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,151
Brother Kong

103
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,272
The Coach

104
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:25,108
Xiangkong

105
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,698
Are you prepared the materials?

106
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:29,859
So let's get started

107
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:32,836
Where is the Yao Huo?

108
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,437
I just had dinner with him 

109
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:35,436
and he said he needed to 

110
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,272
go out on something

111
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,210
Where is he going?

112
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,046
He didn't tell me

113
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,799
Leave him alone. Let's start

114
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,816
Everybody knows that

115
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:46,754
What Weiteng is best at 

116
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,018
is four guarantees one tactic

117
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:48,773
As long as we can

118
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,129
arrest the development of XiPei in the early stage

119
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,546
we may win the game

120
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,104
I've prepared all of XiPei's videos here

121
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:56,287
so let's take a look

122
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,441
Brother Yao, You have come

123
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:11,224
Sorry, guys

124
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,284
I'm late

125
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:15,114
See the video

126
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:31,557
You've been in great form lately

127
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,640
Your contract with the Ledends team 

128
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:36,886
is due to expire in two months

129
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,680
This is a contract for next year

130
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:53,969
Thank you,manager Z hao

131
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:55,954
Who thinks for the team?

132
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:57,577
who is capable?

133
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,575
who is really good?

134
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:02,207
The board and I 

135
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,453
know that

136
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:05,953
YaoHuo

137
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,209
What do you think of 

138
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:09,811
the choice of captain?

139
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,182
If the test match won

140
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,108
won't Xiangkong become the captain?

141
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,913
You, Xiangkong Ji

142
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,477
Yixuan Lin, Feng Lu

143
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,191
Of the four of you

144
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,084
you are the one I admire most

145
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,749
If gu fang hadn't insisted on 

146
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:28,391
recommending Xiangkong Ji as the team leader

147
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:29,328
I would definitely 

148
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,693
recommend you to the board of directors

149
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:38,753
Manager Zhao

150
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,712
My ability is also average

151
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,518
It's not about ability

152
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,033
YaoHuo

153
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:49,814
I'll tell you the truth

154
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,762
Time and tide wait for no man

155
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,968
You know

156
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:59,186
the golden age of the professional

157
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,519
 is just a few years

158
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,436
Chairman Jin has been very thoughtful

159
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,112
 about your furture development orientation

160
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,365
If you 

161
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:08,677
continue to follow Xiangkong Ji 

162
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:09,634
like this

163
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,553
I can't help you

164
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:19,890
A straightforward person does not resort to insinuations

165
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,790
You are a wise man, too

166
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:24,791
If you can understand 

167
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,523
what I mean

168
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:27,785
Do you want to be the captain 

169
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,553
or are you waiting so awkwardly 

170
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,716
for the elimination?

171
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,311
When it comes to the test match

172
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,223
 it's up to you

173
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,802
Don't let me down

174
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
I have something else to do. I'm leaving

175
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,678
XiPei 

176
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,760
likes to fight alone

177
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,854
with a low participation rate 

178
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,794
and little cooperation with his teammates

179
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,188
so this is our breakthrough

180
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:03,157
We need to harass XiPei 

181
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,279
in the early stage

182
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,106
Very good

183
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:08,651
YaoHuo, say it

184
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:11,943
YaoHuo

185
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,086
Tell me about it

186
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:16,428
Sorry, coach

187
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:17,569
I'm a little off my head today

188
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,468
Brother Yao, do you have a fever?

189
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,438
No,I don't

190
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:23,960
If you don't feel well

191
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,075
go back to have a rest

192
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,706
Okay, I'll go home and rest

193
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,916
You guys settle down

194
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,222
 I'll do it tonight

195
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:33,458
I'm sorry

196
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,559
Go for it

197
00:12:58,686 --> 00:12:59,814
It's too difficult

198
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,708
What,did you see the handsome guy?

199
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,496
What are you doing here?

200
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:23,789
Yixuan Lin told me 

201
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:24,600
that you stay here a lot

202
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:25,471
I was just passing by 

203
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:26,763
and came up to have a look

204
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,036
I didn't realize you were actually here

205
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:30,589
So little food and sleep

206
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,305
Only forget to sleep, did not forget to eat

207
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:38,728
What are you looking at?

208
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,553
Xipei can do this wave operation

209
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,798
How do you know it's XiPei?

210
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,849
 His operation can be seen 

211
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:53,951
at a glance

212
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:55,784
Why are you looking at this?

213
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,165
He's teaching me how to use it

214
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:01,879
That is too harsh

215
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:03,818
He was obviously showing off his operations

216
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,638
How can someone like you learn?

217
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,077
I, I have to start early because I am poor

218
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,834
And you said

219
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:15,472
If you say I can, I will

220
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,031
So you come to 

221
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:18,836
MengLvRen to study 

222
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,974
I want to be a commentator

223
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:24,911
And I want to participate in

224
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,289
the competition of Tomorrow Star

225
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,945
so many masters here

226
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,923
I just can improve myself quickly

227
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,689
Don't rub your eyes like that 

228
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:40,140
Have you been looking too long?

229
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,143
Don't look at it. He's hectoring upon you

230
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:44,928
and you can't understand it

231
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,425
Come on, I'll show you around

232
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:47,942
Go

233
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:01,068
Is someone calling me names?

234
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,561
Thank you

235
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,069
It's nice to have flowers

236
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,194
Do you think today is perfect?

237
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:23,783
Why?

238
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:26,395
Because I can go shopping 

239
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:27,206
with a handsome guy like me at night

240
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,783
Why are you so narcissistic?

241
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,116
I have a million fans

242
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:34,336
Ok?

243
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:38,584
Seriously

244
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:39,850
the finals are coming up

245
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,589
Are you nervous?

246
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,027
Nervous?

247
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,300
How can you be nervous?

248
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,070
I could have gotten 90

249
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:47,692
If I add my thousands of fans

250
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:49,348
 I can get 99 points

251
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,056
Where is the other one?

252
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,308
You, if you come

253
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:55,805
I'll get a full mark

254
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,057
Perfect

255
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:02,915
Am I only worth one point?

256
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,639
One point is pretty high, okay?

257
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,400
You're already my number one of fan

258
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:11,245
Can teacher Ji 

259
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,791
tutor your number one fan?

260
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:15,308
No problem

261
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,436
I'll give you top secret tutoring

262
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,349
to ensure that you become a master

263
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:19,490
Come with me

264
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,745
What are you bringing me here for?

265
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,677
You'll find out later

266
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:31,975
Welcome to 

267
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,011
the high-end snacks LiangPin shop

268
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,277
we have hundreds of high-end snacks 

269
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,069
for you to choose from

270
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:36,111
thank you

271
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,376
Didn't you say you were going to teach me?

272
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,236
What kind of expert are you?

273
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,109
I think you're just lying to me

274
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:44,606
Just now

275
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:45,641
XiPei's operation, as you can see

276
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,796
What is the core?

277
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:49,243
It's fast, accurateand tough

278
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,272
That's right

279
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,501
Professional players in addition to the tactics 

280
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,926
beyond the ordinary players

281
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,146
more important is the operation

282
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,676
that is the basic skills

283
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,341
But I play this game very late

284
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,231
Can I succeed?

285
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:01,099
Why not?

286
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:02,190
You're not playing IConquer 

287
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,272
for a competition

288
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,531
You're playing IConquer to be professional

289
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:05,804
So you need to understand 

290
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:06,833
the process

291
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,977
 not just say it

292
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,575
Teacher Ji

293
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:14,075
you train me the way you train the pros

294
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:15,704
Ok

295
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:17,234
Today we have the first class

296
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:19,662
training hand speed and reaction ability

297
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,453
Five dried mangoes

298
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,159
Four boxes of pistachios

299
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:32,596
Pistachios, strawberry jelly

300
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:34,278
Hold it

301
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,329
Xiayi scallops

302
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,992
Five boxes of dried mangoes, quickly

303
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:41,711
I'm coming,I'm coming

304
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:45,279
Come on.    -1,2,3,4

305
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,462
Every hero 

306
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,025
has his strengths and weaknesses

307
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:54,922
in the face of own abilities 

308
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,116
beyond the scope

309
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,345
 of the need for the cooperation of teammates

310
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:00,654
How do I feel like 

311
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,933
you're not teaching me

312
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,305
but playing me

313
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,064
Doesn't what I just said make sense?

314
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,840
Ok, you're Xiangkong ji

315
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,139
You are a battlefield swindler

316
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,511
You're right about everything

317
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:18,989
Two bottles of orange juice

318
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:25,935
Hand speed 

319
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,157
and reflexes were good today

320
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,096
Practice more

321
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,877
Next time I'll take you whack-a-mole

322
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,005
Is it useful?

323
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,085
It works for you

324
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:39,278
Well, here I am

325
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:42,516
Just walk me here

326
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,477
Here you are. Here you are

327
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,074
Is this for me?

328
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:49,765
Don't you girls like to eat these snacks?

329
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:51,196
Just don't eat too much 

330
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:52,317
and get fat easily

331
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,349
Thank you

332
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:55,978
What do you like to eat?

333
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,231
I'll treat you some other time

334
00:18:59,084 --> 00:18:59,876
I...

335
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,787
I like strawberry tea with milk

336
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,502
Isn't it? 

337
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:07,006
As a big man

338
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,516
you like strawberry milk tea

339
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:10,791
Your style pf eating is too jumpy?

340
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,183
Believe it or not

341
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,309
Anyway, thank you today

342
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:16,286
You are welcome

343
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:17,249
Please feel free to ask me 

344
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,277
any questions in the future

345
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,471
I'm an encyclopedia

346
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:20,982
It's no use 

347
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:22,360
asking XiPei 

348
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,356
who can only fight alone

349
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:24,748
Are you sure?

350
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,241
 I remember a thing

351
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,009
You answered wrong all six questions 

352
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,944
in the section where the name you ask me  to answer

353
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:33,546
XiPei...

354
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,334
That was a misunderstanding,okay?

355
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,298
Well, to make it up to you

356
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:40,815
I have prepared 

357
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,048
two invitations for the test match

358
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,493
and I hope you can come here

359
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:45,788
I will cheer you on

360
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:48,057
I told you that 

361
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:49,495
the millions of fans 

362
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,071
cheering me on was only 99 points

363
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,683
 The last point is yours

364
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:55,628
Well, it's getting late

365
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,598
Quickly go upstairs

366
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:58,669
Be safe on the road, too

367
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,417
Bye    -Bye

368
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:11,867
Oh my god

369
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,123
Why is my heart beating so fast?

370
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,392
Face still hot

371
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,027
Don't think too much

372
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,340
Don't think about it

373
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,417
Ying Qiu, you need to calm down

374
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:22,750
Need to calm down

375
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,548
Yiyi, Yiyi

376
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,892
Where did she go?

377
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:39,311
Oh my god

378
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,695
You scared the shit out of me

379
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,867
What are you doing here?

380
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,585
I saw it all

381
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:50,775
What do you see?

382
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:52,357
What do you think I saw?

383
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,049
Sending flowers to each other also

384
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:58,617
He is only on his way

385
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,376
Only you can believe that

386
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,902
He meant well

387
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,514
A girl like me

388
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,249
and still grow so beautiful

389
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:10,997
What if I meet a sex maniac? 

390
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:12,270
Isn't it?

391
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,122
He looks like 

392
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,160
the biggest sex maniac to me

393
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,951
Xiangkong Ji gave me

394
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,626
 two tickets for the test match

395
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:27,044
Would you like to come with me?

396
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,414
This little sugar-coated trick 

397
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,601
is just trying to impress me

398
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:32,987
I'm telling you

399
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:34,741
As long as I'm a firewall

400
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:36,476
he can't take you down

401
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:38,824
Firewall student

402
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,950
This is an industry event

403
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,698
Are you sure you're not going?

404
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:45,802
I don't go to there

405
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,025
To deal with 

406
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:48,849
a philanderer like him

407
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,465
we must adhere to the three cardinal principles

408
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,903
Don't take a reason

409
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:52,536
Don't take the bait

410
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:53,842
Don't accept

411
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:56,770
That's right

412
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,096
This ticket won't help

413
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:00,299
And you're in that nursing home

414
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,711
 like this big news

415
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,498
 you just copy and paste

416
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:05,938
Where's the trash can?

417
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,139
Throw away,throw away,throw away

418
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,557
Wait a minute

419
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:11,531
I just figure it out

420
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:13,108
If I don't go

421
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,038
Xiangkong ji 

422
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:15,640
will have more chance to close to you

423
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,598
No

424
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,917
I have to go there for you

425
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,496
Now, don't be angry

426
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:25,323
I tell you

427
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,095
I don't forgive you

428
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:27,546
Little angel

429
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:28,495
I'm not your little angel

430
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,114
I bought you 

431
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,974
your favorite dried mango

432
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,341
Count you have conscience

433
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,575
You said you didn't want to come

434
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:59,165
  You couldn't wait to get in here

435
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,447
Now that I'm here

436
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,344
 just take some pictures 

437
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:03,789
to pass the time

438
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,717
I'll go over there and have a look.

439
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:08,630
Yiyi Lu

440
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,679
Yixuan Lin

441
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,957
What are you wearing?

442
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,114
You come to see me play

443
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:19,539
and you should dress up 

444
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,601
and put on a tuxedo or something

445
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:22,197
What I wear 

446
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:23,147
is none of your business

447
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:24,057
Besides, I'm here to watch the game

448
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:24,941
 I'm not here to see you

449
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:25,950
Why are you so narcissistic?

450
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,199
You talk to me well. Be respectful

451
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:30,633
I want to hit you again

452
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:32,018
Don't do it. Stop

453
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,654
I tell you

454
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,795
These are my fans

455
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,074
I have many fans. Do you hear me?

456
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:37,308
I don't watch it

457
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:38,917
No, you have to watch it

458
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,880
I have a seat reserved for you

459
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,704
Yiyi Lu

460
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:42,116
Yiyi Lu    -Go away

461
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,336
So busy

462
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,486
They are quarrelsome lovers

463
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:46,911
They'll be back in a minute

464
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,622
By the way, don't forget

465
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:50,650
 what you're here for today

466
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,344
LiMao chairman

467
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:55,788

469
00:23:58,334 --> 00:23:58,994

470
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:00,306
in the industry are here

471
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,114
Won't you come up and get acquainted with them?

472
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:04,923
I don't know anything about this

473
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,232
How can I talk to them?

474
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:08,828
First time strangers,second time friends

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,246
Meet them more often and you'll get to know them

476
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,999
In this way

477
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,547
 someone will label me as a vase again

478
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,157
I don't want to do this

479
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:21,716
In that case,are you worthy of

480
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:22,791
 my invitation?

481
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:24,803
Thank you for the invitation

482
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:25,957

What's your relationship with Xiangkong Ji?

491
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:53,151

492
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:54,753
I ask you

493
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,487
What's your relationship with Xiangkong Ji?

494
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:00,327
I...

495
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,807
We're just friends

496
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,256
Why do you ask?

497
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,714
Bacause I'm curious

498
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:29,512
I'm a little nervous.

499
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,590
A test match

500
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,672
What are you nervous about?

501
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:34,921
Can I not be nervous?

502
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,045
This game will decide 

503
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:38,232
whether you stay as captain or not

504
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:39,551
How terrible

505
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,233
You're in no hurry. I'm in no hurry

506
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:42,539

00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,491
Take it easy. Play hard. Take it easy

That's easy for you to easy

509
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:54,477
Brother yao, what's on your mind?

510
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:56,436
You're not

512
00:25:58,678 --> 00:25:59,173

513
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:00,446
I'm just not feeling well

514
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,799
You have a drink of water

515
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:14,560
What are you staring?

516
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:15,688

You are very thirsty

519
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:29,796
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night

520
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,778
In this way, I...

521
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:33,872

542
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:43,331
 I'd like to introduce you 

543
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,970
to the IConquer series of heroes

544
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,229
Xuantian Warrior

545
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,773
Look at the big screen

546
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:51,279
Here are five new heroes 

547
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,829
designed by IConquer 

548
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,894
specifically for Chinese summoners

549
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,552
Well, they're Yubang

550
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,592

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,488
Their attributes 

553
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,090
are made up of the five elements of China

554
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,320
They are formed by the interaction of 

555
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,949
 metal, wood, water, fire and earth

556
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:10,077
Yes

557
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,000
This design 

558
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,445
is very Chinese

559
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:14,021
Their story 

560
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:14,951
is also adapted from 

561
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,554
the myth of Xuantian Warrior

562
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:17,774
which is 

563
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,759
a unique benefit to Chinese fans

564
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,252
Yes, the Xuantian warrior heroes 

565
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,158

00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:50,798
Weiteng

577
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,238
Ok, let's announce that 

578
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:27,312
this new version of the beta finals 

579
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,068
is now open

580
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:33,030
Please take your seats

581
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:47,791
Come on, come on

582
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:56,748
I just looked at it

583
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:58,694
About 70 percent of the people now say 

584
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,914
 Xipei will win

585
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:01,088
Of course

586
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:05,949
Why?

587
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,392
Wasn't Legends the runner-up 

588
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,322
in the vancouver finals?

589
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:12,868
Legends without Fang Gu

590
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:14,266
gets much worse

591
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:25,109
The cooperation of group battle 

592
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:26,560
is really too tacit       -Great

593
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:27,886
It's really a one-second judgment

594
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,014
Without mutual understanding 

595
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:29,647
and absolute trust

596
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,606
So strong mid like Xi Pei 

597
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:32,892
is difficult to be killed

598
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:34,917
You just said that 

599
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,678
Legends would be much worse 

600
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:38,116
without Fang Gu

601
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:39,916
Did I say that?

602
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:47,521
Ok

603
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,223
Because Xi Pei was killed just now

604
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:50,087
Now Weiteng 

605
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,716
chose to open the fog to secretly shoot down tai lung

606
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:53,325
But Legends' false eye 

607
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,796
has seen them fogging

608
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,451
They're in ambush here

609
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:57,988
Let's see 

610
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,228
if they can sneak down the dragon?

611
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:00,435
The enemy has come

612
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,085
They're coming. They're fighting

613
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:06,800
This...No

614
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:07,868
What's the matter, Yao Huo?

615
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,115
His big move was way off base

616
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:10,309
That's too bad

617
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,635
What's wrong with Yao Huo?

618
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:13,244
Brother Kong

619
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,091
You retreat and defend the enemy

620
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,948
Let's retreat first

621
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:16,753
Don't fight yet,don't fight yet

622
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,214
Move it back

623
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:17,874
Move it back

624
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,969
Brother Yao, move it back,move it back

625
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,077
What's wrong with you, brother Yao?

626
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,238
Okay, I'll go back. I'll go back

627
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,200
How did Legends feel so bad today?

628
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,233
We'll win, we'll win

629
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,796
Yes, yes, yes

630
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:35,432
Can we kill one?

631
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:36,243
Can we kill one?

632
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,463
We can't fight this group war

633
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,278
Weiteng has stormed

634
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:43,399
the final defensive tower of Legends

635
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:44,909
It looks unstoppable

636
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:46,354
They're going to break the crystal

637
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:56,597
No,brother Yao

638
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,402
What's the matter with you today?

639
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,509
Wake up. This is a private test match

640
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:04,782
This is the final game

641
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:18,587
Yao Huo has a problem

642
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:26,726
Yixuan

643
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,801
The second game is about to begin

644
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:28,883
Cheer up

645
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,472
Brother Yao, what happened to you just now?

646
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:36,593
Why don't you come on?

647
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:37,707
Brother Yao

648
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:39,831
Brother Yao

649
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:41,751
We have so much 

650
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,582
economic advantage

651
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:44,191
The win in the last game is in the bag

652
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:49,916
I'm sorry, guys

653
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:51,829
I didn't sleep well last night

654
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:53,392
In the last game

655
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,197
Yao Huo have problem

656
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,628
Maybe I was too nervous

657
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:57,270
I'm not in the zone

658
00:33:58,405 --> 00:33:59,374
Then please stay competitive 

659
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:00,245
for the next round

660
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,353
If we lose again

661
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,431
This is only a test match, brother yao

662
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,061
Our opponent is Weiteng

663
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,316
How many times have we beaten him?

664
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,154
I've been fighting with you for so long

665
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,466
When have I seen you nervous?

666
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,590
If we lose one more game,brother Kong will leave

667
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:14,907
Can you 

668
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:16,437
improve your concentration?   -Stop

669
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,191
Now is not the time for argue about it

670
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,200
BrotherYao

671
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,073
You just need to adjust

672
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:33,388
Masters

673
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,498
What are you doing? One by one

674
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,435
Can you play well?

675
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,563
You don't want to win, do you?

676
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:39,317
Do you have any questions?

677
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:43,954
Manager Zhao, don't worry

678
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,939
What can happen to us?

679
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:53,768
YaoHuo

680
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,635
What are you nervous about?

681
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,197
Do you have any questions?

682
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,033
No problem

683
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:06,742
Be relaxed

684
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:07,870
You have to play well

685
00:35:08,477 --> 00:35:09,473
It was up to you last time

686
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,390
Come on, everyone

687
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:16,088
Ok

688
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:17,321
The next match is about to begin

689
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:18,436
Let's go

690
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,093
Brother Yao

691
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:45,960
All right. We just lost one game

692
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:48,077
We still have a chance in the next game

693
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:52,027
Don't take on too much weight

694
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:54,679
It doesn't matter to me if I'm not the captain

695
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:56,559
the important thing is 

696
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,204
to fight with the brothers

697
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,257
Don't worry, captain

698
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,372
In the next game

699
00:36:03,992 --> 00:36:05,476
I will make no mistake

700
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:18,760
We have been brothers more than two years 

701
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,775
I believe him

702
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:24,557
Ok, the two teams 

703
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,068
are now in the second game

704
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,914
Now this is BP

705
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:29,926
I wonder what kind of hero 

706
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:30,810
each side will choose 

707
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:31,885
in this game

708
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,683
Yixuan, I help you pick

709
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:33,798
Gongxichangqing

710
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:34,912
Ok

711
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:35,921
Let's take a look

712
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:38,072
Legends first chose

713
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,213
 Gongxichangqing

714
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:41,805
They chose Gongxichangqing. Oh, no

715
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,711
They must want to choose 

716
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:44,351
The sup was robbed

717
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,815
this powerful sup hero for Xuanyi Lin

718
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:46,910
We chose Jincan
