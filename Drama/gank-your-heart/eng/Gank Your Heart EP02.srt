2,

00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,890
1.

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,190
My leg,,,

7
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,670
My leg hurts so much.

8
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm sorry, are you okay?

9
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,070
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

10
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,670
I'm fine.

11
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,790
I can get up on my own.

12
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,910
I'll assist you.

13
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,270
She's fine, don't worry, get back to the car.

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm okay, it's alright.

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,270
You should board the car quickly.

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,990
I can walk.

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,870
Are you sure you're okay?

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,750
Do you need me to send you to the hospital?

19
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,750
No.

20
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,230
I still have to look for Gu Fang.

21
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,460
I came to Vancouver

22
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,660
just to see Gu Fang.

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,780
I won't go back

24
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,660
if I don't see him.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,360
You're Ji Xiang Kong, aren't you?

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
I am.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
I know you both are teammates,

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
that...

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
Can you

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,560
bring me to Gu Fang?

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
You're my last hope!

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,390
I beg of you!

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,030
Seems like it's another failure.

34
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,100
How can I reject since you're

35
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,980
already begging me.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,220
Hop on.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,220
Really?

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,420
Thank you.

39
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,740
Your leg...

40
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,250
I was too happy,

41
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,050
I forgot my leg was injuried.

42
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,090
Let's go, hop on.

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,110
He shouldn't have suspected a thing.

44
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,420
Are you cold?

45
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,060
No.

46
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,700
Are you hot?

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,860
No, the temperature is just right.

48
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,660
Are you thirsty? Do you want some water?

49
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,420
No, thank you.

50
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,260
Are you nervous?

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,090
No.

52
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,570
Act, continue acting.

53
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,040
Is your leg still painful?

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,880
Still a lttle,

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
but it's a lot better now.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
It heal so fast?

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,740
Weren't you almost a crippled just now?

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,660
I was still wondering

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,820
if I had to be

60
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,420
responsible for you for the rest of your life.

61
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,540
It's not that serious.

62
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,980
You're already helping me

63
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,740
since you're bringing me to Gu Fang.

64
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,260
I'm more than grateful.

65
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,020
Are you really Gu Fang's fan?

66
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,940
Of course.

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,180
I really like him a lot.

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,570
I'm his ultimate fan.

69
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,810
Then tell me

70
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,450
which year did he

71
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,170
first won the champion?

72
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,930
Which game was it

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,770
for his best performance?

74
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,170
Who was his opponents when

75
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,090
he first gotten wiped out?

76
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,910
You don't know?

77
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,910
I forgot

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,150
but...

79
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,670
But you must really believe me,

80
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,990
I really like him a lot.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,230
Really.

82
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,230
Why are you so nervous for?

83
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,670
What is tricks is he playing?

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,550
Is he suspecting me?

85
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,820
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,380
So he wants to strike a conversation with me.

87
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,610
Add me on wechat.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
I... This...

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,200
On a closer look,

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,200
seems like I haven't seen you before.

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,920
My apologises,

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,600
I've mistaken.

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Play me?

94
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,440
Now we considered met.

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,960
Actually,

96
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,040
I took a lot of your handsome

97
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,680
photos just now during the competition.

98
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,310
I was saying to leave your contact

99
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,110
so it's easier to send it to you.

100
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,870
Look.

101
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,150
So handsome.

102
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,110
This is good too.

103
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,380
There's even nicer ones at the back.

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,940
Hurry,

105
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,820
send them to me.

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,940
Not bad taken.

107
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,500
It's because you're handsome.

108
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,580
where's my phone?

109
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,700
where's my phone?

110
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,170
I left it in the main car.

111
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,050
Lef tit in the main car?

112
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
It's alright.

113
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,370
Next time will do.

114
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,810
Forget it, it's fine.

115
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,850
Keep my photos

116
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,770
well,

117
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,810
do not delete it.

118
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,120
It's so well taken.

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Sure.

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,880
Ridiculous

121
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
and weird.

122
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,630
Seems like I met the drama king himself.

123
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,940
Gu Fang is inside?

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,780
Yes, captain is in there.

125
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,820
Hurry in.

126
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,420
Aren't you going in with me?

127
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,260
You head in first,

128
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,690
I'll come after I parked the car.

129
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,610
Then...

130
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,610
I'll wait for you inside.

131
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,930
See you.

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,660
Hi, how can I help you?

133
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm looking for Gu Fang,

134
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,620
is he here?

135
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,940
You know Gu Fang?

136
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Are you looking for someone?

137
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,810
Okay, wait.

138
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,130
Have you seen this person?

139
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,110
I don't know.

140
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,270
Team Legends,

141
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,350
very famous.

142
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,870
Gu Fang,

143
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,750
very very very famous.

144
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,190
Michael?

145
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,470
Did she just say Team Legends?

146
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,230
Yes.

147
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,390
I love those guys.

148
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,230
Gu Fang, is he here?

149
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,230
Where?

150
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,950
Oh you think he's here,

151
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,030
no.

152
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,110
I definitely would have notice if he was here.

153
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,190
-Not here?          -No.

154
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,110
Sorry.

155
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,030
I hope you find him.

156
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,910
Thank you.

157
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
Hello, how was it?

158
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,540
Did you interview Gu Fang?

159
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,120
Yi Yi, I was played.

160
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
I don't even see

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
Gu Fang's shadow.

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,040
Oh,

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,200
I told you to monitor Legends' fans

164
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
on Weibo,

165
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,400
what's their update now?

166
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,480
you... wait for a moment.

167
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,240
I'll look it up for you.

168
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,200
They uploaded a team photo,

169
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,790
seems like it's at

170
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,070
Vancouver's top pub.

171
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,750
Got it,

172
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,630
I'll go over now.

173
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
Captain.

174
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,690
What's wrong?

175
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,090
We sat here for half a day

176
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,210
but nobody dares to go over.

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,160
In any case, we are still

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,230
the world's second

179
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,150
okay?

180
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,310
First runner up is embarassing.

181
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,430
We are above millions

182
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,990
but below one team.

183
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,070
Is that right, Brother Yao?

184
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,110
Get high, come on.

185
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,150
Get high, hurry.

186
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Not embarassing?

187
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,140
What are we here for?

188
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,540
we arehere for the champion

189
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
and not the first runner up.

190
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,500
Reflection upon yourselves.

191
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,700
Okay, everyone?

192
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,500
Hello, Yi Yi.

193
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,050
I've reached the pub.

194
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,610
I'm looking for him.

195
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,690
I see Gu Fang.

196
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,370
I'll take some background and environment first.

197
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,610
Ensure that the connections are smooth

198
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,520
when I interview Gu Fang later.

199
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,880
Don't worry.

200
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
This is your first interview

201
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,200
for Iconquer.

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,280
You tried to hard

203
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,440
to get an exclusive,

204
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
how'd I dare to be careless?

205
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,440
Furthermore,

206
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,420
you're to get even with me

207
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,500
if a problem arises.

208
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,100
President Liu will fire me,

209
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
right?

210
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll go now.

211
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,260
All the best!

212
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,260
All the best!

213
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,100
Captain,

214
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,020
don't think too much.

215
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,820
Don't you always tell me

216
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,380
that most importantly, is to stand up again

217
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,860
even if we lose the competition.

218
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,450
Those are words to comfort you.

219
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,090
If you were to say that,

220
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,170
your words hold no power

221
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,690
here with me

222
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,090
next time.

223
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,070
Xiang Kong, I'm sorry.

224
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,790
Why are you sorry for?

225
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,430
Losing the competition

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,670
isn't solely your fault.

227
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,310
Actually, I did saw

228
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,790
that you told them

229
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,070
to change my position with Huo Yao.

230
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,190
Captain, so you knew it all along?

231
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,550
My condition is bad now.

232
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,190
If I had supported you

233
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,310
in changing tactics,

234
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,140
we might not have lost today.

235
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,020
You already said maybe.

236
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,780
There isn't a 100%

237
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,280
guarantee tactic to win.

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,400
But I lost so unwillingly.

239
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
It's been 4 years.

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
I've taken the first runner up for 4 years.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
Stop saying you're sorry.

243
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Losing the competition

244
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,190
isn't entirely your fault, we...

245
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,790
I've played in competitons for 10 years.

246
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,910
I know my condition

247
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,470
the best.

248
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,230
My prime will not come back.

249
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Actually, sometimes I know clearly

250
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
when they are attacking,

251
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,620
from where,

252
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,580
which route

253
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,260
but I just can't avoid it.

254
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,740
So it's because of Gu Fang

255
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,300
that's why they lost.

256
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,250
This is definitely a hot topic.

257
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,840
This... Is there a problem with the signal?

258
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,640
President Liu...

259
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,920
Hurry, don't just sit there.

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,000
Give her a call, quick.

261
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,270
I... why is it cut off suddenly?

262
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,190
Then.. It must be that she...

263
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,070
Call.

264
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,990
Pick up your phone and call.

265
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,550
Call.

266
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,350
Okay, I'll call.

267
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,980
We're leaving.

268
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,060
Let's go.

269
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,340
Hello, Yi Yi.

270
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,340
What are you up to, Qiu Ying?

271
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,900
Why don't you interview Gu Fang

272
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,330
when you clearly saw him?

273
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,490
And what did Gu Fang

274
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,490
tell Ji Xiang Kong?

275
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,410
What can't be avoided?

276
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,050
Continue up

277
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,130
the video now.

278
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,290
That... President Liu...

279
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,490
I...

280
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,200
Shouldn't I

281
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
build up a good relation with them first?

282
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,480
You say,

283
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,840
if I were to get rejected

284
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,720
when I ask for an interview

285
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,840
it won't be easy for collaboration next time.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,260
What did I ask you to go there for?

287
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,060
You're the host,

288
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,780
I get you to go there to interview...

289
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,460
I'll foot the bill.

290
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Wait for me in the car.

291
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,540
Thank you, Brother Kong.

292
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Sorry.

293
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,260
Don't worry, President Liu.

294
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,620
I'll think of a solution.

295
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,900
Don't tell me all these bullshit.

296
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,620
Go now, immediately!

297
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,420
Yes.

298
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,210
Hey, beautiful.

299
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,050
What are you doing?

300
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,770
I like you.

301
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,770
No.

302
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,690
Don't touch me, no.

303
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,210
What are you doing?

304
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,550
This is my Girlfriend.

305
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,110
He said,

306
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,470
my girl?

307
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,270
Okay.

308
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,390
Thank you.

309
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Thank you.

310
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,460
You really won't give up.

311
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Aren't you angry

312
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,020
for getting played?

313
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,960
Why would I?

314
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
You just saved my life.

315
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,280
Otherwise, I'll treat you to a meal next time.

316
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,680
Trying to satisfy me with just a meal?

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,440
Then... what do you want?

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,160
Simple,

319
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,320
turn right when you exit, bye.

320
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,080
I really want to thank you.

321
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,910
No need to.

322
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,430
You are the one that

323
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,430
pretended to be a staff

324
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,390
and sneak into the restrooms?

325
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,390
Be careful of your skirt.

326
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,230
Sorry.

327
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,020
What? Be careful of your skirt.

328
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,580
You have been continuously

329
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,980
been pretending to be a fan,

330
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,980
your motive is

331
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,330
to have news on Gu Fang right?

332
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,330
Sorry,

333
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,090
he does not accept any interview now.

334
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,810
He need time alone.

335
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,450
I couldn't care less,

336
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,130
I must interview Gu Fang.

337
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,130
Ji Xiang Kong.

338
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,050
Wait up.

339
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,610
Wait a moment.

340
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,360
Wait a moment.

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,120
I admit, I lied to you

342
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,680
but it's also because

343
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,680
of my job.

344
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560
A self introduction,

345
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,350
I'm a host at You Xing Entertainment.

346
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,150
I'm Qiu Ying.

347
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,030
I came to Vancouver

348
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,430
to interview the competition

349
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,590
and to interview Gu Fang.

350
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,780
No matter what you think of me,

351
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,820
I still hope you can help me

352
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,380
because Gu Fang

353
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,980
is China's idolized gamer.

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,820
This battle for him...

355
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,940
Is it that females with good looks

356
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,540
have bad memory?

357
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,180
I've said it

358
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,060
very clearly just now.

359
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,300
Please do not harass him.

360
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Or is that

361
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,620
you can agree to any condition

362
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,140
as long as you can interview him?

363
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,690
It's late now,

364
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:52,970
I still have work to do.

365
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,650
I'll write you my number.

366
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,160
I really wish to interview him

367
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,440
but I know

368
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
he's not in the mood now.

369
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
Call me anytime

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,040
when his mood gets better.

371
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,060
I'll go now, bye.

372
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,660
Remember to give me a call, you must!

373
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,500
You sit here.

374
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,820
How is captain?

375
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,700
He kept sleeping.

376
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,610
Manager Zhao called.

377
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,170
He said the fanmeet tonight

378
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,930
will be cancelled if captain drank too much.

379
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,490
This sly fox.

380
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,930
You saw how he was just now.

381
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,910
I don't believe he'll do this to us

382
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,790
if we were to win today,

383
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,230
But it's better if it's cancelled,

384
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,510
I don't bear to see

385
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,230
the captain now

386
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,110
forcing a smile infront of everyone.

387
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,060
Playing tricks with me?

388
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,180
Who's is it?

389
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,020
None of your business.

390
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,840
It's none of my business.

391
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,480
Driver, let's go.

392
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,720
Let's go.

393
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,110
Hello, Yi Yi.

394
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,550
Hello, Qiu Ying.

395
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,020
What's the situation there?

396
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,900
Interview Gu Fang yet?

397
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,460
No.

398
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,460
He just lost in today's competition,

399
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,090
he's still upset about it.

400
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,410
If I were to interview him now,

401
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,530
isn't it

402
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,730
a little inhumane?

403
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,290
At times like this, you're still

404
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,290
thinking if your inhumane or not?

405
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,930
If that's the case, President Liu is inhumane to you.

406
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,370
I intend to

407
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,680
ask regardlessly,

408
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,760
but

409
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,440
it was see-through, and I got chased out.

410
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,440
Forget it.

411
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
The main priority now is to

412
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,070
quickly do broadcast

413
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,070
of Gu Fang's fanmeet.

414
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,510
You have to start on time,

415
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,510
you can't afford to be late.

416
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,630
Who know,

417
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,510
maybe by then

418
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,870
you may even get the chance to interview Gu Fang.

419
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,390
Okay, I know.

420
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm on my way there.

421
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,180
Then you better hurry up.

422
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,700
Don't worry.

423
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,980
The event got cacncelled?

424
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,860
Why do they only say it now.

425
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,700
Connect her on,

426
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
the broadcast is about to begin.

427
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,700
Nothing should go wrong.

428
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,570
Qiu Ying, are you there yet?

429
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,330
Let him see their official post.

430
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,970
It was said 5 minutes ago that

431
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,330
the event was cancelled

432
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,010
due to Gu Fang being unwell.

433
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,630
President Liu, the event got cancelled.

434
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,630
I don;t care for what reason,

435
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,910
or who's at fault.

436
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,750
The company has invested

437
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,390
a lot of resources,

438
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,310
this can't go to waste.

439
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,390
Let me tell you, Qiu Ying.

440
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,150
I want you to go on live

441
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,350
in the next 30 seconds.

442
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,350
You have to be online!

443
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,030
No, President Liu. Hello?

444
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,110
President Liu, Qiu Ying is alone,

445
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,590
can she do it?

446
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,540
Hello everyone,

447
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm the host from You Xing Entertainment,

448
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,860
Qiu Ying.

449
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,060
Today, I'll bring you the lastest news

450
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,860
of Iconquer.

451
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,240
What do we do, President Liu?

452
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,120
The views kept going down.

453
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,320
You say,

454
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
everyone is here to see Gu Fang

455
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
but now the event is cancelled

456
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,320
our broadcast is

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
not necessary

458
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
to continue anymore?

459
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,440
No, it mustn't stop.

460
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,270
Is there other stuff

461
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,910
about Iconquer,

462
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,630
that is possible to push it up?

463
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,070
No, ask her to think of a solution.

464
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,910
This broadcast

465
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,910
mustn't stop.

466
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,390
Isn't this putting her in a bad spot?

467
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,590
If this broadcast were to stop.

468
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,270
we can all consider

469
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,350
to get fired.

470
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,260
Seems like everyone's

471
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,660
participation is pretty high today

472
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,210
but sadly,

473
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,970
today's event

474
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,210
got cancelled last minute.

475
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,090
I felt that it's a pity.

476
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,530
Legends once again

477
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,530
missed out the champion.

478
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,850
How about this,

479
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,490
I represent You Xing Entertainment

480
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,570
and give everyone

481
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,370
a special programme

482
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,170
as a form of encouragement to Legemds.

483
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,930
Please don't go away.

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,950
The programme is about to begin.

485
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,310
Everyone, please don't leave.

486
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,220
Qiu Ying is really going to dance?

487
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,460
Not bad.

488
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,340
She managed to think of something

489
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,420
despite there's no event.

490
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,000
Isn't this where the fanmeet

491
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
venue is?

492
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,680
Yes.

493
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,680
This Zhao Yang...

494
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,160
If it's not for him,

495
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,480
I couldn't seen Qiu Ying today.

496
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
I remember it now.

497
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,220
I saw her at the

498
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,780
pub entrance today,

499
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,660
talking to Handsome Ji for some time.

500
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
I think I saw her too.

501
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,740
Then why didn't you both tell me.

502
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,620
Are you asking for death?

503
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,980
Captain's asleep.

504
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,620
Handsome Ji, you know this Qiu Ying?

505
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,260
Are you farmiliar with her?

506
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,020
Introduce her to me.

507
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,780
I've noticed her for a long time now.

508
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,820
This kind of flamboyance acting

509
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,580
with low EQ

510
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,410
and uses online fame person,

511
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,410
how can I be familiar with her?

512
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,210
Handsome Ji is Handsome Ji,

513
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,770
he has such peircing eyes.

514
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,650
What are you saying?

515
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,070
Good, the views are going up.

516
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,190
Now

517
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,830
upload the video of

518
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,030
Gu Fang and Ji Xiang Kong.

519
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,550
President Liu,

520
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,430
isn't it not appropriate to

521
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,790
upload that video up?

522
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,910
What is not appropriate about it?

523
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,350
Strike when the iron's hot. Quick, upload it.

524
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,350
Even if it's against the officials, hurry.

525
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,190
I think

526
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,550
she's comparable to the

527
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,430
idol, Miya.

528
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,910
You're comparing her to Miya?

529
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,990
Brother Kong will beat you up.

530
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,870
Why?

531
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,820
Handsome Ji is Miya's die-hard fan.

532
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,180
What are you thinking? Die-hard fan?

533
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,180
Let me tell you

534
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,180
that's called being faithful.

535
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,620
Collecting Miya's albums,

536
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,880
that's called devotion, right?

537
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,560
He buys 3 of each album.

538
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,120
One for listing, one for keeping

539
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
and one for bringing around.

540
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,480
-Right?          -Yes,

541
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,360
I even bow 3 times

542
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,480
to her poster everyday.

543
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,640
Nothing.

544
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,120
Her dancing

545
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
indeed looks at little like Miya.

546
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,080
Brother Kong, do you know her?

547
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,780
Brother Kong?

548
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,700
Miya is too far out of reach,

549
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,780
why not just make

550
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,580
do with her?

551
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,210
Go to bed.

552
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,970
Although your owner is a little mean,

553
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,970
but that's not your fault.

554
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,210
I'll let you unleash your

555
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,800
usage for the last time.

556
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,740
Hello, Qiu Ying.

557
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,140
It was a close call just now.

558
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,180
Luckily you're quick-witted,

559
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,380
make use of dancing to fill up the gaps.

560
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,020
The views for the broadcast went up again.

561
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,460
Really?

562
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,700
That's great.

563
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,820
Alright, you worked hard the whole day.

564
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,090
Head back and rest early.

565
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,090
I'm already at the hotel's entrance.

566
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,730
Okay, bye.

567
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,890
Bye.

568
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,390
[Don't you think that Qiu Ying looks a little like Miya?]

569
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,310
Are they really similar?

570
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,870
Why are you sorry for?

571
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,510
Losing the competition

572
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,510
isn't entirely your fault.

573
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,430
Actually, I did saw...

574
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,590
Film in secret when you can't get to interview?

575
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,350
She really go all out

576
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,710
just to gain fame.

577
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,470
Actually you long know

578
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,300
my condition isn't ideal.

579
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,300
Don't blame me for being

580
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,300
nasty since you're like this.

581
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,320
It's still a little cold.

582
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,320
Maybe it won't be cold if I were to stand up and jump.

583
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,340
[Your necklace is with me, come to Marco Polo hotel tomorrow at 7am to ge tit.]

584
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,490
3,

585
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,770
2,

586
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,610
bye.

587
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,320
Is it out of battery?

588
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,300
Hello,

589
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,180
excuse me.

590
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,780
Hello, how can I help you?

591
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,140
I want to know him

592
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
from team Legends,

593
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,860
Ji Xiang Kong.

594
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,380
His room number.

595
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm sorry

596
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,980
but we can't tell

597
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,140
client's information.

598
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,850
I'm his best friend

599
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,210
but his phone is

600
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,930
off now,

601
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,520
I think maybe he's still sleeping.

602
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,640
Okay, let me check.

603
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
Thank you.

604
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
Actually,

605
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,060
he checked out 15 minutes ago.

606
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,060
-Checked out?        -Yes.

607
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,940
My name is Qiu Ying,

608
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,340
did he leave anything for me?

609
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,900
No, he didn't leave anything.

610
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,740
Okay.

611
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,260
It's only just past 7am.

612
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,690
Tricked me?

613
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,810
Excuse me, maybe you

614
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,090
can check out parking lot?

615
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,170
Maybe he's still there.

616
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,170
What?

617
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,770
You can check the parking lot.

618
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,630
P, parking lot.

619
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,270
P!

620
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,510
Yes, maybe he's still there.

621
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,710
That's great.

622
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,750
Okay,

623
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,510
thank you.

624
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,710
-Good luck, bye.            -Bye.

625
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,180
Why isn't our car here yet?

626
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,980
Why is their car

627
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,860
so much bigger than ours?

628
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,460
This necklace is very important to me,

629
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,980
I'll go and get it tomorrow.

630
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,340
I'm already at the hotel.

631
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,660
Which room are you at?

632
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,520
If playing tricks on me makes you happy,

633
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,160
do whatever you want.

634
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,320
But you have to

635
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,440
return me the necklace

636
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
otherwise, I'll not let you off.

637
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
Please.

638
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
Please take good care

639
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,400
of my necklace.

640
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,200
What are you smiling at?

641
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,480
Your fans.

642
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,390
Are those my fans?

643
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,430
They are all here to support us.

644
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,910
This is China's fanbase,

645
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,550
right?

646
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,790
Hello, friends!

647
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,550
Hello.

648
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,260
Hello.

649
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,020
Hey, losers.

650
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,620
What's up?

651
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,420
You all finally

652
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,330
won the champion after

653
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,530
joining Iconquer for so many years.

654
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,330
It's not easy, congratulations.

655
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,290
Losers.

656
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,570
If I were a loser just because

657
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,570
I lost in a competition,

658
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,690
then you guys

659
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,770
must have been one for many years.

660
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,810
We'll still be the champion next year.

661
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,690
Where's Gu Fang?

662
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,170
Is he hiding under his blanket crying?

663
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,760
-Talk nicely.          -Don't be rash.

664
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
Isn't he very strong when he used

665
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
Spirited Princess last time?

666
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,960
Why did he suddenly become

667
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,910
so so so useless?

668
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,790
Who are you saying?
