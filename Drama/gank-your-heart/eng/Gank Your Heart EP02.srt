00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,779

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,801
My leg.

7
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:05,202
It is so hurt

8
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:06,129
Sorry, are you OK?

9
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,202
Are you ok? Did you get hurt?

10
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:09,380
I am ok

11
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:11,898
I can stand up by myself

12
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:13,193
Let me help you

13
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:15,461
She is fine.You can get on the car.

14
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,709
It is OK.

15
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,642
You can get on the car,too.

16
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:20,626
I can walk.

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,850
Are you sure?

18
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,900
Do you need I send you to the hospital?

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,800
No,it's OK.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,220
I am going to see GuFang.

21
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:30,817
I came to Vancouver

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,425
for GuFang.

23
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:34,866
I will not go home

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,375
if I don't see him.

25
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:43,743
Are you  JiXiangkongï¼Ÿ

26
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,052
Yes,I am.

27
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:49,025
I know that you are teammate.

28
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:52,355
Could you please 

29
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,069
take me to see GuFang?

30
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:58,483
You are my last hope.

31
00:02:58,498 --> 00:02:59,825
I beg you please.

32
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,800
She looks like a cheater.

33
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,570
I couldn't refuse such beautiful girl

34
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:11,580
now that she beg me so much.

35
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:12,236
Let's go.

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,825
Really?

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,656
Thank you.

38
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:19,084
Hey, your feet.

39
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:23,818
I am just too happy. 

40
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,573
I almost forget the pain.

41
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:31,466
Come on. Let's go.

42
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:54,289
I think i got him.

43
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,788
Are you cold?

44
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,351
No,no.

45
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:08,945
Are you hot?

46
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,106
No,the temperature is ok.

47
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:15,070
Are you thirsty? Do you want  to drink water?

48
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:16,595
No,thank you.

49
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:19,788
Are you nervous?

50
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,247
No, no.

51
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,524
Keep acting.

52
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,641
Do you still feel hurt?

53
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,771
It seems still to hurt a little.

54
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,266
But I feel better now.

55
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:39,974
How did you get better so fast?

56
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:41,680
You looked lame just now.

57
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:45,655
I just thought that

58
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,341
whether I should be responsible for you in the future.

59
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:50,425
Not that serious.

60
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,987
You take me to see GuFang

61
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,988
which does me a big favor.

62
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,131
I really want to thank you.

63
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,071
Are you  really GuFang's fan?

64
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:05,543
Of course.

65
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,089
I love him so much.

66
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,125
I am totally his loyal fan.

67
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,250
Well, can you tell me

68
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:13,742
which year did he win the word champion?

69
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,425
When did he win the MVP?

70
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:16,986
Which team did he fight against

71
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:18,295
when he got his first penta kill?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,259
You don't know it?

73
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:28,656
I forget it.

74
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:32,814
But,

75
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:34,554
but you really need to believe me.

76
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:36,695
I really like him.

77
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:37,728
It's real.

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,921
Why are you so serious?

79
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,235
What is he up to?

80
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,861
Is he doubting me?

81
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,100
I think I've seen you before.

82
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,753
So that he is trying to chat me up.

83
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,172
Let's add WeChat.

84
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,099
I,

85
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:04,684
I just looked carefully,

86
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,453
I thought I haven't seen you before.

87
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:08,471
I am sorry.

88
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:09,094
I mistook you for someone else.

89
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:09,697
Fool me!

90
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,756
Now we've seen each other.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,303
Actually,

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,797
I just took a lot of nice photos for you

93
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:18,065
during the competition.

94
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,483
I mean that we can leave a contact number for each other.

95
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,498
It's convenient for me to send photos to you.

96
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,090
Look.

97
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:28,375
So handsome!

98
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:29,669
This one is good,too.

99
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:30,839
There are more photos even better.

100
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,590
Come on.

101
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,111
Send to me.

102
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:32,992
These photos are really good.

103
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:34,456
Mainly because you're handsome.

104
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:37,806
Where is my phone?

105
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:39,821
Where is my phone?

106
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,245
I left it on the team car.

107
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,420
You forgot it?

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,428
It's OK.

109
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:50,548
Maybe next time.

110
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,977
It's OK.It's fine.

111
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:57,077
My photos

112
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:57,983
Keep them well.

113
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:58,626
Please don't delete them.

114
00:06:59,317 --> 00:06:59,924
They look so good!

115
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:01,979
OK OK

116
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:06,727
So ridiculous.

117
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,062
So weird.

118
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,283
He must be a drama queen. 

119
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,194
Is GuFang in there?

120
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:32,397
Yes, he is.

121
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:33,241
Just go.

122
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:40,189
You go first.

123
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,403
I'll come as soon as I park my car.

124
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:42,634
Well

125
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,255
I will wait for you inside.

126
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:45,680
See you later.

127
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:18,361
Hey,can I help you?

128
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,910
I find GuFang.

129
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,168
Come here?

130
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,416
You know,GuFang?

131
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,117
Are you looking for someone?

132
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:31,538
OK,wait.

133
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,008
This one.

134
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,567
I,I don't know.

135
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:41,708
Team Legends.

136
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,534
Very famous.

137
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,097
GuFang.

138
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,826
Very very very famous.

139
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,662
Um,Michael.

140
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,848
Did she just say Team Legends?

141
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,745
Yeah yeah yeah.

142
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:53,759
I love those guys.

143
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,689
GuFang,he come here?

144
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,500
Where?

145
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,298
Oh,you think he is here?

146
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,375
No,no.

147
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,091
I definitely woild know if he was here.

148
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:03,600
Not here?

149
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:04,665
No.

150
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:05,268
Sorry.

151
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,364
I hope you will find him now.

152
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:09,806
Thank you.

153
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,310
Hey,what's going on?

154
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,442
Did you interview GuFang?

155
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,401
Yiyi,I was fooled by someone.

156
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,795
Now i haven't seen anything

157
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,714
related to GuFang.

158
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:28,822
Well.

159
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,101
I let you follow Legends' fans 

160
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,139
in Weibo before.

161
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,364
Do they update any news now?

162
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:34,567
You,you wait for me for a second.

163
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,106
Let me have a look.

164
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:39,154
They just uploaded some photos of team.

165
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,662
It seems like

166
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,693
the Top Bar in Vancouver.

167
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:43,824
I got it.

168
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:44,482
I am going there now.

169
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,383
Captain.

170
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,321
What happen?

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,901
We have been there for a long time

172
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:06,989
and dare not disturb him.

173
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,156
We are the silver medal winner anyhow.

174
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:31,495
OK?

175
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,721
Did that lose our face?

176
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:35,200
We are just under one team,

177
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,713
and surpass millions of teams.

178
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:36,456
Right,Yao?

179
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:37,627
Cheer up! Come on!

180
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,456
Cheer up,cheer up.

181
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,871
Do you think we didn't lose any faces?

182
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:48,481
What are we doing here?

183
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,140
We came here for the champion,

184
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,118
not for the second place.

185
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,995
Reflect on it,

186
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,966
you guys.

187
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Hey,Yiyi.

188
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:00,394
I reached the bar.

189
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,945
I am finding them.

190
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:05,848
I see GuFang.

191
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,809
I shoot some enviromental scene first.

192
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,643
When i am interviewing GuFang,

193
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,578
you must make sure the signal reliable.

194
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,797
Don't worry.

195
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:15,639
It is your first interview in Peakedness.

196
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:17,004
You spent so much efforts 

197
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:17,029
to get the exclusive.

198
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:17,981
to get the exclusive.

199
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,775
I'll take it seriously.

200
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:19,758
What's more,

201
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,075
If I make any mistakes,

202
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:23,675
I must be blamed by boss Liu.

203
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:24,254
Right?

204
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:25,851
Well,i am gonna go.

205
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:27,472
Fighting,fighting!

206
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:28,065
Fighting.

207
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,748
Captain.

208
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,047
Don't think too much.

209
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,741
Don't you remember what you said to me?

210
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,401
Geting up when you lose the game

211
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,436
is the most important thing.

212
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:52,238
It is for you.

213
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:55,347
If you think in this way,

214
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,625
you will lose your authority in my heart.

215
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,632
Sorry,XiangKong.

216
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,621
Why do you feel sorry?

217
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:12,381
It is not your own responsibility

218
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,208
for missing the champion.

219
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,183
Actually, i have already seen.

220
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,514
I saw you talking to them.

221
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,350
Let me exchange position wtih HuoYao.

222
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:24,225
Captain.

223
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:24,998
You should know it early that

224
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,040
my state is very bad.

225
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,525
If I supported you change the tactics at that time,

226
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,504
maybe we couldn't fail today.

227
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:37,761
You also said it is maybe.

228
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,400
There isn't a 100%-win tactic in the world.

229
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,847
But I am not willing to beleive.

230
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:44,996
4 years,

231
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,426
I got second places for 4 times.

232
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,055
Sorry.

233
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,406
Do not say sorry anymore.

234
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,210
It is not your own fault about the failure.

235
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,850
We all should take the responsibility.

236
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,800
I've been attending the competition for 10 years.

237
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:04,407
I clearly know

238
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,455
what's my status now.

239
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,984
The peak period will never back again.

240
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:11,985
Sometimes I clearly knew that

241
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:12,950
when they will attack

242
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:13,795
where they will attack

243
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:14,533
what blocking they will use.

244
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,145
But I just cannot avoid it.

245
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,076
It is because of GuFang.

246
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:19,124
So we failed.

247
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,481
It must become social focus.

248
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:46,331
Is that the signal problem?

249
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:46,954
Boss Liu.

250
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,119
Come on, don't stop.

251
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:48,952
Call her now.

252
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,027
Why it suddenly disconnect? 

253
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:53,141
Call her!

254
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:54,108
Use your phone to call her.

255
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:54,491
Call her!

256
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,330
OK,OK,I will.

257
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:12,631
Let's go!

258
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:13,674
Go.

259
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:15,316
Hello,Yiyi.

260
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,101
What are you doing,QiuYing?

261
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:18,738
Why you didn't interview GuFang,

262
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:19,992
when you saw him?

263
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:21,340
What did GuFang say 

264
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,154
to JiXiangkong?

265
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:22,785
What thing does he cannot avoid?

266
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:24,862
Give me the video immediately.

267
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:25,640
Continue.

268
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:27,890
Boss Liu,

269
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:28,700
I

270
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:32,345
Now I have to 

271
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,417
build up relationship with them first.

272
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,725
It is not good for us to keep long combination with them,

273
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,209
If he refuse me

274
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,602
after I interviewed him directly.

275
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:40,716
What did I ask you to do?

276
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:41,707
You are the host.

277
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,157
I asked you to interview him.

278
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:46,592
I am going to pay for the bill.

279
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:47,879
You just wait for me in the car.

280
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:47,899
Thanks,bro.

281
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:48,750
Thanks,bro.

282
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,471
Sorry,sorry,sorry.

283
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:52,826
Don't worry,Boss Liu.

284
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:54,120
I will figure out other solutions.

285
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,294
Don't talk nonsense.

286
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,133
RIght now,go!

287
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:58,807
OK.

288
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:11,837
Hey,beauty girl.

289
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:12,755
What are you doing?

290
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:13,408
I like you.

291
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,318
No,no,no.

292
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:17,191
I don't like you, no, don't touch me,no.

293
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:19,987
What the hell?

294
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,056
This is my girl.

295
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:22,315
He said,

296
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,011
my girl.

297
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:25,946
OK,OK,OK.

298
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,715
Thank you.

299
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:52,708
Thank you.

300
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,573
You are so persistent.

301
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:56,817
Are you not mad

302
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,260
for finding nothing before?

303
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:01,148
Why I need to be mad at you?

304
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:02,837
You just save me.

305
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,469
What about I treat you for a meal someday?

306
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:08,819
Only use a meal to thank me?

307
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,389
What do you want?

308
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:15,239
Very easy.

309
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,457
Go out, turn left and bye. 

310
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,064
I really want to thank you.

311
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,031
 I don't need it.

312
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:22,467
You are the person 

313
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,433
who pretended the worker

314
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,048
to get into the back field.

315
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,292
Take your dress.

316
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,167
Sorry,sorry.

317
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,498
What?Take your dress.

318
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,554
Now you are pretending the fans

319
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:38,745
once and once again.

320
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:39,942
Your main purpose is 

321
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,051
digging more news about GuFang.

322
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:41,978
Sorry.

323
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:43,769
He doesn't accept any interview now.

324
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:45,653
He needs quietness.

325
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:51,034
Whatever,

326
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,592
I must interview GuFang.

327
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,293
JiXiangkong,JiXiangkong.

328
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,903
Wait,wait,wait,wait.

329
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,497
I admitted that I lied to you.

330
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:05,263
But all I did

331
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:06,350
was also for my job.

332
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,042
Let me introduce myself to you

333
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,930
I am a host from YouXing Video.

334
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,788
My name is QiuYIng.

335
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,424
I came to Vancouver

336
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,042
for interviewing this competition.

337
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:18,196
and also fot interviewing GuFang.

338
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:20,507
Nomatter how do you think of me

339
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:22,373
I still hope that you can help me.

340
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:24,009
Because GuFang is 

341
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:25,709
the idol in Chinese E-sports circle.

342
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,835
This competition for him is 

343
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:27,783
Does the beautiful girl

344
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:29,362
not have the good memory?

345
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,310
I just said very clearly.

346
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,657
Please don't disturb him anymore.

347
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,176
Or 

348
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,611
you can do anything 

349
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,143
in order to interviewing him?

350
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,634
It's too late tonight.

351
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:46,090
I still have many works.

352
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,512
Let me write my phone number for you.

353
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:52,950
I really want to interview him.

354
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,857
But I know now he is very down.

355
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:56,412
You can call me anytime,

356
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:57,731
when he become better.

357
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:01,975
I should go,see you.

358
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,925
Please remember call me.

359
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,375
You sit here.

360
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,384
How is he now?

361
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,162
He is still sleeping.

362
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,829
Manager Zhao said

363
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,454
If captain drinks too much,

364
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,075
the fans meeting tonight will be canceled.

365
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:36,550
The fox Zhao.

366
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,285
The way he looks like just now.

367
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,331
If we had won today,

368
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,944
I don't believe he would dare to do so. 

369
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,546
But it's good that it's canceled.

370
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,031
I can't bear to look

371
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:47,495
the captain

372
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:49,132
hiding his mood for everyone.

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,012
Play game with me.

374
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,269
Whose necklace?

375
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,792
None of your business.

376
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,636
Ok, fine.

377
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,494
Driver,let's go,come on.

378
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,350
Let's go.

379
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:47,709
Hello,Yiyi.

380
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:49,285
Hi,QiuYing.

381
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,766
How is going on?

382
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,876
Did you interview GuFangï¼Ÿ

383
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,187
Not yet.

384
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,599
He just failed on the competition today.

385
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,667
He is sad now.

386
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:02,841
It is so inhuman 

387
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,042
to interview him

388
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,275
at this time.

389
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,050
What is the point now?

390
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:11,650
You are still thinking of humanity.

391
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,701
Then Boss Liu will be inhuman to you if you not to do so

392
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,793
I was going to

393
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,151
interview him directly.

394
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:22,989
But in the end,

395
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:26,350
I've been caught and kicked out.

396
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,025
Well,

397
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,405
The most important thing now

398
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,718
is doing the live streaming 

399
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:31,743
of GuFang's fans meeting.

400
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,150
You have to start it on time.

401
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,096
Do not be late again.

402
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,158
Maybe

403
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:36,032
you will catch the chance

404
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,515
to interview GuFang.

405
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,984
Ok,I got it.

406
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,189
I am on the way.

407
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,061
Well,take your time.

408
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,193
Don't worry.

409
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,064
The event was cancelled.

410
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,932
Why do they inform so late?

411
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,719
Connect with her now.

412
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:42,325
The live streaming is going to start.

413
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:43,357
There must be nothing wrong.

414
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,607
Have you arrived yet,QiuYing?

415
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,420
You let him check the offcial micro-blog in hurry.

416
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,761
Due to GuFang's health problem,

417
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,214
the fan's meeting was canceled

418
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,712
5 minutes ago.

419
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:01,319
The event was canceled,Boss Liu.

420
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,606
I don't care what reason

421
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,797
and whose problem.

422
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:07,663
Our company provided so many resource,

423
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:08,719
so there must be no mistake this time.

424
00:22:09,546 --> 00:22:10,278
I tell you,QiuYing.

425
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:10,855
I must see your live streaming

426
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,150
in 30 seconds.

427
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,965
You must be online.

428
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,809
No,Boss Liu,hello?

429
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,590
She is alone,Boss Liu.

430
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:18,806
Can she handle this?

431
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,041
Hello,everyone.

432
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,865
I am the host of YouXing Video,

433
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,015
QiuYIng.

434
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:37,651
Today I will bring you the latest information

435
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:39,115
about IConquer

436
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:48,922
What shall we do,Boss Liu?

437
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,701
The current data has been falling.

438
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:51,726
You know that.

439
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,160
Everyone came here for GuFang.

440
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,508
Now the event was canceled.

441
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:55,334
Therefore,our live streaming 

442
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,076
seems unnecessary

443
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,068
to continue.

444
00:22:59,196 --> 00:22:59,850
No,we can't stop.

445
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,813
Do we have anything else about IConquer to post?

446
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,550
No,so you ask her to come up with a solution.

447
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,863
This live streaming

448
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:04,799
must keep going on.

449
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,341
Aren't you trying to embarrass her?

450
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,366
If we stop this live streaming,

451
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,525
We all can think about

452
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,510
the dismissal issue.

453
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:18,309
It looks like everyone

454
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,796
has a lot of enthusiasm.

455
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:20,774
But unfortunately,

456
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,587
today event

457
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:22,800
was canceled temporarily.

458
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,417
It's real a pity that

459
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,538
The Legends team

460
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,624
missed champion again.

461
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:28,689
Well,

462
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,024
Let me stand by YouXing Video,

463
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,785
to show you guys

464
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:32,717
a special program

465
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:33,466
and in order to encourage the team Legends.

466
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,123
Do not miss it!

467
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:43,468
Wait me for a moment.

468
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,117
Please don't leave the live room.

469
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:10,268
QiuYing really starts to dance.

470
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:11,830
Not bad.

471
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:12,820
Create an event

472
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,902
to fill the vacancy.

473
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,351
Is that the place

474
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:32,372
which was planned to hold the fans meeting?

475
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:33,638
which was planned to hold the fans meeting?

476
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:34,826
Yes.

477
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,914
ZhaoYang

478
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:38,449
If not because of him,

479
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,011
I could see QiuYing today.

480
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:42,366
I remember that

481
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:43,793
I saw she was chatting with Ji for a long time

482
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:44,947
at the door of the bar.

483
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,355
I also saw her.

484
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,571
So why you didn't tell me?

485
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:49,975
Do you wanna die?

486
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:53,229
Captain has already fallen asleep.

487
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,618
Do you know QiuYing,Ji?

488
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,649
Do you know her well?

489
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,481
Could you introduce her to me?

490
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,300
I've been following her for a long time.

491
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,225
I am not familiar with the such person

492
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,200
who acts grandiosely,

493
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,250
and has low IQ,

494
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:10,925
and has low IQ,

495
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,644
and tries to use cyber to win publicity.

496
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:14,141
He is still the Ji,

497
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,625
who is argus-eyed.

498
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,935
What are you talking?

499
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,171
Good, the number of online audience has increased.

500
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,141
Now

501
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:27,491
You can upload

502
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,055
the video of GuFang and JiXiangkong.

503
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,071
Boss Liu

504
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,575
It could be inappropriate

505
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:34,625
to upload that video.

506
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,566
to upload that video.

507
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,095
I don't think it's inappropriate.

508
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:37,189
Come on,hurry up.

509
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,975
Don't forget the official micro-blog.

510
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:41,071
I think

511
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,350
she is as good as the superstar Mia.

512
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,600
Do not compare her with Mia.

513
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,900
Kong will hit you.

514
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,185
Why?

515
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,025
Ji is the fanboy of Mia.

516
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:53,400
Not the fanboy,

517
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:55,247
Let me tell you,

518
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,794
it called loyalty.

519
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,880
When he collects Mia's album,

520
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,996
he is so faithful,right?

521
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:03,565
He always bought an album for 3.

522
00:26:04,222 --> 00:26:05,250
Listen one,save one.

523
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,250
And carry one.

524
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:07,285
Right?

525
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,200
Why don't you say

526
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,246
I pray for her poster everyday?

527
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,425
No,no,no.

528
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:13,725
The dance she is playing

529
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:14,772
is really familiar with Mia's.

530
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,875
Do you know her well,Kong?

531
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:39,744
Go and get her.

532
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:41,419
Go to sleep.

533
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,627
Let you show your 

534
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:49,825
last effort.

535
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,125
last effort.

536
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,400
Hello,QiuYing.

537
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:19,025
It's so urgent just now.

538
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,486
Thank god you're smart.

539
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,469
Using dance to fill the vacancy.

540
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,207
The heat of live streaming increased again.

541
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,415
Really?

542
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,067
 That would be great.

543
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:29,800
Well,you must be tierd today.

544
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:29,801
Go back to your hotel early and have a rest.

545
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:30,875
Go back to your hotel early and have a rest.

546
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,548
I've already arrived at outside of the hotel.

547
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,798
OK,bye.

548
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,557
Bye.

549
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:49,575
Do they really look so familiar? 

550
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,334
Why you feel so sorry?

551
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,325
It's not your own fault for failing the competition.

552
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:01,525
I know it early.

553
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,973
Snapped pictures?

554
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:06,425
She does whatever it takes to be famous.

555
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:11,175
You've already known my status.

556
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,736
In that case

557
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,950
Don't blame me inhuman.

558
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,450
I still feel a little cold.

559
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,400
How about stand up and jump

560
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:50,701
Your necklace is here.Get it at Marco Polo Hotel at 7am tomorrow. 

561
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:01,925
Three.

562
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,101
Two.

563
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,175
Bye.

564
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,393
Is the battery dead?

565
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,400
Hello.

566
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,975
Excuse me.

567
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:47,475
Hi,how can i help you?

568
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,775
I want know him.

569
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,638
Legends.

570
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,775
Ji Xiangkong.

571
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,375
His room number.

572
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,375
I am sorry

573
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,976
 because you can't take  client's information.

574
