00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,340
Episode 28

2
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,010
Thank you for bringing me here

3
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,250
to eat such delicious food.

4
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,210
Then...

5
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,970
What surprise do you want to give me?

6
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,430
Why are you so nervous for?

7
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,710
You'll know later.

8
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,150
Mr. Ji, your cake.

9
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,270
Why is there a cake?

10
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,820
You can cut it.

11
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,580
Then... let's cut it together.

12
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,150
Previously, when I was here,

13
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,390
i waited for you till they were closed.

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,220
Thankfully, now,

15
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,860
I finally waited till you're here.

16
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,820
I nearly missed you.

17
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,260
Hello everyone.

18
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,380
I am Mi Ya.

19
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
During the time that had passed,

20
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,820
a lot of things happened.

21
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,460
I know everyone is really curious about my relationship.

22
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,980
I feel that

23
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,900
in everyone's lives,

24
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,460
there should a time you forgot yourself

25
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,490
because of someone else at least once.

26
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,530
Not wishing for the future,

27
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,610
not wishing to travel together,

28
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,690
not wishing to once have,

29
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,760
and even, not wishing for you to love me.

30
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
I want to tell that person

31
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,260
You accompanied me through

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,380
the darkest moment in my life.

33
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
When you really needed someone

34
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,180
to accompany you,

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,380
I was absent.

36
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,900
You got into a new relationship.

37
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,460
I wish you both all the best.

38
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
This song, 'Beyond the skies',

39
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,260
was written because of you.

40
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,500
Today,

41
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,940
I'll sing it for you one last time.

42
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,850
I really didn't expect.

43
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,090
Mi Ya will wish us well.

44
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,990
Chairman Guo.

45
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,870
This is the report for this competition season.

46
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,310
Originally, after this season,

47
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,670
the organizing committee wanted to

48
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,870
wanted to develop our collaboration.

49
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,430
Now look what happened.

50
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,790
The leaking of tactics came out,

51
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,500
the organizing committee was very unhappy.

52
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,180
I think

53
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
within the season.

54
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
make changes to our department

55
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,740
We also have to organise our internal team.

56
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Yes.

57
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
Such a big thing happened.

58
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,640
It's my responsibility.

59
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
Luo Tian.

60
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Don't keep putting all the

61
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,040
responsibilities on yourself.

62
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,880
This is all

63
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
Qiu Ying's problem.

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
She has already affected

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
our reputation.

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
We can't keep her anymore.

67
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,870
Chairman Guo.

68
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,670
You mean you want to fire Qiu Ying?

69
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,390
But, the investigation is still ongoing.

70
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,070
Even if there isn't sufficient evidence.

71
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,790
The truth can't be far from this.

72
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,710
Her dedication to her job and hard work,

73
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,060
I've seen it all.

74
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,620
Before this is

75
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,660
fully investigated,

76
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,660
I definitely wouldn't allow

77
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,740
Qiu Ying to be fired like this.

78
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,580
Luo Tian, you-

79
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,900
If you insist on firing her,

80
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,290
then, fire me first.

81
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,490
Do you know that

82
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,970
there are already rumours

83
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,690
that you and Qiu Ying are more than colleagues?

84
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,410
If this rumour

85
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,530
spreads to the organizing committee,

86
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,130
how will they view you?

87
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,210
We know that we're clear,

88
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,050
so it doesn't matter how they view.

89
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,050
Don't you think

90
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,010
about your own reputation?

91
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,090
My reputation is nothing much

92
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,240
compared to her career.

93
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,030
Not bad.

94
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,790
No wonder you're the best at

95
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,070
making coffees amongst professional gamers.

96
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,380
I invited you over today

97
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,300
not to drink coffee.

98
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,100
You want to ask me again

99
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,100
which team I'll go?

100
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,020
Continuing on,

101
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,620
what plans do you have?

102
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,060
Ideas...

103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I do have one.

104
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,660
The manager here

105
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,060
should be paid pretty well right?

106
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,570
Dream Journey's manager

107
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,290
you can't handle it.

108
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,290
Right.

109
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,690
I forgot to congratulate you.

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,170
For winning the Spring championship.

111
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,160
And tickets to the worldwide finals.

112
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,320
Will China be able to be champion again

113
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,600
depends on the Legends team.

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
You and I both know.

115
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
Based on the Legends current situation,

116
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,660
it's impossible to win championship.

117
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,100
Within less than half a year,

118
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,540
if we can breakthrough

119
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,500
with a tactic,

120
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,780
it isn't exactly hopeless.

121
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,620
They need you.

122
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,860
Qiu Ying told me before

123
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,620
you went to Legends because of me.

124
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,580
Yes.

125
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,140
But after I went,

126
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
you left.

127
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,020
What are your plans now?

128
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
I haven't thought about it yet.

129
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,540
Anyway, for the next season,

130
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,050
wherever you're going,

131
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,650
I'll go.

132
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,290
No, Pei Xi.

133
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,530
You're joking with me right?

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,610
I'm serious.

135
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,760
From start to end.

136
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,950
I'm fine with

137
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,430
whoever will end up leading.

138
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,830
Your dream

139
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,510
is to become world champion.

140
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,670
And your tactics,

141
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,990
plus my skills,

142
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,070
this dream can come true.

143
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,870
So,

144
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,030
I hope that you

145
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,230
can be my member.

146
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,670
Wherever you go,

147
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,190
I'll go too.

148
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,110
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

149
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,230
But, with my current situation

150
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,300
which team would still want me?

151
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
If no team wants you,

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,060
you can create your own team.

153
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,220
Please.

154
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
Starting a team isn't so simple.

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
Even if I form one,

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,960
your worth is so high,

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
how am I able to hire you?

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,840
Thank you for your coffee.

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,560
I'll learn from you next time.

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,830
My dream previously,

161
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,390
was to win the championships a second time.

162
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,620
But my dream now,

163
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,580
is to watch you guys hold the trophy.

164
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,060
I believe that one day

165
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,620
I will be able to find

166
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,570
the perfect team.

167
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,850
If no team wants you,

168
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,650
you can form your own team.

169
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,470
My Sun ge.

170
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,790
What are you sulking about?

171
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,790
Until now, there's no team

172
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,790
that has contacted my Kong ge,

173
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,710
what should we do?

174
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,790
Hasn't he told you

175
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,620
what he intends to do?

176
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,740
Nope.

177
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,860
Then, why didn't you ask him?

178
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,540
Why don't you go and ask him yourself?

179
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm afraid to provocate him if I ask.

180
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,740
Then just wait for him

181
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,700
Once he has thought it through,

182
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,500
naturally, he'll tell us

183
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,380
right?

184
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,940
When my Kong ge left from Legends,

185
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,180
you were so nervous you couldn't sleep.

186
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,860
Why are you acting so fine now?

187
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,060
Because now, Xiang Kong is very clear

188
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,700
that there is only one route

189
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,650
in front of him.

190
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,810
And it's a harder walk than before.

191
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,130
What road?

192
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,450
When he's here,

193
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,450
you can ask him yourself.

194
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,880
They're here.

195
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
- Okay.

196
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll go fetch them.

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,760
Qiu Ying.

198
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,640
Come quickly.

199
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Yi Yi.

200
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Why haven't you went up?

201
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,080
You guys haven't went up yet.

202
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
It's embarrassing for me

203
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,340
to go up alone.

204
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,020
Reporter Lu.

205
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,940
Hey.

206
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
It's okay if you want to

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,380
be loving at home.

208
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't be loving in front

209
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,460
of a single person like me.

210
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,140
We should show our lovingness.

211
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,020
Give me a kiss.

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,340
I'm embarrassed to see.

213
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,020
Kong ge,

214
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,660
usually you

215
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,100
hate it when others are loving.

216
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,100
Guys that are in love,

217
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,860
change really quickly.

218
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,740
Exactly.

219
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,980
Don't touch me.

220
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,100
Stay further away from me.

221
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,780
Are you jealous?

222
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,810
That's right, Ah Xuan.

223
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,850
You have to be quick.

224
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,850
Or this lady would run away with another man.

225
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,050
Who are you running away with?

226
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,050
What nonsense!

227
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,690
You-

228
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,010
Don't use me as a joke.

229
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,200
Qiu Ying, let's go.

230
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,470
Really, aren't they annoying?

231
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,470
Hello, big bro Sun.

232
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,430
I am Lu Yi Yi.

233
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,190
Pleasure to meet you.

234
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,310
We met in a hurry last time.

235
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,230
I'm very honoured to meet you.

236
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,350
Since you're here, treat it as your home.

237
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,550
Eat and drink well.

238
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,870
- Okay.

239
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,870
Don't be so polite.

240
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,430
Don't worry.

241
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,390
I definitely won't be polite.

242
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,070
Eat and drink as you like.

243
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,950
Treat is as your own home like Sun ge said.

244
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,190
You rascal,

245
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,070
you won the championship,

246
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,310
yet don't even know to treat me to a meal?

247
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,070
I-

248
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,070
I was scared that you'll be sad.

249
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,270
That's why I didn't dare to show off.

250
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,950
You're still blaming me.

251
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,100
You're crying? Why have you become dramatic?

252
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,340
I learnt from her.

253
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,700
How dare you say that.

254
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,900
Okay.

255
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,100
Congratulations to you for

256
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,760
receiving tickets to the worldwide finals.

257
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,640
You must win the championship.

258
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,160
- Fighting.

259
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,160
I'll work hard.

260
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
You definitely must win.

261
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Show that Jeffrey

262
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,960
some attitude.

263
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,040
But the teams from Europe and America

264
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,400
and Korea this year, are all

265
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,160
really strong.

266
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,240
If Legends

267
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,600
don't make a breakthrough

268
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,600
in their tactics,

269
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
it's hard to go far in the game.

270
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,480
Even if,

271
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
this year Legends can enter the finals,

272
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,870
we won't be able to get champion.

273
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,670
If things didn't happen to VNG,

274
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,310
it's certain that Kong ge

275
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,350
would be able to defeat Jeffrey.

276
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,940
The leakage of their tactics,

277
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,260
is just the last straw

278
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,620
that caused us to collapse.

279
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,340
Li Gan and Shu Wen having different notions

280
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,370
was the deadly trigger.

281
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,450
Don't be so sad.

282
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,570
I believe

283
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,890
China's conquer teams

284
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,570
won't just stop here.

285
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,130
Sooner or later there'll be a

286
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,650
perfect team.

287
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,130
- Here.

288
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,130
Definitely.

289
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,770
Come, cheers.

290
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,200
Right.

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,040
The tactic leakage incident.

292
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,040
How's the investigation coming along?

293
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,960
Still ongoing.

294
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,400
How long are they going to let you take the blame?

295
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,230
Exactly.

296
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,270
We can't let Qiao Xin take advantage of the situation.

297
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,590
When I was interviewing A Can today,

298
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,230
Qiao Xin looked so arrogant.

299
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,030
I had to suppress so much anger.

300
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,100
Too overboard.

301
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,780
Sun ge.

302
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,860
Isn't Luo Tian very familiar with

303
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,660
the organizing committee?

304
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,060
Help to put in a good word.

305
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,940
Help Qiu Ying out.

306
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,860
Forget it.

307
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,620
Teacher Luo already helped me out a lot.

308
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,940
Everyone don't worry.

309
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
I'll definitely settle it well.

310
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay.

311
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,420
We're all hungry.

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,100
Let's eat quickly.

313
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,780
Let's eat.

314
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,210
Ji Xiang Kong.

315
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,160
What are your plans now?

316
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
What has that got to do with you?

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
How dare you say that.

318
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,960
What are your plans, Kong ge?

319
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,580
I haven't thought it through yet.

320
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,780
He hasn't thought it through yet.

321
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,340
What does that mean?

322
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,020
Yi Yi.

323
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,140
Why are you pulling me?

324
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
If he wasn't your boyfriend,

325
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,900
why would I bother?

326
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,220
Ji Xiang Kong.

327
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,340
Could it be...

328
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,540
you're really deciding to

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,540
work as a manager at Sun ge's cafe forever?

330
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,780
How dare you say that?

331
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Why?

332
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,860
I mean that it's impossible.

333
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,620
Today, Sun ge still told me

334
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,060
my Kong ge

335
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,860
was pondering on a way out.

336
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
It's just that this route

337
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,170
is harder than in the past.

338
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,610
Right, Sun ge?

339
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,690
Then tell me.

340
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,610
What's that way out?

341
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,810
Speak.

342
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,050
Which way out is it, Kong ge?

343
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,430
Fire of lust won't extinguish.

344
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Rebirth after death.

345
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,750
I want to end my contract with Legends.

346
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,270
Are you sick?

347
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,310
You don't have fever too.

348
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
I'm serious.

349
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,710
You're serious? What a joke.

350
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,030
What's your benefit for ending the contract?

351
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,470
attend the worldwide finals?

352
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,470
You don't even want the chance to

353
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,710
Ji Xiang Kong and I

354
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,910
will win the championship

355
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,020
for the worldwide finals together.

356
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,540
What else did you dream of?

357
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,900
Now, which team

358
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
dares to use Ji Xiang Kong?

359
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,900
He will form a team himself.

360
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,780
Did he tell you that?

361
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,930
No.

362
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,840
He didn't.

363
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,720
Then how do you know

364
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,840
that he wants to form a team?

365
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,920
I just know.

366
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,520
I understand him.

367
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,920
Brother,

368
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,800
it's not easy to form a team.

369
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,040
Anyhow,

370
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,920
even if the team is really formed,

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
you can gurantee

372
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,680
that he'll get into worldwide finals?

373
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,800
Definitely.

374
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,110
I don't really understand you now.

375
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,190
You and Ji Xiang Kong are enemies.

376
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,870
Now, you're always sticking to him.

377
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,790
What do you want?

378
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
I just admire him.

379
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,140
You know too,

380
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,700
I entered Legends

381
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,300
because of him.

382
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,060
Do you have money to pay the termination fee?

383
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,500
No.

384
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,450
But you do.

385
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,450
Get out.

386
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,810
Get out.

387
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,010
Why do I have a younger brother like you?

388
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Tomorrow,

389
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,550
I will tell Chairman Guo that I quit.

390
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,150
Why?

391
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,670
I don't want to give Teacher Luo Tian

392
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,790
anymore trouble.

393
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,580
Since Dream Journey,

394
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,820
I have never gotten a good night's sleep.

395
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Now I finally can rest for a bit.

396
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,260
I really miss

397
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,180
the feeling of sleeping till I wake up naturally.

398
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,010
Sorry.

399
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,200
I can't help you with anything.

400
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,960
As long as you're accompanying me,

401
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,160
I definitely will stand on the commentary table again.

402
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,520
I didn't forget

403
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
about our promise.

404
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,060
Qiu Ying.

405
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,940
If I really

406
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,220
became like what Lu Yi Yi said,

407
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,340
working as a manager in a internet cafe,

408
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,780
will you look down on me?

409
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Yes.

410
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,540
I don't look down upon your decisions.

411
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,420
but rather,

412
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
because you don't respect what you want.

413
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,300
Since you already made a decision in your heart,

414
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,380
then be brave and do it.

415
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,570
But if I fail,

416
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,930
I will be left with nothing.

417
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,170
Just like what Sun ge said,

418
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,670
fire of lust doesn't extinguish,

419
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,830
Rebirth after death.

420
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,070
Even if you're shattered to pieces,

421
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll also believe in you.

422
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,350
You definitely will be able to stand again.

423
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,390
No matter how difficult this path is,

424
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,790
I will definitely stay by your side.

425
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,790
Accompanying you.

426
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,990
Fire of lust doesn't extinguish.

427
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,630
Rebirth after death.

428
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,180
Phoenix, this name

429
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,180
as a team name... How's it?

430
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,580
Phoenix.

431
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,180
Phoenix Nirvana.

432
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,520
I feel that it's very nice.

433
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,240
And,

434
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
it really fits your current situation.

435
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Why not

436
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,360
we use that name?

437
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,480
Then, our Phoenix team

438
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,640
still lacks a captain.

439
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,800
Commentator Qiu.

440
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Are you willing to condescend?

441
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,920
Guess.

442
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,390
I heard your heart beat go

443
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,790
"I'm willing."

444
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,600
Hello everyone.

445
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,080
I am commentator Qiu Ying.

446
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,960
Today I'll be sharing with everyone

447
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,320
the first competition for

448
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,400
the Summer's conventional competition.

449
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,320
Why can't I

450
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,390
tell your passion

451
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,110
for Conquer

452
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,150
through your commentary?

453
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,790
If I wasn't passionate about it,

454
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,990
I... I wouldn't stand in front of you.

455
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,350
Hello everyone.

456
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,180
I am your new friend, Qiu Ying.

457
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,900
Teacher Luo.

458
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,970
Why must you leave?

459
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,450
You've helped me too much.

460
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,370
I don't want to drag you in trouble anymore.

461
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,320
GDV can lose me,

462
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
but they can't lose you.

463
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,440
Qiu Ying.

464
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,900
I know that you've suffered a lot grievances,

465
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,820
but everything will be investigated properly.

466
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,100
In order to stand at the commentary table, you

467
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,380
invested a lot of effort.

468
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,740
Are you going to give up like this?

469
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,300
From the moment I decided to be a commentator,

470
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,580
I wanted to treat it as my lifelong job.

471
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,780
In the past,

472
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,500
and now too.

473
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
I love commentary.

474
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,380
even if I leave GDV,

475
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,140
I won't give up.

476
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,490
This is

477
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,970
the conclusion for this season.

478
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,910
You've really thought it through?

479
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,750
That you must leave?

480
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,750
From Dream Journey till GDV,

481
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,470
you've always guided me.

482
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,230
I hope that in future, you

483
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,230
will still be able to guide me.

484
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,470
A week, a commentary video.

485
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,350
No problem.

486
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,980
Then, I'll leave first.

487
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,020
I'll send you off.

488
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,740
No need.

489
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,380
Xiang Kong is waiting for me downstairs.

490
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,960
Bye, Teacher Luo.

491
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,470
Why are you only here now?

492
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,070
Now, training places for teams are

493
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,070
too hard to find.

494
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,070
I'll go look at a few more places next time.

495
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,990
Find one that's more value for money.

496
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,420
Oh right.

497
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,540
But, I have a good news.

498
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,180
Our competition outfits have been delivered.

499
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,980
I saw it.

500
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,860
Really awesome.

501
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,660
Really?

502
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,620
You've worked hard?

503
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,140
Our Captain Qiu is really efficient.

504
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,100
It's necessary.

505
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,980
I'll treat you to good food tonight.

506
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,860
Okay.

507
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,460
Right.

508
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,260
This thing about us building a team.

509
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,010
When do you intend to tell Ah Xuan?

510
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,690
Right now, I don't want to tell him.

511
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,480
That's true.

512
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,600
Ah Xuan is in Legends now.

513
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,240
And they can already compete in the worldwide finals.

514
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
He doesn't have to risk it with us.

515
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,600
And start afresh.

516
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,020
And I'm worried after we tell him,

517
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,260
he will make a fuss about joining us.

518
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,460
That's right.

519
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,540
Right now, he

520
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,700
is the top support.

521
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,540
That value...

522
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,900
how will we be able to hire him?

523
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,260
Then...

524
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,860
Do we have anyone new in mind?

525
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,980
What competition is this?

526
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,620
Mid solo with unknown members game.

527
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,700
Look.

528
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,590
This creator's movements and control...

529
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,990
You can tell he's a rising professional player.

530
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,830
He is the

531
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,830
first person I want to look for.

532
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,070
And this person

533
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,950
is someone you know too.

534
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,710
I know him?

535
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,710
Who?

536
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,550
Guess.

537
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,670
Don't make me guess.

538
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,790
Just tell me.

539
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,110
It seems like you're really dumb.

540
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,630
I already hinted you so obviously.

541
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,710
You still can't guess?

542
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,230
Think carefully.

543
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,750
The creator.

544
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,660
Pei Xi's life hero.

545
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,100
Could it be...

546
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,870
Hi.

547
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,380
What's wrong?

548
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,980
Are you disappointed to see me?

549
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,260
Yes.

550
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,460
Why?

551
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,820
You're waiting for Ji Xiang Kong?

552
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,290
Let me tell you.

553
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,930
I already asked.

554
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,170
I asked Luo Tian, Lao Sun.

555
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:58,930
And Shu Wen.

556
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,130
They all said they never heard

557
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,250
Ji Xiang Kong wants to form his own team.

558
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,490
So,

559
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,250
your prediction is wrong.

560
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:06,770
Ji Xiang Kong

561
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,210
won't form his own team.

562
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,490
Have you given up?

563
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,490
I already discussed with

564
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,560
Chairman Jin.

565
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,440
I will terminate my contract tomorrow morning.

566
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,800
Remember

567
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,480
to prepare the money.

568
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,790
You're really my 'ancestor'.

569
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,270
Not drinking.

570
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,540
Cool, Xiang Kong.

571
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,820
You finally formed your own team.

572
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,140
Phoenix is a nice name.

573
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,780
That's of course.

574
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,730
Sun ge.

575
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,890
This is the inspiration you gave me.

576
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,330
Fire of lust doesn't extinguish.

577
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,450
Rebirth after death.

578
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,130
So we named it Phoenix team.

579
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,370
In future, when you guys are champion,

580
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,890
does I still have credit?

581
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,520
Definitely.

582
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,920
And,

583
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,080
we want to let you wear it.

584
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,040
And become Phoenix's first member.

585
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,620
Are you two joking with me?

586
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,940
Sun ge.

587
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm not joking with you.

588
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,340
But,

589
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,060
don't reject me so quickly.

590
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,340
Ask yourself.

591
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,580
Do you really not want to return to competition site?

592
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,740
And work hard one more time?

593
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,060
In the founders team,

594
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,500
I am already the oldest.

595
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,540
Even Gu Fang,

596
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,140
who's always been competing

597
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,140
has already quit.

598
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,140
Besides,

599
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,970
I already have not competed for five to six years.

600
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,490
What?

601
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,030
This is you right?

602
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,670
Sun ge.

603
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,870
You're old but still vigorous.

604
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,470
You still maintained

605
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,510
your hand speed and awareness.

606
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,470
And,

607
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,750
compared to Gu Fang three years ago,

608
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,630
you're not too far off.

609
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,470
You totally can return.

610
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,950
That's right Sun ge.

611
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,550
And right now, we really need you.

612
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,030
This is a competition with strangers.

613
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,430
It's different from an actual competition.

614
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,380
This isn't something I,

615
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,220
someone who hasn't played in an official competition for many years,

616
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,740
can get used to.

617
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,660
Besides,

618
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
what's your goal for the competition?

619
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,660
To become world champion.

620
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,840
Not to play with strangers.

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,720
But Sun ge-

622
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
Qiu Ying.

623
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
as the team's captain,

624
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,040
you should be clear

625
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
how difficult it is to form a team.

626
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
If the peak of a professional gamer

627
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,760
is over then it's over.

628
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Where did you two

629
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,680
get your confidence in me?

630
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,760
No, Sun ge.

631
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,400
Do you really

632
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,680
not want to get back the trophy?

633
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,540
Go.

634
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,420
The both of you leave.

635
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,020
Don't waste your time on me.

636
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,940
And don't use the future of the team

637
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,260
to gamble with this possibility.

638
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,930
Why is Sun ge angry?

639
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,690
Maybe during the competition that year,

640
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,730
something weighed heavily upon Sun ge.

641
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,180
Come here.

642
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,820
Start fighting.

643
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,300
Go.

644
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,260
Go.

645
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,860
Come.

646
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,700
Summer, buy worksman.

647
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,700
I bought it.

648
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,780
You handle this.

649
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
Almost got it.

650
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,450
Coming.

651
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
Champion trophy.

652
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,960
We're coming.

653
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,390
Why didn't Pei Xi come today?

654
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,030
He's someone precious.

655
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,470
Why would he need to practice?

656
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,990
Be faster.

657
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,790
Act like a human.

658
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,510
Quick, Yao ge, run.

659
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,150
-  Don't drag me.

660
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,150
Fighting.

661
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,950
I'm going.

662
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,740
Should I go and greet them?

663
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,260
They wouldn't mind my departure right?

664
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Bye.

665
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,920
Maybe after tonight,

666
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
I'll see myself.

667
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,000
The me with an inner

668
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
bright sunshine.

669
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,560
Every star that has a name

670
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,630
is incredible.

671
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,830
What's wrong?

672
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,780
Goodbye.

673
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,980
Goodbye?

674
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,100
What goodbye?

675
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Pei Xi sent it to the group.

676
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,020
His message has no start or end.

677
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,860
What does this mean?

678
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,620
What does he mean?

679
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
This morning, I think I heard he wanted

680
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,210
to end the contract with the team.

681
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,330
Could it be true?

682
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,450
He's leaving?

683
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,690
Let's go back and see.

684
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,580
Is anyone here?

685
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,820
There's not even a shadow.

686
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,220
He's not here.

687
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,060
Not at the dorm too.

688
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,980
Where can he go?

689
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,340
He should at least

690
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,650
say it personally.

691
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,530
I don't know what he's thinking daily.

692
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,730
Pei Xi this person.

693
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,730
Is pretty nice if you think about it.

694
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,480
He's just arrogant and slow sometimes.

695
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,600
When he helped us

696
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,800
chase Zhao Yang away,

697
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,480
I really felt that he's really rightful.

698
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
Yet you still talk bad about him.

699
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,940
You have issues too.

700
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,660
Not cooperating with others during work.

701
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,020
In the least, he's the leader.

702
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
Sometimes when I think about it,

703
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
this person is leaving...

704
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,740
I really can't bear to part.

705
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,780
I forgot to take my uniform.

706
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,710
I...

707
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,830
also forgot to say goodbye.

708
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,430
Thank you guys.

709
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,910
Thank you.

710
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,230
Sorry.

711
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,310
Leader.

712
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,110
Thank you.

713
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,300
You allowed me to learn a lot.

714
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,740
We won't forget you.

715
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,780
Yi Xuan.

716
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,360
Faster.

717
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,480
Leader.

718
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Don't forget.

719
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,480
You once had group members like us.

720
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,080
Legends will always welcome you back.

721
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,600
Fighting.

722
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,950
Let's work hard together.

723
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,230
I'll go first.

724
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,020
Hey.

725
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,650
About what happened previously,

726
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,810
sorry.

727
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,630
Goodbye.

728
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,110
Leader.

729
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,820
Let's meet at the competition.

730
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
This one isn't okay too.

731
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,220
You're not satisfied with this one too?

732
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,580
You're not satisfied with all these people?

733
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,220
These contestants

734
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,740
Be it their skills, experience,

735
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,700
or character,

736
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,060
at most

737
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,620
can last till the pre selection round.

738
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
We have to wait for them to be more mature.

739
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,300
And that'll be at least two years.

740
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,970
Then what do we do?

741
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,370
Why not

742
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,530
we think of a way

743
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,650
to convince Sun ge to join us?

744
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,370
I feel that

745
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,590
currently,

746
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,990
there's only one person

747
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,190
who can convince him.

748
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,910
You're talking about Wen jie?

749
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,790
Let's go.

750
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,670
Let's go find Wen jie.

751
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,550
Wrong.

752
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,990
We should go look for Summer ge.

753
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,830
Find Summer ge?

754
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,190
Why?

755
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,590
The reason why Wen jie doesn't forgive Sun ge is because

756
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,070
during that year,

757
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,110
before he went to Vancouver,

758
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,830
Sun ge left the team without reasons.

759
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,110
Without reasons.

760
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,420
No.

761
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,940
Wasn't it because he had family members to take care

762
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,380
That's why he left?

763
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,460
I feel that's merely an excuse.

764
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,900
There must be

765
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,200
something that has happened.

766
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,920
Summer ge will definitely know.

767
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,640
Heroine between females.

768
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
Don't think I don't know

769
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
you're letting me win.

770
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,190
If you already saw it, don't say it out.

771
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,150
Exposing me.

772
00:39:59,470 --> 00:39:59,950
I just

773
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,550
wanted to let you head out and relax.

774
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,830
Actually after leaving VNG,

775
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,150
I feel more relaxed on the contrary.

776
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,460
The company that you spent years building,

777
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,020
isn't that a pity?

778
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,970
What's there to pity?

779
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,330
we're not looking for a common objective.

780
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,330
Our paths are different,

781
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,250
I should have understood this logic earlier.

782
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,090
Then, what's the current situation

783
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,450
between you and Li Gan?

784
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,050
I hope he can find someone right.

785
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,850
What are your plans now?

786
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,610
I intend to go to Singapore.

787
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,440
For a study exchange for a while.

788
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Take it as recharging myself.

789
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,760
Have you ever considered

790
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
talking to Sun ge?

791
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,720
Besides, you two-

792
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,000
Enough.

793
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,310
It doesn't matter if we do or not.

794
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,430
I need a change of environment now.

795
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,670
A fresh start.

796
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:55,950
You

797
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,340
can't change your habit of gossiping right?

798
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,980
I'm not gossipy.

799
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,260
I really mean it.

800
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,860
It's a pity for you two.

801
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,820
Enough.

802
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,980
Let's go another round.

803
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,740
I'm going to be serious now.

804
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,740
I won't let you win now.

805
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,900
Don't let me.

806
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,970
Are you guys looking for me?

807
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,200
No. We're looking for your cousin.

808
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,960
Pei Xi.

809
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,340
Where are you going?

810
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,300
I just ended my contract with Legends.

811
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,340
You terminated your contract with them?

812
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,980
We can form a new team now.

813
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,580
We can form a team?

814
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,740
This is our uniform isn't it?

815
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,820
Phoenix.

816
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,940
Meaningful.

817
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,540
No.

818
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,700
Pei Xi, what do you mean?

819
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,970
Aren't you guys letting me join you?

820
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,490
Really?

821
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,850
That's nice Xiang Kong.

822
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,470
Pei Xi, you are the most talented rising player.

823
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,390
And an opponent I think highly of.

824
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,910
But sorry.

825
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,470
You don't suit Phoenix.

826
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,190
Are you rejecting me?

827
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,230
Stay at Legends.

828
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,230
You already got

829
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,710
tickets to the worldwide finals.

830
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,510
There's no need for you to take this risk.

831
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,990
I told you previously

832
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,550
my goal

833
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,310
is to get world champion.

834
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,990
Staying at Legends, and using the same tactic,

835
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,310
I won't reach my goal.

836
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,310
Since it's like this,

837
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,900
I rather take this risk.

838
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,260
That's right Xiang Kong.

839
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Actually, Pei Xi is pretty good.

840
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,760
Why not we give it a go?

841
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
What are you hesistating for?

842
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,160
You can't be telling me

843
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,160
you are not prepared right?

844
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,040
It's you who's not prepared for the team.

845
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,960
Outsiders always say you can beat nine people.

846
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,480
Aside from the five opponents,

847
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,270
there's four members who drag you down.

848
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,630
Your personal skills are outstanding.

849
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,910
But you don't cooperate well with the team.

850
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,070
What do you think?

851
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,060
I always rely on myself to win.

852
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,740
So,

853
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,900
I wanted to look for you as my team mate.

854
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,410
On future battles, I

855
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,930
will change because

856
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,170
of your tactics.

857
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,050
No matter what team you join,

858
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,330
the situation will be the same.

859
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,730
Shouldn't you find the reason why?

860
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,330
If you're a player who doesn't know cooperation,

861
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,090
then any tactics that are handed to you

862
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,450
will end up as four protecting one.

863
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,120
It'll be the same even if you choose me.

864
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,360
Xiang Kong.

865
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,200
Why not we give it more thought?

866
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,110
Qiu Ying,

867
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,430
don't forget.

868
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,950
We need a perfect team.

869
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,350
Ji Xiang Kong.

870
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,220
Other than me, you can't find a more suitable player.

871
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,340
Whoever you find, they need to work with you.

872
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,660
Then why am I not okay?

873
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,060
Unless

874
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,260
you can't control me.

875
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,260
Before you suspect me,

876
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,340
let me first see your determination.

877
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,410
You're rejecting my cousin.

878
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,650
Looks like the Phoenix team

879
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,610
really is an impressive team.

880
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,370
Summer ge.

881
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,170
Summer ge, you're finally back.

882
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,520
I won't give up.

883
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,040
Enough, stop looking.

884
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,940
That rascal is like that.

885
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,540
Let's talk in the office.

886
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,180
Sun ge rejected joining the team.

887
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,780
He said he already gave up.

888
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,780
He doesn't want to game anymore.

889
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,140
So I want to know

890
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,380
That year, before the worldwide finals,

891
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,340
why did he give up?

892
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,220
I also only found out on Shu Wen's birthday.

893
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,180
I...

894
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,460
Li Gan.

895
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,100
After winning the championship.

896
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,090
That...

897
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,450
That was purely a coincidence.

898
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,330
Like a cat encountering a dead mouse.

899
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,810
She doesn't even know how

900
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,310
the RMB 300,000 we used to go Canada

901
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,550
came about.

902
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,590
How did it come about?

903
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,550
How did it come about?

904
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,470
It's the house mortgage

905
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,590
that I borrowed.

906
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,670
Didn't you say the money is

907
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,710
was gathered by a sponsor?

908
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:01,670
Brother.

909
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,070
Are you dumb or am I dumb?

910
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,230
Who dares to give us the money?

911
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,460
Does big bro know?

912
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,040
Because he knew you used the mortgage,

913
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,880
that's why he left?

914
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,310
That year,

915
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,350
we thought he left the team

916
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,380
because of family matters.

917
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,820
Li Gan was originally a subsidiary player.

918
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,260
And he pulled in a sponsor,

919
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,660
so he successfully became a member.

920
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,180
And got champion,

921
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,890
But I didn't expect...

922
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,050
Didn't expect

923
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,690
Actually it's Li Gan.

924
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,610
Used that money to force him to leave.

925
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,090
Leave Wen jie.

926
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,810
Li Gan really likes Shu Wen.

927
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:15,570
At that time,

928
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,730
we can all tell.

929
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:17,970
But at that time,

930
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,970
Shu Wen and Lao Sun were already together.

931
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,800
But Li Gan...

932
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,560
In order to win the competition

933
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,960
and be with Shu Wen.

934
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,630
So, in the end,

935
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,590
in order to fulfill all your dreams, Sun ge

936
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,310
carried everything on his own.

937
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,870
Was misunderstood by Wen jie but didn't explain.

938
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,700
And he even

939
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,260
hid himself in The Kings for so many years.

940
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,940
And try not to meet with you guys.

941
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,380
He should return to the competition site.

942
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,780
We still owe him a championship.

943
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
Let's do this.

944
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,220
Tomorrow, Shu Wen will be going to Singapore.

945
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,540
You two think of ways to make her stay.

946
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,810
Leave the remaining matters to Pei Xi and I.

947
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,810
Thank you Summer ge.
