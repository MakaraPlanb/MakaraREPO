1
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,420
Yi Yi.

2
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,580
Lawyer Chen, you’re here.

3
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,140
This is Qiu Ying.

4
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,860
-Hi. -Hello, Lawyer Chen.

5
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,460
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,380
No worries. Please sit.

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,100
Please sit.

8
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,650
-Here’s coffee. -Thanks.

9
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,010
Lawyer Chen. How’s Qiu Ying’s issue?

10
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,830
The situation is against you.

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,550
There’s no evidence to prove your innocence.

12
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,270
It’s getting more complicated,

13
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,230
and there may be compensation involved.

14
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,510
It doesn’t look like it’ll be a small sum.

15
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,670
What should we do?

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,870
Are we just sitting ducks?

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,510
The best bet we have now is a settlement.

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,030
Ji Xiang Kong and I will not be able to settle.

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,220
Look, Lawyer Chen.

20
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,340
Is there any other way besides me

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,500
looking for him?

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,280
The lawyer letter

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
was sent by the Chuan Qi team.

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
Ji Xiang Kong is their contracted team member.

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,000
He would listen to the team.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
You can try looking for the team’s leader.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,700
Sister.

28
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Why are you here?

29
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,690
Something big happened. You won’t return my messages.

30
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,970
How can I not come?

31
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,850
Sister. You couldn’t pay the mortgage?

32
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,850
Stay out of my problems.

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,800
Sister. I’ve been looking out for you.

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
I know you were fired by You Xing.

35
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,560
Chuan Qi is also planning to sue you.

36
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,190
It’s not only me.

37
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,950
Dad -

38
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,670
is worried about you too.

39
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,670
Come home with me.

40
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,020
Enough. Don’t bring him up.

41
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,980
Don’t talk about home with me.

42
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,620
Xia Ling. I’m not as lucky as you are.

43
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,820
You have a home. I don’t.

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,380
-Sister. -Don’t call me that.

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,580
I don’t need your sympathy.

46
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
Don’t come here again.

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,700
How can I help you, Sister?

48
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,820
Not sleeping yet?

49
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,460
Not yet, Dad.

50
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,290
I’ll put it here for you.

51
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,210
What are you looking at?

52
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,190
Are you thinking about something?

53
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,630
No. What can it be?

54
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,190
No? So why have you been out

55
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,710
of it ever since you came home today?

56
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,830
Did you quarrel with your schoolmates?

57
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,150
Don’t worry. Your mother is asleep.

58
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,470
You can tell me anything.

59
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,790
It’s not about me. It’s Sister.

60
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Your sister?

61
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,900
Yeah.

62
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,940
Dad. Sister is really in trouble this time.

63
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,500
What trouble?

64
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,640
You Xing fired her.

65
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Good. It’s not a proper job.

66
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,440
She also owes a lot of mortgage.

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Mortgage? She asked for it.

68
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,990
She’s capable, right?

69
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,710
Abandoning the family just like that.

70
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,830
Moving out just like that.

71
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,390
Dad. It was my fault that she moved out.

72
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,060
Don’t blame her.

73
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,140
Don’t speak up for her.

74
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,340
This has nothing to do with you.

75
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,860
Don’t contact her again.

76
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,700
We’ll treat her as if she doesn’t exist.

77
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,810
Don’t say that, Dad.

78
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,290
All these years, you’ve never

79
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,650
stopped thinking about Sister.

80
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,130
Plus, Sister really needs us the most now.

81
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,850
It’s getting late.

82
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,850
Get some rest.

83
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Who’s there?

84
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,770
-Sister. -I thought I told you -

85
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,920
Why are you here?

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,280
Dad wanted to visit you.

87
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,100
Won’t you let us in to sit down for a while?

88
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,980
Why are the curtains

89
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,540
drawn in the middle of the day?

90
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,030
I’ve heard about what happened.

91
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,910
I wanted to find you a job.

92
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,750
You said no.

93
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,110
You were messing with this instead.

94
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,230
Now you’ve got fired.

95
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,910
Yes, I was messing with this.

96
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,190
I even bought a house.

97
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,070
It’s a little small, but it’s nice.

98
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,630
Now that you’re out of a job,

99
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,950
do you have money for the mortgage?

100
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,870
Xia Ling. You’re amazing.

101
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,220
You’ve gone and tattled.

102
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,300
No, Sister. I just wanted to help.

103
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,460
Your brother is just concerned about you.

104
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,740
I don’t have a brother.

105
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,320
My mother only had one daughter.

106
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,400
Dad, Sister. I’ll wait for you outside.

107
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,680
Go ahead and chat.

108
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,410
Ying. I know you may be angry at me.

109
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,890
But I’m your dad, after all.

110
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,250
It’s okay if you got fired.

111
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,690
It’s good. We can find you a proper job.

112
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,810
What isn’t proper about my job?

113
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,530
Do you know what people on the net

114
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,770
are still saying about you?

115
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,520
What people on the net say about me

116
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
has nothing to do with you.

117
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
I’ll handle the embarrassment myself.

118
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,160
I remember when I first left home,

119
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,120
I had already cut father-daughter ties with you.

120
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,510
You have neither right nor duty to care about me.

121
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,870
I didn’t want to.

122
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,790
But think of your mother.

123
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,910
If she knew you were like this -

124
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,350
Don’t mention Mother to me.

125
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,740
She knows how I’ve survived all these years.

126
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,100
She’s proud of me.

127
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,620
But you -

128
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,140
You know best what you’ve done.

129
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,380
What have I done?

130
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,540
When my mother was in the hospital,

131
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,460
lying alone on the hospital bed,

132
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,700
you didn’t care for her at all.

133
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,540
You were still with that woman -

134
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,780
It wasn’t like what you think!

135
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,020
I don’t want your explanations.

136
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,360
If you’re going to be like this, fine.

137
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,260
I’ll leave my bank card here.

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,660
Use it to pay up your mortgage

139
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,020
No need. I’ve already told you.

140
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,860
I’ll finish walking the path I chose.

141
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,740
It has nothing to do with anyone.

142
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,300
Least of all you.

143
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,350
Come,

144
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,310
this is for Mom.

145
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,700
-Mom. -Thank you, Dad.

146
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,620
Thank you, dear.

147
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,620
When I was 18, that morning,

148
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,260
he called me to his room.

149
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,120
‘High expectations for your child’.

150
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,120
This is?

151
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,440
What ‘dragon’ what ‘pulse’?

152
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
‘Come dragon go pulse’ (the details of a story).

153
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,480
That’s right.

154
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,480
That’s beautiful.

155
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,600
Come, take a break.

156
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,400
Are you tired?

157
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,710
Have some fruit.

158
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,270
You eat, Dad.

159
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,560
Dad. You obviously care for each other.

160
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,440
Why can’t you talk nicely?

161
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
I know all these years,

162
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,280
you’ve been trying to get your sister to come home,

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,070
and for us to reconcile.

164
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,230
You’ve done a lot. Thank you.

165
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,510
Was it because of my mother and me

166
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,350
that you two -

167
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,230
It has nothing to do with you.

168
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,620
You still don’t understand adult matters.

169
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,100
Let’s go.

170
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,420
What are you doing?

171
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,820
I’m going to buy everyone coffee.

172
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,020
What will you drink, Brother Qi?

173
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,380
No, thanks.

174
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,100
What a strange day.

175
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,740
What’s he doing?

176
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,740
I don’t know.

177
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,780
Want coffee, Brother Qi?

178
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,340
No.

179
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,130
Come.

180
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,870
I -

181
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,230
just wanted the number of your Manager Zhao.

182
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,030
Come, Brother Xuan.

183
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,110
Have some coffee.

184
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,630
Don’t play this with me. Let me tell you.

185
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,910
It’s useless looking for anyone now.

186
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,110
Do you know that the sponsors

187
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,150
have been going crazy recently?

188
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,430
The only way now is for Qiu Ying to step up,

189
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,510
clarify, and apologise.

190
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,100
How many times do I have to say this?

191
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,420
Qiu Ying was framed for the video uploading.

192
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,740
Do you have proof?

193
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,040
Not yet.

194
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,080
Why should I believe you then?

195
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,960
What attitude is this?

196
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
No.

197
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,760
It’s useless even if I believed you.

198
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,080
There are so many managers up there.

199
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,510
The team has to believe you.

200
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,550
Once I find proof,

201
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,230
look at how I’ll cut that liar Ji Xiang Kong.

202
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,270
Not so loud!

203
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,020
How could you scold him?

204
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,500
Do you know how much trouble this has caused Brother Kong?

205
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,020
How bad could it be? As bad as it is for Qiu Ying?

206
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,290
She was fired by You Xing because of this.

207
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,010
Did you know that?

208
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,530
Fired?

209
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,290
Ji Xiang Kong even said that Qiu Ying used him for views.

210
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,130
She doesn’t even have a job. What good would views do?

211
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,330
Are you all hare-brained?

212
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,610
Also, Qiu Ying is just a girl.

213
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,330
How can she have the capability to falsify that video?

214
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,370
Let’s assume that even if she did,

215
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,130
would she have been stupid enough

216
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,810
to upload it on her own computer?

217
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,250
Let me tell you. This was obviously

218
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,800
a setup and trap for your Brother Kong.

219
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,600
look at how I’ll cut that liar Ji Xiang Kong.

220
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,120
Qiu Ying was but a scapegoat.

221
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,000
Could you please use your brains?

222
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,710
You do seem to make sense.

223
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,750
Of course!

224
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,510
Think about it.

225
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,620
Who else did Brother Kong offend?

226
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,700
He’s offended many people.

227
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,500
Let me count.

228
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,660
Qiu Ying?

229
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,900
Hello, Qiu Ying? I’m -

230
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,820
What?

231
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,410
Wait. Wait for me to get there.

232
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,490
Where are you going?

233
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,370
Qiu Ying just sold her house.

234
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,770
Is Ji Xiang Kong happy now?

235
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,210
Wait, don’t go -

236
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,920
You aren’t drinking this?

237
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
She was fired and even sold her house?

238
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,380
Yeah.

239
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,580
I heard it myself

240
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,140
when Qiu Ying called Lu Yi Yi.

241
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,740
Lu Yi Yi even asked me for Manager Zhao’s number

242
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,460
to ask for a settlement.

243
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,500
Brother Kong.

244
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,340
I’m starting to believe that Qiu Ying didn’t do this.

245
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,940
I think something’s strange too.

246
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,620
The more complicated this gets,

247
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,020
the more it shows that someone is pulling the strings.

248
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,340
Brother Kong, remember when

249
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,210
Qiu Ying said her computer was hacked?

250
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,130
I think this could have been done by our competitor.

251
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,510
If this really wasn’t done by Qiu Ying,

252
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,550
I don’t think it seems like it was a competitor, either.

253
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,750
On the contrary, Zhao Yang’s demeanour

254
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,390
is out of the ordinary.

255
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,030
What did he do?

256
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,790
He’s always been strong at solving PR crises.

257
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,590
This time, he’s behaving strangely.

258
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,470
He hasn’t released

259
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,590
a single clarification on our official Weibo account.

260
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,590
When I suggested looking for Jeffrey,

261
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,910
he became very proactive, asking me to

262
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,390
train well and that he would look for him.

263
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,230
He doesn’t want you to meet Jeffrey.

264
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
That makes sense.

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,280
I really don’t understand.

266
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
You were so determined to buy this house.

267
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
And now you’re selling it just like this?

268
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,790
Maybe I wanted a home of my own too much.

269
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,790
But I understand now.

270
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,860
Even with a house, you might not have a home.

271
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,420
But -

272
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,810
But this house has been your dream.

273
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,770
How could you bear to crush it with your own hands?

274
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,530
My dad and Xia Ling came by today.

275
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,050
What? Your dad was here?

276
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,050
I thought you haven’t met

277
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,050
since you moved out when you were a freshman.

278
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,680
First time meeting him after so many years,

279
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,640
he told me he could pay the mortgage for me.

280
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,550
But I’d have to

281
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,710
give up the nonsensical jobs.

282
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,790
Actually, your dad is good to you.

283
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,700
Don’t sell this house on impulse and out of anger.

284
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,180
I’m not selling it out of anger.

285
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,340
Besides selling the house,

286
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,020
I don’t have any other choice.

287
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,940
I have to prove to myself that

288
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,730
I can overcome anything.

289
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,130
That’s why all these years,

290
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,930
I have never respected anyone but you.

291
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,860
But you’re homeless now.

292
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,220
I shall be generous and take you in then.

293
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,580
I knew you were the best to me.

294
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,700
Of course. Who else would be better to you?

295
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,580
Silly.

296
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,300
Alright, I’ll take this for you.

297
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,540
Come.

298
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,540
What are they doing?

299
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,060
Having a strategy meeting.

300
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,090
I’m going out for a little while.

301
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,890
If anyone looks for me, tell them

302
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,090
that I’m looking for Jeffrey.

303
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,090
Alright.

304
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,710
Manager Zhao. - You scared me to death.

305
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,190
Sorry, I didn’t knock.

306
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,070
No worries.

307
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,030
Come have a seat.

308
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,270
I’m alright.

309
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,390
I just wanted to ask if you’ve contacted Jeffrey yet.

310
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,510
Yes, I have.

311
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,750
Tonight, we’re meeting for dinner

312
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,230
to discuss the matters of his clarification.

313
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,830
I’ll go with you tonight.

314
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,830
I should be the one to apologise to him.

315
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,550
Sure. No problem.

316
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,390
Sure.

317
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,260
Manager Zhao, I forgot!

318
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,100
This -

319
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,900
I’ve arranged two training matches for Ji today.

320
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,140
I forgot.

321
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,660
How could you forget?

322
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,360
Xiang Kong.

323
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,320
I know that we’ve had scuffles before.

324
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,240
But you have to believe me that on this matter,

325
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,200
we’re on the same team.

326
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,990
Even if I had to give up my reputation,

327
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,550
I’ll definitely invite Jeffrey to step out

328
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,030
to clarify things publicly.

329
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,950
It’s not for you alone,

330
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,270
but for the whole company’s sake.

331
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,420
As for you, train well with your teammates tonight.

332
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,260
Fight to win the inner competition.

333
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,690
Fight hard to make people

334
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,490
who had looked down on you shut up.

335
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:40,930
Thank you, Manager Zhao.

336
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,810
-I’ll head back to training then. -Sure.

337
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,810
I’ll leave it to you.

338
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,570
Of course.

339
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,130
Please.

340
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,240
How was it?

341
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,870
Zhao Yang arranged two training matches for me.

342
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,190
He wants to hold me back.

343
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,830
You’ll lead the reserves in the matches first.

344
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,550
I want to see if he’s going to look for Jeffrey.

345
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,030
Got it.

346
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,860
Put the pillow up.

347
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,500
Great. Nearly there.

348
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,460
I’ll help you to arrange your

349
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,420
things over these few days.

350
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,740
In the future, this will be your nest.

351
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,810
It’s a little small. Please don’t mind it.

352
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,770
Thank you for taking me in.

353
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,680
I don’t have anything for you.

354
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,720
Please take these face masks.

355
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,160
Sure.

356
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,900
I wanted some masks anyway.

357
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,020
Thank you.

358
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,900
I went to look for Lin Yi Xuan yesterday.

359
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,820
He wouldn’t help out.

360
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,140
It’s okay.

361
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,380
I’ll look for Zhao Yang at Chuan Qi myself.

362
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,660
Aren’t you afraid that the people at Chuan Qi will eat you alive?

363
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,180
Look.

364
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,140
What’s this?

365
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,860
Zhao Yang’s car.

366
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,620
Zhao Yang’s car?

367
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,610
What do you mean?

368
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,010
You’ll know very soon.

369
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,950
So many cars. How will I find it?

370
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:56,030
Great. Ji Xiang Kong. I’ve found you.

371
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,710
86… 186…

372
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,070
No. You’re flaking on me.

373
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,100
Yes. I’ve arranged for a private room.

374
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,940
Fine. Whatever. Fine.

375
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,100
Hello, Manager Zhao.

376
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,690
I’m Qiu Ying.

377
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,650
Ah, Qiu Ying! What’s up?

378
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,970
I wanted to borrow a bit of your time.

379
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,250
I wonder if it’s convenient?

380
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,450
Please go ahead.

381
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,530
I wanted to talk to you a little

382
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,890
about Chuan Qi sending me a lawyer letter.

383
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,750
Aren’t you coming?

384
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,640
Manager Zhao.

385
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,500
The viral video of Ji Xiang Kong’s fight wasn’t uploaded by me.

386
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,620
Could you help me to explain it to your company?

387
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,500
Please, Manager Zhao?

388
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,060
Actually,I do think that this couldn’t have

389
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,980
been done by a little girl like you.

390
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,140
What about this?

391
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,650
I could release a statement

392
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,130
to say that Ji Xiang Kong didn’t hit anyone.

393
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,790
Why are you in a rush?

394
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,030
You haven’t eaten, right?

395
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,350
This was opened by a close friend of mine.

396
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,230
Why don’t we go in and chat while we eat?

397
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,910
Please don’t do that, Manager Zhao.

398
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,550
What about this?

399
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,230
There’s a steak place just ahead that’s delicious.

400
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,230
Let me buy you a meal. Let’s go. It’s close by.

401
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,990
Qiu Ying. You’re pretty. Know what to do.

402
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Do you think that this matter can be resolved through a single meal?

403
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,380
No, Manager Zhao.

404
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,560
-No? -Don’t do this.

405
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,720
What are you doing? Don’t do this.

406
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,120
What are you doing?

407
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,440
Don’t touch me. Let go! I’m going to call the police.

408
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,280
Go ahead!

409
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,800
Don’t touch me. I’m calling the police!

410
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,600
Don’t do this! Let go of me!

411
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,770
Who is it?!

412
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,280
You -

413
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,840
Are you crazy, Ji Xiang Kong? You hit me!

414
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,470
Manager Zhao. Weren’t you going to meet Jeffrey?

415
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,340
Qiu Ying! Are you okay?

416
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
Don’t touch me!

417
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,060
Ji Xiang Kong!

418
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,820
You and Qiu Ying -

419
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,700
Just wait!

420
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,820
Qiu Ying!

421
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,980
Qiu Ying.

422
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,260
Let go of me.

423
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you okay, miss?

424
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Alcohol -

425
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,350
You can’t drink anymore. You could clear the bill first.

426
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,190
The bill? I have money.

427
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,910
Don’t drink anymore, Qiu Ying.

428
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,940
Why did you push me? I’m footing the bill.

429
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,340
Sorry about that. I’ll clear the bill with you later.

430
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,340
Sure.

431
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,220
Slow down.

432
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,130
How about this? I’ll pay you back.

433
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,920
Do you know what ‘priceless’ means?

434
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,480
Go foot the bill.

435
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,950
This was her mother’s necklace. She wasn’t pretending.

436
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,790
Go get the bill for me.

437
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,630
I’ll get the bill. I’ll get the bill for you.

438
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,900
Don’t sit on the floor, okay? It’s cold.

439
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,340
Leave me alone.

440
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,340
I’ll go get the bill. Come. Sit here first

441
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,420
Get up.

442
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,860
Don’t touch me!

443
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,540
Sit here. I’ll get the bill.

444
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,850
Sorry, how much is it?

445
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,890
-Qiu Ying! -Where’s the door?

446
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,770
Keep the change.

447
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,650
Please come again.

448
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,840
Don’t touch me!

449
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,400
Okay, I won’t touch you.

450
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,200
Where do you live? I’ll send you home.

451
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,300
I don’t have a home.

452
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,740
All thanks to you, you arrogant, disgusting moron.

453
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,340
Hey, I did save you just now, right?

454
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,380
If not for you, Ji Xiang Kong,

455
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,420
would I be at rock bottom right now?

456
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,780
I was just -

457
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,020
I was just pretending to be Gu Fang’s fan.

458
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,220
I was just trying to ride alongside you.

459
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,810
Did you have to harm me to this state?

460
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,270
Ji Xiang Kong. You’ve really hurt me.

461
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,870
I have no home. No job.

462
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,710
Everything I’ve worked for is gone.

463
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,070
Are you happy? Are you satisfied?

464
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,830
I’m sorry. It was my fault. Go ahead and scold me.

465
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,430
Don’t say sorry to me.

466
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,750
We have nothing to say to each other.

467
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,070
You -

468
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,750
and Zhao Yang.

469
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,140
Your whole team is full of scum.

470
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,570
Didn’t you want to sue me? Come. Sue me!

471
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,120
I’ve never been afraid of anything!

472
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:28,120
One day, I will make all of you apologise to me!
