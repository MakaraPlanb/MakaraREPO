00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Thank you everybody.

19
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,390
I'm going to start

20
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,310
my commenting.

21
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,470
Not long after the game starts,

22
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,710
Bei Xi is

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,630
defeating

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,710
Lu Sheng.

25
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,990
It causes Lu Sheng's

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,790
creator

27
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,870
to be unable to develop.

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,670
Now the competition has started for

29
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,790
eight minutes sixteen seconds.

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,830
The situation in the competition

31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,470
has

32
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,790
a drastic change.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,790
Pei Xi,

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,900
due to the advantage in economy,

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,900
want to kill Lu Sheng.

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,420
However end up fainted

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,580
by Lu Sheng's

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,500
"extreme cold" skill.

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,460
For luckily, Pei Xi reacted fast

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,900
and chose to fall back

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
and retreat to the tower.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
Surprisingly,

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,880
the conservative Lu Sheng

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,520
have suddenly

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,520
become a changed person.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Went up to the tower and kills.

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
Two members from Chuang Qi Team

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
came in time

49
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,360
to protect and support.

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,080
Lu Sheng's attack is very powerful now.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
CEO Guo, how is it?

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Your You Xing have a talent.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,400
I think

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
she's very likely to become

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,590
the female Luo Tian.

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,230
Defeated.

57
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,950
The help from the two Chuang Qi team members.

58
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,990
Luo Tian,

59
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,030
how is it?

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,910
Lu Sheng is fighting against three.

61
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,550
Not too bad.

62
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,860
Using on clever movements

63
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,580
he avoided Chuang Qi Team.

64
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,380
Miss Mi Ya,

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,100
what's your comments?

66
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,940
I'm came here

67
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,140
having the attitude to learn.

68
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,220
I don't really understand game commenting.

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,730
But based on what we see now,

70
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,410
I feel that Qiao Xin is not too bad.

71
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,970
Help Qi Yue to achieve triple kill.

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,090
Thank you everybody.

73
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,690
That's the end of my commenting.

74
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,080
Very excellent comments!

75
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Thank you Qiao Xin.

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,440
Dear audiences,

77
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,040
how do you feel

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,800
about

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
Qiao Xin's performance just now?

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,640
Is it good?

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,270
No!

82
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,390
What about the popularity...

83
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,590
Based on the audiences here,

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,270
the live voting shows that

85
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,110
Qiao Xin is still

86
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,190
the number one.

87
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,590
While Qiu Ying is number two.

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,220
The difference between both is also getting bigger.

89
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,900
So

90
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,100
who will be crown as the

91
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
winner?

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,140
Okay,

93
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,540

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,220

102
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,820
Since the start of the autumn match,

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,820
VNG is in

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,940
long dark moments.

105
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,820
Under the pressure,

106
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,140
VNG have made a

107
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,460
very bold decision

108
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,180
by changing the front Lu Sheng

109
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,340
to the middle position.

110
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,740
In the first match,

111
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,860
VNG lose.

112
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,700
The second match is starting soon,

113
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,380
could they change the situation,

114
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,420
let's look forward to it.

115
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,420
VNG's double moon team

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,410
choose to avoid the fog and go to the river,

117
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,490
at the beginning of the game.

118
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,010
What does that mean?

119
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,650
Let us look

120
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,730
Lin Yi Xuan is here.

121
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,970
Looks like VNG knew about

122
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,850
Lin Yi Xuan's move beforehand.

123
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,150
They started.

124
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,030
Shen Yue's second level skill

125
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,990
have trapped Lin Yi Xuan,

126
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,230
Qi Yue back that up

127
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,510
one blood is done.

128
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,150
This move is really beautiful

129
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,270
and have helped VNG

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,550
to develop their advantage in the early stage.

131
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,710
After the short peace,

132
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,510
VNG's double moon team

133
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,670
started to attack

134
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,870
the lower route.

135
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,630
Both used the same tactics.

136
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,510
First, Shen Yue controls Lu Feng,

137
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,710
Qi Yue

138
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,270
uses skills to kill Lu Feng.

139
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,550
At this moment, Qi Yue

140
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,870
activate the speed skill

141
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,990
go over the tower and kill

142
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,110
in one breath.

143
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,870
This is a beautiful double kill

144
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,420
and have create the chance for

145
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
VNG's victory.

146
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,900
Bravo Qiu Ying!

147
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,360
Is everyone

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,160
very familiar with

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,480
this set of tactics?

150
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,960
That's right.

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
This used to be the double moon team

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,280
who dare to use an abandoned tactic

153
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,400
in such an important competition.

154
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,560
In the whole legend,

155
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,960
maybe only him

156
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,320
and he is VNG's

157
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,430
new team leader

158
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,310
who is known as the best tactic master,

159
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,630
Ji Xiang Kong.

160
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,100
Ji Xiang Kong,

161
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,860
went to VNG

162
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,010
with a yearly pay of $1.

163
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,330
With the pressure from the negative feedbacks,

164
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,850
he restarted the double moon team,

165
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,930
Just like VNG's motive,

166
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,770
Born with no fear,

167
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,210
strive for the future.

168
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,570
In this competition,

169
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,570
he made it!

170
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,810
He created a

171
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,490
brand new VNG.

172
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
With the hope,

173
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
strive for the future

174
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,640
to accompany you to the top of the world.

175
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,750
I believe you

176
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,310
you will reach the top of the world.

177
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,030
Then I hope that day,

178
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,030
its you standing at the commenting stage

179
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,870
announcing to the world that

180
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,340
our China team

181
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,700
is the world champion.

182
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,700
Does Qiu Ying really that understand you?

183
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Xiang Kong,

184
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,980
how much did I missed

185
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,820
in your life?

186
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm about to cry.

187
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,140
If there isn't so many people,

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,380
I will cry.

189
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,090
This girl is not too bad.

190
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,650
But I feel that

191
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,690
Qiao Xin

192
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,450
is more suitable for

193
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,570
our GDV's style.

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,480
Qiu Ying you are the best!

195
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Qiu Ying fighting!

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
Fighting!

197
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,700
Qiu Ying!

198
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Thank you everybody.

199
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,780
That's the end of my commenting.

200
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,980
That's very exciting!

201
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Thank you QIu Ying.

202
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,220
Come, this way please.

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Also, Qiao Xin

204
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,180
please come to the center of the stage.

205
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,500
Both commenting

206
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,940
are as exciting

207
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,740
and hard to say who's better.

208
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,380
Now,

209
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,820
I have the

210
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,820
final results for the

211
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
audience votings.

212
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,820
Qiao Xin,

213
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,060
have a slight advantage

214
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,730
and are slightly higher votes.

215
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,410
But who is the winner

216
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,570
for today

217
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,090
is still unknown.

218
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,810
So

219
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,130
according to our rules,

220
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,130
all the judges will have one vote.

221
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,470
If you are voting for Qiao Xin,

222
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,710
please raise the blue card.

223
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,830
For Qiu Ying,

224
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,510
please raise the red card.

225
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,910
Every judges votes

226
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,590
is equivalent to

227
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,350
hundred votes of the audiences votes.

228
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,190
Therefore,

229
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,830
all judges,

230
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,390
it's now

231
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,830
all over to you all.

232
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
This two-

233
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,870
Congrats Qiao Xin

234
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,510
for getting two votes now.

235
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,550
Okay, what about Summer's side?

236
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,390
Who are you voting for?

237
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,500
Qiu Ying, you are great!

238
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,700
Brother Xia Tian I love you!

239
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,820
Nice Brother Xia Tian!

240
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,600
Congratulation Qiu Ying for getting one vote.

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,680
What about Teacher Luo?

242
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
Who are you voting for?

243
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
Before voting,

244
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
I want to say something.

245
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,800
I couldn't find

246
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
any flaws

247
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,360
Qiao Xin's performance just now.

248
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
No matter from the tactics analysis,

249
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,640
or the judgement of the match-

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,680
What does he mean?

251
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
Is he voting for Qiao Xin?

252
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,190
Whereas Qiu Ying

253
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,070
from how she handles the details,

254
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,670
it can tell that she's more inexperienced.

255
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,830
This Luo Tian...

256
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,150
Qiu Ying has already

257
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,150
performed so well.

258
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,580
Where is the inexperience part?

259
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,580
Teacher Luo is too strict.

260
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,660
Do you feel that

261
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,540
Qiao Xin

262
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,860
is better too?

263
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,700
Profession is not just the skills,

264
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,820
and also attitude,

265
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,900
we, the commentators

266
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,650
is the bridge between the audience

267
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,850
and the industry.

268
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,850
If the commentator

269
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,690
couldn't present her passion,

270
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,730
how will the public

271
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,530
fall in love with

272
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,250
this new sports?

273
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,530
All those

274
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,490
youngsters who want

275
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,370
to be in this industry,

276
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,610
please remember,

277
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,050
if you does not have

278
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,730
the passion and the faith,

279
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,730
please do not step into this industry.

280
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,240
This is because its a hard path

281
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
and yet its a honor.

282
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,600
This is also

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,520
our motive

284
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
for organizing this competition.

285
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,790
To choose

286
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,390
the talent truly love

287
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,750
this industry.

288
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,990
So this vote

289
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,980
goes to Qiu Ying.

290
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,860
It's a tie now.

291
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,620
Qiu Ying's commenting just now

292
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,300
really make me feel

293
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,780
the passion she have for this industry.

294
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,980
Thank you Teacher Luo,

295
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,700
I will continue to work hard.

296
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,700
Okay.

297
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,530
So now,

298
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,690
both contestant

299
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,850
each gotten two votes.

300
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,970
Even though Qiao Xin's

301
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,690
votes are slightly higher

302
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,080
but the winner

303
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,520
is still an unknown puzzle.

304
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
The crucial vote

305
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,840
is in

306
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Miss Mi Ya's hands.

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
So who would you

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
vote for?

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,700
Xiang Kong,

310
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,220
did you found my shadow

311
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,460
on her?

312
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,540
I have a friend

313
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,180
who really love

314
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,500
this sports.

315
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,100
She has friends from the game industry.

316
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
got to understand this sport very long ago

317
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,980
but given that,

318
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,260
I have never try to understand

319
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,860
how hard it is for the professional players.

320
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,340
Till today

321
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,300
after listening to the commenting,

322
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,180
then I realise

323
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,130
there's so many hardship and difficulties

324
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,330
behind these professional players.

325
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,610
So they really worth the

326
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,210
honor.

327
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,850
Thank you this stage

328
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,550
for giving the chance to understand it

329
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,230
within such a short time.

330
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,590
In this industry,

331
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,430
China also have a group

332
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,790

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,790
So my votes goes to

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,110

Is your performance just now

359
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
worth my vote.

360
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I always love your songs

361
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,400

Tian Kong Zhi Wai.

364
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,270
It feels like I am

365
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,310

366
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,550

377
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,980

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,500
you can anyhow hug? No-

393
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,580
Qiu Ying's commenting just now

394
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
is so great and touching!

395
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,260
If who were to say that

396
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,180
I will immediately marry her.

397
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,460
Stop matchmaking.

398
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,420
You go one side.

399
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,300
No,

400
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm just help my Brother Kong

401
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,980
to say out his inner voice.

402
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,300
You go one side.

403
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,420
Come,

404
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,220
let me get some

405
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,180
happiness from the winner.

406
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,100
Today,

407
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,820
you really amazed the crowd.

408
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,060
Let's go

409
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,060
celebrate at our usual place.

410
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Let's go.

411
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,940
Let's go celebrate!

412
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,570
Come come come.

413
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,210
Let's celebrate.

414
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,450
Congrats Qiu Ying

415
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,770
for being the winner of Next Star

416
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,890
becoming GDV's

417
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,850
intern commentator.

418
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,170
Congrats!

419
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,890
Qiu Ying is the best.

420
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,470
I still feel like it's a dream.

421
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,870
I know right.

422
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,150
When Luo Tian is giving his comments,

423
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,950
my heart

424
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,590
is almost popping out.

425
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,830
Thank goodness,

426
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,710
at the crucial moment,

427
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,030
there's a twist.

428
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,110
Actually what really shocks me is

429
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,550
not just Teacher Luo

430
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,630
but also Mi Ya.

431
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,590
A big star like her

432
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,710
not just listen to my commenting

433
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,630
but also gave me her vote.

434
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:52,950
Also,

435
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,150
she gave me

436
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,750
an autographed album.

437
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,380
Mi Ya's album.

438
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,500
Ji Feng Xiang Yang.

439
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,820
Tian Kong Zhi Wai.

440
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,940
She signed?

441
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,480
Qiu Ying you are so privilege.

442
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
I heard that

443
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,680
the song, Tian Kong Zhi Wai

444
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,480
is written by

445
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,080
Mi Ya for her first love.

446
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

447
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,080
I heard of this too.

448
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,240
What

449
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,080
What's the name of her first love?

450
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
He's called...

451
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,680
Ren Xu!

452
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,720
Yes.

453
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
Mi Ya ditched him after she got famous.

454
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,960
Why did I feel that this song

455
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,400
doesn't sound like it's written for Ren Xu.

456
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,160
This song

457
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,510
sounds like it's for lover

458
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,670
but also sounds like for family.

459
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,830
It's like they have been through a lot together,

460
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,990
supporting each other,

461
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,910
giving warm to each other.

462
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,390
No matter what we say,

463
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,870
this first love is quite sad.

464
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,990
He got to become the topic

465
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,140
when she release her new album.

466
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,220
So poor thing.

467
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,260
Right Brother Kong?

468
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,300
Enough,

469
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,300
stop gossiping.

470
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,060
Aren't we here to

471
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,900
celebrate for Qiu Ying?

472
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,780
Faster dig in.

473
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,450
Yes, let's eat.

474
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,290
Come, Qiu Ying eat more.

475
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,050
Eat more. Thank you Yi Yi.

476
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,970
Eat more meat.

477
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,890
Send this two tickets to Qiu Ying.

478
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,170
Ask her to find me at the backstage

479
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,210
when she come for the fan meeting.

480
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,410
Tony,

481
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,010
now you can tell me right?

482
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,250
Sister Mi Ya,

483
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
I shall go send out the tickets.

484
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,000
What did Xiang Kong

485
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,560
told you?

486
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,280
I don't believe anything

487
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,750
that you mention just now.

488
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,550
He agree

489
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,030
to meet me today.

490
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,150
Did you stop him?

491
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,940
Just the opposite.

492
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,380
He came to look for me.

493
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,770
Please wait a moment.

494
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,210
Mi Ya is busy.

495
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,370
You can tell me if you have anything to say.

496
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,330
Actually I came

497
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,930
to look for you

498
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,040
not Mi Ya.

499
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
What do you want to say to me?

500
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
Are you telling me

501
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,540
how you and Mi Ya

502
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,220
can't forget each other

503
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,380
and ask me not to

504
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,700
stop you two for being together?

505
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,740
No way.

506
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,700
How much effort we put in

507
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,740
for what Mi Ya

508
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,700
got to today.

509
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,300
I don't allow you to destory Mi Ya.

510
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,100
Great minds think alike.

511
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,340
Before you became her

512
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,300
manager,

513
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,300
I have witnessed

514
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,100
how many times she fails and her hard work.

515
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,100
She won't rest even if

516
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,810
she injures herself when dancing,

517
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,290
sing until her throat is sore.

518
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,930
This has all become a commonplace.

519
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,610
As long as there's chance to perform,

520
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,770
no matter if it's winter,

521
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,290
wearing thin clothes,

522
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,630
in the strong wind

523
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,750
she can dance the whole day

524
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,990
in the outdoor stage.

525
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,030
This is the dream that she have

526
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
been chasing for over ten years.

527
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,270
I have no rights to ask her give up.

528
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,190
Didn't you

529
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,550
think of that before?

530
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,150
On the day we break up,

531
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,510
I knew that

532
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,430
we will be

533
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,550
people from different world.

534
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,270
Please help me tell her

535
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,830
the beautiful past

536
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,470
is the best gift

537
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,670
for both of us.

538
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,110
Forget the past,

539
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
live the fullest now

540
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,780
I will give her my blessings.

541
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
Ji Xiang Kong is right.

542
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Both of you are no longer

543
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,360
from the same world.

544
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,120
He have never thought of

545
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
reconcile with you.

546
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,590
Xiang Kong is just thinking of me

547
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,390
and doing his best to fulfill my dreams.

548
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,070
The more he say

549
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,940
the more I could not

550
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,140
give up.

551
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,020
Tony, I'm going to look for him now.

552
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,580
What are you doing?

553
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't you know

554
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,780
the number reporters out there?

555
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,860
Do you really want to drag

556
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,580
Ji Xiang Kong into this situation?

557
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,290
Sit down.

558
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,170
Sit down.

559
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Tony,

560
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
we used to be very poor

561
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,550
that we cannot even afford cup noodles.

562
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,190
It's Xiang Kong who

563
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,750
support me by

564
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,870
working part time in hunger.

565
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,300
It's him who beg the management company

566
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,820
to give me a chance.

567
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,620
Without him,

568
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,420
there won't be today's Fu Mi Ya.

569
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,220
So I rather give up everything

570
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,340
just for him.

571
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,100
I hope you can give me your support.

572
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,340
Mi Ya,

573
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,100
can you stop being one sided?

574
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:07,980
He has already

575
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,530
got someone he likes.

576
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,250
Let me tell you the truth.

577
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,650
He did not go backstage for you

578
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
but he was there to support Qiu Ying.

579
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
Do you know that?

580
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,120
Ji Xiang Kong has already

581
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
made his choice.

582
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,140
This is

583
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,420
just taken today by the netizens.

584
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,340
He and Qiu Ying

585
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,980
are celebrating at the BBQ restaurant.

586
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,940
Take a look yourself.

587
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,140
Congrats. Thank you everybody. Cheers.

588
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,300
What should we do later on?

589
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,340
What can we do?

590
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,780
Go home

591
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,100
and look for your own mother.

592
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,450
Just like this?

593
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,170
I still want to treat you

594
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,290
treat you all to sing karaoke.

595
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,230
Why are you so generous today?

596
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,070
Since when am I not generous?

597
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,710
Why did you...

598
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,030
Do you want to treat us

599
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,550
or just Yi Yi?

600
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,150
Qiu Ying.

601
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,190
Of course is you all.

602
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,030
Why should I treat her?

603
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,350
Ya right.

604
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,590
What's there to sing for the both of us.

605
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,630
If it's not you

606
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,630
who sang very happy that day-

607
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,550
Will you die not saying anything?

608
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,630
Xiang Kong,

609
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,590
thank you.

610
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,910
Without you,

611
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:35,870
I might not

612
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,070
be able to be the winner.

613
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,550
So-

614
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:45,940
Sorry,

615
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,060
I got to answer the call.

616
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,600
Why is he so secretive for the call?

617
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
Who is it?

618
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't know.

619
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
I won't tell you even if I know.

620
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,640
Hello.

621
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,350
Xiang Kong, it's me.

622
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,030
I'm flying back

623
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,990
tonight

624
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,830
so I want to meet you privately.

625
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,780
I'm opposite of you.

626
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,660
Tony should have told you

627
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
whatever I want to say.

628
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,210
I don't believe.

629
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,090
Even if you doesn't

630
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,370
want to reconcile with me,

631
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,530
I want to hear you say it in person.

632
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,770
I got it.

633
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,760
Sorry.

634
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,880
I got something urgent suddenly,

635
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,200
I got to go first.

636
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,160
Ah Xuan,

637
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,280
send both of them back.

638
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,600
Okay.

639
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,670
It's okay.

640
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,990
If you have something on,

641
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,590
go ahead first.

642
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,790
Oh ya,

643
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,790
just now you say-

644
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,510
I have a gift.

645
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,030
Sorry.

646
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,900
Answer it.

647
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,700
He has been helping with your votes.

648
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
It's not easy for him.

649
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,420
Hello.

650
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,020
Why must you make your brother injure

651
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,380
because of your competition?

652
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,980
Do you know he met a car accident?

653
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,620
What?!

654
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,260
The doctors are still saving him.

655
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,980
Xia Ling

656
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,060
Xia Ling is now undergoing rescue?

657
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,930
Which hospital is he in?

658
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,450
Okay.

659
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,250
I need to go to the hospital first.

660
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,170
Don't panic, I will send you there.

661
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,520
Bills. I...I-

662
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,120
I will go too.

663
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Yi Yi, both of them is enough.

664
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,480
This way, this way, this way.

665
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,800
Wear the helmet.

666
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't panic.

667
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
Slowly.

668
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,980
Faster.

669
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,260
How is Xia Ling?

670
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,420
You still have the face to ask. You-

671
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,580
What are you doing? You-

672
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,500
How can you hit people?

673
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,380
It's my son in there.

674
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,610
It's not over

675
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,730
if there's anything that happen to my son.

676
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,850
Auntie,

677
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,970
we can understand how you feel

678
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,410
because of what had happen

679
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,690
but please calm down.

680
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,610
No matter what's wrong,

681
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,750
you can't hit people.

682
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,190
Who is the patient's family?

683
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,750
I am.

684
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,750
He needs an emergency blood transfusion.

685
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,030
However the hospital's A blood type stock

686
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,390
is not enough. What?

687
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,750
Such a big hospital

688
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,910
and you have no A blood type blood.

689
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,270
Are you joking with me?

690
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:45,990
Stop auguring.

691
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,910
What to do now, doctor?

692
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,030
Quick think of some solutions.

693
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,270
I'm A blood type.

694
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,870
Take mine.

695
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,540
Qiu Ying has my Brother Kong with her,

696
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,700
so don't worry.

697
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,700
Now Xia Ling is in danger

698
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,660
Qiu Ling will sure be very guilty.

699
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
Let me tell you.

700
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,880
Their two famailies

701
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,120
used to be neighbors

702
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
and their relationship was very good.

703
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,840
Xia Ling

704
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,240
will alway go Qiu Ling's house for meals.

705
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,240
The two of them

706
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,120
are really like real siblings.

707
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,440
But

708
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,000
why are they in so bad relationship now?

709
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,760
Not long after Qiu Ying's mom have passed away,

710
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,630
Qiu Ying's dad

711
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,230
married Xia Ling's mom.

712
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,990
You mean

713
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,310
her dad

714
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,830
were with his mom

715
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,780
when Qiu Ling's mom is still around?

716
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,220
How would we know

717
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,180
what exactly happened?

718
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,380
Yes, yes yes.

719
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,700
Qiu Ying

720
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,900
is always very stubborn,

721
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,970
she couldn't get along with Xia Ling's mom.

722
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,610
Her dad is between held up in between them.

723
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,250
Most of the time,

724
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,490
he sides Xia Ling's side.

725
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,250
Therefore,

726
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,690
once Qiu Ying move out of the house

727
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,170
and cut ties with her dad

728
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,890
at the year when

729
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,850
she got into university.

730
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,210
But Xia Ling

731
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,850
is a very sensible kid

732
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,210
who always feel that

733
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
is he and his mom

734
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,640
who destroyed

735
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,280
the relationship of Qiu Ying and her dad.

736
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
So he think of all kinds of way to be good to Qiu Ying.

737
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,520
It's not that Qiu Ying doesn't know

738
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,150
how thoughtful is Xia Ling

739
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,510
but she just couldn't bring herself

740
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,710
to forgive her dad

741
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,910
and

742
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,230
forgive Xia Ling's mom.

743
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,110
Therefore

744
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,470
she's quite cold

745
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,980
towards Xia Ling.

746
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,620
However

747
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,260
based on Qiu Ying's reaction today

748
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,820
it seems like she still

749
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,100
cares for this brother.

750
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,880
You just donated blood

751
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,840
your body needs more nutritions.

752
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,110
Come.

753
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,860
Be good, drink it.

754
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,900
It's been one night,

755
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,020
why isn't he out yet?

756
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,620
Don't worry.

757
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,340
He will be okay.

758
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,500
But today you

759
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,020
need to report at GDV.

760
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,980
You shouldn't be late on your first day.

761
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,540
Get going.

762
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,580
I will help you keep a look out here.

763
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,450
Xia Ling is not out yet.

764
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,490
I can't go.

765
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,690
He had the car accident

766
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,990
in front of the competition venue.

767
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,150
It's all to help to get votes.

768
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,030
He treat me with his whole heart

769
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,830
and how could I treat him like this.

770
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,350
I even went to his school to scold him.

771
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,150
Okay.

772
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,590
You didn't do it on purpose.

773
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,430
You can tell him

774
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,070
when he wake up.

775
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,150
Don't worry.

776
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,230
He will be fine.

777
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,110
Doctor, doctor.

778
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,670
How is my son?

779
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,180
You are patient's family member right?

780
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,060
The patient suffers from slight concussion,

781
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,340
fractured his right tibia,

782
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,340
too much bleeding that leads to shock,

783
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,040
but it's already fine now.

784
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,920
But

785
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,640
he needs to stay in the hospital for observations.

786
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,560
Thank you doctor.

787
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,680
All because of you.

788
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,640
You go!

789
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,240
Auntie, calm down.

790
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,240
Go away you all!

791
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,760
Qiu Ying is as hurt as you.

792
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,360
My son

793
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640
still needs to join the basketball competition.

794
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,360
Go away you all!

795
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,720
Can you lower down your volume?

796
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Son,son. Xia Ling.

797
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,320
Xia Ling.

798
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,310
Xia Ling wke up.

799
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,060
The car is here.

800
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
You better get going.

801
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,900
I ask you

802
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,610
tibia fracture

803
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,090
will it affect him

804
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,250
when he plays basketball in the future?

805
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,450
Don't worry.

806
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,450
He's still young.

807
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,050
He will recover very fast.

808
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,170
It's not early now,

809
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,850
quick go report at GDVs.

810
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,760
Thank you.

811
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,310
You have competition today right?

812
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,710
You been awake the whole night.

813
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,550
It's all my fault.

814
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,070
Don't worry.

815
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,070
I'm fine.

816
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,630
I will take a nap

817
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,590
at the holding area later on.

818
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,980
Whereas you

819
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,020
also got to find time

820
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,060
and take a rest.

821
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,700
Maybe tonight's competition,

822
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,900
I will see Teacher Luo

823
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,940
and you doing the commenting.

824
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,460
Fighting.

825
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,340
Get going.

826
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,940
Bye bye.

827
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,640
Teacher Luo

828
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,560
just now in the show

829
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,640
luckily you react fast

830
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,240
if not,

831
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,440
I might say something wrong.

832
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
Your performance

833
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,920
is not too bad

834
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,800
but

835
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,600
got to work on

836
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
your professional knowledge.

837
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,100
Teacher Luo,

838
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,900
Qiu Ying,

839
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,700
why did you just came?

840
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,100
Teacher Luo have waited half day for you.

841
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,820
Do you know the show

842
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,780
almost couldn't go on?

843
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,100
Teacher Luo,

844
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,140
sorry.

845
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,700
I have something on.

846
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,260
Don't say sorry to me.

847
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,260
Is your sorry

848
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,260
so cheap?

849
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,700
Being late is my bad.

850
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,180
I must apologize.

851
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,220
Professional players

852
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,780
will participate in the competition even if they are sick

853
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,100
this is what we call

854
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,090
sportmanship.

855
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,970
Same goes for our commentators.

856
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,770
Being punctual is the basic principle.

857
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,570
Don't think that

858
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,930
you can be indulgent after winning.

859
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,610
You does not have the rights yet.

860
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,590
Teacher Luo,

861
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,430
I will never

862
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,590
be late again.

863
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,110
Qiu Ying.

864
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,270
From You Xing to GDVs,

865
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,150
your lazy attitude to work

866
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,110
has never change.

867
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,350
Luckily

868
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,510
I am here today

869
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,550
to replace you for the show

870
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,710
if not,

871
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,030
there will really be problem

872
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,230
with this show.

873
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,470
You replaced me?

874
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,350
Yes.

875
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,550
You Xing and GDV

876
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,870
have a collaboration

877
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,870
so

878
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,870
from today onwards,

879
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,230
I will also be GDV's

880
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,470
intern commentator.

881
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,660
Xiao Zheng.

882
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,260
Teacher Luo.

883
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,980
You will be in charge of Qiu Ying

884
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,260
start from familiarizing the place

885
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,460
and setting up the set.

886
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,520
You can slowly pass on

887
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,680
whatever logistic stuff you have.

888
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,920
I will go back to the office first.

889
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,790
Teacher Xiao Zheng,

890
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,750
in the future,

891
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,390
if I have anything that's not sure

892
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,030
please help me along.

893
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,220
From Luo Tian's new partner

894
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,380
to becoming a member in the logistic team with me

895
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,260
what is all these about?

896
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,420
Let's go.

897
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,620
The competition is starting soon.

898
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,330
After so many competitions,

899
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,610
VNG's main member

900
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,290
Qi Yue,

901
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,570
can say is quite popular

902
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,610
and most likely

903
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,730
will become the MVP

904
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,050
of this seaon match.

905
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,680
Based on my understanding,

906
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,680
Qi Yue's

907
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,960
attack value for every match is 4.8,

908
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,600
every minute's economy

909
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,640
is 518.

910
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,400
While every minutes experience points

911
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,560
is 521.

912
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,390
It's a very good figure.

913
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,630
So let's

914
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,550
look forward to

915
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,030
his performance.

916
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,070
Let's continue to see

917
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,270
the two team's...

918
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,660
Okay,

919
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,700
your performance today is very good.

920
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,180
Fighting.

921
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,460
I got to go, see you tomorrow.

922
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,900
Teacher Xiao Zheng bye bye.

923
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,410
Why

924
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,610
didn't you explain to Teacher Luo

925
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,970
why you are late?

926
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,690
No matter you explain or not

927
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,610
it's stil the same.

928
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,400
It's my fault that I'm late.

929
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,680
Also,

930
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,640
my professional basics are not strong,

931
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,860
if I'm on the stage,

932
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,500
I might make a bigger fool out of myself.

933
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,900
Since I'm in GDV,

934
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,820
I'm not worry that there's no chance.

935
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,740
Don't worry.

936
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,540
I will adjust myself.

937
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,100
I know.

938
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,900
You are the cockroach that never dies

939
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,740
but you are also not

940
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,900
iron woman.

941
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,660
Don't shoulder everything by yourself.

942
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,490
But I really

943
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,250
doesn't want to create burden for others.

944
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,170
Because of me,

945
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,950
Xia Ling is still lying in the hospital.

946
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,030
Actually today outside the emergency room,

947
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,070
my whole head is all about

948
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,110
the images of us when we were young.

949
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,910
In my heart,

950
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,990
he is already

951
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,390
my brother.

952
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,310
But these few years,

953
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,900
I will scold him whenever he came to look for me.

954
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,820
The better he is to me,

955
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,140
the angrier I am.

956
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,660
The more I don't want to care about him.

957
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,300
You say

958
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,520
why am I so cold hearted,

959
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,440
so vicious.

960
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
Fool,

961
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,000
do not under estimate yourself.

962
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,280
You are the

963
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,960
strongest,

964
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,080
kindest,

965
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,800
cutest person I ever met.

966
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,950
Stop crying.

967
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,700
Dad, look how well my sister said.

968
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,500
A lot of people recoginize my sister

969
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,020
and all support her.

970
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,660
Dad,

971
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,780
this incident

972
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,130
is really not my sister's fault.

973
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,970
And my sister is so great,

974
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,370
I'm really proud of her.

975
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,050
Sister,

976
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,410
when did you came?

977
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,570
I just came.

978
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,210
Oh ya,

979
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,770
brought a lot of food for you.

980
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,410
It's all your favourite snacks.

981
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,530
Give it to me.

982
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
You two talk.

983
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
I go

984
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,200
and get some water.

985
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,950
Come,

986
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,070
let's see what's there to eat.

987
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,270
I remember

988
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,710
this is all your favourite.

989
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
Come, quick

990
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,780
eat it.

991
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,060
Is the injuries better?

992
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,300
Is it still pain?

993
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,690
I'm fine.

994
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,170
I'm a sport student.

995
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,850
These injuries are nothing much to me.

996
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,370
It won't affect the tournament.

997
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,520
Also,

998
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
there's so many good food,

999
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,360
who cares about the pain.

1000
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,040
You must listen to the doctor,

1001
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,060
don't panic,

1002
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,060
rest well.

1003
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,860
When you are having a match next time,

1004
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,340
remember to tell me earlier,

1005
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,940
I will ask all my friends to go

1006
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,380
and be your family and friends supporters.

1007
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,580
Family and friends supporter?

1008
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,730
You are silly?

1009
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,650
Sister,

1010
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,490
don't worry too much for me.

1011
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,210
You just enter GDV,

1012
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,990
you must be very busy.

1013
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,510
My classmates ask me

1014
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,950
when my sister

1015
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,350
will be partnering with Luo Tian.

1016
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,630
I told them

1017
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,590
it's anytime.

1018
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,230
My sister is the best.

1019
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,470
Sister,

1020
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,950
I'm really proud of you.

1021
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,790
For your words,

1022
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,030
I must really fight for it.

1023
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,950
I couldn't let my

1024
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,740
brother

1025
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,940
throw face in front of his friends.

1026
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,830
Are you going?

1027
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,390
You accompanied the whole night yesterday

1028
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,900
and donated blood,

1029
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,260
it's indeed time to go back and rest.

1030
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,460
Get going.

1031
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,810
Ying Zi,

1032
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,290
Xia Ling's accident is not your fault.

1033
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,360
What did the doctor say

1034
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,400
about brother's injuries?

1035
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,840
Say is to observe,

1036
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,480
shouldn't be a big problem.

1037
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,310
Why didn't you accept

1038
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,430
the money that's transferred to you via wechat?

1039
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,990
That's your allowance.

1040
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,940
Accept it.

1041
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,340
Go.

1042
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,340
The doors are closing any time later.

1043
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,060
Your competition video,

1044
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,780
send it to me.

1045
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,540
The one where you won.

1046
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,740
Please enjoy it.

1047
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,820
Okay, thank you.

1048
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,860
Hello.

1049
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,060
Why are you free

1050
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,060
to come here?

1051
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,460
Why?

1052
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,780
You don't welcome me?

1053
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,500
I didn't have a proper farewell with everyone

1054
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,370
after the Next Star competition.

1055
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,370
You came at the wrong timing,

1056
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,330
Brother Summer is not around.

1057
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,270
It's okay.

1058
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,590
You are around.

1059
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,630
I'm not good at

1060
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,830
conveying message.

1061
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,110
Afterall,

1062
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,550
we used to be colleagues,

1063
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,390
must you be so cold hearted?

1064
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,270
Brother Summer will be very happy

1065
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,430
if he knows you are here.

1066
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,860
Actually I came today

1067
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,100
to have a

1068
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,500
good farewell with everyone

1069
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,600
and also thank everyone

1070
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,640
for the care.

1071
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
But I'm sure I will come here often.

1072
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,960
I really like this place.

1073
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,160
Do you want a cup of coffee?

1074
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,360
Okay.

1075
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,440
Seriously after so long,

1076
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,080
I have not tasted

1077
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,240
your coffee.

1078
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,440
Just nice,

1079
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,280
I invented a new item.

1080
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,310
You will be my guinea pig then.

1081
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:49,850
Teacher Luo.

1082
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,410
Training materials.

1083
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,770
Thank you Teacher Luo.

1084
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,070
Oh My.

1085
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,510
Teacher Luo's notebook as my

1086
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,710
training material.

1087
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,460
Teacher Luo,

1088
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,460
did you regret?

1089
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,220
There's a competition today,

1090
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,980
you go and help out at the set.

1091
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,220
Remember,

1092
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,580
listen and learn.

1093
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,140
Yes.

1094
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,570
What's going on?

1095
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,290
It's just one night

1096
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,810
and Teacher Luo's attitude

1097
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,890
to me has a 180 degree change.

1098
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,620
Since you have already accept Qiu Ying as disciple,

1099
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,620
why didn't you listen

1100
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,500
to her reason for being late?

1101
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,860
Since when did I say

1102
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,700
she is my disciple?

1103
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,420
If it's not disciple,

1104
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,660
would you teach her?

1105
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,300
If it's not for the love of talent,

1106
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,980
would you scold her

1107
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,140
because of a few supporting post?

1108
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,780
Will you give her your vote

1109
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,820
under the pressure of CEO Guo?

1110
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,780
Can this be her reason

1111
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,820
for being late?

1112
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,740
Commenting stage is a

1113
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,340
place which does not allow any disrespects.

1114
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,770
On this matter,

1115
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,650
if you really want

1116
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,650
to help her,

1117
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,290
then this is the end

1118
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,730
of our friendship.

1119
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,290
The supportive post are posted by her brother.

1120
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,670
Because of this,

1121
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,310
Qiu Ying blamed him.

1122
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:42,910
In the end, he went all over

1123
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,830
to help Qiu Ying get votes.

1124
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,190
In the end,

1125
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,710
he got into a car accident.

1126
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,550
Qiu Ying is very guilty

1127
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,270
and stayed in the hospital the whole night

1128
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,110
and even donated blood to her brother.

1129
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,470
She went back to the office

1130
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,830
once her brother is out of danger

1131
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,430
but she's still late.

1132
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:02,670
Qiu Ying knows that

1133
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,030
you don't like to listen to explanations.

1134
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,470
So no matter if its supportive post,

1135
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,070
or her lateness,

1136
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,750
she didn't explain

1137
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,150
anything for herself.

1138
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,580
Teacher Luo,

1139
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,540
she only has passion for commenting,

1140
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,980
does not have disrespectful.

1141
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:04,890
Darling,

1142
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:05,810
you have entered GDV,

1143
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,130
When can we announce that we are together?

1144
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,850
We are in the company.

1145
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,250
I just bcame

1146
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,290
Luo Tian's new partner.

1147
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,770
If anyone found out,

1148
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,130
the impact is not very good.

1149
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,770
We are

1150
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,370
dating legally,

1151
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,450
what's there for people to say?

1152
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,400
You Xing and GDV

1153
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,760
just collaborated

1154
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,960
and they want

1155
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,640
me to be the first female commentator.

1156
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,880
For this,

1157
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,200
I promise CEO Liu that

1158
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,320
I will not be in relationship

1159
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:31,470
to avoid any

1160
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,750
disadvantages

1161
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,230
and to portray my professional image

1162
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,270
in front of the audiences.

1163
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,350
You are a commentator,

1164
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,700
not idol star,

1165
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,260
why is there so many concern

1166
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,260
just for dating?

1167
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:42,700
Futhermore,

1168
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,700
you are dating with

1169
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,460
a professional player,

1170
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,460
this will help your

1171
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,700
situation right?

1172
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,100
Commentators depends on profession.

1173
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,300
Popularity

1174
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,380
is not enough.

1175
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,460
Furthermore,

1176
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,740
if we expose

1177
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,460
our relationship,

1178
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,620
I couldn't join any competition

1179
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,340
with you in it.

1180
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,730
People will say its

1181
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,330
favouritism.

1182
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,050
You doesn't want this to happen too

1183
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,050
right?

1184
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,530
For your career,

1185
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,690
I shall wait a while more.

1186
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,490
Give me a hug.
