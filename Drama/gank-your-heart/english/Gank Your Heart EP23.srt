[Episode 23]

3
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,300
Qiu Ying.

4
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,540
Ah Xuan.

5
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,690
Pei Xi.

6
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,010
Qiu Ying,

7
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,370
my Brother told me to tell you,

8
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,650
visit him when you're free.

9
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,730
Never have I thought,

10
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,650
Pei Xi got cheated on for so long.

11
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,070
This Qiao Xin is a little overboard.

12
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,950
You...

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,870
Why are you looking at me like this?

14
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,510
Nothing.

15
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,350
I'll get going, bye.

16
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,070
Pei Xi still has a competition today,

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,270
What's there to see, go on in.

18
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,630
do I tell him or not?

19
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,750
Let me tell you,

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,270
that's my Brother Kong woman.

21
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,350
Don't even think about it.

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,350
Forget it,

23
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,630
it's none of my business anyway.

24
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,820
But Pei Xi is my friend.

25
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,540
Furthermore,

26
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,800
he even helped me a lot.

27
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
No way,

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm making this my business.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
Pei Xi.

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
What is it?

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,950
Just right,

33
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,590
I have something to tell you too.

34
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,140
How arrogant.

35
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
Brother Kong,

36
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,820
someone's sabotaging.

37
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,570
You'll say first.

38
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,210
Pei Xi.

39
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,570
Actually, I want to tell you

40
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,170
there's no right or wrong in love.

41
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,170
Sometimes,

42
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,810
you've to turn back if you realise

43
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,290
you're walking the wrong way.

44
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,280
You've to let go in time if you realise

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
you've been loving the wrong person.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,360
I mean,

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,000
some things

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,750
will not belong to you no matter

49
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,510
how much you like it.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,310
You have to learn

51
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,750
to give up on some

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,270
people no matter how reluctant you are.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,500
Are you sure

54
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,660
you want to be a professional

55
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,700
commentator instead of a relationship advisor?

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,260
Speak your mind.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
I'll say it then.

58
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,460
That is

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,580
your Girlfriend...

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,530
My Girlfriend?

61
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,250
Your Girlfriend...

62
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,970
That...

63
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,840
You know it.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
I don't have a Girlfriend.

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't have a Girlfriend?

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,240
You broke up with Qiao Xin already?

67
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I'll repeat myself again,

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,220
I don't have a Girlfriend.

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,620
Is Ji Xiang Kong and you

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
together?

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,700
No...

72
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,140
No.

73
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,700
That's good.

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,540
If there's anything next time,

75
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,780
don't go looking for him.

76
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,980
Come look for me instead.

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,780
What do you mean?

78
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,570
Aren't you caring? He's already confessing.

79
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,170
Xiang Kong.

80
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,010
You heard what I said

81
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,790
just now?

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,670
I heard everything

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,470
I should and shouldn't hear

84
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,230
but let me advise you,

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,110
better put your focus on the competition.

86
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,910
We, We Teng is catching up

87
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,270
on your team, Legends.

88
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,150
It's only interesting that way.

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,550
Oh,

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,350
a word of advise to you.

91
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,270
Be careful of Qi Yue,

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,910
he gets a over-confident easily.

93
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,350
Thanks for the reminder.

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Welcome.

95
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,940
Is Brother Kong handsome when he's jealous?

96
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Lin Yi Xuan, talking about you.

97
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,040
What's wrong with you recently?

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Do you still want to compete?

99
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,520
Not too hard.

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
You're not on par with Tong Wu,

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
support is not on par with Qi Yue.

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,080
-Son.            - Mother.

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,960
Are you feeling better today?

104
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,550
Why did she bring so

105
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,270
many things here?

106
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,310
For his Dad to see?

107
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,390
Mother,

108
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,270
don't say that of my Sister.

109
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,910
She send them

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,950
here out of good will.

111
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,940
Good will?

112
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,420
She caused you leg

113
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,580
to be like this out of good will?

114
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,460
After so many years,

115
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,220
did she ever give me a decent attitude?

116
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,180
Let alone call me by Mother,

117
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,700
she has never call me by Auntie before.

118
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,730
Mother,

119
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,210
let bygones be bygones.

120
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,810
Don't mention the past.

121
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,050
Don't say that of my Sister.

122
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,210
Also,

123
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,250
this has nothing to do with Sister.

124
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,770
I injured myself on accident.

125
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,490
Mother,

126
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,570
it's basketball tournament next month.

127
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,810
When can I be

128
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,010
discharged from the hospital?

129
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,720
Son,

130
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,360
100 days if you hurt your bone and muscles.

131
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
Just focus on recovering.

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,840
I've applied medical leave for you.

133
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,200
The coach said

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,150
you can go back once you recover.

135
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,310
Classmates are already entering

136
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,550
the national teams yet I'm still here.

137
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
How long do I need to recover?

138
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,870
Don't be anxious, focus on recovering.

139
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,740
Family of Xia Ling,

140
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,580
Doctor Zhang wants to see you.

141
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,420
Coming.

142
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,020
I'll be back soon.

143
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,730
In here.

144
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,770
Okay, thank you.

145
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,890
Comparing this two photos,

146
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,170
there's a very obvious bump here.

147
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,000
Lao Qiu.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Hello.

149
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,960
I invite you here today

150
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
is to talk about

151
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
Xia Ling's condition.

152
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,780
After observing his intracranial,

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,260
there's no after-effects

154
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,220
but

155
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,940
his leg area is not just a simple

156
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,300
bone fracture.

157
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,620
You see,

158
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,540
his common peroneal nerve

159
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
is already damaged.

160
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,500
Is...

161
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,860
Is such situation curable?

162
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,260
It's definitely curable

163
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,220
but

164
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,340
there'll be limitations to

165
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,340
any ankle activities.

166
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,100
Doctor,

167
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,180
What does limitations to

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,380
any ankle activities means?

169
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,100
Such as walking

170
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,970
or working, there'll

171
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,330
be certain effect.

172
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,610
This...

173
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,610
Doctor,

174
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,330
will I still be able to play basketball?

175
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,760
Doctor,

176
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,990
I just want to know

177
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,830
if I'm still

178
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,150
able to play basketball.

179
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,830
I afraid not.

180
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,630
The common peroneal nerve is very fragile.

181
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,190
Even if it recovers,

182
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,710
it may cause the foot to droop.

183
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,710
Strenous activites are not possible.

184
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,310
Thank you, Doctor.

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,430
This is fun.

186
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,950
Qiu Ying,

187
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,790
come over quickly.

188
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,950
Let you see something fun.

189
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,750
Qiu Ying.

190
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,100
What is she up to?

191
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,570
Qiu Ying.

192
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,090
You scared me to death.

193
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,090
You ignored me first.

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
I called you many times.

195
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
What are you thinking? Ignoring me.

196
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
I can't hear you since

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm on headphones.

198
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,960
What are you looking at?

199
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,320
Commentary.

200
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,470
It's already 2am, what soup are you boiling?

201
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,750
I'll turn it off for you.

202
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,590
Stop.

203
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,390
Don't touch it.

204
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,110
Yi Yi, don't off it.

205
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,340
Pigeon soup is only nutritious

206
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,380
when it has taste.

207
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,020
Xia Ling is really blissful,

208
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,340
It'd be nice if I were

209
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,220
to have such a good Sister

210
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,140
like you.

211
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,580
Having a Brother like Xia Ling

212
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,540
seems nice too.

213
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,020
You're boiling soup and watching

214
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,610
competition videos at the same time,

215
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,970
so hardworking.

216
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,530
That Luo Tian

217
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,050
wouldn't even allow you to be at the analyzing table.

218
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,650
Why do you work so hard for?

219
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,320
Sctually,

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,560
it's good that he didn't allow me to be

221
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,320
at the analyzing table.

222
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
My reserve knowledge now

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,480
isn't enough.

224
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,080
It's not a bad to use the

225
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,880
time now to learn more,

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,060
right?

227
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,100
That's true.

228
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,340
Xia Ling.

229
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,860
Sister.

230
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,300
I bought you pigeon soup.

231
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,210
Why are you so free to visit me today?

232
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,930
There's no competition today.

233
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:02,890
You?

234
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,050
How's recovery?

235
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,950
Not bad.

236
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,710
I'll be going to the rehabilitation room later.

237
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,470
I'll accompany you.

238
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,230
No need to.

239
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:13,990
Sister, you burn

240
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,430
the midnight oil again right?

241
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,950
Your dark eye circles are heavy.

242
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,990
I'm fine.

243
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,310
Drink the pigeon soup while it's hot,

244
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
it won't be nice if it's cold.

245
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,030
Sister,

246
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,190
you're pretty busy.

247
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,430
Next time,

248
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,710
you don't have to visit me so often.

249
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,140
Xia Ling,

250
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,020
do you

251
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,460
have something on your mind today?

252
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,060
You're acting weird.

253
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,320
No,

254
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,920
I'm just a little tired.

255
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
You should head back,

256
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,320
I want to rest now.

257
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll help you.

258
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,880
Be careful of your leg.

259
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
You rest well,

260
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,660
I'll visit you again.

261
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,140
Remember to eat it when it's hot.

262
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,540
Captain,

263
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,660
still not leaving?

264
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,420
You're looking at

265
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,020
Handsome Ji's notebook?

266
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:28,930
In the entire Autumn game,

267
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,730
Wei Teng Double Moon team's performance

268
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,810
is really strong.

269
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,330
I'm looking through Ji Xiang Kong's notebook

270
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,290
to see if there's

271
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,400
any inspiration.

272
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
Do you still remember

273
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,880
when we were against Wei Teng previously,

274
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Coach Luo used Handsome Ji's method

275
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,920
against Wei Teng.

276
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,840
In the end,

277
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,760
Handsome Ji

278
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,080
managed to counterattack.

279
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
He know us too well.

280
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,220
In another words,

281
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,060
you guys know him well too.

282
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,820
What do you mean?

283
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,020
Let him have a taste

284
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,460
if his own medicine.

285
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,660
Your understanding towards him

286
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,220
is our greatest weapon.

287
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,510
Where's Qi Yue?

288
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,990
His Mother from Taipei came to visit him.

289
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,710
He's with his Mother.

290
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,350
He asked me to take leave from him.

291
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,790
Why don't he tell me himself?

292
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,670
Maybe he's too busy,

293
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,750
didn't have the time to.

294
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,790
The four of us

295
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,830
practice 2v2 first.

296
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Qi Yue and Qiao Xin?

297
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't know, maybe after a few days.

298
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
Tell me wherever you go.

299
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Your turn.

300
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,960
Hurry, we'll be seen like this.

301
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,190
Hurry in.

302
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,910
Be obedient.

303
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,870
Bye.

304
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,130
Let's have a short

305
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,570
and simple meeting.

306
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,490
We're up against Xin Tu this afternoon,

307
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,610
the few of you

308
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,370
have to win

309
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,450
this match.

310
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,730
After winning this match,

311
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,050
we can enter the semi-finals

312
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,050
as number 1 in results.

313
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,400
This way, we'll have

314
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,440
priority to choose sides,

315
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,400
allowing us to take

316
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
initiative during selection.

317
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,520
Most importantly.

318
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,800
we have to win this match

319
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,710
to break Legends record of 10 consecutive

320
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,590
wins last year.

321
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,070
Master,

322
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,070
Sister Wen,

323
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,230
with us around, you don't have to worry.

324
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,990
This record will be broken tonight.

325
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,270
From then on,

326
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,980
I want Legends

327
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,260
to call us big Brother.

328
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,100
What's wrong, Qi Yue?

329
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,380
Didn't rest well last night?

330
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
No, my Mother came from Taipei

331
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,180
to visit me yesterday. Then,

332
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,500
I accompanied her the whole day

333
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,970
so I'm a little tired.

334
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,890
Youhaven't been home so some time.

335
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,730
Spend some time with

336
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,090
with your family when you're free.

337
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,210
Master,

338
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,170
it will definitely

339
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,410
not affect the match later.

340
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
There's holiday before the semi-finals.

341
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,760
By then, you can go back

342
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,960
and spend some time with them.

343
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
Thank you, Sister Wen,

344
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,460
Qi Yue,

345
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,020
you did not particpate in the training yesterday.

346
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,060
We made some changes

347
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,940
for the tactics.

348
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,180
Xin Tu's ace player, Cheng Chen

349
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,300
output are really

350
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,660
explosive these few rounds

351
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,580
so...

352
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,900
Cheng Chen...

353
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,620
I've played against him many times,

354
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,380
he's not that strong.

355
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,220
Needless for you to say,

356
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,660
I'll defeat him later.

357
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,900
Okay.

358
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Another matter.

359
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,420
All of you shouldn't forget

360
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,300
what day is today.

361
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,740
We remember.

362
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,260
It's Sister Wen's birthday.

363
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,170
To think that you guys remember.

364
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,490
It's too busy recently,

365
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,690
we'll celebrate later

366
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,210
after the match.

367
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,110
Master has already prepared the gift.

368
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,990
Enough said.

369
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,670
Winning the competition

370
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,990
is the best birthday gift to me.

371
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,790
Are you all confident?

372
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,150
Yes.

373
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,310
What are you taking notes of?

374
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,510
I'm taking notes of

375
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,150
the keypoints when Wei Teng

376
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,270
is against Xin Tu.

377
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,350
What main points are there?

378
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,990
Tell us about it.

379
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,340
Actually,

380
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,420
every team

381
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,580
has their own style

382
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,500
and way of playing.

383
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,460
When to attack,

384
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,220
attack under what situation,

385
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,920
when to attack the dragon,

386
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,920
should you attack the dragon when you're at a disadvantage.

387
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,280
After knowing

388
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
these few main points,

389
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
it'll help a lot in my commentary

390
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
next time.

391
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,280
I remember

392
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
Xin Tu's habit is to

393
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,200
snatch the dragon at the start,

394
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,880
getting the advantage in earlier stage.

395
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,520
As for Wei teng,

396
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,830
the way they play is everchanging.

397
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,710
It makes their opponent

398
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,270
show their weakness very easily.

399
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,350
My goodness,

400
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,700
Qi Yue is very aggresive in this match.

401
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,100
They are in chaos now.

402
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
Luckily, Ji Xiang Kong arrives in the nick of time.

403
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,620
It depends on this wave of teamwork now.

404
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,690
Although this operation is risky

405
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,410
but it's worth it for the result.

406
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,290
Don't just see it as snatching the dragon

407
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,010
but to conservative teams

408
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,410
like Xin Tu,

409
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,410
it's considered a deadly blow.

410
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,330
Let me have a look at your notebook.

411
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,850
Okay.

412
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,040
So full.

413
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
You take note of every match?

414
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Qiu Ying,

415
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,910
I thought you only

416
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,790
did it for show,

417
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,590
who knows you're

418
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,150
actually hardworking.

419
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,390
Seems like

420
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,350
you're more qualified

421
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,870
to be on the analyzing table than Qiao Xin.

422
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,380
They won.

423
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,900
That's awesome.

424
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,100
Where to go?

425
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,620
Start an attack in the middle.

426
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,940
Steady, okay.

427
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,300
Give skill.

428
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,570
Push.

429
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,570
Continue pushing him.

430
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,810
Okay, push.

431
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,610
Nice one.

432
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,050
Minions.

433
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,450
Today,

434
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,130
Wei Teng held a new record

435
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,160
in Iconquer with

436
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
11 consecutive wins.

437
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,400
in short, they're against the wind.

438
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,560
Let us see

439
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,400
who's the MVP?

440
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,240
Qi Yue!

441
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,420
11 consecutive wins,

442
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,860
MVP for 20 rounds.

443
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,300
He has already surpass Pei Xi

444
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,940
in this season.

445
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,860
The first

446
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,260
well-deserved MVP.

447
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,060
Let us congratulate Qi Yue.

448
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,620
We're back.

449
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,020
Not bad, Qi Yue.

450
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,220
You're worthy to be my disciple.

451
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,980
Small matter.

452
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,260
30 consecutive wins also not a problem.

453
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,900
Xiang Kong,

454
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,020
you've worked hard.

455
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,260
No, Sister Wen.

456
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,420
It's the result of

457
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,340
everybody's hard work.

458
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,420
Enough,

459
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,300
I've already

460
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,300
arranged the place to eat.

461
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,540
You guys bring Sister Wen over first.

462
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,660
Aren't you going?

463
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,660
Okay,

464
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,530
let us go get ready.

465
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,130
Let's go.

466
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,130
Let's go.

467
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250
Let'go, we'll go first.

468
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,410
Hurry.

469
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,430
Happy birthday,

470
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,350
Brother Yi.

471
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,950
Li Gan,

472
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,590
what are you doing here?

473
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,910
Cogratulations to Wei Teng today.

474
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,350
Oh,

475
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,980
it's Shu Wen's birthday today.

476
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,580
You still remember right?

477
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,700
What a great day.

478
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,820
I organized a

479
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,300
birthday party to celebrate.

480
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,860
I was wondering if

481
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,320
you'd like to come.

482
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm

483
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
held up here.

484
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,720
Xia Tian ans Luo Tian will be going too.

485
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,040
I know you usually

486
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,320
might not like going to events

487
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,240
with many people

488
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,000
so

489
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,320
I came personally to invite you.

490
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,400
There's only me here,

491
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,000
I really came leave.

492
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,190
Brother Yi,

493
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,070
Shu Wen has always been

494
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,510
trying to find opportunities

495
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,830
to bring our team

496
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,710
together again.

497
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,470
I'm thinking

498
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,670
of making use of her birthday

499
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,580
to fulfil this wish of hers.

500
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,740
Yes,

501
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,420
she also said

502
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,340
you have credits

503
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,940
that Wei Teng is able to

504
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,020
get such results today.

505
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,820
Brother Yi, just go.

506
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,290
Let us have a good gathering.

507
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,690
I really can't go.

508
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,490
Brother Yi,

509
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,890
it's been so many years.

510
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,520
Aren't you over it yet?

511
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,630
Happy birthday.

512
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,620
Happy birthday.

513
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
I was about to drop both of you a text.

514
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,980
Here.

515
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,900
Come, have a seat.

516
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,060
The birthday girl is indeed different.

517
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,700
The birthday girl seems a ittle young.

518
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Why don't I usually see you?

519
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,300
You're good at talking.

520
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,980
There's no need for introduction.

521
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,660
Hello, teachers.

522
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,780
Hello.

523
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,980
Today's match is not bad.

524
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,450
Pretty interesting.

525
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,330
It's mainly because captain's tactics are good.

526
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,410
There's nothing to do with captain.

527
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,370
I think it's because the coach is good.

528
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,490
The fw of you have to cherish these praises.

529
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,760
These two teachers

530
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,640
don't compliment people easily.

531
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,640
It's really not bad.

532
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,680
They're almost like how we were then.

533
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,960
Pour the wine, quick.

534
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,900
Yes.

535
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Xiang Kong, help me pour some.

536
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,740
Where's Li Gan?

537
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,700
Where's he after

538
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,540
calling us over?

539
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,180
Probably preparing Sister Wen's gift.

540
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,860
Not too much.

541
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,500
Not too much.

542
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,300
Your tolerance level for alcohol is low.

543
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,060
Come, I'll make you drink up the next time.

544
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,780
He's here.

545
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,740
Brother Sun.

546
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,740
Happt birthday.

547
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,100
Thank you.

548
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,890
Okay, don't just stand there.

549
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,730
Have a seat.

550
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,210
Over here.

551
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,330
Sit here.

552
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:23,970
Long time no see, Brother Yi.

553
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,090
It's really not easy inviting you.

554
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,770
Hurry,

555
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,010
let's all sit.

556
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,330
Okay.

557
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,430
Li Gan,

558
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,430
you sit too.

559
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,790
I'll go prepare.

560
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,870
How is it at the shop now?

561
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,070
Is business okay?

562
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,910
As usual.

563
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,950
Gu Fang is not here today.

564
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,910
If Gu Fang were to come,

565
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,910
the five of us

566
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,070
are together again.

567
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,190
Enough said,

568
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,990
drink up.

569
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,830
Here, Ji Xiang Kong.

570
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,830
Come.

571
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,590
Like you.

572
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,740
Like you.

573
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,640
Happy birthday to you.

574
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Happy birthday to you.

575
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Happy birthday to you.

576
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,520
Happy birthday to you.

577
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,310
I hope that

578
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,350
everyone here

579
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,700
is able to fulfil their own wish.

580
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,580
Happy birthday.

581
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,610
Say yes!

582
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,490
Say yes!

583
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,210
Say yes.

584
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,480
Shu Wen,

585
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,720
just say yes.

586
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,870
Li Gan,

587
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,990
I can't accept such a

588
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,220
valuable gift from you.

589
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,020
Let's just

590
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
put all our focus on

591
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,220
the competition.

592
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,740
Didn't we agree to

593
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,370
ge tthe world's champion together?

594
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,170
I like

595
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,210
everything you've done

596
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,370
for me today.

597
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,770
Thank you.

598
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,800
Sister Wen,

599
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
both matters aren't clashing.

600
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,340
Okay,

601
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,380
I'll personally put

602
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,260
this ring on for you when we

603
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,300
get the world champion.

604
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,860
Here, let's drink.

605
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,700
Come.

606
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,860
Hurry.

607
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,060
come, let's drink up.

608
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,780
Here, Brother Yi.

609
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,110
Talking about you,

610
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,190
do you have to do things to the extreme?

611
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,830
Don't you know

612
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,190
Shu Wen's temper?

613
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,030
I wonder...

614
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,310
I'm wonder

615
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,990
where do I

616
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,190
stand in her heart.

617
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,510
If you want to proof

618
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,030
where do you stand in her heart,

619
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,470
there's many other ways.

620
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,910
Why do you have to invite her

621
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,110
ex-Boyfriend there?

622
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,020
She couldn't forget about Brother Yi.

623
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,780
Enough said.

624
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,980
Shu Wen rejected you

625
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,180
is not entirely because of Brother Yi.

626
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,680
They've broke up for many years.

627
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,320
If it's not for

628
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Ji Xiang Kong to go to Wei Teng,

629
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,920
both of them wouldn't even meet.

630
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,960
You think too much, Brother.

631
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,040
It's been so many years,

632
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,520
you guys can see

633
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
how I feel towards Shu Wen.

634
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,510
We all know.

635
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,710
We know it very well.

636
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,470
Shu Wen understands it too.

637
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,230
Understand?

638
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,390
No,

639
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
she doesn't.

640
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,220
Enough, don't drink so much.

641
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
A few years ago,

642
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,010
I gave up the invitation

643
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,610
from an America Team

644
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,730
because of her.

645
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,450
I stayed...

646
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,010
Empty-handed...

647
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,370
To start

648
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,610
up Wei Teng with her from the scratch.

649
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,370
In Wei Teng,

650
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,370
whatever she say counts.

651
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,490
Let me tell you,

652
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,650
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me.

653
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,680
I, Li Gan,

654
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,560
Boss of Wei Teng,

655
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,160
has no stand in the team.

656
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Not even the slightest bit.

657
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,040
No.

658
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,990
Shu Wen said to let Ji Xiang Kong

659
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,470
be the captain.

660
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,190
Do you know how

661
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,350
the sponsers

662
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,310
give me, no.

663
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,150
Give us

664
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,740
how much stress?

665
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,380
Who's shouldering it?

666
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,300
Me.

667
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,620
How I feel towards Shu Wen,

668
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,860
how much I've contributed

669
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,970
to her and Wei Teng

670
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,690
is nothing compare to Brother Yi.

671
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,330
Come.

672
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,250
I'll drink with you.

673
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,980
Brother Sun,

674
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,780
I never thought that

675
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,620
Sister Wen will do that today.

676
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,140
Brother Sun,

677
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,060
actually...

678
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,260
I never believed that

679
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,220
you're a coward then.

680
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,660
Why did you leave Kai Tuo Zhe?

681
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,140
Why did you leave Sister Wen?

682
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,780
I mean,

683
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,620
do you have

684
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,940
something that's unspeakable of?

685
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,010
It's all in the past,

686
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,330
why mention it?

687
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,470
But I think

688
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,950
Sister Wen still has you in her heart.

689
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,710
How is it possible?

690
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,390
How is it not?

691
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,390
Anyway, I think

692
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,830
Sister Wen doesn't like Li Gan.

693
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,470
Furthermore,

694
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,590
don't you want to woo her back?

695
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,430
Remember what I told you before,

696
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,150
Time

697
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,390
is able to change everything.

698
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,470
Shu Wen and I

699
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,620
are in the past.

700
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,660
Don't just talk about me.

701
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,580
How's you and Miya?

702
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,680
You said it just now,

703
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,880
time will change everything.

704
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,240
Miya left for so many years

705
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,360
and you've always miss her.

706
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,080
She's finally back

707
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
yet you...

708
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,640
Can't be that you really

709
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
like that girl, Qiu Ying?

710
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,160
Seems like you're admitting to it.

711
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,550
Just do your best and chase her.

712
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,390
Don't avoid it.

713
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,030
Don't allow Xia Tian's

714
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,670
cousin to chase her away.

715
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,540
No,

716
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,860
how do you know about this?

717
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,660
Did Brother Xia Tian

718
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,700
tell you something?

719
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,420
Pei Xi is being serious.

720
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,650
Yi Xuan told me some on accident.

721
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,170
I don't know if Pei Xi

722
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,090
is being serious or not

723
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,210
but

724
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,690
it's very obvious that you are.

725
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,090
Lin Yi Xuan, this lad.

726
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,560
What's happening?

727
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,440
We finally got a 10 days break

728
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,000
after 3 months of competition

729
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,150
but in the end?

730
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,150
Extra training.

731
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,190
I already agree to meet my friend.

732
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,990
In the end, I'm to come in here early in the morning.

733
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,390
Where's the rest?

734
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,820
There's only you and me today.

735
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,500
Just the both of us?

736
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,380
On what basis?

737
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,900
Finding fault with me.

738
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,860
I'm leaving.

739
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,380
I've applied extra training

740
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,460
for the both of you from Sister Wen.

741
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,460
Lu Sheng and Tong Wu aren't training.

742
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,410
All the more Brother Qi

743
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,490
doesn't have to.

744
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,570
He make the most mistakes.

745
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,290
I'm the MVP for every match,

746
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,450
where's the mistakes?

747
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,160
On the last match,

748
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
when we're snatching the dragon at 8 minute mark.

749
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,560
If it's not for Shen Yue's protection,

750
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,840
you'd be the the one that's killed.

751
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,000
At the 12 minute mark,

752
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,000
why didn't you listen to my command

753
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,840
and act on your own accord?

754
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,800
At 15 minute mark, if you had arrive

755
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,420
earlier durin gthe group attack,

756
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,100
we could've

757
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,140
ended the match then.

758
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,860
It's only small mistakes.

759
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,820
Furthermore,

760
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,580
Brother Qi's

761
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,780
Mother came all the way from

762
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,940
Taipei to see him.

763
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,260
It can be understandable even if

764
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
it's just small mistakes.

765
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,580
You know it yourself whether if you

766
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,300
accompanied your Mother or went on a date.

767
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,580
What date?

768
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,300
Ji Xiang Kong,

769
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,580
let me warn you, don't look

770
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,980
for trouble out of nothing.

771
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
You'll regret.

772
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,980
Go ahead if you want

773
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,690
to complain.

774
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,650
I don't care.

775
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:32,810
The Double Moon combi

776
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,970
is the tactic we thought of.

777
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,630
Your condition alongside with Shen Yue

778
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,670
is very important.

779
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,670
Qi Yue,

780
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,950
you came all the way

781
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,030
here to compete,

782
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,750
I believe the persistence you have for your dream.

783
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,830
It's now the peak of

784
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,670
your career,

785
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,110
you only have a year or two

786
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,350
to show your results.

787
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,950
Think through it carefully.

788
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,620
Xia Ling,

789
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,660
you're discharged?

790
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,020
-Why are you here again?          -Mother.

791
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,980
Mum, you get on the car first.

792
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,220
I have something to tell her.

793
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,080
What's there to talk to her about?

794
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,280
-Dad.          -Let's go.

795
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Just let them be.

796
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,560
What are you doing?

797
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,120
What's there to talk about?

798
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,440
Enough, get on.

799
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,960
Sister.

800
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,520
Xia Ling,

801
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,360
why didn't you

802
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
notify me on your discharge?

803
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
There's still rehabilitation training right?

804
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,440
I'll accompany you.

805
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,400
No need to.

806
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,800
Sister,

807
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,830
you see it too.

808
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,510
Mother's attitude to you is not good.

809
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,950
If we keep in contact,

810
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,910
conflicts can't be avoided.

811
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,270
Next time,

812
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,790
let's contact less.

813
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,300
Xia Ling,

814
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,740
is this what you want?

815
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,420
That's what I want.

816
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,580
I don't wish

817
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,580
to be caught in between.

818
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,380
Also,

819
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,050
you must be busy with work.

820
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,690
Don't have to get distracted because of me.

821
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,930
That's it, I'll get going.

822
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,440
Ying Zi,

823
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,560
don't be upset.

824
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Head back first.

825
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,870
Your Brother has us to take care of.

826
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,390
Go back.

827
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,060
Sister,

828
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
I'm sorry.

829
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
It's not that I don't

830
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,060
want to see you, I'm afraid you'll be

831
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,340
upset if you know that

832
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,740
my leg will never recover.

833
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,410
All thanks to

834
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,850
Teacher Ah Can's guidance

835
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,090
that lead to the me today.

836
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,200
Qiao Xin is really the most hardworking

837
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,560
female commentator I've ever met,

838
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
no among.

839
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,260
No,

840
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,940
these two are ridiculous, complimenting each other.

841
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,980
Out of all days, let's go

842
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,140
sing today.

843
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,660
Who was to go out with you?

844
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,380
Not free.

845
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,830
Excuse me,

846
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,750

847
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,550

You know me?

853
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,830
It's really you!

854
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,310

870
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,400
Brother Xuan, both of you are going to sing?

871
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,240

881
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,160
I think what is lad said is not bad.

882
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,880

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,510

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,150
Clocking off.

893
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
Bye.

894
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,380
You're not going?

895
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,180
I'll go your head.

896
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,130
Why do I go if you're not going? I..

897
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,090
Brother Xuan,

898
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,290
how can you just leave like that?

899
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,090
-I've already booked a room.          -Exactly.

900
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,010
So fast?

901
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,370
We can have a meal

902
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,250
before going to sing.

903
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,770
Let's go.

904
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,570
How about

905
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,130
another day? I know...

906
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:28,970
What another day?

907
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,050
Must be today.

908
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,970
Today.

909
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,850
Let's go.

910
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,730
The room is already booked.

911
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,770
I cam to look for Lu Yi Yi.

912
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,090
Let's go.

913
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,090
We'll leaving, hurry.

914
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,470
You,

915
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,750
a grown up man,

916
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,150
likes to drink milk tea?

917
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,670
Didn't you say you're going home?

918
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,750
Why are you here?

919
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,780
Can't be that you want to meet me coincidentally?

920
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,100
I...

921
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,620
I...

922
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,220
I was on the way.

923
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,540
Then?

924
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,740
I suddenly remember that I've left

925
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,420
Meng Lu Ren for so long

926
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,940
but have not visited them.

927
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,820
Do miss them a little.

928
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,460
So i just drop by to

929
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,020
buy some drinks over.

930
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,100
So our Qiu Ying

931
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,540
is someone

932
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,250
who treasure friendships.

933
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,570
Oh,

934
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,690
Pei Xi should be at

935
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,330
Meng Lu Ren at this hour,

936
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,200
it can't be that you want to see him?

937
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,240
Oh,

938
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,280
how's the both of you now?

939
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,880
What do you mean?

940
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you really thinks that

941
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,100
he was confessing to me the other time?

942
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,220
It's very obvious.

943
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,460
It's not.

944
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,540
This...

945
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,860
I just felt that

946
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,140
he only do so because

947
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,060
he was hurt in love,

948
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,100
he's mood is not good.

949
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,460
Hurt in love?

950
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,020
You know Qiao Xin and...

951
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,460
forget it, shall not explain.

952
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,380
Anyway he's not confessing to me.

953
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,700
You say

954
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,900
Pei Xi is knows Qiao Xin

955
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,410
is in a relationship with Qi Yue

956
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,450
so he...

957
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,570
You know about Qiao Xin and Qi Yue

958
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,890
underground relationship too?

959
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,230
I also know who was the one

960
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,630
going after you.

961
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,790
Not Pei Xi,

962
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,910
is Qi Yue.

963
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,230
Qi Yue?

964
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,910
Qi Yue hacked into Pei Xi's account.

965
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,030
Also, Pei Xi and Qiao Xin's relationship

966
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:30,830
is totally

967
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,430
a self-directed act by Qiao Xin herself.

968
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,750
So Pei Xi

969
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,990
is not hurt by love,

970
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,910
he's actually confessing to you.

971
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,990
What and what?

972
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,830
I already said,

973
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,390
no confessions.

974
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,030
He...

975
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,510
He...

976
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,950
How is that considered as a confession?

977
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,030
Nothing of that sort.

978
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,350
Why are you so anxious for?

979
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,070
Are you guilty?

980
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,500
What am I guilty about?

981
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,140
Even if he confess,

982
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,540
I won't like someone

983
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,140
with a ice-cold face like him.

984
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,780
Looks like a fool.

985
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,520
Oh,

986
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,360
has Teacher Luo's attitude

987
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,600
towards gotten better?

988
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,720
It's still the same

989
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,560
but it's alright.

990
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I just entered the industry,

991
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,840
there's indeed a lot of things

992
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,870
I've to learn.

993
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,630
I just hope I'm able

994
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,590
to walk down this career steadily.

995
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,710
Then do you mind

996
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,430
to let me have a look

997
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,230
at your commentary videos?

998
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,230
Sure.

999
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,140
There's still many areas that I'm not sure of,

1000
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,380
why don't we

1001
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,940
go to Meng Lu Ren...

1002
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,060
Why is it Meng Lu Ren again?

1003
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,660
Why do you like

1004
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,540
Meng Lu Ren so much?

1005
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,580
Or is it because

1006
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,740
someone is there?

1007
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,250
State a place,

1008
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,570
you'll bring me there.

1009
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,760
Speak,

1010
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,280
why did you gather us for?

1011
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,160
Today, I

1012
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,400
want to have a meeting on tactics.

1013
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,480
The subject of the meeting is

1014
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,160
Ji Xiang Kong.

1015
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,750
Brother Kong?

1016
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,350
It's really an eye opening for me today.

1017
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,870
It's my first time hearing that we are discussing

1018
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,390
about someone for our tactics meeting.

1019
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:18,870
Exactly,

1020
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,620
what do you mean by that?

1021
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,740
You're making me confuse.

1022
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,260
How about

1023
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,140
you guys listen

1024
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,100
to what captain has to say?

1025
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,140
Based on Wei Teng's capability now,

1026
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,420
they'll probably be competing against us in the semi-finals.

1027
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,860
They have a higher probability.

1028
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,220
Before that,

1029
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,180
Ji Xiang Kong validate

1030
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,100
himself with understanding

1031
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,260
us too well.

1032
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,220
This time,

1033
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,700
why don't we

1034
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,260
also use our understanding towards him

1035
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,370
to win him back?

1036
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,170
Sounds

1037
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,530
right.

1038
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:45,850
Makes sense.

1039
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,690
I'm at your favour since I'm eating

1040
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,400
your food, right?

1041
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,320
I'll go first.

1042
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,400
Brother Kong...

1043
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,280
Name, Ji Xiang Kong.

1044
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,760
Horoscope, Leo.

1045
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,000
Loves to eat strawberries.

1046
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,060
Best buddy

1047
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,900
is me.

1048
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,660
We're having a tactic meeting nown

1049
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,500
not chit-chatting.

1050
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:06,940
Exactly.

1051
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,380
You're already eating his food,

1052
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,380
can't you answer properly?

1053
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,420
Captain,

1054
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,220
sorry.

1055
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:18,900
That...

1056
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,460
I'm being serious.

1057
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,460
From what I understand about him,

1058
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,420
if he managed to get a huge advantage

1059
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,740
in the earlier game,

1060
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,100
hr will expand his

1061
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,370
advantage at the later part of the game.

1062
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,810
Brother Yao, give one.

1063
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,600
Handsome Ji biggest merit is

1064
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,910
his imagination.

1065
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,030
Don't think that we are in a

1066
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,990
advantage in the early game

1067
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,990
and take it lightly.

1068
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,790
It might be his trap,

1069
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,670
have to be vigilant.

1070
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,150
Handsome Ji...

1071
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,190
Handsome Ji

1072
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,030
is very

1073
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,630
very impressive.

1074
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,750
Don't joke around.

1075
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:05,830
I thought of a really important one

1076
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,910
that you guys did not mention.

1077
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,180
He especially like motorbikes.

1078
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,460
Do you realised

1079
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,400
Pei Xi isn't as cold as before?

1080
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,800
Lu Feng,

1081
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,440
give me one more.

1082
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,680
Why me again?
