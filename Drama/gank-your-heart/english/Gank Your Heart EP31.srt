00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,140
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,370
Fellow summoners,

4
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,570
welcome to the venue

5
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,510
of 2019 Iconquer's spring tournament.

6
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,030
I'm the host for today, Ah Can.

7
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,150
Okay, the team I'm

8
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,030
introducing next

9
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,590
has been controversial

10
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,550
since they started.

11
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,910
Let's welcome

12
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,870
the highly anticipated

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,150
team of 2019,

14
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,750
Phoenix.

15
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,030
let's welcome on stage.

16
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,390
Pheonix is the best!

17
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,310
First, it's their captain,

18
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,670
Ji Xiang Kong.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,830
Pheonix

20
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,620
is a team of weaklings.

21
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,420
Actually, I'm looking forward

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,620
to play a match with them.

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,220
Yes,

24
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,060
I'm also looking forward,

25
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,220
looking forward to defeat you all,

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,180
Ji Xiang Kong.

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,960
An veteran player,

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
captain of the former team, Kai Tuo Zhe,

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
Sun Ze Yi.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,240
I think that

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
it's really courageous of him

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
to step out and compete in competitions again.

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,000
Brother Yi!

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
The first middle for the new generation,

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,080
Pei Xi.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
It's not easy of Ji Xiang Kong

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,640
to gather these people.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,360
I hope

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,710
they're able to achieve good results.

40
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,950
It's a pity that Pei Xi is still unable to

41
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,710
adapt to

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,790
Ji Xiang Kong's tactics.

43
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,110
He's just ruining himself.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,870
I think having the both

45
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,910
of them in the same team,

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,870
brings everyone

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,950
higher anticipation.

48
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,020
I always respect Pei Xi's

49
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,220
choices and decisions

50
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,220
so

51
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,100
I think he has better foresight than me.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,660
Pheonix's secret weapon is

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,700
their youngest player,

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,330
Xia Ling.

55
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,850
All the best, Xia Ling!

56
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,010
You're the best!

57
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,890
Pheonix

58
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,450
reminds me of

59
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,490
Kai Tuo Zhe then,

60
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,770
their passion and pureness

61
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,050
for Iconquer.

62
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,010
I believe

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,930
they will create

64
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,410
another miracle.

65
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,690
The last member,

66
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,410
their strongest support,

67
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,810
Lin Yi Xuan.

68
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,200
Every member in Pheonix

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
were questioned

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,920
and criticized before.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
They are able to get to where

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
they are today is based on their cofidence

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
and their passion for Iconquer.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
I hereby announce

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,950
the competition officially begins!

76
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,060
All the best, Phoenix! Pei Xi, attack.

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,140
Ji Xiang Kong uses immotality,

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,940
he's revived now.

79
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,540
This wave

80
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,580
is a counterattack.

81
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,100
Sun Ze Yi entered from the side,

82
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,460
messing up Dragon's formation.

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,340
Only the experienced

84
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,100
player will have such knowledge to do that.

85
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Next wave of attack.

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,820
Pei Xi performs well in this round.

87
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,610
Phoenix is really

88
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,730
doing a pressurizing counterattack.

89
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,690
Xia Ling starts on killing,

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,530
he's simply doing it without any difficulty.

91
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,250
Dragon has one man standing,

92
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,170
escaping back to base.

93
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,130
Next wave of attack.

94
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,770
Next wave.

95
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,520
Nice one!

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,880
Attack! Push!

97
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Got it!

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Pei Xi attack.

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
All the best!

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,840
Nice wave of attack.

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,800
Next wave is to attack the crystal.

102
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Nice one!

103
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,220
Let us congratulate Phoenix

104
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,060
for a good start,

105
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,620
taking down their first victory!

106
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,740
Phoenix performance today

107
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,780
is totally splendid.

108
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,340
I believe they will continue to

109
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,460
bring us surprises

110
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
in future competitions,

111
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,700
let us anticipate.

112
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,740
I watched Pei Xi grow up.

113
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,100
He has shown unprecedented

114
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,380
breakthrough after joining Phoenix.

115
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,340
Yes.

116
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,620
Pei Xi in the past only thinks for

117
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,460
himself,

118
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,740
now he knows how to leave chances to

119
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,450
Xia Ling to develop his economy.

120
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,690
He's all grown up.

121
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,570
Feeling happy?

122
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,690
Of course.

123
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,370
Everyone did

124
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,290
great today.

125
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,290
Yes,

126
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,970
especially our Xiao Ling Ling,

127
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,470
attack Dragon till they were

128
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,350
all confused.

129
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,350
A like for you.

130
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,830
Ah Xuan, you're not bad too.

131
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,750
That's of course.

132
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,750
Actually I think that

133
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,950
Ah Xuan sounds nice.

134
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,630
Yes.

135
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,590
I think so too.

136
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,470
If I did not remember wrongly,

137
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,710
you're a week younger than me.

138
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,510
Technically,

139
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,990
you should call me Brother Xuan.

140
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,030
Are you sure?

141
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm sure.

142
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,310
Look,

143
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,350
Lu Yi Yi.

144
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,590
Where?

145
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,830
Tricked me right?

146
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,910
Did you tricked me?

147
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,390
Here.

148
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Slow down.

149
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,060
Only the experienced

150
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,140
player will have such knowledge

151
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,920
to do that.

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,800
Phoenix is really

153
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,760
doing a pressurizing counterattack.

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Xia Ling starts on killing,

155
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
he's simply doing it without any difficulty.

156
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,440
Dragon has one man standing,

157
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,240
escaping back to base.

158
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,200
Next wave is to

159
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,000
attack the crystal.

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,360
Winning for the first battle,

161
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
congratulations.

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,480
You worked hard, Luo Tian.

163
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,190
Thank you, Teacher Luo.

164
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,270
Brother Yi,

165
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,190
treasured knife doesn't age.

166
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,070
Pretty stunning.

167
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,350
My speed isn't a good as

168
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,030
the past.

169
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,190
Speed isn't the most important,

170
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,230
experience and

171
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,460
knowledge is.

172
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,700
You're making me all embarassed

173
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,740
from all the complimenting.

174
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,660
As if.

175
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,500
Xiang Kong,

176
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,500
I will

177
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,620
have a chat with Teacher Luo.

178
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,130
Wait for me in the rest room.

179
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,290
Okay.

180
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,450
See you later.

181
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,770
Let's go.

182
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,650
Let's go.

183
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,450
Being the leader

184
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,690
recently is tiring right?

185
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,490
Actually, it's still okay.

186
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,010
It's more tiring for them.

187
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,650
I only work on the miscellaneous.

188
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,130
Qiao Xin

189
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,480
denied to the committee

190
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,320
that she told you

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,560
about Ji Xiang Kong fainting

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,760
so

193
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,400
the issue about leakage of Wei Teng's tactics

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,600
have no progression

195
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
for the past 3 months.

196
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,430
I expected her

197
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,230
to deny anyway.

198
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,670
Don't worry,

199
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,670
I'll let the committee

200
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,590
continue to investigate

201
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,550
and

202
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,590
return you your innocence

203
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,190
to come back to the analyzing table quickly.

204
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,660
I believe

205
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,620
the truth will be

206
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,340
come to light one day.

207
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,340
Don't worry,

208
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,740
I'm pretty good now.

209
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,780
I've learn a lot

210
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,420
being the leader.

211
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,940
Oh,

212
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,060
this is this week's homework.

213
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,730
Let's go.

214
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
So many presents, Xia Ling.

215
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,960
This is for you.

216
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,280
Mine?

217
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,400
Look.

218
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,880
It's so cool.

219
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,600
Nice.

220
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,580
This, Qiu Ying,

221
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,340
is yours.

222
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,580
I have too?

223
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,500
We will always support you.

224
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,540
Face mask.

225
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,180
it's mud mask.

226
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,020
What other good stuff are there?

227
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,340
Give you a piece.

228
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300
Who gave me a rabbit?

229
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,340
Rabbit.

230
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,580
Someone's at the door.

231
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,020
I'll go get it.

232
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,740
Mum.

233
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,060
Ying Zi.

234
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,340
Xia Ling,

235
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,140
your Mother and I went to school to look for you

236
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,050
and heard that you're here.

237
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,370
I wondered why didn't you

238
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,930
allow your Father and I

239
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,330
to see you in school,

240
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,150
so you actually came here

241
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,350
to fool around.

242
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,150
Xia Ling,

243
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,110
you didn't tell them

244
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,390
about your competition?

245
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,310
Xia Ling, let's go.

246
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,190
Let's go home.

247
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,670
Let's talk at home

248
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,710
if you have anything to say.

249
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,990
I'm not going back.

250
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,150
I came here to compete,

251
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,230
not to fool around.

252
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,030
I've already transfer

253
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,390
my major to E-sports.

254
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,630
I'm studying and

255
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,670
competing at the same time,

256
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,990
the school has approved of it.

257
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,150
What competition?

258
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,380
What major did you transfer to?

259
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,260
Auntie,

260
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:19,860
you

261
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,100
calm down first.

262
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
You might not understand.

263
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,660
E-sports now is already

264
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,800
is added into the Asian Games

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
as a competition category.

266
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
I don't wish to talk much to you.

267
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
Xia Ling,

268
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
come home with me.

269
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
I'm not going back.

270
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Mum, if you comtinue to be like this,

271
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,560
I'm never going home.

272
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,400
Xia Ling,

273
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
don't talk to your Mother like this.

274
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
She doing what she thinks is best for you.

275
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,990
Cut the act.

276
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,990
If it's not for you, my Son

277
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,910
wouldn't get into an accident.

278
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,270
His leg wouldn't become like this.

279
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,150
You're not doing any proper work,

280
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,310
hanging out with these

281
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,110
dubious people,

282
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,740
don't think about ruining my Son.

283
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,820
You're going overboard.

284
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
How am I so?

285
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,820
When Xia Ling got into an accident,

286
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,700
my Daughter, no.

287
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,380
His Sister is also as anxious

288
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,500
and visits him everyday in the hospital.

289
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,420
Enough.

290
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,570
Xia Ling,

291
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,570
look at yourself.

292
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,690
Why didn't you discuss with us

293
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,410
beforehand

294
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,730
about changing major?

295
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,290
Look how anxious your Mother is getting.

296
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,530
You Mother might not understand

297
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,970
what you

298
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,800
are doing now.

299
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
How about

300
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,320
we go back first.

301
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,400
We'll convince her slowly

302
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
when we get back after you guys are done.

303
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,960
Let's go.

304
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,560
Enough.

305
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,280
Let's go.

306
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,990
Come, go home with me.

307
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,070
-Come.          -No, I'm not going.

308
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,150
I'm not going.

309
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,630
Since young,

310
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,980
everything is wrong

311
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
as long as you don't like it.

312
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,900
Towards Dad,

313
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,420
towards Sister

314
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,260
and towards me.

315
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,460
Havd you ever wondered

316
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,260
if everything you do is right?

317
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,100
Mum,

318
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,140
I don't care how

319
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,500
you look at what I'm doing,

320
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,300
I just want to tell you that

321
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,780
there's Sister,

322
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,730
everyone and Phoenix

323
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,770
here.

324
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,850
I can only find

325
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,570
my worth here.

326
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,170
I hope you

327
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,530
will respect my decision.

328
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,980
What brings you here?

329
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,620
I'll place my credit card here.

330
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,180
Go pay up for the instalments.

331
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,340
Send me the video

332
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,100
of the competition,

333
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,420
the one with the champion.

334
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,220
That Ji Xiang Kong is your Boyfriend?

335
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,300
Not bad.

336
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,300
He seems steady,

337
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,210
unlike how he was said online.

338
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,490
How am I overboard?

339
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,210
When Xia Ling got into an accident,

340
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,890
my Daughter, no.

341
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,410
His Sister is also as anxious

342
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,730
and visits him everyday in the hospital.

343
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,470
Lao Qiu,

344
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,990
does you Son really thinks that

345
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,420
I chased

346
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,140
Qiu Ying out of the house?

347
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,020
No,

348
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,100
don't think that way.

349
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,120
Many things in the past,

350
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
everyone did things that are wrong.

351
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
This child of mine

352
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,360
is stubborn since young,

353
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,120
you suffered from injustice too

354
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
but as a whole,

355
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
it's my bad.

356
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,120
I did not handle it well, really.

357
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm sorry.

358
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,230
My temper isn't good today.

359
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,710
You're just being concerned,

360
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,070
I understand.

361
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,020
You're

362
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,220
really allowing both of

363
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,540
them to participate in that competition?

364
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,660
I heard it from

365
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,970
Xia Ling that

366
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,690
Qiu Ying

367
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,090
became a commentator.

368
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,970
From then on,

369
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,770
I keep myself updated on this new

370
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,050
occupation.

371
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,090
In the past, we

372
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,610
always thought that

373
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,530
this is not any proper job,

374
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,330
right?

375
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,570
Addicted to online games

376
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,730
but I only realised

377
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,850
it's actually E-sports

378
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,490
after I understand it better.

379
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,210
It's different

380
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,570
from online games.

381
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,240
You see, even Asian Games

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,800
added this category

383
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,360
as one of their sports segment.

384
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,440
Xia Ling's school then opened

385
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
a course specially for this.

386
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,430
You say, what future

387
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,630
can this major bring him to?

388
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,630
How would you know

389
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,910
that there's no future?

390
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,990
He's only 20 years old,

391
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,390
a life of 20 years

392
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,100
has endless possibilties.

393
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,580
You see,

394
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,300
he likes E-sports now.

395
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,420
If he's able to walk out

396
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,340
of the shadow of his leg injury

397
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,380
and gain confidence

398
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,940
isn't that a good thing?

399
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,660
Let me show you something.

400
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
Look how confident your Son is

401
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
in the video.

402
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,900
Sister,

403
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm sorry

404
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,940
about how Mother spoke to you.

405
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,180
It's nothing.

406
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,300
Your Mum was anxious

407
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,580
because she doesn't

408
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,860
understand our career.

409
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
She's just being a know-it-all.

410
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,780
Xia Ling,

411
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,340
don't say that of your Mother.

412
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,380
Your Mum do so because

413
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,140
she loves and

414
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,340
care for you.

415
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,250
How about

416
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,010
I bring you home

417
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,890
after breakfast?

418
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,410
Have a good chat with her, okay?

419
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,290
There's nothing to chat about,

420
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,570
she won't understand.

421
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,350
So you intend to

422
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,470
stay like this

423
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,550
with your Mother?

424
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,790
Just like my Dad and I.

425
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,270
Previously, you kept telling me that he cares about me

426
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,390
but I did not believe.

427
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,150
Dad is really concerned about you.

428
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,150
I'm not lying.

429
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,500
After you became a commentator,

430
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,620
he even started following you on Weibo.

431
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,420
I know.

432
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,580
I thought for the

433
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,940
whole night yesterday.

434
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
Ever since he married your Mother,

435
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,800
I kept thinking that he doesn't love me anymore

436
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
so I hated him a lot.

437
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
I won't pick up his calls,

438
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
I won't see him when he comes to school.

439
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I'll refund the money

440
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,990
he transferred to me.

441
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,820
Eating breakfast?

442
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,220
How?

443
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,020
Still angry with your Mother?

444
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,540
No.

445
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,900
No?

446
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,610
I've already convinced your Mother.

447
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,290
Really?

448
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,810
Of course it's real.

449
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,810
Don't you know

450
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,690
what your Mother is like?

451
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,450
She's like that.

452
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,610
She's not unreasonable,

453
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,570
it's just how you put it across to her,

454
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,850
right?

455
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,770
You see,

456
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,690
she got me to bring you all these.

457
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,890
Anything to wear and eat,

458
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,650
it's all in here.

459
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,170
Give us a call if

460
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,400
you're lacking anything.

461
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,560
Call any one of us is fine,

462
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,440
we'll send it over to you.

463
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

464
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
Your Mother specially instruct

465
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,080
you to not sit for too long

466
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,600
during training

467
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,910
since your leg isn't well.

468
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,950
Don't delay on the doctor's

469
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,910
rehabilitation.

470
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,990
Don't forget about

471
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,910
homework too.

472
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,830
Don't you worry,

473
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,990
there's Sister to supervise me.

474
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,580
Dad, don't worry.

475
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,180
Of course,

476
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,420
there's

477
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,930
Sister to look after her Brother.

478
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,330
Of course I don't have to worry.

479
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,010
I used to...

480
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,280
hope that you'll be able to forgive me.

481
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,700
She's

482
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,900
the commentator

483
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,700
while you

484
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,740
plays for E-sports.

485
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,340
As long as you do what you love,

486
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,340
your Mum and I wouldn't

487
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,100
object to it.

488
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,940
Since you like it,

489
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,220
then work hard in doing well.

490
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,820
As long as you work hard,

491
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
no matter the result may be,

492
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,780
we will be

493
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,020
proud of the both of you.

494
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,140
My Daughter

495
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,140
and my Son

496
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,580
are the best.

497
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,730
Bye.

498
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,010
I'll get going.

499
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,840
Pei Xi, any drinks?

500
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,070
New dark horse, Phoenix,

501
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,870
are sweeping well-known teams off the charts.

502
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,150
They are Sun Ze Yi,

503
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,830
Ji Xiang Kong,

504
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,670
Pei Xi,

505
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,350
Lin Yi Xuan

506
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,030
and Xia Ling.

507
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,140
Good, nice one!

508
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,740
Legendary.

509
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,980
Okay, another wave of attack.

510
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,370
Congratulations, Phoenix

511
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,610
for winning in this round

512
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,690
and is ranked number 1 based on score,

513
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,650
getting in

514
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,090
to the semi-finals.

515
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,970
In this 3 months long

516
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,090
tournament, they suffered

517
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,050
many constroversies.

518
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,960
They brought us countless surprises

519
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,040
with their individual

520
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
operation and excellent

521
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,240
teamwork.

522
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
Let us anticipate this

523
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
soaring Phoenix

524
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
to continue their glory in the following

525
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,190
tournaments.

526
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,220
For you.

527
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,140
Thanks.

528
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,700
Rest early.

529
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,570
What's this?

530
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,330
Let me try.

531
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,240
Here, I'll teach you.

532
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,160
That's cool.

533
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,760
Right?

534
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,520
This is the new tactic

535
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm researching on

536
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,660
but

537
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,020
this thought is a little bold.

538
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,340
I don't know if there's

539
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,220
risk if we were to implement it

540
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,940
because after the both of them

541
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,740
changes their position,

542
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,940
counting in the time for cool down,

543
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,540
it's about to cause a huge damage.

544
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,130
You're the best,

545
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,990
believe in yourself.

546
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,510
Thank you.

547
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,870
Not sleeping yet?

548
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,710
I'll accompany you.

549
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,070
It's fine,

550
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,910
hurry to bed.

551
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,390
I'm not tired,

552
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,790
I won't be a disturbance to you.

553
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,310
I'll be very quiet.

554
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,040
butI'm unable to focus with you

555
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
looking at me like that.

556
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,640
Then...

557
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,080
Then it's better if I go to bed.

558
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll go put on a facial mask.

559
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,990
Rest early too.

560
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,350
You forgot your mask.

561
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,290
I think I'll just go to bed.

562
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,770
Don't you want it anymore?

563
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,170
No,

564
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,610
take it as I'm with you.

565
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,770
Goodnight.

566
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,870
We'll be up against Xin Tu

567
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,510
for the first round in the finals.

568
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,110
This team is good at middle and

569
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,020
ending stage, avoiding to fight with us

570
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,940
in the early stage.

571
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,940
Play a push and pull.

572
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,940
Xia Ling is good at jungling,

573
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,820
it's an advantage

574
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,020
for us in the early stage.

575
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,180
but at the middle to ending stage,

576
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,900
once the economy closen up

577
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,660
we'll be especially passive.

578
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
Team Ju Shi is also

579
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,780
good at playing push-and-pull.

580
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,780
That's right

581
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,420
so these 2 teams

582
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
are our strongest opponents.

583
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,090
We need to have a change in tactic.

584
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,970
What tactic?

585
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,890
Change of position.

586
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,680
I named this tactic

587
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
as Shadow.

588
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,520
Xia Ling and Pei Xi

589
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,460
will change their position.

590
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,420
Which means,

591
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,860
I'll go jungle

592
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,180
and Xia Ling will go middle.

593
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,660
I hope that both of you will be

594
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,940
about to change positions flexibly.

595
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,220
Change position flexibly?

596
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,060
What do you mean?

597
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,380
Pei Xi and Xia Ling

598
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,700
can move among middle and jungle

599
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,900
as well as working

600
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,860
alongside with you

601
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,260
in catching those alone.

602
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,220
Three of you

603
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,820
can start a mini

604
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,180
group fight at the bottom.

605
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,300
Then...

606
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,220
Then...

607
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,100
The nut are suitable

608
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,980
to handle the whole game.

609
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,290
Which means,

610
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,890
you guys are shadows of each other.

611
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,810
You can change positions as you like

612
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,450
while supporting each other

613
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,090
allowing the enemies to get confused.

614
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,950
That's right.

615
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,670
Qiu Ying is really smart.

616
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,390
You taught well.

617
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,790
This idea is good,

618
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,030
it can control many line-ups

619
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,350
but

620
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,110
it's not easy to

621
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,590
adapt to it.

622
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,470
Also,

623
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,910
Xia Ling is better at jungling

624
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,950
as compared to me.

625
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,270
My input and output as a whole

626
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,230
will have a distant compared to Pei Xi.

627
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,630
I believe the both of you can do it.

628
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,470
Why don't we give it a shot?

629
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,150
Anyway I'll give it my all

630
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,900
in whichever pisotion I play.

631
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,300
But I'm really not confident.

632
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,580
No problem,

633
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,250
I'll coordinate with you.

634
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,720
we'll face any

635
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,240
problems together.

636
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes, Xia Ling.

637
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
We all believe in you.

638
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
All the best.

639
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Come on, we'll work

640
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,480
hard together to get the

641
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
championship this season.

642
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Come on,

643
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,080
Xia Ling.

644
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,030
All the best!

645
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,540
Xiang Kong.

646
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,370
Qiu Ying,

647
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,330
what brings you here?

648
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,170
I'm thinking

649
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,090
of talking to you in private regarding Xia Ling's matter.

650
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,370
You want to talk to me about

651
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,450
the matter on position changing?

652
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,970
I'm worried

653
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,130
that Xia Ling is not competent

654
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,290
for the middle position.

655
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,410
Don't you worry,

656
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,570
he's the youngest

657
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,600
among us

658
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,840
but reaction and learning

659
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,640
ability is the fast.

660
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,840
He's speed is comparable

661
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
to that Pei Xi.

662
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,440
There's nothing to worry about.

663
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
I know him well,

664
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,630
I'm worried

665
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,550
that he's not confident in himself.

666
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,270
I believe in him,

667
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,100
he's stronger than we think.

668
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,780
Alright, don't worry anymore.

669
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,380
Do you know?

670
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,340
I never wanted so much

671
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,540
to win.

672
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,260
Previously,

673
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,980
I'm not afraid of

674
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,570
how people scold me

675
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,210
but now,

676
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,850
to protect the people around me,

677
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,570
I have to be stronger.

678
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,930
I know

679
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,440
your stress

680
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,120
is bigger than anyone.

681
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,320
Since Phoenix was set up,

682
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,040
I wanted to tell you that

683
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,780
I'll bring you to the Global Final competition.

684
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,340
We'll go together,

685
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,540
be the top of the world.

686
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,140
I believe you.

687
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,570
Fellow summoners,

688
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,570
welcome to the first round of

689
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,290
Iconquer 2019

690
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,770
semi-finals match.

691
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,170
Welcome everyone,

692
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,870
I'm the host for today, Ah Can.

693
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,470
Don't be nervous,

694
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,150
although it's our first time playing Shadow.

695
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:58,910
It's okay,

696
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,750
relax and play.

697
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,670
Don't worry,

698
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,470
we

699
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,750
will have no problem.

700
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,870
Don't be afraid,

701
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,110
I'm here.

702
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,350
Don't listen to him, I cover you.

703
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,470
You better

704
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,630
cover yourself first.

705
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
Don't trust me right?

706
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,390
In today's competition,

707
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,910
the new team

708
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,830
Phoenix

709
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,590
will be up matching up

710
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,820
against Xin Tu.

711
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,060
Now I'll annouce

712
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,100
today's competition

713
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,140
officially

714
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,180
begins!

715
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,060
Welcome both teams

716
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,420
to their seats.

717
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,080
Xia Ling and Pei Xi changed their position.

718
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,480
This is Xiang Kong's new tactic.

719
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,600
What a big change.

720
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
Are they prepared?

721
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,200
The effect was not bad during

722
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
training match.

723
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,400
Ji Xiang Kong do not

724
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,400
fight in a battle unprepared,

725
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,920
it should be fine.

726
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,510
We'll see.

727
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,670
Allowing Pei Xi to jungle,

728
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,110
is Ji Xiang Kong crazy?

729
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,510
Can the rookie play middle

730
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,390
well?

731
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,590
This Ji Xiang kong

732
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,550
is ruining Pei Xi's tempo.

733
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,380
This jungler is so annoying.

734
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:06,860
It's okay,

735
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,820
we'll just be slightly wretched.

736
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,340
Pei Xi,

737
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,260
go to the opponent's jungle.

738
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:09,820
Got it.

739
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,540
This jungler is at the bottom,

740
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,500
Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan

741
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,340
met at the bottom.

742
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,330
Pei Xi took this chance

743
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,290
to develop at the jungle on top.

744
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,770
Jungler has disappeared.

745
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,530
Jungler has disappeared.

746
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,010
It's okay,

747
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,730
I'll leave once I'm done here.

748
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,810
Retreat, don't attack.

749
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,490
Be careful.

750
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,810
Retreat, go.

751
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,210
Assist.

752
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,290
I can fight here.

753
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,650
They have started,

754
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,930
Xia Ling used snow storm

755
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,010
to confuse Hell Messenger

756
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,970
but both support of Xin Tu

757
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,850
send him directly under the turret.

758
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,930
Mo Ge La charged forward,

759
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,050
using his Ultimate to confuse Xia Ling.

760
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,530
Crystal Ice Monster follow up with a ice shield.

761
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,050
Hell Messenger

762
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,810
attacked with his skill.

763
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,600
XiaLing has been slained.

764
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,480
First blood is born.

765
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,080
Nice one!

766
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
Xin Tu achieved first blood.

767
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,640
Steady.

768
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,920
Steady, you be the eyes.

769
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,840
Protect Pei Xi while he develop.

770
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,870
This attack came in time.

771
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,110
if Ah Xin was a second late,

772
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,390
they might have slain Hell Messenger.

773
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:46,990
That being said,

774
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,870
but both support

775
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,230
of Xin Tu are being very vigilant,

776
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,270
ready to send anytime.

777
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,390
Maybe because

778
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,670
the middle is inexperience.

779
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,300
Xia Ling is a little too anxious.

780
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,020
Find your tempo.

781
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,980
Sun Ze Yi is being

782
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,860
pressured at the top.

783
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,660
Pei Xi went into jungle,

784
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,700
detouriing to top.

785
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,540
Pei Xi, your position.

786
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,500
Why did you go there for?

787
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,340
I have a bunch of minions here,

788
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,980
I can't go.

789
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,900
No, Pei Xi, run quickly.

790
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,940
You can't fight.

791
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,100
Pei Xi is in trouble.

792
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,380
He jumped into the opponent's turret

793
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,180
but Sun Ze Yi

794
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,020
is being controlled by the opponent.

795
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,220
Pei Xi has not enough damage,

796
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,580
executed under their turret.

797
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,010
Pei Xi did not enter at the right time.

798
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,690
Seems like Pei Xi

799
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,610
has yet to adapt to the

800
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,530
jungling tempo.

801
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,650
Top is quite steady.

802
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,370
They seems to be restricting

803
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,090
me from jungling.

804
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Pull back a little.

805
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,480
Pull back a little.

806
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,520
I didn't lose him in economy.

807
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,760
My blood isn't enough.

808
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,680
You can't fight now.

809
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,480
I can.

810
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,080
I can.

811
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,550
Okay,

812
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,020
I know.

813
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,340
Quickly.

814
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,020
All the best.

815
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,660
Xia Ling got slain again.

816
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,380
Xia Ling has to steady his mentality.

817
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Pei Xi, change to middle.

818
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,460
You go to middle,

819
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,220
change with Xia Ling.

820
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,060
Okay.

821
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,740
Xia Ling, do develop.

822
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,260
If this continues, they are going to lose.

823
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,020
Xia ling is still not farmilar with

824
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,340
the tempo of the middle.

825
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,380
After all, he's a rookie.

826
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,700
Middle is such an important role,

827
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,340
this is ridiculous.

828
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,300
All the best.

829
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,780
All the best.

830
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,410
The different in economy of both teams are increasing.

831
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,010
Seems like,

832
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,690
Pei Xi and Xia Ling

833
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,850
have yet to adapt to the change.

834
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,570
Alas,

835
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,850
Pei Xi returned to the middle.

836
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,050
Xia Ling is developing in the jungle.

837
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,530
I can't follow up with the middle tempo.

838
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,990
Jungle area is under control by the opponents.

839
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,710
They can't hold for long if they were to

840
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,510
start a group fight now.

841
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,190
There isn't

842
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,390
anyone in Phoenix who can do damage now.

843
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,590
They are really in big trouble.

844
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,790
Xia Ling, it's okay.

845
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,590
Find your tempo.

846
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,270
Find your tempo.

847
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,230
Don't get confused.

848
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,910
Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan

849
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,750
sneak into the jungle area

850
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,070
wanting to be Pei Xi's bird-eye.

851
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,910
But Xin Tu

852
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,030
has gain controlled a step ahead

853
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,670
of the eyes of the jungle.

854
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,310
Seems like Ji Xiang Kong

855
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,710
and Lin Yi Xuan are exposed.

856
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,270
No, we are being stunned.

857
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,030
I'm stunned at the top.

858
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,790
I'll guide Pei Xi.

859
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,670
Pei Xi, can do your kill, quick.

860
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,510
I'm coming.

861
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,150
This damage is too painful,

862
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,950
both of you be careful.

863
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,590
Pei Xi, come over quickly.

864
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,430
I don't know where the jungler is.

865
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,190
Both of you be careful.

866
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:42,590
I'll attack.

867
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,460
Pei Xi, run.

868
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:44,980
Jungler is here.

869
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,580
I can't.

870
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,700
Pei Xi, you go. I'll carry for you.

871
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,980
What are you all doing?

872
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,080
No, we lost just like that?

873
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,960
We can see that

874
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,480
Ji Xiang Kong from Phoenix

875
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,640
has already surrender.

876
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,720
Let us congratulate Xin Tu

877
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
in winning for the first round.

878
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,600
Congratulations.

879
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,350
Let us congratulate Xin Tu

880
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,030
on winning

881
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,950
with 2 to 0.

882
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,990
Phoenix entered the losing group.

883
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,950
It's a pity.

884
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,230
It's okay, Xia Ling.

885
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,590
We can win it back in the next round.

886
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,860
Relax.

887
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,100
It's a pity that

888
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,740
Pei Xi and Xia Ling has yet to farmilarize

889
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,380
themselves with the new tactic.

890
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,450
Didn't you say you've let it go?

891
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,690
Why are you still watching?

892
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,170
How's preparation?

893
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,290
Almost done.

894
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,170
The concert this time round

895
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,130
is a change for me.

896
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,250
I hope to become

897
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,530
a self-composing singer,

898
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,370
not just an idol.

899
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,080
I support you on changing style

900
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,680
but isn't it

901
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,840
a little too sudden?

902
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,920
You have to play and sing

903
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
yourself for this concert

904
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,840
and even be hang from the wire.

905
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,160
It's too dangerous.

906
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,270
I've already decided,

907
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,790
just trust me.

908
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,150
Alright.

909
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,780
Since you've decided,

910
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,180
all the best.

911
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,250
It's okay,

912
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:36,930
we still have a chance.

913
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:39,930
It's my fault,

914
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,770
I've not adapt to jungling.

915
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,690
Don't need to take the blame for me.

916
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,160
If my turret did not fall

917
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,040
that early,

918
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
your jungle area wouldn't be affected too.

919
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,600
Organizing econony and tempo

920
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,600
wouldn't be so messy too.

921
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,600
The problem lies with me,

922
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm sorry.

923
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,100
I'm a burden to everyone.

924
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,780
What are you saying?

925
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,140
What right and wrong?

926
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,860
We are all brothers,

927
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,060
don't say all these.

928
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,420
I did not perform well today either.

929
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Ah Xuan Is right.

930
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,180
Today is an unforgettable

931
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,300
experience.

932
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,220
We found out the problem,

933
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,980
we can do better next round.

934
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,020
Right,

935
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,140
it's just a round of competition.

936
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:22,940
We'll just win

937
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,100
back in the next round.

938
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,850
Okay,

939
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,970
we'll head back and rest first.

940
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,150
Come.

941
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,590
Brother Sun.

942
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,750
Xiang Kong,

943
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,910
Sister Wen

944
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,390
asked us to go over

945
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,510
to The King to have a chat.

946
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,790
Based on my understanding

947
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,950
towards Xiang Kong, he'll never agree

948
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,430
to change Pei Xi back.

949
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,270
Then what now?

950
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,350
Remain as it is?

951
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,510
Can it work?

952
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,510
You've seen the result,

953
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,390
how is it?

954
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,270
Can wait till they're here before discussing?

955
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,260
They're here.

956
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,340
Everything okay?

957
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,580
Sit.

958
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
Okay, Xiang Kong.

959
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,920
cheer up.

960
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,440
Don't get your mood affected by those

961
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,600
netizen's comments online.

962
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,360
It's not only those netizens,

963
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
even professionals

964
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,040
are criticizing Xiang Kong and Xia Ling.

965
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,150
It's my responsibility

966
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,230
for losing today's competition.

967
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,990
Shadow is not familiarize yet.

968
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,430
What tactic are you

969
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,230
intending to use in next round?

970
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,260
I think...

971
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,460
I'd suggest you to

972
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,820
change Pei Xi back,

973
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,140
it's more secured this way.

974
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,020
Before you guys came,

975
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,250
we were discussing

976
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,730
about your tactic.

977
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,010
It's something new,

978
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,490
if Xia Ling and Pei Xi

979
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,330
are able to do as you say,

980
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,690
changing position flexibly,

981
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,450
this will indeed confuse the opponents.

982
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,610
But can Xia Ling

983
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,650
do it well?

984
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,770
Xia Ling

985
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,650
is a

986
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,160
a child with potential.

987
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,280
It's just that he

988
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
has too little experience for competition.

989
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,640
But

990
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
in such an important competition,

991
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,950
you let a rookie to play middle.

992
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,990
Aren't you

993
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,030
giving him too much stress?

994
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,910
Don't you agree?

995
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,430
If you were to lose again,

996
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,750
Phoenix

997
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,700
can't enter the global finals.

998
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,660
There's nothing wrong with Shadow,

999
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,380
there's no need for a change.

1000
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,300
I understand what you guys are saying

1001
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,500
but I believe in Xia Ling.

1002
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,140
The three of you,

1003
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,180
stop worrying so much.

1004
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,980
Give us some time.

1005
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,470
Xia Ling,

1006
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,710
come on out to eat.

1007
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,230
don't hide

1008
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,470
yourself inside.

1009
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,830
Xiao Xia Xia...

1010
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,190
Xiao Xia Xia...

1011
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,110
come out and eat, okay?

1012
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,270
Be good.

1013
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,590
Xia Ling,

1014
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,870
come out and eat.

1015
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,470
Don't hide yourself in there.

1016
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,590
Yes,

1017
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,790
you don't have to care about what

1018
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,870
they say online.

1019
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,350
They...

1020
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,260
They are all ridiculous.

1021
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,940
You...

1022
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,940
You don't take it to heart okay?

1023
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,620
Don't shout anymore,

1024
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,380
let him be alone.

1025
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,120
All of them are back.

1026
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,520
Let's go down first.

1027
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,800
Okay.

1028
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
I want to see him.

1029
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,600
Let him be alone.

1030
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,670
You're also tired,

1031
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,190
eat up first.

1032
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,870
How can I eat like this?

1033
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,430
What's wrong with you, Majesty Pei?

1034
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,830
Comments about you

1035
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,870
isn't friendly either.

1036
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,300
It doesn't matter to me,

1037
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,540
anyway the competition

1038
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,900
competition goes on.

1039
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,860
Cool.

1040
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,700
I like your attitude.

1041
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,210
How about you?

1042
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,330
What do we do?

1043
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,690
Everywhere online

1044
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,250
now are voices

1045
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,410
of questioning.

1046
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,210
We're fine.

1047
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:33,850
We're used to it.

1048
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,290
True.

1049
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,440
You guys are all

1050
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,040
should be used to it already.

1051
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,640
Just that Xia Ling

1052
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,600
got the most scoldings

1053
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,600
online.

1054
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,160
I don't know if

1055
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,590
he's able to take it.

1056
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,590
Xiang Kong,

1057
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,150
don't think too much.

1058
00:40:59,460 --> 00:40:59,980
everyone, sit.

1059
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,460
Eat up first.

1060
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,060
Let Xia Ling

1061
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,140
have some time alone.

1062
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,210
Xia Ling,

1063
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,770
come down quickly to eat.

1064
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,130
It's my decision, as the

1065
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,480
captain of Phoenix, to change

1066
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,560
Xia Ling to middle and

1067
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Pei Xi's to jungle.

1068
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,600
Please believe us.

1069
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
Before the sun comes out,

1070
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,360
we'll be braver than before.

1071
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,740
I'd suggest you to

1072
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,220
change Pei Xi back,

1073
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
it's more secured this way.

1074
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
It's not only those netizens,

1075
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
even professionals

1076
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,580
are criticizing Xiang Kong and Xia Ling.

1077
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,900
Xia Ling

1078
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,860
is a

1079
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,060
a child with potential.

1080
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,180
It's just that he

1081
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,300
has too little experience for competition.

1082
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,740
If you were to lose again,

1083
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,060
Phoenix

1084
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,900
can't enter the global finals.

1085
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,790
Xiang Kong.

1086
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,390
What brings you here?

1087
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,630
Netizens are all blaming you

1088
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,470
after you posted

1089
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,950
the post on Weibo.

1090
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,310
I'm usually the man in the news.

1091
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,670
Okay,

1092
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,510
don't worry.

1093
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,990
I'm already used to

1094
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,390
those things online.

1095
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,590
Chang Pei Xi

1096
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,270
and Xia Ling back.

1097
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,060
Of course I can't.

1098
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,580
If I give up now,

1099
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,100
it means that I do not trust him.

1100
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,380
I understand your intentions,

1101
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,940
-but...           -No buts.

1102
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,320
He finally build

1103
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
up his confidence,

1104
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,440
if we do not give him more

1105
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
support and encouragement,

1106
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,760
he will never cross this difficulty

1107
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,280
and fulfil his dreams.

1108
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,680
What if he can't do it?

1109
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,640
It's the double fail system now.

1110
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,040
If you were to lost again,

1111
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,040
Phoenix will have no fate

1112
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,440
for the world finals.

1113
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,720
Gu Fang,

1114
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,400
Sister Wen,

1115
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,240
Luo Tian,

1116
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,960
Brother Xia Tian,

1117
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,710
all of them have high hopes for Phoenix.

1118
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,110
Brother Sun,

1119
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,910
Pei Xi,

1120
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,550
Ah Xuan

1121
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,230
and you.

1122
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,620
All of your dreams may be crashed because of this.

1123
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,860
xia Ling isn't just your Brother,

1124
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,170
he's also our brother.

1125
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,050
In the world of Iconquer,

1126
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,530
we trust and support

1127
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,650
each other

1128
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,770
as brothers

1129
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:46,770
so we can win

1130
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,250
match after match.

1131
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,450
If we're going to give up on Xia Ling

1132
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,130
just because we lost once,

1133
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,730
then Phoenix is not qualified

1134
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,170
to be the world's best.

1135
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,760
Yes.

1136
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,400
Okay.

1137
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,120
Bear with it a little more.

1138
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,110
Pei Xi,

1139
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,390
why don't you go back first?

1140
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,260
I can handle my myself.

1141
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,300
Xia Ling isn't around,

1142
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,700
it's meaningless for me to

1143
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,020
practice Shadow alone

1144
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,900
since it needs both of our cooperation.

1145
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,340
Thank you, Pei Xi.

1146
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,980
I'll answer a call.

1147
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:42,930
Hello, Dad.

1148
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,170
Ying Zi.

1149
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,490
Did you Brother go for

1150
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,530
rehabilitation today?

1151
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:47,970
He went,

1152
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,730
he's doing it now.

1153
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:49,880
I'm watching him.

1154
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,040
How is he?

1155
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm pretty worried about him.

1156
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,160
Many people are scolding

1157
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,360
him online today.

1158
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,680
It's nothing,

1159
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,620
don't you worry.

1160
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,020
Are you okay?

1161
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,220
I wish to be alone.

1162
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,420
Xia Ling.

1163
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,060
Don't need for you to care.

1164
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,780
I'll take care of him.

1165
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,700
You may go first.

1166
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:32,930
Doctor.

1167
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,970
Hello, I have a question.

1168
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,530
Why is my Brother's condition

1169
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,050
getting from bad to worse?

1170
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,550
I thought it was weird too.

1171
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,670
He should be recovering pretty well,

1172
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,070
should be able to make do without clutches.

1173
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:45,950
Does he have

1174
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:46,950
some sort of mental stress?
