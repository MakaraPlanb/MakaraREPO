3
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,710
Sorry.

4
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,270
We are closed.

5
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,270
Have he not reply you?

6
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,830
Sorry.

7
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,630
I am going off soon.

8
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Hello Qiu Ying,

9
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,920
sorry.

10
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Are you okay?

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,680
Got held up by something urgent.

12
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
I didn't know it will take so long.

13
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
I didn't reply your message in time.

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
So sorry about that.

15
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,990
It's okay as long as you are fine.

16
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,110
Are you still at the milk tea shop?

17
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,030
Sorry,

18
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,230
you waited so long for nothing.

19
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,190
Let me go and fetch you.

20
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,430
It's okay.

21
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,790
The team have curfew,

22
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,750
if you were to make this trip,

23
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,340
you will be late.

24
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,940
I...

25
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm already at home.

26
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,380
I shall treat you a meal next time

27
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,810
as an apology.

28
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,330
Okay.

29
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,850
I will make sure it's an expensive meal.

30
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,770
You...

31
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,970
Rest early.

32
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,210
Okay.

33
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,330
You rest early too.

34
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,650
Goodnight.

35
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,570
Goodnight.

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,270
You came back because of Ji Xiang Kong?

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,910
Did I heard wrongly?

38
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,500
You didn't hear wrongly.

39
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,700
No wonder you will insist on using

40
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,980
"Tian Kong Zhi Wai" as

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,260
the theme song for your comeback.

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,180
Mi Ya,

43
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,180
he has already dumped you.

44
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,850
Xiang Kong break up with me

45
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,970
for my own good.

46
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,250
And my feelings toward him

47
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,250
have never change.

48
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,890
I believe its the same

49
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,210
for Xiang Kong.

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
No matter you agree or not,

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,840
I want to be with Ji Xiang Kong.

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Are you crazy?

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,200
You are betting on

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
everything you have now

55
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
for Ji Xiang Kong.

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
Do you know how much effort I have put in

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,740
for you to have all this?

58
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,180
Have you forgotten?

59
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
I didn't forget.

60
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,260
Its me

61
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,980
who practice until

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
2am everyday

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,900
and wake up 6am

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
for schedules.

65
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,820
365 days,

66
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,540
I didn't even rest

67
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,340
during new year.

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,740
How hardworking have I been?

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,860
Have anyone understand?

70
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,500
That's because you chose this path.

71
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,580
So you should accept it.

72
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,370
You need to be responsible for your fans.

73
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,370
Your behaviour

74
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,730
needs to fulfill their expectations.

75
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
They doesn't want you to be in a relationship,

76
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,090
so you have no rights to be in a relationship.

77
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,070
But I am a human.

78
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,710
But you are not ordinary human.

79
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,270
You enjoyed

80
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,630
the fame of a superstar,

81
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,630
so all the hardship and give in

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,390
are necessary.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,590
If Ji Xiang Kong really love you,

84
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,070
he shouldn't have hold up on you.

85
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,230
Mi Ya,

86
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,310
don't ruin yourself.

87
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,230
Since you are back,

88
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,580
work hard

89
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,780
and find yourself a place in China.

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,460
Today,

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
I just got a new event.

92
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,720
You will be the special appearance guest.

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't worry.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
I will complete my job.

95
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,600
But this time for Xiang Kong,

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,200
I will never give up.

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm tired.

98
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,920
Yesterday,

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
Class 3 are quite good in playing.

100
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,480
Yes.

101
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,780
What are you all doing?

102
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,980
Did you help to give my sister likes?

103
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,300
I do it everyday okay?

104
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,220
Why is the statistics so low?

105
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,260
Why did Qiao Xin have so many?

106
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,220
What are you looking at?

107
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,060
Gu Jia Yi is really a goddess.

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,380
A prefect goddess.

109
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,460
Xia Ling,

110
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,380
look.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,020
Gu Jia Yi is looking at  you.

112
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,330
Stop looking.

113
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,930
What are you looking at?

114
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,570
What are you looking at? Quick!

115
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,490
Post a tweet.

116
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,290
Quick!

117
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,430
Let us congrats VNG

118
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,950
2 vs 0, winning Meng Hu!

119
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,710
Winning another round!

120
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,030
That's great!

121
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,830
VNG won! Congrats VNG!

122
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,310
I will treat three of you milk tea!

123
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,510
What flavour do you want to drink?

124
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,100
They are set to win-

125
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,460
Pei Xi,

126
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,940
You are not training in the team,

127
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,060
what are you back for?

128
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,660
The enemy trembled with fear.

129
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh my, did I see wrongly?

130
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
What?

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,800
You-

132
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,720
You are smiling while looking at Ji Xiang Kong!

133
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,160
I didn't.

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,880
Don't deny.

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
I saw it clearly.

136
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
Why are you smiling so happily

137
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,880
when VNG won?

138
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,590
On the seasonal competition,

139
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
it will be more interesting

140
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,270
to meet Ji Xiang Kong.

141
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,950
Why did I found

142
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,110
your comment

143
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,110
a complement?

144
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,010
Congrats for the 5 consecutive wins.

145
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,600
Congrats to you too.

146
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,600
For being second in the Next Star's

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,350
online voting.

148
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,430
Good comment.

149
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,980
Second?

150
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,860
Since when did my popularity

151
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,300
became so high?

152
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,740
Brother Xia Tian,

153
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,180
Can I

154
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,980
apply for a 2 hour leave?

155
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,690
Where are you going?

156
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,050
Sending video to Luo Tian?

157
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,050
Of course.

158
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,320
You really got yourself a master?

159
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
He's so busy

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
yet still needs to watch my

161
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
explaination videos

162
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
So I've been thinking of

163
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,900
how to thank him.

164
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,940
He...

165
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,820
Other than work,

166
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,260
he's not interested in anything.

167
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,340
In better terms, he's a workaholic.

168
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
In bad terms,

169
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,340
he's an idiot in life.

170
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,580
Really?

171
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,860
In our team back then,

172
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,460
he even have to use our cups.

173
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,500
I got it!

174
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,780
What are you so surprised?

175
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,660
Thanks Brother Xia Tian.

176
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,140
I will make a move first.

177
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,740
Bye bye.

178
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,290
I have not approve the leave yet.

179
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,810
Thank you Brother Xia Tian.

180
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,750
Ceo Guo,

181
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,110
GDV is indeed different.

182
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,110
It's much stronger than You Xing.

183
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,430
Our GDV,

184
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,630
is lack of female commentators who is

185
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,430
as good image,

186
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,070
as talented like you.

187
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,550
I still need you

188
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,510
to give me more opportunity.

189
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,630
Of course.

190
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,510
Teacher Luo.

191
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,790
You all know each other?

192
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,030
Of course.

193
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,630
I used to go Dream Tourist often.

194
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,950
Listening to Teacher Luo's review

195
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,150
and learn from Teacher Luo.

196
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,910
That's great that you know each other.

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,100
Luo Tian,

198
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220
Qiao Xin is now

199
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,300
Next Star's

200
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,660
famous winner.

201
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,020
If you have time,

202
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,220
do give her more attention.

203
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,340
Next Star,

204
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,340
is professional competition.

205
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,520
Most importantly is the professional talent.

206
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,840
I hope to see your exciting performance

207
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,280
on the competition,

208
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
Don't worry.

209
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
I will work hard for it.

210
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,200
After all,

211
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm who am I now

212
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,280
based on

213
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,680
my own ability.

214
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm not like some other people

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,680
who love short cuts

216
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,800
and ask for people to support them.

217
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,560
Using other opponents' gossips

218
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,360
and got a lot of

219
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,910
good reviews.

220
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,990
So sorry.

221
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,550
I think my emotions

222
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,350
got a bit exaggerated.

223
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,070
Why did I say so much?

224
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,230
I really hope that

225
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,500
there is

226
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
a fair competition.

227
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Qiao Xin, don't worry.

228
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,940
I will look into

229
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,380
this case.

230
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,740
Thank you CEO Guo.

231
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,580
CEO Guo,

232
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,940
I've something on, will make a move first.

233
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,130
Sure, go ahead.

234
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,570
Teacher Luo, bye.

235
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,570
Qiao Xin,

236
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,970
I will give you a lift.

237
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,290
Okay.

238
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,180
Doing all these useless stuff.

239
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,940
Hello.

240
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,300
Teacher Luo, Miss Qiu is looking for you.

241
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,220
Teacher Luo?

242
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,500
Ask her to wait for me at the commenting room.

243
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,540
Okay.

244
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,990
You should really reflect

245
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,750
if you really have the rights

246
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,390
to stand at this position.

247
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,830
Teacher Luo.

248
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,030
Sorry.

249
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,030
I just wanted to wait for you here.

250
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,590
What brings you here?

251
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,190
To thank you

252
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,340
for your guidance,

253
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,940
I've prepared a small gift.

254
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,460
Hope you will like it.

255
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,500
What is it about?

256
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,440
This is

257
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
my game review.

258
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,920
I have seen a lot of

259
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
your game review videos.

260
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,600
Today,

261
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to see your reaction on the spot.

262
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,380
Let's start.

263
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,380
But Teacher Luo,

264
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,820
I...

265
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,500
I am not prepared.

266
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,260
Live reaction,

267
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,580
does that need any preparation?

268
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,210
If you doesn't want to start,

269
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,690
then I will make a move.

270
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,810
Teeacher Luo, Teacher Luo.

271
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,170
Today my game review is

272
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
the first competition

273
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,360
in the new version of Dian Feng,

274
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
VNG versus Xiao Long.

275
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,520
Don't rush,

276
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,960
take your time.

277
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,590
At 21 minutes

278
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,870
36 seconds,

279
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,110
both parties started their team match.

280
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,110
This team match

281
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,780
should be the most crucial match

282
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,620
in this competition.

283
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,380
Take note of your speed and tone.

284
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,620
At 21 minutes

285
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,820
36 seconds,

286
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,420
both parties started their team match.

287
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,940
This should be the most crucial match

288
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,380
in this competition.

289
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,540
5 person from Xiao Long

290
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,060
versus 4 person from VNG

291
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,060
This team match

292
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,060
if its not Pei Xi,

293
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,890
VNG might be defeated.

294
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,370
From your comments,

295
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,330
I couldn't tell

296
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,570
your love for Dian Feng.

297
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,330
I...

298
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,080
I...

299
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Sorry Teacher Luo,

300
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,640
I didn't control my tone well enough.

301
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,640
Don't call me Teacher Luo.

302
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,080
If you have no interest

303
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
in this sports,

304
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,080
you have no rights

305
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,140
to stand in front of me.

306
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,820
If I don't love Dian Feng,

307
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,260
I...I...

308
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,940
I won't stand in front of you.

309
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,900
Really?

310
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,780
A good commentator

311
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,380
will not need to spam supporting post

312
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,420
to get her position.

313
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,100
Spam supporting post?

314
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,860
Teacher Luo, I...

315
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,540
I have never

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,740
spam any supporting post

317
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,890
There must be some misunderstanding.

318
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,810
Give me some time,

319
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,690
I will investigate it.

320
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,130
I got to go back to work.

321
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,310
Bye Teacher Luo.

322
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Teacher Luo,

323
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
The weather have turn colder,

324
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
your gastric is not very good,

325
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
so drink more warm water.

326
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,600
This brother plays quite good.

327
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,720
Yes, he's from Class 5 right?

328
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,720
Yes, Class 5.

329
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,680
I always thought is Class 3.

330
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,150
No, is James very strong?

331
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,550
Isn't that my sister?

332
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,910
So that's your sister.

333
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030
Introduce her to us.

334
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,030
Go away.

335
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,910
Don't be so narrow minded.

336
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,630
Don't ever think of that.

337
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,310
You all go see

338
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,620
Gu Jia Yi's cheerleading competition.

339
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,740
Okay.

340
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
We will wait for you, be quick!

341
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,340
Sister.

342
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,460
Sister.

343
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,220
What brings you to my school?

344
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,100
I'm here for you.

345
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,260
For me?

346
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,770
This is your first time

347
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,650
to my school right?

348
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,890
Are you hungry? Why not

349
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,890
let's go eat something.

350
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,370
It's okay.

351
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,130
I came to find you for one thing.

352
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,810
Stop doing

353
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,130
all the unnecessary stuff.

354
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,130
Sister, you knew everything?

355
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,610
I just want to help you.

356
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,090
Do you think its helping me?

357
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,970
Xia Ling,

358
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,970
no matter what you do,

359
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,320
I will never forgive you all.

360
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,720
I just want to

361
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,040
live quietly by myself.

362
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
Do you not understand?

363
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Sister,

364
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,110
what have I done wrong?

365
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,230
Don't call me sister.

366
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,910
I will take care of

367
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,390
my own business.

368
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,870
Xia Ling,

369
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,390
keep your sympathy.

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
I don't need it.

371
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,300
Let's look at this statistic.

372
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,300
In recent winning competition,

373
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,380
Bao Long

374
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
uses battle car

375
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,060
and Dian Feng these two heroes.

376
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,540
There's a outbreak in the early stage.

377
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,060
In the team battle at the later stage,

378
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,090
they cooperates very well.

379
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,490
So we need to strategize

380
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,490
when we are choosing.

381
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,610
Qi Yue,

382
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,570
these few days,

383
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,210
you should practice more of

384
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,370
the hero Qi Heng.

385
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,800
What?

386
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,040
Qi Yue,

387
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,800
we are discussing about the strategy,

388
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,280
please put down your phone.

389
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm listening.

390
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,380
Leader ask you to practice more Zhi Heng.

391
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,260
I got it.

392
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,900
Is there any thing else?

393
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,700
No more.

394
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,700
Then I will go off first.

395
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,300
Bye.

396
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,260
Leader,

397
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,740
if you have anything else,

398
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,660
tell me,

399
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,540
I will convey it to Brother Qi.

400
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,780
Next match,

401
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,850
we are still playing double moon matching,

402
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,050
you two can practice more.

403
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,730
Okay, no problem.

404
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,610
Okay,

405
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,090
that's all for today.

406
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,250
Dismiss.

407
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,110
Sister Wen.

408
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,990
Sister Wen.

409
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,630
I have a look at

410
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,830
Qi Yue's recent three competitions.

411
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,350
Statistics are not very stable.

412
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,430
He's too full of himself recently.

413
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,830
Seven consecutive wins.

414
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,470
He's the MVP of every competition.

415
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,550
Maybe that's why.

416
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,590
I will ask Li Gan

417
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,140
to communicate with him.

418
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,780
And you,

419
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,380
don't be too stress about it.

420
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,380
Go back earlier and rest.

421
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,260
Relax.

422
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,880
Hi everyone, I am Qiu Ying

423
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
Today I am commenting about

424
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,760
Dian Feng 2017

425
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,680
World Finals Competition.

426
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,240
On the third match,

427
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,040
Chuang Qi vesus Chao Gan.

428
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,430
The start of team match

429
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,230
the Torns Queen, Shan Shuo enters the crowd

430
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,230
and releases the third skills

431
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,070
to defeat battle car.

432
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,070
But beside the battle car

433
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,350
is Megaera.

434
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:17,950
This time,

435
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,990
this time...

436
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,900
she uses one skill to hold up the Torns Queen.

437
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,500
Both cooperates and release

438
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,300
This translator application

439
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,620
is even more natural than me.

440
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,820
The Sword King choose

441
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,020
to attack into the crowd from the side.

442
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,900
Start of the killing move.

443
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,780
But while he

444
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
dash out half way,

445
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,890
suddenly

446
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,650
he got send back

447
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,450
by one skill.

448
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,850
Why are you here?

449
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,090
The training is over

450
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,090
so I came out for a walk.

451
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,730
Okay. Why?

452
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:38,690
Why are you

453
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,850
so depressed?

454
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,450
Tomorrow is the

455
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,170
finals for Next Star.

456
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,850
I was listening to my game comments

457
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,010
and its still so bad.

458
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,450
Everytime Teacher Luo

459
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,000
is always so full of feelings

460
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,840
but when it comes to me,

461
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,520
I sound like I am completing a mission.

462
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,880
I've tried many ways.

463
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,760
But its all useless.

464
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,880
I don't even feel like going now.

465
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Do you know

466
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,230
what's most important

467
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,310
before exams?

468
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,710
It's not last minute revision,

469
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
But to relax.

470
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,190
At this moment,

471
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,310
stop listening to all these.

472
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,150
Give me the earpiece.

473
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,820
Let you listen to

474
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,940
my playlist.

475
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
Every time before competition,

476
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,060
I will listen to all these songs

477
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
to relieve some stress.

478
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,020
It's very useful.

479
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,300
Oh ya,

480
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,460
close your eyes.

481
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:34,950
Didn't I ask you

482
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,030
to close your eyes?

483
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,910
How is it?

484
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,110
Are you feeling better?

485
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,750
This song

486
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,230
is so nice.

487
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,150
As long as you put down your concerns,

488
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,870
be confident,

489
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,510
be focus,

490
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,270
put in all you got,

491
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,420
you definite can do it.

492
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,540
Don't forget

493
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,540
our agreement

494
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,300
to go to the peak of the world together.

495
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,400
Oh ya,

496
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,400
Ji Xiang Kong,

497
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
there's something

498
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,320
I actually

499
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
wanted to ask you

500
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
very long ago.

501
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,560
Actually...

502
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,150
actually...

503
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,270
Quick look!

504
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,790
Mi Ya got catch

505
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,310
meeting with a guy at night.

506
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,670
Heard that she came back this time

507
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,550
using

508
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,150
Tian Kong Zhi Wai

509
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,070
as her singles album

510
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,470
to find back her first love.

511
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,940
What happened?

512
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,050
I forgot.

513
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,050
You are Mi Ya's hardcore fan.

514
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,170
Why?

515
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,170
She's in a relationship

516
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,770
and you are sad?

517
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,410
You already said I'm a hardcore fan,

518
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,610
why would I be sad?

519
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,290
As long as it's her choice,

520
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,290
and got her happiness,

521
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,040
I will give her my blessing.

522
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,040
Oh ya,

523
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,200
what did you want to ask just now?

524
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,910
Tomorrow is the

525
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,910
Next Star's finals.

526
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,750
You will be there to root for me

527
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,430
right?

528
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,580
Of course.

529
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,420
Tony.

530
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,820
The rumor about me and Ren Xu

531
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,820
is it all your doings?

532
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,380
Ren Xu is very famous now.

533
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,380
You just came back

534
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,300
this will help to boost

535
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,060
your popularity.

536
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,940
Didn't you say

537
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,580
I have no rights to be in a relationship?

538
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,500
You met Ji Xiang Kong privately,

539
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,610
and people caught it.

540
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,850
This is what I can do

541
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,610
to save the situation.

542
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:54,970
Do you know that?!

543
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,210
Then just expose us.

544
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,250
Expose who?

545
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,450
Ji Xiang Kong?

546
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,130
Do you know

547
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,970
what kind of person he is?

548
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,610
How bad his reviews are?

549
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,200
If you were together with this kind of people,

550
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,440
it will affect your image.

551
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,280
Do you know that?

552
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,840
That's because they

553
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,400
doesn't understand Xiang Kong.

554
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,920
Ji Xiang Kong,

555
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,340
is a very capable person.

556
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,500
He's the most passionate

557
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,500
person I have seen.

558
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,340
I have never feel ashame

559
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,620
being with him.

560
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,980
Mi Ya,

561
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,140
are you crazy

562
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,180
because of love?

563
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,460
It's been so many years.

564
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,060
Even if you never change,

565
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,340
it doesn't mean that Ji Xiang Kong had never change.

566
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,700
Xiang Kong will not change.

567
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,580
Okay.

568
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,380
There's a girl

569
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,140
who is in good terms with him now.

570
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,420
Her name is Qiu Ying.

571
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,380
Search it yourself if you don't believe.

572
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,150
It's you in the photo right?

573
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,660
So many years,

574
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,140
she's finally back.

575
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
What Ren Xu and etc,

576
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,380
is all to mislead people.

577
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,840
Don't need to care about it.

578
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,600
I know.

579
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
She and Ren Xu is not real.

580
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
But we

581
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
are not what you imagine too.

582
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
What is your relationship with her now?

583
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,640
That day she told me that

584
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,400
she came back this time

585
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,470
all because of me.

586
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,750
Also,

587
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,070
she said that she will stay

588
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,470
even if she needs to give up her job.

589
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,260
But...

590
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,420
You scare to hold her up?

591
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,420
Then what are you worrying about?

592
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,140
Xiang Kong,

593
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,850
you've been single for so many years.

594
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,490
Other than

595
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,330
competition,

596
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,770
isn't it because of

597
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,610
the trauma that Mi Ya

598
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,930
caused previously?

599
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,170
Now she's back,

600
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,810
and wanted a reconcile

601
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,690
why can't you try starting it again.

602
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,590
Hello.

603
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,780
Xiang Kong.

604
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,660
Do not misunderstand.

605
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,260
Ren Xu and I are not in relationship.

606
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,540
It's all company's arrangements.

607
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
I didn't know about it.

608
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,420
I know.

609
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,180
This

610
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,500
is to protect your image.

611
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,740
Thank you for your understanding.

612
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,900
Don't worry.

613
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,620
This kind of situation will not

614
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,180
happen again.

615
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,770
I will tell Tony

616
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,370
to clarify as soon as possible

617
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,290
and tell everyone

618
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,290
the person I love is-

619
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,170
You don't be impulsive.

620
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,010
You are a public figure,

621
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,450
every decision

622
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,760
have to be more careful.

623
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,040
Xiang Kong,

624
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,120
You let go

625
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,120
for my career development

626
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,480
last time,

627
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,940
but when I became more successful,

628
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,180
I realize

629
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,060
as compared to being an idol

630
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,020
you are more important to me.

631
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,220
Shall we meet now?

632
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,260
It's too late tonight.

633
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,260
And the photo

634
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,900
is all over internet now.

635
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,180
If you come out now,

636
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,460
its too dangerous.

637
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,700
What about tomorrow?

638
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,460
Tomorrow I will go to Next Star

639
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,300
as a guest.

640
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,580
Before the competition,

641
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,220
let's meet up okay?

642
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,050
Don't reject me okay?

643
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,650
You must come.

644
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,770
I will wait for you.

645
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,630
Quick.

646
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,630
Which room is it?

647
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,990
It's written here.

648
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,950
Makeup room.

649
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,870
Qiu Ying.

650
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,190
So sorry.

651
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,310
Why are you all here?

652
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:29,950
Qiu Ying,

653
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,550
I tell you

654
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,790
its so crowded out there.

655
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,670
Really, its very crowded.

656
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,630
Your friends from Dream Tourist

657
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,390
are all here.

658
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,390
Then

659
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,990
is Ji Xiang Kong here yet?

660
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,630
Why do you only care about him?

661
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,270
He said that

662
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,630
he will be here to support me.

663
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,220
My Brother Kong will always keep his words.

664
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,700
He will be here soon.

665
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,220
I can't stand it.

666
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,460
Are you two

667
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,300
Ji Xiang Kong's fans?

668
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,760
Oh ya,

669
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,280
I just heard that

670
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,960
Qiao Xin will be the winner.

671
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,040
It can't be.

672
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,760
Don't say any nonsense.

673
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,760
You Xing is the

674
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,320
main sponsor.

675
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,560
I will go to the holding room first.

676
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,480
See you later.

677
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,440
The matter we said just now,

678
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,320
is all on you now.

679
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,430
Teacher Luo.

680
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,790
Hi CEO Liu.

681
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,950
Thank you everyone for today.

682
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,190
I will go back to the makeup room first.

683
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,150
Qiao Xin,

684
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,270
Teacher Luo and I

685
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,790
are looking forward for your performance.

686
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,220
Don't worry.

687
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,220
I won't disappoint you all.

688
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,100
Good.

689
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,620
Let's go.

690
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,980
Do get yourself prepared.

691
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:36,410
Qiu Ying,

692
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,330
come here.

693
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,810
Come over here.

694
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,810
CEO Liu and GDV's CEO Guo

695
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,210
and the judge Luo Tian

696
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,650
send Qiao Xin to the makeup room together.

697
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,930
Looks like

698
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,650
its not a rumor.

699
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,090
I don't believe anyway.

700
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,120
Right.

701
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,080
Don't think of all these.

702
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,320
All the best for later!

703
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,720
Qiu Ying fighting!

704
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,040
Qiu Ying fighting!

705
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,200
Fighting!

706
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,990
What are you looking at?

707
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,110
Sorry Qiu Ying,

708
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,150
I got something on last minute,

709
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,870
so I maybe will be late.

710
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,860
It's okay.

711
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,100
You go ahead with your stuff first.

712
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,580
What happened?

713
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,300
Ji Xiang Kong

714
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,540
said that he got something on last minute

715
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,060
so he will come later.

716
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,020
Didn't you said your Brother Kong

717
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,580
will always keep his words?

718
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,210
Such an important competition for Qiu Ying

719
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,490
and he dares to be late.

720
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,090
He's just late for a while

721
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,490
and didn't say he's not coming.

722
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,490
You let go first.

723
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,320
Then

724
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,680
I will go in and prepare first.

725
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,120
Okay.

726
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,160
go ahead and get ready.

727
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,680
Later the both of us

728
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,040

729
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,800

730
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,900

804
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,740
Thank you!

Hi.

812
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:04,970
Brother.

813
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,690
Can you help

814
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,720
me to scan this QR code?

815
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,160
No...this is my sister

816
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,040
taking part in this competition.

817
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,480
Can I have one minute of your time?

818
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,640
The longest distance of

819
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,640
Jin Can's wound skill

820
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,800
is how much?

821
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,940
A, 800. B, 1000.

822
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,620
C, 1200. D,1400.

823
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,620
Please answer.

824
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,220
This round Qiao Xin is faster.

825
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,100
What to do?

826
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,260
Qiao Xin's speed

827
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,140
is really too fast.

828
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,260
Indeed is You Xing's

829
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,940
best female host.

830
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,620
Okay, Qiao Xin please reply.

831
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,460
Jin Can's wound skill

832
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,180
Although after upgrading the skill,

833
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
is only 1000,

834
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,220
But with some help of the tools,

835
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,780
it can reach up to 1150.

836
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,820
Together with some special movements,

837
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,020
it can reach up to

838
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,890
the longest 1200.

839
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,290
So I choose C.

840
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,090
Congratulations Qiao Xin,

841
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,610
for getting another correct answer.

842
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,150
Couldn't tell that

843
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,150
this Qiao Xin is quite impressive.

844
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,870
Every time she got the question,

845
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,350
she can answer without thinking.

846
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,750
I tell you,

847
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,910
even professional gamers like me

848
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,910
couldn't be like her.

849
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,070
There must be something fishy.

850
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,150
Then...

851
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,790
Will it be...

852
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,510
will it be that

853
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,430
she already knew the answer beforehand.

854
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,790
Choose D.

855
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,750
Correct.

856
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,230
I choose C. Another correct answer!

857
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,030
I choose A.

858
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,740
It's correct.

859
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,220
B C D.

860
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,500
It's correct again!

861
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,620
Choose A.

862
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,180
D.

863
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,600
Congrats Qiao Xin

864
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,920
for getting it right.

865
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,960
Sister must get the next question.

866
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,720
Okay, next.

867
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,720
Next question,

868
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,520
everyone please get ready.

869
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,320
Question is

870
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,160
Ah Xin's first attack...

871
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't care,

872
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,200
just snatch the chance first.

873
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,240
26-31.

874
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,480
B28-31.

875
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,590
C30-32.

876
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,070
D33-38.

877
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,870
Please answer.

878
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,340
Okay,

879
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,900
Qiu Ying got it this time.

880
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,740
Please answer.

881
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,660
Do take note

882
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,820
we have to answer it within the timing.

883
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,730
Why is she not answering?

884
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,570
Qiu Ying fighting.

885
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,330
Ya, quick answer.

886
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,010
This is very easy Qiu Ying.

887
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,370
She must be thinking.

888
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,890
At first, in Dian Feng Hero's

889
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,810
first attack

890
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,050
the lowest is

891
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,170
Pan God.

892
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,960
After that,

893
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,960
five heroes from Xuan Tian got added in,

894
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Ah Xin snatch away

895
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
the title of the lowest.

896
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,190
When the hero's attack

897
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,510
is lower than twenty eight,

898
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,550
he's unable to attack army's protection

899
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,230
and undergo another attack.

900
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,510
So,

901
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,750
it must be bigger than twenty eight.

902
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,540
I choose B.

903
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,140
Okay.

904
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,300
Congrats Qiu Ying

905
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,620
its the correct answer.

906
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,220
Qiu Ying!

907
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,100
Qiu Ying!

908
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,060
You are the best!

909
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,020
Qiu Ying!

910
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,820
Hi!

911
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,260
Can I

912
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,140

913
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,980

914
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,540

916
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,180

917
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,020
Please okay?

918
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,620

919
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:18,930

Thank you!

923
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,490
Thank you. Bye bye.

924
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,410
Hi there.

925
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,800
Okay,

926
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,840
the competition now

927
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,040
is getting more exciting.

928
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:31,960
Currently,

929
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,960
there's one last question.

930
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,480
Number 2 is Qiu Ying,

931
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,840
and number one is Qiao Xin.

932
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,060
They are only ten points apart.

933
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,780
So who will be the final winner

934
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,100
is still unknown.

935
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,540
Please listen

936
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,860
to the last question.

937
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,620
How should the commentator react

938
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,660
if the screen suddenly blackout during commenting?

939
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,140
It's like this, Qiu Ying,

940
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,820
The answer for this question

941
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,980
is very broad,

942
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,740
are you sure

943
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,980
you want to the answer

944
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,220
without listen to the options?

945
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,740
Or you are too nervous

946
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,260
and press it accidentally?

947
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,290
What are you laughing at. Stop laughing!

948
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,450
She just got the chance to answer earlier

949
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,810
and are still thinking of the answer.

950
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,890
This kind of question is not just answering

951
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,370
a few numbers.

952
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,850
Is there any correct answer?

953
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,110
If she does not take note,

954
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,390
she will be out of topic.

955
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,590
Qiu Ying.

956
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,190
Please answer.

957
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,350
As this question

958
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,710
as a time restriction

959
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,630
so you need to answer

960
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,110
within the given time.

961
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:29,750
If not,

962
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,430
it will be consider as wrong answer.

963
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,030
If...

964
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,590
while I am commenting,

965
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,070
and it suddenly dark out,

966
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,310
I will stay put on the commenting stage,

967
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,310
and use all my means

968
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,860
to keep the audiences' focus

969
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,100
on the

970
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,620
expectations of the competitions.

971
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,820
And not worsen

972
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,180
the impact the audience got

973
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,080
from the sudden situation.

974
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,160
I think this answer

975
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,800
is really

976
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,040
so Qiu Ying.

977
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,160
I remember before this

978
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,040
you were doing a program at Vancouver right?

979
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,320
Then you will dance and sing

980
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,040
to solve

981
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,760
the incident.

982
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,960
Are you going

983
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,040
to dance and sing

984
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,640
whenever

985
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,480
you met any incident?

986
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,630
This Ah Can

987
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,550
is obviously

988
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,030
digging a hole for Qiu Ying.

989
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,790
It's just good luck.

990
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,030
The most simple way

991
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,660
is to verify and tell the audience the truth

992
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,580
that cause the dark out.

993
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,420
But this will affect

994
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,140
audiences' expectation towards the competition.

995
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,340
But if it's me,

996
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,060
I will try my best

997
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,010
to lighten the atmosphere,

998
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,250
console the audiences.

999
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,410
Commentator's profession

1000
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,930
does not only reflect

1001
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,210
on accurate commenting,

1002
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,370
quick analyzing,

1003
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:48,810
but also reflect on

1004
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,690
if a commentators can be the bridge

1005
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,330
of the audiences and the competition

1006
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,530
during the incident.

1007
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,970
Respecting the audiences

1008
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,240
and let them feel passionate

1009
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
about the competition.

1010
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:02,800
So,

1011
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,800
have you finish answering?

1012
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,080
I've finish answering.

1013
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,800
The correct answer is

1014
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,230
adjust the audiences' feelings

1015
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,830
and continue the commenting.

1016
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,150
Congratulation Qiu Ying,

1017
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,390
for answering correctly.

1018
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,630
Bravo!

1019
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,420
How is it?

1020
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,180
Not bad right?

1021
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,700
I feels that she has the potential.

1022
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,500
Okay, Qiu Ying have answer this correctly

1023
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,820
and manage to catch up with the scores

1024
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,100
and is the number one together with Qiao Xin.

1025
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,540
Let us congratulate

1026
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,580

1029
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,610

00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,640

1037
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,020
No way,I'm too nervous.

1038
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,740
One more time.

1039
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,780
Hi everyone, I am Fu Mi Ya.

00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,060

1043
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:37,970
What are you writing?

1044
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,830
What are you looking at?

1045
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,790
You sit other there.

1046
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,270
You go sit other there.

1047
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,150
Do you know

1048
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,630
when you look the most beautiful?

1049
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,950
When?

1050
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,510
When you are serious.

1051
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,510
So irritating.

1052
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,950
I am very nervous.

1053
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,000
Hi everyone,

Stop looking. First time.

1063
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,390
You are so hardworking

1064

00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,550

1074
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,280

1075
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,360
Is it very thrilling?

1076
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,080
But

1077
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,680

Confidence and hardworking.

1081
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,430
I can't wait for your

1082
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,430

1083
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,110
My second segment

1084
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,510
is live commenting.

1085
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,620
If you are free,

1086
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,180

1087
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,660

I'm here to watch your competition.

1089
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
You say if I'm free or not?

1090
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,380
Okay.

1091
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
I shall not disturb your preparation.

1092
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,900
I will go look for Li Yi Xuan they all.

1093
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,020
See you later.

1094
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,740
All the best.

1095
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,940
All the best.

1096
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,610
Let go.

1097
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,530
Mi Ya.

1098
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,050
You are now the guest.

1099
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:08,850
We are recording

1100
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,210
can you be more professional?

1101
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,400
Tony.

1102
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,400
Qiu Ying's smile

1103
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,280
and the way she work hard

1104
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,160
is just like me five years ago.

1105
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,800
If Xiang Kong really likes her,

1106
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,940
that means he found me

1107
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,180
on her.

1108
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,660
I knew it.

1109
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,700
There's always me

1110
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,740
in Xiang Kong's heart.

1111
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,780
I go look for him.

1112
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,460
Mi Ya,

1113
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,700
face the reality.

1114
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,020
Just now Ji Xiang Kong

1115
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,220
came to look for me.

1116
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,900
He ask me to tell you

1117
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,020
to forget him

1118
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,260
and be back yourself.

1119
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,500
Can you?
