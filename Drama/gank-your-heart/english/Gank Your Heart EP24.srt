[Episode 24]

3
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,740
This is so cool.

4
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,940
Of course.

5
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,250
It's all designed by my Brother Sun.

6
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,730
Be careful of this.

7
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,930
Don't spoil it.

8
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,850
Brother Sun.

9
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,310
Qiu Ying.

10
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,670
Yes.

11
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,070
Xiang Kong always mention about you.

12
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,670
Since when?

13
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,390
I'm hungry.

14
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,790
Let'sgo eat something.

15
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,830
Wait,

16
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,670
did you reincarnate from hungry ghost?

17
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,430
I have not self introduce.

18
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,310
Don't need for that. I know you.

19
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,950
You are Sun Ze Yi,

20
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,350
one of the five ancient master.

21
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,670
Did this rascal told you?

22
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,710
No,

23
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,470
I've watched all your competitions.

24
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,550
You are the leader and the commander,

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,230
totally like the soul

26
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,580
of the team.

27
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,220
I'm a bit shy after being

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,580
praised by your girlfriend.

29
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,420
Take a seat first

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,220
and have a chat,

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,680
I will make some good food for you all.

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you Brother Sun.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,200
What are you thinking of?

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Not..

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Nothing.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,760
Let me take a look at

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,640
your game analysis.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,200
Then...

40
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,500
Not bad.

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,170
There's improvements.

42
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,880
The...

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,400
If you look at me like this,

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,360
I cannot

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
focus.

46
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,150
Are you thirsty?

47
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,990
I will go get you a bottle of water.

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,210
Yi Yi, I'm back.

49
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,570
You're back?

50
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,210
Quick, come here.

51
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,090
Why are you so happy?

52
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,490
I'm

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,440
looking at your

54
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,800
game analaysis that you uploaded.

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Nice!

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
You saw it so fast?

57
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
It's on the hot search

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,560
how can I miss it?

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,260
But I just posted on weibo,

60
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,980
how did it became hot search.

61
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,620
Because this afternoon,

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,580
Qiao Xin

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,340
uploaded a game analysis too.

64
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,980
The netizens

65
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,660
compared both of your

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,340
articles

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,660
and they all said that

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
yours are better.

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,860
Let me take a look.

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,020
Here.

71
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,700
You see.

72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,980
I bet this Qiao Xin

73
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,980
must be very angry now.

74
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,460
Really.

75
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,610
Your game analysis

76
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,450
really

77
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,970
gave her a slap in face.

78
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,770
Well done.

79
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,410
Come.

80
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,530
This Qiao Xin,

81
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,330
only knows how to

82
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,310
act all day long.

83
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,470
Actually,

84
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,870
she just found a ghostwriter

85
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,670
so she needs to be hit by the reality.

86
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,110
Ghostwrite?

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,430
That

88
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,310
means

89
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,670
this is not written by her?

90
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,950
It must be written by Ah Can.

91
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,030
You see

92
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,950
the style and choice of words

93
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,750
is totally Ah Can's style.

94
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,670
I'm telling you this

95
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,190
to remind you

96
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,190
to be careful of Qiao Xin and Ah Can.

97
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,470
They are now a team.

98
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,630
Beware of them.

99
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,110
I know.

100
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,700
But I

101
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,900
don't have time to think of them now.

102
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Whatever they want.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Right, don't think of them.

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,020
Come,

105
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,060
hungry?

106
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,300
Eat this.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Indeed Hot Pot is still the best.

108
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
I will go cook one.

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Sit here.

110
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
I have already cooked it for you.

111
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,240
I'll go get it.

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Love you.

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,520
There's a delivery on the table.

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Open it up and take a look.

115
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,350
Coming coming.

116
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,790
So hot.

117
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,950
Move this away.

118
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,030
Move it move it.

119
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,950
Put here.

120
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,460
What is this?

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,540
Tickets for Mi Ya's new song release?

122
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,700
Who gave that to you?

123
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Mi Ya gave it to me.

124
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,580
She gave it to you?

125
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,700
During the finals of Next Star,

126
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,970
she told me

127
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,170
to go her meeting session

128
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,970
and can go to the backstage.

129
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,170
But I didn't expect her to really send it.

130
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,610
Didn't know that

131
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,250
there's such good stuff.

132
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,050
When can we go?

133
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,850
You faster eat.

134
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,770
So happy!

135
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,670
Are you free tomorrow

136
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,510
5pm?

137
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,750
I have a surprise for you.

138
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,190
Okay.

139
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,180
As for the candidate for the advertisement,

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,180
why don't you consider Qi Yue?

141
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,540
He is the MVP

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,860
of this tournament.

143
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
Xiang Kong is here.

144
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,820
Let me introduce

145
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,980
this is our VNG's leader

146
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
Ji Xiang Kong.

147
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,170
Hi.

148
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,410
Hi.

149
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,930
I have been following VNG's competition

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
and really salute your skills.

151
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,440
Actually I am a Dian Feng fan

152
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,760
if there's a chance,

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,160
I hope we can play together.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,780
This is my honour.

155
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,340
But Miss Mi Ya is so busy

156
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
and is also a public figure

157
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,140
who needs to be careful of your behaviours,

158
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,060
I doubt you will have many chances

159
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,060
to play Dian Feng right?

160
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,420
Maybe it is before that

161
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,460
but I have already

162
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,620
discuss with my management company,

163
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,020
my work focus

164
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,060
will shift back to China

165
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,860
and especially with Dian Feng

166
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,980
collaboration.

167
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,580
It's like this,

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,420
Miss Mi Ya

169
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,060
have a lot of new endorsement recently

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,660
and specially appointed to interact

171
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,620
with VNG.

172
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,620
VNG is my favourite team

173
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,730
and I hope to bring more

174
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,890
resources for everyone

175
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,970
so that you all can focus

176
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,970
in your competitions.

177
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,170
As for the advertisement candidate,

178
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,310
I hope it's Ji Xiang Kong.

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,070
Not sure

180
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,630
if you will be willing to do it.

181
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
Our leader

182
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,630
is your super fan.

183
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,390
He must be very happy.

184
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,070
Xiang Kong

185
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,110
express your decision.

186
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,860
Hope our cooperation with a pleasure one.

187
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
Why are you

188
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,640
so quiet the whole trip?

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Are you

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,920
angry that

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,160
I went to your team?

192
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,510
No.

193
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,070
I was thinking of something else.

194
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,550
Go back early.

195
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,830
Xiang Kong.

196
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,380
I am too selfish last time.

197
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,860
I ask you to

198
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,140
help in my career growth

199
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,140
but I neglected

200
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,980
that you are in your downs during that time

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,300
and you also need accompany.

202
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,970
I won't do it again.

203
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,050
This time

204
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,090
I will support you

205
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,090
with what I have got

206
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,130
over the years

207
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,970
and help you fulfill your dreams.

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,080
If two wants to carry on

209
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
it doesn't mean that one

210
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
have to sacrifice for another one

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,950
what it take is the accompany

212
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,310
and helping each other.

213
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,910
Your success today

214
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,870
is not because of me.

215
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,550
So

216
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,180
you don't need to make up for that.

217
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,860
When I see you shining

218
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,780
on the stage,

219
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
I know that the decision

220
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,740
is the right one.

221
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,620
But I regretted.

222
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,380
When I reach the peak

223
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,340
that I thought

224
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,020
I realise

225
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,500
no matter how beautiful the scenery is,

226
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,210
it's nothing with your accompany.

227
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,080
Xiang Kong,

228
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,960
can you help with something?

229
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Give me a moment.

230
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,460
Please don't go.

231
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,820
Xiang Kong,

232
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,940
do you remember this guitar?

233
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,140
This Taylor

234
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,740
have been with me for years.

235
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,460
Even though the colour is old,

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,060
but the tone is very good.

237
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,700
Take a look.

238
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,700
Can I pay by monthly installment?

239
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,010
Or can I work for you?

240
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,450
Taylor's guitar.

241
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,210
Where did you get the money

242
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,690
to afford such an expensive guitar?

243
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,830
Actually,

244
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,630
it's not as expensive as you thought.

245
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,270
This is a second hand guitar.

246
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,390
But the tune is very nice.

247
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,630
Listen.

248
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,670
The tune is nice

249
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
but it's old,

250
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,950
so it's hard to tune.

251
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,710
But don't worry,

252
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,110
I have already learn how to tune it.

253
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,910
Next time,

254
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,150
I will tune it

255
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,670
before you plays it.

256
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,830
Then I must

257
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,670
use this guitar forever,

258
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,430
so that you will tune it for me

259
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,790
forever.

260
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,550
How is it?

261
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,110
Okay.

262
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,380
You said you will

263
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,060
help me tune it forever.

264
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,740
Will you still

265
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,140
tune it for me now?

266
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Okay.

267
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,060
Xiang Kong.

268
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,140
Sorry,

269
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,900
I forgot how to tune it.

270
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,380
I got to go.

271
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,460
Xiang Kong.

272
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,870
You insisted on doing it your own way,

273
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,550
agreed to that few endorsements

274
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,790
to help Ji Xiang Kong.

275
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,910
How did it end up?

276
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,310
Did he thank you after knowing?

277
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,030
It's not important.

278
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,550
I've already decided.

279
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,110
I will use

280
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,990
double the time

281
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,030
Xiang Kong waited for me

282
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,990
to make up and wait for him

283
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,180
till he is willing to accept me.

284
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,700
You will regret

285
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,940
because of your

286
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,920
stubborn character.

287
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,240
Isn't you

288
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
chose me

289
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,920
because of my stubbornness

290
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
and accompany me to conquer everything

291
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
till today.

292
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,440
Tony,

293
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,320
don't stop me.

294
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,630
Even if I will regret,

295
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,380
let me be crazy one more time.

296
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,340
Okay?

297
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,850
Mi Ya,

298
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,770
some people won't come back

299
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,010
even if you wait.

300
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,050
Ji Xiang Kong said before

301
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,290
both of you

302
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,850
have changed.

303
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,050
Furthermore,

304
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,730
he has

305
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,290
Qiu Ying now.

306
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,690
Qiu Ying is just my stand in.

307
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
She has my shadow.

308
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,560
So,

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,320
today's new song release

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,750
you arrange her to go backstage find you

311
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,310
is to have it out with her?

312
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,750
To tell her

313
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,070
your past with Ji Xiang Kong

314
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,190
and ask her to leave?

315
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,410
Thank you.

316
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,410
Ah Can Teacher,

317
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,650
not that I am petty,

318
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,490
but we just

319
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,170
complete a game analysis,

320
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,800
Qiu Ying also wrote one.

321
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,040
What does she mean?

322
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,720
Newbie is like that.

323
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,280
Thinking of all ways to stand out.

324
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,360
This is understandable.

325
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,340
But all the comments are saying

326
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,860
her analysis

327
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
is accurate and professional

328
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
while ours

329
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,780
is not up to the standard.

330
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,860
What's going on?

331
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,740
My...

332
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,980
My analysis is not up to the standard?

333
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,980
When I was is GDV,

334
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,820
she don't even know

335
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
what is commenting.

336
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,700
I not capable?!

337
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,940
Ah Can Teacher,

338
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,020
actually

339
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,260
you don't need to be so angry.

340
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,180
This is obviously Qiu Ying

341
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,450
paying people for the good comments.

342
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,570
She used to do this

343
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,770
when she was in You Xing.

344
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,210
She love to put people down

345
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,410
to raise her values.

346
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,010
Okay.

347
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,510
Newbies nowaday

348
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,950
are so arrogant

349
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,270
even before going on to the stage.

350
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,270
I will to let her know

351
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,670
what is called respecting the seniors.

352
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,590
Let's see how great she is.

353
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,510
Thank you. You are welcome.

354
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,860
CEO Guo, are you looking for me?

355
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,140
Take a seat.

356
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,840
Is this article on weibo

357
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,720
written by you?

358
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,600
Yes, it's written by me.

359
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Is there any problem?

360
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,000
There's no problem with the article

361
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
but Qiu Ying

362
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,040
you are still a newbie

363
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,680
so you might be unsure of

364
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,040
culture with GDV.

365
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,990
For GDV to have today,

366
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,710
everyone have to be on the same line,

367
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,830
I don't hope that anyone

368
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,470
will destroy the relationship in between colleagues.

369
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,750
No, CEO Guo,

370
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,300
I don't understand what you mean.

371
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,140
This article is written by me

372
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,820
but I didn't want to destroy

373
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,420
the relationship in between colleagues.

374
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,050
Qiu Ying

375
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,290
you rush for

376
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,530
success.

377
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,250
Write articles to bring down your colleagues

378
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,490
just to stand out.

379
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,290
How do you want

380
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,210
the outsiders to see GDV?

381
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,050
Ah Can Teacher,

382
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,970
I just merely did an analysis

383
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,850
for the competition,

384
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,610
I don't mean to bring down anyone.

385
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,410
Enough enough.

386
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,160
You don't need to explain anymore.

387
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,520
You posted an article

388
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
right after Qiao Xin have posted.

389
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,040
And the angles of the article are about the same.

390
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
Isn't it very

391
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
obvious?

392
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,830
I don't want to see any

393
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,870
internal disputes again.

394
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,230
Do you understand?

395
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,310
CEO Guo-

396
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,060
CEO Guo, the materials you want.

397
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,900
Pardon me

398
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
I overheard your

399
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,140
conversation earlier on.

400
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,820
Why don't I feel that

401
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,700
Qiu Ying's article

402
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,020
is against anyone?

403
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,500
Just because Qiao Xin posted an article,

404
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,980
doesn't mean other cannot post.

405
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,740
Does that mean that

406
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,380
Qiu Ying is attacking someone

407
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,380
when her article

408
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,740
is better than someone else's?

409
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,860
CEO Guo,

410
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,050
GDV

411
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,570
have seventeen commentators

412
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,090
including the interns.

413
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,450
If one wants to stand on the stage,

414
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,090
they need real work.

415
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,290
Furthermore,

416
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,880
Qiao Xin's article

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
is too shallow.

418
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,800
Ah Can,

419
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,000
from your professional point of view,

420
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,400
what do you think?

421
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,700
Teacher Luo

422
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,300
is always right.

423
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,060
Enough.

424
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,700
Stop discussing about this.

425
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,820
Go back to work.

426
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,290
Brother Kong,

427
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,090
you say finally we got

428
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,090
some off days

429
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,690
and you don't ask Qiu Ying out

430
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,150
to sing or what.

431
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,630
If you want to ask Lu Yi Yi out,

432
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,710
just go ahead.

433
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,630
Don't disturb me.

434
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,270
Who say I want to ask her out?

435
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,150
I'm just panicking for you.

436
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,470
Pei Xi has already confess.

437
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,310
Secret Garden?

438
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,910
Isn't this the popular

439
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,070
confess restaurant?

440
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,430
Are you thinking of confessing to Qiu Ying?

441
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,470
My Brother Kong has finally grown up.

442
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,750
It's not easy.

443
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,150
Go go go.

444
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,230
Go help Brother Sun.

445
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,270
Don't close the webpage.

446
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,270
This is very hard to get.

447
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,580
They will only release the reservation for the night

448
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,100
at 3pm everyday.

449
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,100
If you don't hurry, it will be gone.

450
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,980
Go away.

451
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Don't disturb me.

452
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,300
You might not get it with just one computer.

453
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,280
What's that...

454
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,920
Brothers,

455
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
That Chen Qi Meng, Chai Hao Wei,

456
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,680
today

457
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,120
whoever who can help my Brother Kong

458
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
get the reservations of Secret Garden

459
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,520
you will get three days free to

460
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,520
here.

461
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,440
Is it okay, Brother Sun?

462
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,440
I agree.

463
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,440
You see.

464
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,200
Captain Ji,

465
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,840
who are you dating with?

466
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,800
Is it Qiu Ying?

467
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Tell you a good news.

468
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,830
Teacher Luo say

469
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,110
I can go on the commenting stage.

470
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,430
That's great.

471
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,910
I will prepare a feast for you tonight.

472
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,590
This sour taste.

473
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,500
Go go go.

474
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,740
Didn't you say you want to help?

475
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,380
Go and get it.

476
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,500
Okay.

477
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,490
You scared me!

478
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,130
How dare you to be late.

479
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,530
Late?

480
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm not late.

481
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,600
It's just nice 6.30pm.

482
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,560
On the point.

483
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,840
You should be

484
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,800
early than me.

485
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,440
What did you bought?

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,030
A gift for you.

487
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,790
For me?

488
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,990
Let me see.

489
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,950
But you can't open it now.

490
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,750
Why can't I open it now?

491
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,190
You just can't open it now.

492
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,580
If not I will be angry.

493
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,940
Let's go.

494
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
You have not tell me

495
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,020
where are you bringing me to.

496
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,340
Don't care about it.

497
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,500
Quick. So many people.

498
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,020
This way this way.

499
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,900
Isn't the entrance there?

500
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,580
You don't care, just follow me.

501
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
You stepped on me.

502
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay.

503
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,780
Dear audiences,

504
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,740
good afternoon to everyone.

505
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm now at

506
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,410
the press release of

507
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,850
Fu Mi Ya's China first album

508
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,050
"Tian Kong Zhi Wai".

509
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,130
Quick.

510
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,530
What event is this?

511
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,490
So secretive.

512
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,490
And you bring me though the back door.

513
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:40,960
You can meet

514
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
the person that you have been wanting to meet.

515
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Is this a big surprise?

516
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,680
Are you sure you know

517
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,080
who I always wanted to meet?

518
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,080
Of course.

519
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,360
You see.

520
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,580
How is it?

521
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
You brought me to Mi Ya's-

522
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,420
Today is Mi Ya's

523
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,420
new song press release.

524
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,220
She gave me two VIP tickets

525
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,940
and we can meet her backstage

526
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,290
and ask her for autographs.

527
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,890
I want to go out for a while.

528
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,850
Don't be shy.

529
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,770
Let's go. Quick.

530
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,210
Don't be shy, come.

531
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,270
Go in.

532
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,310
Xiang Kong.

533
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,510
Why didn't you tell me you are here?

534
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,030
Or did you saw

535
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,510
my message?

536
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,870
Qiu Ying?

537
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,710
You..

538
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,020
you all...

539
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
know each other?

540
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,200
Come.

541
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,720
Do you remember

542
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,440
during Next Star

543
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,800
competition,

544
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,200
I said that

545
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
I have a friend

546
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,320
who love competitive sports?

547
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,400
He's Xiang Kong.

548
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,470
Also,

549
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,230
we

550
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,470
grow up together.

551
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,830
Right, Xiang Kong?

552
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,730
Mi Ya,

553
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,280
let me introduce to you.

554
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,120
Qiu Ying,

555
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
my girlfriend.

556
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,660
Xiang Kong,

557
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,660
are you blaming me for

558
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,420
not persisting for our love?

559
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,900
You chose Qiu Ying

560
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,340
is it because

561
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,660
she's very similar to me?

562
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,860
Is it because

563
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
she was like the me five years ago

564
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,860
right?

565
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,930
She is indeed very similar with you

566
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,330
but-

567
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,210
Enough.

568
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,450
The love story in between the both of you

569
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,880
have nothing to do with me.

570
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,640
Please don't

571
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,160
drag me into it.

572
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
I doesn't want

573
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,400
to be the tool

574
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,460
that both of you use to test your love.

575
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,940
Qiu Ying. Xiang Kong.

576
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,580
Xiang Kong,

577
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,900
can you give us another chance,

578
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,780
let's start again okay?

579
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,180
Sorry,

580
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,780
I have someone I like already.

581
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
Qiu Ying, listen to my explanation. Qiu Ying!

582
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,620
Qiu Ying!

583
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,860
Sorry.

584
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Listen to my explanation.

585
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,090
You are Mi Ya's first love right?

586
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,690
The song "Tian Kong Zhi Wai"

587
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,970
is for you

588
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,450
right?

589
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,470
The one who she hugged beside the pool

590
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,870
is not Ren Xu,

591
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,630
is you right?

592
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,190
Why didn't you tell me?

593
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,110
Why must you make me so embarrassed?

594
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,030
Qiu Ying, sorry

595
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,990
but

596
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,990
it's not what you're thinking.

597
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,430
Why must you tell her

598
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,870
I am your girlfriend?

599
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,190
Ji Xiang Kong, what am I to you?

600
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,270
You can't forget her.

601
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,740
Why must you make me misunderstood

602
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,860
that you like me?

603
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,380
Qiu Ying, I really like you.

604
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,520
I want you to be my girlfriend.

605
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,280
Really.

606
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
But I can't bring myself

607
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,280
to believe this.

608
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,160
Ji Xiang Kong,

609
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,520
you can't forget her.

610
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
You be friend with me

611
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,400
cause because you can find her shadow

612
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,640
in me.

613
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm just a stand in.

614
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,240
Qiu Ying, it's not what you are thinking.

615
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Listen to my explanation.

616
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,480
Let's go of me, let go.

617
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,960
I don't want to listen to your explanation.

618
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,880
I will wait for you at Secret Garden.

619
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,680
Give me a chance to explain to you.

620
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,830
Hello,

621
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,750
the number you have dialed is unavailable.

622
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,540
Sir,

623
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,620
Sir,

624
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,020
your meal

625
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,300
should I serve it later on?

626
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,200
Thank you.

627
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,480
Okay.

628
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,980
Ji Xiang Kong.

629
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,890
I believe you will

630
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,370
stand on the top of the world.

631
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,410
I hope that day

632
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,010
it's you

633
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,490
who is standing at the commenting stage

634
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,890
announcing to the world that

635
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,450
China team

636
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,810
is the world champion.

637
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,130
Promise.

638
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,730
Promise.

639
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,950
Thank you for riding

640
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,790
pass the low period of my life.

641
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,740
If this is fate,

642
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,460
I hope I can hug you tightly

643
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,420
and accompany you to the top of the world.

644
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,240
Qiu Ying

645
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,920
be strong

646
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,860
and finish this notes.

647
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,220
Forget

648
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,820
about what happened today.

649
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,300
Tomorrow

650
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,740
is a brand new day.

651
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,930
What are you doing so late at night?

652
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,050
Teacher Luo.

653
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,050
What happen

654
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,170
to you?

655
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,630
I got to go.

656
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,630
Wait.

657
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,710
Let me send you back.

658
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,580
Sir,

659
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,420
sorry.

660
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,220
We

661
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,260
are closing.

662
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,960
Okay.

663
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
Sir, sir.

664
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The deposit you paid

665
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,800
includes our restaurant's

666
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,280
special secret garden cake.

667
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,560
If your friend

668
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
couldn't come today,

669
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,800
we can help you

670
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
remake another one next time.

671
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,150
Thank you.

672
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,830
Maybe there's no more next time.

673
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,720
Always

674
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,400
didn't have the chance

675
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,320
to thank you.

676
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,120
I really like the cup.

677
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,430
Sorry,

678
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,470
Teacher Luo

679
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,710
for showing this side of me.

680
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,060
It's okay.

681
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,500
Everyone will have sad moments.

682
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,540
But

683
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,460
I hope that

684
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,300
you can adjust your condition as soon as possible.

685
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,140
As an intern,

686
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,660
you should know

687
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,580
how cruel is the commenting stage.

688
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
If you can't make it

689
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,860
for the upcoming tournament,

690
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,450
maybe you might

691
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,450
even lose the chance of

692
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,730
sending materials.

693
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,970
I got it.

694
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,290
Teacher Luo.

695
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,860
Is it here?

696
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,460
Thank you Teacher Luo.

697
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,380
Sorry for bothering you.

698
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,660
You're welcome.

699
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm going up.

700
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,980
Oh ya.

701
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,460
Here.

702
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,420
Take it.

703
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,780
Go back and take the medicine.

704
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,810
If you really caught a flu,

705
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,730
how are you

706
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,090
going to face the camera and audiences?

707
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,330
Thank you.

708
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,250
Bye bye Teacher Luo.

709
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,710
Bye bye.

710
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,910
You finally came back.

711
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,790
I thought

712
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,430
you got kidnapped by Ji Xiang Kong.

713
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,950
Quick, tell me

714
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,710
what did you all did

715
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,790
today.

716
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,620
What happened?

717
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,780
Why are you so messed up?

718
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,580
Give me your bag.

719
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,660
What happened?

720
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,680
Nothing.

721
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,120
It was raining.

722
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,080
I have no umbrella.

723
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,720
What is Ji Xiang Kong doing?

724
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,160
How can you be drench like this?

725
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm going to shower.

726
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,040
Qiu Ying,

727
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,400
tell me

728
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,200
did Ji Xiang Kong bullied you?

729
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,000
Tell me,

730
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,520
if yes, I will make sure he pay for it.

731
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,510
No.

732
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,030
Yi Yi

733
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,470
I'm cold.

734
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,190
I going to shower first.

735
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,210
Something is not right.

736
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,490
There must be something.

737
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
Hello Lu Reporter

738
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,280
you finally gave me a call.

739
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,840
Do you want to eat supper?

740
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,430
Eat what supper?

741
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,670
I ask you

742
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,670
tonight

743
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,350
did you Brother Kong

744
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,230
ask Qiu Ying out for a date?

745
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,190
Yes.

746
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,670
I even help to reserve the restaurant.

747
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,750
Secret Garden,

748
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,710
super hard to reserve.

749
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,500
It's a restaurant for confession.

750
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,740
Confess?

751
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,340
You don't know?

752
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,140
Oh ya, how was it?

753
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,580
Did they...

754
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,540
I say can your brain

755
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,900
be more clean?

756
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Qiu Ying came back

757
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
all wet

758
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,780
and very unhappy.

759
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,980
I

760
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,820
I see her state,

761
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,900
I didn't dare to ask much.

762
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,370
You say

763
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,650
did you Brother Kong

764
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,050
bully our Qiu Ying again?

765
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,810
Impossible.

766
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,850
My Brother Kong is very gentleman to ladies,

767
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,890
how would he bully Qiu Ying?

768
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,200
Maybe

769
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Qiu Ying rejected my Brother Kong.

770
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,720
Qiu Ying like him so much

771
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,700
it's impossible to reject him.

772
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,260
Wait wait wait wait

773
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,220
what what what?

774
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,540
Enough, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

775
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,460
No point asking you.

776
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,940
Hanging up. Bye.

777
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,250
Such a grown up

778
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,450
and still don't know how to take care of yourself.

779
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,010
Drink some ginger tea and warm up.

780
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,190
No wonder

781
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,470
Mi Ya will fall down on her new song

782
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,710
release event.

783
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,070
You didn't saw the news?

784
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,200
Looks like

785
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,760
Mi Ya won't give up so easily.

786
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,760
Brother Sun,

787
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,960
what should I do now?

788
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,880
Qiu Ying this girl,

789
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,160
even though I only met her once

790
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,550
but can tell that

791
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,790
she won't tolerate

792
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,790
any flaws

793
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,190
in the relationship.

794
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,580
She doesn't want to listen to my explanation.

795
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,780
Both of  you need to

796
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,820
calm down now.

797
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,090
The tournament is

798
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,370
starting few days later.

799
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,890
This is very important to you and Qiu Ying.

800
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,450
No matter you are thinking of yourself

801
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,090
or being responsible for her,

802
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,490
you all should concentrate

803
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,810
on the tournament.

804
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
But I hope that

805
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,960
you can adjust your condition as soon as possible.

806
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
If you can't make it

807
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,240
for the upcoming tournament,

808
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,740
you might even

809
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,980
lost the chance of sending materials.

810
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,020
Hello.

811
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,700
Sorry,

812
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
I know this call

813
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,260
is very sudden.

814
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,140
But I really want to meet you.

815
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,060
Can I?
