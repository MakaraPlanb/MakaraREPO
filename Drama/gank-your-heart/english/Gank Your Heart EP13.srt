00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 13

2
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,100
Okay.

3
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,220
Let's have a look.

4
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,540
Legends has chosen Gong Xi Chang Qing.

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,980
They choose Gong Xi Chang Qing, damn it.

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,090
They must be keeping this strong support hero for Lin Yi Xuan.

7
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,610
Choose Jin Can.

8
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,170
Actually he has the shortest cool down time in the game.

9
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,170
VNG has chosen Jin Can.

10
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,070
Over here, Legends has actually chosen another

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,830
Xuan Tian Hero, Zhi Heng.

12
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,550
Are they asking the support to catch people?

13
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,070
These two heroes are both supporting hero.

14
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,670
Just that Gong Xi Chang Qing is better at

15
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,150
healing and buffing teammates.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,950
And Jin Can tend to be better at ganking.

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,550
He has a higher damage rate among the supporting heroes.

18
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,190
But I really think that today's competition

19
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,590
is getting more and more interesting.

20
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,790
Okay, both sides have completed their selection now.

21
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,830
VNG is one to zero ahead of Legends temporarily.

22
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,030
Second round of new version

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,380
internal testing competition starts now.

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,240
Nice.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
This is the best seat.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,800
Sitting here,

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
I can even see the facial expression

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
of the players on the stage.

29
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
Didn't you say you are going to take pictures?

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
What took you so long?

31
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,030
I was just simply take a few pictures.

32
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,150
I didn't know this stadium is so big.

33
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,430
Stupid.

34
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,260
There's a rumour going round. I heard that

35
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,500
Ji Xiang Kong made a pledge

36
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,540
in front of the Board of Directors of Legends.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,380
If he loses today's internal testing competition,

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,540
he will have to leave Legends.

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,930
So today's competition is a life-and-death battle for him.

40
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,690
Is it for real?

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,050
My news are always reliable, aren't they?

42
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,610
Keep it up...

43
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,250
We're still targeting on Pei Xi this match.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
Break their four protecting one strategy.

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,160
No problem. Break them up in the first six minutes.

46
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,960
Try not to fight.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Understand. Farm for a while.

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Clear bot creeps, clear bot jungle.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,550
Okay, got it.

50
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,190
Catch Pei Xi in the mid.

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,270
Brother Yao, follow me to the mid.

52
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,510
I'll bait them.

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,310
Ambush for a while.

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,830
Okay, I'm on my way.

55
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,500
There's bait in bush.

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,980
Shen Yue, come over to support.

57
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,740
I was trapped by Lu Feng.

58
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,140
Brother Qi, can you go for a while?

59
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,700
Qi Yue, come over here.

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,740
Fine, I'll go.

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,420
Qi Yue managed to arrive in time,

62
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,940
and uses wing play to control Huo Yao.

63
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,700
He has successfully escorted Pei Xi to the bottom of the turret.

64
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,300
Quickly come over here, Brother Yao.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,580
I'm on my way.

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,980
Attack.

67
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,620
I can wrap up.

68
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,260
I've done wrapping up.

69
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,420
We can make it.

70
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,410
Xuan, peel for me.

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,250
One for one.

72
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,690
Awesome.

73
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,010
Ji Xiang Kong is zoning Pei Xi in the early game.

74
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,730
In the middle stage,

75
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,450
force the team to fight under a situation

76
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,410
where Pei Xi's items are not formed.

77
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay, let's see how both sides will react to this end.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Next end, continue to catch Pei Xi.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
Xuan and Li Nan, go jungling at their place.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Okay.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,840
Li Nan, follow me.

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm on the way.

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,420
Captain, Qi Yue and Pei Xi are here.

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,420
Qi Yue is protecting Pei Xi, I can't lay a finger on him.

85
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,980
Don't back out, we can fight with them.

86
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,900
I'll withstand for a while.

87
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,420
We can fight.

88
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,300
I'll control for a while. Attack the initiate first.

89
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,860
Hide in the bush, don't attack first.

90
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,340
I think it's a bit risky for Ji Xiang Kong to withstand like this.

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,220
Can you control it?

92
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,180
I can't.

93
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,300
Here, both Ji Xiang Kong and Huo Yao are lack of blood this end.

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,420
But Lu Feng still hasn't make a move.

95
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
What are they doing?

96
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,540
They must be going back to restore.

97
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,380
There is no pressure in the middle.

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,940
Brother Qi, jungle has been reset.

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,060
Go back to jungling, let's go.

100
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
Qi Yue and Shen Yue went back to jungle.

101
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,860
Lin Yi Xuan, you guys be careful.

102
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,260
Okay.

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,900
Pei Xi must be thinking that we have recalled.

104
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,140
Come on, let's continue to catch Pei Xi.

105
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,730
Three people gank him, we can definitely kill him.

106
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,730
Ji Xiang Kong has made his move.

107
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,570
He is holding on to Pei Xi.

108
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,730
He is attacking Pei Xi without mercy.

109
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,410
Legends is certainly unpredictable.

110
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,210
Captain, you guys be careful.

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,890
There are three people there.

112
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,650
I'll deal with them.

113
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,430
We can fight.

114
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,590
Brother Yao, we have a baron.

115
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
Let me control him first.

116
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,430
Ready...

117
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,110
The last performance was pretty good.

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,990
I will not betray my brothers anymore.

119
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,270
But you already did.

120
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,710
You don't want to be the captain anymore, do you?

121
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,230
Yes.

122
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,030
What about the contract?

123
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,070
So you don't want to renew the contract with company anymore?

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,180
Zhao Yang, you—

125
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,660
You had better think about it carefully.

126
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,020
Let me remind you one last time.

127
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,800
If Ji Xiang Kong is not leaving,

128
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,040
you will be the one to leave.

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Let me tell you clearly.

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Even if you terminate the contract with me,

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,720
I will never betray my brothers ever again.

132
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Huo Yao.

133
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,680
You don't have to reply me so soon.

134
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,760
Think about it carefully.

135
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,870
Hit him.

136
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,310
Don't back out.

137
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,900
Attack.

138
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,460
Don't back out.

139
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,660
I withstand.

140
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,980
Brother Yao, go ultimate.

141
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,300
We can control.

142
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,460
Brother Yao, go for ultimate.

143
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,020
Go ultimate. Brother Yao, what are you doing?

144
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
Brother Yao, go ultimate.

145
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,130
Brother Yao, what are you doing?

146
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,730
That sucks.

147
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,370
Oh no, what is wrong with Huo Yao?

148
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,410
Why is spacing out again?

149
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,170
They actually didn't manage to trap Pei Xi.

150
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,890
Now they are in danger.

151
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,170
What a pity.

152
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,850
They actually got counter killed.

153
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,130
How could this be...

154
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,810
Right, what was Huo Yao thinking.

155
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,530
Hey, you...

156
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,610
Why are you being so worried?

157
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,560
Didn't you tell me,

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,960
that this match determines Ji Xiang Kong

159
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
whether to stay or leave Legends?

160
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,240
So?

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,880
As a friend,

162
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,480
I'll definitely hope that he could win.

163
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,630
No way... Qiu Ying,

164
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,510
are you caring for him?

165
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,310
Let's not talk about it anymore, watch the game.

166
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,070
Lin Yi Xuan is here right now.

167
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,540
He has fully healed Ji Xiang Kong.

168
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,020
But Shen Yue suddenly make a move over here.

169
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
A team fight has started to be breaking out at the mid.

170
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,300
VNG has counter attacked.

171
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,260
As expected, Gong Xi Chang Qing's ganking

172
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,940
is not as good as Jin Can.

173
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,820
And it's a two on three fight.

174
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,420
Such a disadvantage.

175
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,380
We're late.

176
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,740
Brother Kong, back out.

177
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,740
I protect you, you go.

178
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,500
I can't.

179
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,020
Everyone back out.

180
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,620
Disengage.

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,340
We can't fight.

182
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
They were still going smoothly just now.

183
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,410
How could this be?

184
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,210
Because Huo Yao didn't go ultimate.

185
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,010
He did not kill Pei Xi.

186
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,930
Such a pity.

187
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,930
Let's take a look over here,

188
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,120
Qi Yue and Pei Xi have ended Ji Xiang Kong with crowd control.

189
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
I think that's such a pity.

190
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
I think Ji Xiang Kong still can't withstand

191
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,080
Qi Yue and Pei Xi's combo.

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,660
You don't have to be so nervous.

193
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,940
The news that I told you might not be true.

194
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,820
It may be fake, right?

195
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,500
I got no spell.

196
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,500
Defend for a while more.

197
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,140
Can we still defend for a while?

198
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,060
I don't have spell anymore.

199
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,260
I'm dying...

200
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,140
Just push...

201
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,380
Don't rush. We got this.

202
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,660
Let's take a look at VNG over here,

203
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,380
they have already pushed to the base.

204
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,010
Legends's shortest time for revive will have to take five seconds.

205
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,810
It's too late.

206
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,270
Huo Yao, are you out of your mind?

207
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,670
Why did you play so badly?

208
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,470
Xuan, calm down.

209
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,910
Congratulations to VNG

210
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,750
for being the champion of iConquer's

211
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,750
new version internal testing competition.

212
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,030
Congratulations to VNG.

213
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,190
Nice.

214
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,430
Why are you clapping your hands?

215
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,390
That was a good game.

216
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,470
I'm just clapping for it casually. Good game.

217
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,910
You betrayer, I know you did it intentionally.

218
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,500
You are a betrayer.

219
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,180
What Brother Yao done was mistakes.

220
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,500
Mistakes?

221
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,060
First round, you didn't attack when you should.

222
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,260
Second round, you didn't go ultimate when you should.

223
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,780
You were playing badly

224
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,680
in both rounds of downwind matches,

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
how shameless of you to say

226
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,960
that you're a professional gamer.

227
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,800
Do you know that Brother Kong has to leave now?

228
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Lin Yi Xuan.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,760
Three of you, get out.

230
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Hua Yao, you stay here.

231
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,270
I'm not leaving.

232
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,750
I want to listen to my dearest Brother Yao's reason

233
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,190
for deceiving us with my own ears.

234
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,780
Speak up!

235
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,020
Lin Yi Xuan, why don't you go out first.

236
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm not leaving.

237
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,850
Get out!

238
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,770
Xuan, let's go.

239
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,010
Let's go.

240
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,920
Brother Yao, give me a reasonable explanation.

241
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
I hope I guessed it wrongly.

242
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,910
I know,

243
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,540
no matter what I say right now,

244
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,220
it's already too late.

245
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,060
Zhao Yang came to see me.

246
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,740
If I don't do according to what he told me to do,

247
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,140
he will not renew contract with me.

248
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,330
So you just ignored the brothers on the battlefield?

249
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,650
That's not how it is. Coach, I admit

250
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,650
that I was shaken up in the first round.

251
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,240
Coach, I really want to stay.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,760
Coach.

253
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm already 28 years old.

254
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,980
I have been staying in this industry for ten years.

255
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,980
It was all for that trophy.

256
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,060
If Legends doesn't renew the contract with me at this time,

257
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,820
then it will be an end to my career path.

258
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,140
In the second round,

259
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,420
it was indeed my mistakes and I was distracted.

260
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,220
Before I went on stage,

261
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,530
I have already sworn

262
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,650
that I will never betray my brothers again.

263
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,690
I, I would rather leave

264
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,930
than to betray my brothers who fight with me again.

265
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,070
Xiang Kong.

266
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,350
It's all my fault.

267
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,110
I know,

268
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,990
no matter how I explain,

269
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,950
I am sorry to everyone.

270
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm even more sorry to you.

271
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,840
But don't you worry.

272
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
I will make it clear to the board of directors

273
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,280
and tell them it was all because of me.

274
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,600
It has nothing to do with you.

275
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
What are you going to say?

276
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,920
That Zhao Yang threatened you,

277
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,840
and you intentionally lost the game by making mistakes?

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Yes, we trust you,

279
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,470
but will the board of directors do the same?

280
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,230
Once you told them about it,

281
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,590
will you still be able to stay in the team?

282
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,300
Xiang Kong.

283
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,810
The contract has been altered according to your demand.

284
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,850
Here, have a look.

285
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,530
Here, please.

286
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,870
When should I report to Legends?

287
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,150
As long as you've done clearing things up with VNG,

288
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,270
anytime will do.

289
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,700
Sweet.

290
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,340
It's such a wonderful day.

291
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
Such a memorable moment,

292
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,660
I have to take a picture and share it on Weibo.

293
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,140
Come on.

294
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,340
Are you okay?

295
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,380
Director Jin,

296
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,460
I believe you have seen the data last night.

297
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,060
I am responsible for Huo Yao's mistakes.

298
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,730
Before the game started, he did tell me that

299
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,890
he was feeling unwell.

300
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,730
But I did not take it seriously.

301
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,770
You don't have to look for excuses for him.

302
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,750
I know very well about this game.

303
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,910
Huo Yao's mistakes,

304
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,270
to an extent,

305
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,670
it is the problem of Ji Xiang Kong's tactical instruction.

306
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,750
Director Jin, even if you don't trust me,

307
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,030
you should trust Gu Fang's vision.

308
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,550
In order to keep Ji Xiang Kong,

309
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,590
he‘d rather sign

310
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,750
an unequal decommissioning contract with our team.

311
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,910
What do you mean by unequal?

312
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,750
This is business.

313
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,630
Is business unfair?

314
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,940
Coach Luo,

315
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,340
Ji Xiang Kong is the one who made a pledge

316
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,580
in front of Director Jin.

317
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
Manager Zhao,

318
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,220
I think we should look for a time to have a good chat.

319
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,440
Who? Me?

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,760
What is there to talk about?

321
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
Ji Xiang Kong is not responsible for the mistakes of this game.

322
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,400
Aren't you clear about that?

323
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,040
What should I be clear about?

324
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
You are so funny.

325
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,560
Fall game is coming soon.

326
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,200
Besides Ji Xiang Kong,

327
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,670
who is able to become a captain in our team right now?

328
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,030
Director Jin, please think it over again.

329
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,510
Director Jin.

330
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,510
This is the contract of Pei Xi,

331
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,220
he can transfer to our company next week.

332
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,620
Please have a look.

333
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Who is capable and who is not,

334
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,060
this game

335
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,700
has already given an answer.

336
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,610
Brother Xuan,

337
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,450
is Captain Ji still not answering his phone?

338
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,450
Did anything happen to him?

339
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,970
Brother Xuan, don't—

340
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,040
Huo Yao,

341
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,430
go to see the board of directors

342
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,950
and tell them everything right now.

343
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:20,870
Do you hear me?

344
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,630
Brother Xuan,

345
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,590
Coach is negotiating with Director Jin right now.

346
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,870
What if he has already done with the negotiation?

347
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,830
Nonsense.

348
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,420
Don't you know how long has Coach been away?

349
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,580
If there's a result he should have came back by now.

350
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,860
You have no rights to say anything here.

351
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,180
Don't cut in, do you hear me?

352
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,700
Huo Yao.

353
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,420
You are already at this age,

354
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,580
and you are a man,

355
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,980
don't make Captain Ji take the blame for you, do you hear me?

356
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Xuan...

357
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,780
Brother Yao doesn't want it to be like this either.

358
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,940
Xuan, he is our brother.

359
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,210
Did he treat me as brother?

360
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,970
Did he treat Captain Ji as brother?

361
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,170
Let me ask you. Move.

362
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,250
How can you treat Brother Yao that way?

363
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,930
How did he treat me?

364
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,200
How did he treat Captain Ji?

365
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Let me tell you,

366
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,400
if you are standing on his side,

367
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,820
I will never see you as my brother for the rest of my life,

368
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,700
Did you hear me?

369
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,300
I don't want Captain Ji to leave.

370
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,020
But I don't want Brother Yao to leave either.

371
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,820
I...

372
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,140
don't want to lose you as my brother even more.

373
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,100
Didn't we promise to win next year's championship together?

374
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,020
Brother Xuan.

375
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,210
Brother Yao.

376
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,630
Captain Ji can't leave.

377
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,260
This contract is good.

378
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,660
Once Pei Xi is here, the championship for next season

379
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,580
will be well in sight.

380
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,000
It all thanks to Director Jin for your support.

381
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,720
But,

382
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,520
Pei Xi has just joined our company and he is already a captain,

383
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm afraid that some people are jealous of his talent.

384
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,920
And ice him out.

385
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,360
Manager Zhao.

386
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
What do you mean by that?

387
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,600
Nothing.

388
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,870
The company has to build

389
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,230
an environment with strict rules for reward and punishment.

390
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,270
When something happened,

391
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,270
isn't that someone should be responsible for it?

392
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,300
Everyone knows who should be responsible

393
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,700
for the lost of this game.

394
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,780
It is Huo Yao.

395
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,460
It has nothing to do with Ji Xiang Kong.

396
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,300
Coach Luo,

397
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,500
Huo Yao's usual play has been very stable.

398
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,250
You are his coach, it can't be that you don't know about it.

399
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,370
If it wasn't because of Ji Xiang Kong's bad tactic,

400
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,570
will it cause Huo Yao performed badly?

401
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,490
You—

402
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,690
What's wrong with me?

403
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,490
How about this.

404
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,850
Let Ji Xiang Kong confront Huo Yao.

405
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,410
The person who is at fault,

406
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,090
should leave.

407
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,360
Is it fair?

408
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,160
You want them to confront each other?

409
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,280
That's right.

410
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Are you creating an internal conflict for them?

411
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,950
Director Jin,

412
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,510
Coach Luo has become bad.

413
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,670
This won't work and neither that will work.

414
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,390
I have ran out of ideas.

415
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,870
I'll take the responsibility.

416
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,340
I was the one who gave wrong direction in the game,

417
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,900
it has got nothing to do with other people.

418
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,220
Coach Luo, Director Jin,

419
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,140
thanks for your training.

420
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,330
I will never break my promise.

421
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,010
Xiang Kong,

422
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,610
why are you doing this?

423
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,170
You are not responsible for the lost of this game.

424
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,090
Director Jin,

425
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,450
this game, it's because—

426
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,680
Coach, we have lost.

427
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,760
A bet is a bet, I am willing to leave.

428
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,480
Since Captain Ji has already decided to leave...

429
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Director Jin,

430
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,260
let's get the termination contract ready as soon as possible.

431
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
Brother Yao, you should stay.

432
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Xiang Kong.

433
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
It's all my fault.

434
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,830
I am the one who should leave.

435
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,790
You know that,

436
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,310
Zhao Yang is targeting me.

437
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,460
Even if today I managed to stay,

438
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,380
I will still be driven away sooner or later.

439
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,980
What will happen to Lin Yi Xuan and all of them then?

440
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,740
Do you really not worry about them?

441
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,420
Xiang Kong.

442
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,340
Brother Yao,

443
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,570
don't talk about it anymore.

444
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,450
Just stay,

445
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,090
and continue to make our dream come true.

446
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,490
No matter where I go,

447
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,730
we will always be brothers.

448
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,380
Coach.

449
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,890
Coach, how was it?

450
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,850
Yi Xuan,

451
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,450
we have lost the game,

452
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,890
and someone must be responsible for it.

453
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,400
Is Brother Yao...

454
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
really going to leave the team?

455
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
It's not Huo Yao,

456
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,670
but Xiang Kong.

457
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,100
Lin Yi Xuan.

458
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,660
Lin Yi Xuan, have you gone crazy?

459
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,100
You're the crazy one.

460
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,340
You said you're going to keep leading me to win championship.

461
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,740
If you're leaving alone, you are a big liar then.

462
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,220
Do you know that? You're a big liar.

463
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,460
Captain Ji,

464
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,810
what are we going to do if you have left?

465
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,650
You, let's go up.

466
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,850
We will talk to Director Jin.

467
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,530
I can't let you go.

468
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,090
There nothing else to be said.

469
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,390
A bet is a bet and I have lost.

470
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,310
You want to leave,

471
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,350
but you don't tell us why.

472
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,630
We're all waiting for you,

473
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,310
but you're leaving even without a farewell.

474
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,230
Ji Xiang Kong,

475
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,350
you said you treat me as brother

476
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,750
but have you done so?

477
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,990
You are just a big liar!

478
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,990
Lin Yi Xuan,

479
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,470
let go of your hands.

480
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,430
No.

481
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,790
Drag him away.

482
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,260
Don't you dare to touch me.

483
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,180
Let go.

484
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I won't.

485
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,180
Let go!

486
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,560
I won't!

487
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,160
Lin Yi Xuan...

488
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,560
Let go of me.

489
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,960
Big Liar!

490
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
You are a big liar.

491
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,500
Captain.

492
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,300
How are you doing there?

493
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,420
By the way,

494
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,220
don't send me pictures anymore.

495
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,860
I saw you keep showing off your leisure life,

496
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm really—

497
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
I already know about the termination,

498
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,660
don't act like everything is fine.

499
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,810
I have already bought a return flight tomorrow,

500
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,450
I will form a team for you when I get back.

501
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,010
Captain,

502
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,850
I actually came out from the Legends team,

503
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,010
are you still worried that no one wants me?

504
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,290
Don't worry about me.

505
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,560
There's only one month left to the new season game,

506
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
you have to form a team as soon as possible.

507
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,080
I'm sorry, Captain.

508
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,560
I have failed you.

509
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,110
How did it go this wrong?

510
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
Captain, don't you worry no more.

511
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm hanging up.

512
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,020
Did you come here to play with your phone?

513
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,380
Why did you ask me to come over then?

514
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,260
You are becoming more arrogant now.

515
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,490
Transfer is such a big event,

516
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,850
and you didn't even bother to tell me?

517
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,050
I did.

518
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,050
When was that?

519
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,170
Last week.

520
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,830
What are you doing here?

521
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,990
Is there a problem?

522
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,630
Speak up if there is.

523
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,550
Team fight.

524
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,230
You...

525
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,030
How do you feel about Legends?

526
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,710
Hurry. Low HP level.

527
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,190
Chase... Control him. Right there.

528
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,230
I'll sign the contract then?

529
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,910
Stack the turret.

530
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,990
Great!

531
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,950
Nice.

532
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,510
Push turret...

533
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,870
You called this inform?

534
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,830
You didn't hear it, how can you blame me?

535
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,300
I can't believe you...

536
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,740
You are my big brother, okay?

537
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,780
Why would I have such a weird cousin.

538
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,360
Say, what has VNG done wrong to you?

539
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,840
Shu Wen had trained you for three years,

540
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
and you just leave like that.

541
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,240
How am I going to face Shu Wen?

542
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Her goal is to win the world championship.

543
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,960
But based on VNG's current situation,

544
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,320
they can't make it at all.

545
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,600
Also,

546
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,640
there is really no point staying in VNG.

547
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,440
So Legends is meaningful to you?

548
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,160
Right.

549
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,710
Because Ji Xiang Kong is there.

550
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,590
So you just want to compete with Ji Xiang Kong?

551
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Why are you laughing?

552
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,940
You just want to compete with Ji Xiang Kong.

553
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,420
but in the end, Ji Xiang Kong

554
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,340
had made room for you to take over his captain position.

555
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,810
He has terminated his contract and left.

556
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,410
Do you still want to transfer to Legends?

557
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,810
What do you mean?

558
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,490
Ji Xiang Kong has left?

559
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,130
You can ask around if you don't trust me.

560
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,770
Are you really going to ask around?

561
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,730
I 'm not done talking yet.

562
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,570
Don't go.

563
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,800
Pei Xi,

564
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,680
can you teach me about the Creator again?

565
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm not free.

566
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Pei Xi.

567
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,310
Such a happy event, aren't you suppose to buy us a meal?

568
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,950
That's right.

569
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,750
Drive Ji Xiang Kong away and becoming the captain of Legends,

570
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,750
you are pretty awesome.

571
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,030
Move.

572
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,350
Hey. Pei Xi.

573
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,260
You guys were saying,

574
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,140
Pei Xi had driven Ji Xiang Kong away?

575
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,100
That's right.

576
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,140
Pei Xi is the current captain for Legends team.

577
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,460
The news has been spread out in the industry.

578
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,500
Don't you know that?

579
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm telling you guys,

580
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,460
I've always feel that Pei Xi is the successor of Gu Fang.

581
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,180
Ji Xiang Kong should have left earlier.

582
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,920
Ji Xiang Kong.

583
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,440
Why did you leave Legends?

584
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,540
Seems like it has nothing to do with you.

585
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,540
I just signed contract with Legends.

586
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,180
I know.

587
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,060
You are the new captain for Legends.

588
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,740
My brothers are all good players.

589
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,900
I hope you could lead them well and get some good results.

590
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,460
No matter where I go, my ability will be the same.

591
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,380
It doesn't matter whom I fight with.

592
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,300
No matter how strong you are,

593
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,300
iConquer is a team match.

594
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,490
You should lead everyone to charge,

595
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,930
and not just be the hero who fights alone.

596
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,210
Don't forget,

597
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,650
you are the captain.

598
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,210
The backbone of the whole team.

599
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,510
This is not my initial plan for joining Legends.

600
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,150
What I need,

601
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,230
is not teammates who only rely on me.

602
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,110
To me, these kind of people are just burdens.

603
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,070
Ji Xiang Kong—

604
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,470
Do you know that you will affect everyone's career?

605
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,030
We are professional gamers,

606
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,350
please show some professionalism.

607
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,590
Be responsible to my brothers,

608
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,230
or else I will look down on you.

609
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,550
Ji Xiang Kong.

610
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,670
See you on the battlefield.

611
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,400
Fei Mao.

612
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Fei Mao.

613
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,120
It's already 7.30p.m. I'm starving.

614
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Let's go for dinner.

615
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,320
Okay. Let's go. Ask Qiu Ying to go together.

616
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,800
Qiu Ying.

617
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,040
Forget about her.

618
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,600
Let's go. I'm starving.

619
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,690
Ain't I deliberately ask it when I already knew it?

620
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,790
I know there is a shop, their milk tea is very nice.

621
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,420
And it is strawberry flavor.

622
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,540
If you are free, I will treat you.

623
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,540
Okay.

624
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,330
Hi, your strawberry milk tea.

625
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,490
You are here.

626
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,010
Luckily you still remember, still consider have some conscience.

627
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,200
Are you okay?

628
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm worried about you.

629
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,580
Originally, I am already heartbroken.

630
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,380
But I'm feeling better after drinking this milk tea.

631
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,380
Don't talk about one milk tea,

632
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,660
as long as you are happy, I can treat you everyday.

633
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,220
You will treat me everyday?

634
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,420
You will feed me?

635
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,460
I will feed you.

636
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,980
As long as you don't mind eating instant noodles everyday.

637
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,180
Forget about it then.

638
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,420
By the way,

639
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,930
your service area should've already entered the top 100, aren't you?

640
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,050
Not yet.

641
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,730
I'm too dumb.

642
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,010
You know yourself pretty well.

643
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,230
To professional gamers like you, it is just a piece of cake.

644
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,230
But to normal gamers like me,

645
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,910
it's actually pretty hard.

646
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,310
How about this.

647
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,190
Today, for the sake of this milk tea,

648
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
I'll guide you.

649
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,750
Really?

650
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,030
I'll bring you to Meng Lu Ren. The facilities there are the best.

651
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,230
Why don't we forget about it.

652
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,830
I'm just a rookie,

653
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,590
actually it doesn't matter.

654
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,470
Why?

655
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,900
Is there someone chasing you there?

656
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,980
You're afraid of being misunderstood?

657
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,660
It's not like that.

658
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,100
No one is chasing me.

659
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,340
Then you must be afraid that I will embarrass you.

660
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,760
It's not like that, don't think it that way.

661
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,160
Let's go then.

662
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,480
Okay.

663
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,600
He was kicked out from the Legends team,

664
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,720
and he still has the mood to fall in love.

665
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,110
I heard that before Gu Fang decommission,

666
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,230
he protected him to be the captain.

667
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,550
I really don't know what he sees in him.

668
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,070
Oh.

669
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,430
Have you been to VIP room?

670
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,750
No.

671
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,110
I heard that it's only open to professional gamers.

672
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,580
I'll let you experience the treatment of a professional gamer today.

673
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,980
Really?

674
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,890
This is not a cyber cafe.

675
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,090
Brother Summer often invites some

676
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,890
professional gamers here to play offline match.

677
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,040
Here.

678
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,160
I'll see you play one round.

679
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,360
Aren't you going to teach me first?

680
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
Actual combat is the best way to learn.

681
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,350
Hold on,

682
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,110
let me take a look at your data.

683
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,100
Not bad.

684
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,500
Pretty good.
