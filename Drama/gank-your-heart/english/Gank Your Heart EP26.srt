[Episode 26]

3
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,980
Xiang Kong!

4
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,820
Please hold,

5
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,660
come to the front of the stage with me for a while.

6
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,220
Just a little of your time.

7
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,300
Come on, it's okay.

8
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,220
Just a little of your time.

9
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,410
Here, let's invite Xiang Kong to the front of the stage

10
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,170
because there's a fan who is related

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
to you in the venue today

12
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,450
so

13
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,450
do you have anything you'd like to say to her?

14
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,150
How about

15
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,990
staffs,

16
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,590
I'll ask Mi Ya first.

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,950
Do you have anything to say about

18
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
Wei Teng's performance today?

19
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,830
Xiang Kong,

20
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,950
all the best to you.

21
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,510
Although today's competiton

22
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,670
is a little pitiful,

23
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,870
but I know you guys will be able

24
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,630
to get better results

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,670
the next time.

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,190
So you're still confident

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,630
in Wei Teng's following performance?

28
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,990
Of course

29
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,940
because I believe in Ji Xiang Kong.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,740
I will always

31
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,940
stay by his side.

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,220
Even though he lost the competition

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,420
but in my heart,

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,840
he's always the best

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
professional player.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,640
So

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,600
at such a time,

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
I want to gossip a little.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,680
Why do I feel that

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
the relationship between the both of you

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,040
is unusual?

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
We grew up together,

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
we chased our dreams together.

44
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,470
He is my first love.

45
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,730
Today's job

46
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,610
is over.

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,770
Yoou've worked hard.

48
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,210
Head back and rest early.

49
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,250
Never thought there will be

50
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,090
a small segment after

51
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,770
the competition ended.

52
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,090
Then let me ask.

53
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,570
Xiang Kong,

54
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,210
do you have

55
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,330
anything to tell Mi Ya?

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Thank you for coming

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,600
to support my competition.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,720
I hope everyone will support Wei Teng

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
and follow us closely on our competition.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,160
Thank you.

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,020
No wonder you have mood to compete,

62
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,380
you're actually in a triangle scandal

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,740
with the celebrity and commentator.

64
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,660
Qi Yue,

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
what the hell are you talking about?

66
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,420
What?

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,940
The competition is affected bc he's in a relationship,

68
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,890
is it wrong to tell him off?

69
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,490
Celebrity Girlfriend

70
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,650
came to watch you compete,

71
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,570
rumoured Girlfriend is the commentator at the venue.

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,490
Why?

73
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,730
Were you nervous till you're crippled?

74
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,570
Is that so?

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
Qi Yue,

76
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,560
don't push the blame here.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,560
You know it very well

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,880
on why we lost the competition.

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
You dare to push me?

80
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,500
You really thought

81
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,620
you're the ace player of Wei Teng?

82
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,780
Qi Yue, are you done?

83
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,500
Brother Qi.

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
Li Gan, do you see it?

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,220
In your disciple's eyes,

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
we do not exist.

87
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,220
Aren't you letting go?

88
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,660
Sit well.

89
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,460
Master.

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,540
Sister Wen.

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,940
We lost this competition

92
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,740
too ridiculously.

93
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
I did not perform well

94
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,980
but the tactics

95
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,300
itself have too many problems.

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,180
Ji Xiang Kong is just...

97
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,050
I think that you've not sober up.

98
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,810
Everyone is unhappy

99
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,770
that we lost the competition.

100
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,110
Qi Yue,

101
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,470
apologise to Sister Wen quickly.

102
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,230
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,670
I shouldn't be drinking.

104
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,390
I've been working outside these few years,

105
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,030
I felt pressured that

106
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,310
my Mother is here this time

107
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,190
so I drank too much on accident.

108
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,470
I promise on the

109
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,110
next match...

110
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,110
Next match?

111
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,470
You still intend to

112
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,470
play the next round in this state?

113
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,390
Or do you want to bring

114
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,910
your Girlfriend along?

115
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,470
I do not object dating

116
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,980
but can you please

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,620
don't affect the competition?

118
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,860
Alright,

119
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,700
stop scolding him.

120
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,740
We're all tired, quickly

121
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,100
head back to your rooms and rest.

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,980
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

123
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,160
What do you mean?

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
You're letting this matter go?

125
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,800
You're just going to shelter

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
you disciple like this?

127
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Nobody is willing to lose in the competition.

128
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
Qi Yue already know  that he's in the wrong.

129
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
If he really knows that, he wouldn't

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,280
have push

131
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,440
the blame to Ji xiang Kong.

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,280
Qi Yue,

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,000
from now onwards,

134
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
you don't have to play anymore.

135
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,310
Master,

136
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,070
you're putting me in the reserve too?

137
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Ji Xiang Kong, you...

138
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,820
Brother Qi,

139
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,460
don't cause trouble anymore.

140
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,330
Despicable.

141
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,650
You can date

142
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,610
but others can't.

143
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,330
Qi Yue,

144
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,010
you can waste your talents

145
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,610
but I'll not allow you to ruin Wei Teng.

146
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,240
Shu Wen,

147
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,710
do you have to?

148
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,550
Isn't it just losing a match?

149
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,270
You're putting

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,270
Qi Yue in the reserve.

151
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,780
Qi Yue is your disciple,

152
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,380
but you don't even know

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
what he does everyday.

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,380
Li Gan,

155
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,220
Wei Teng is my everything.

156
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,540
I'll definitely not let it

157
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,780
get ruined in the hands of Qi Yue.

158
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,340
Yes, Wei Teng is your everything

159
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,540
but it's also my everything.

160
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,460
You have to remember,

161
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm the biggest shareholder.

162
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,140
Have you thought

163
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,540
of discussing this matter

164
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,090
with me beforehand?

165
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,810
What do you take me as?

166
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,130
Okay,

167
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,400
I also hope you remember

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
that I'm Wei Teng's coach.

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,320
I have the rights

170
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
to handle the members.

171
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
Biggest shareholder right?

172
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
If you have any issue next time,

173
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,780
do hold a shareholder meeting.

174
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,100
I'll cooperate anytime.

175
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,020
Master,

176
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,740
I've won so many

177
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
competition for Wei Teng.

178
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm also the first for MVP

179
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,740
but just because I lost a match,

180
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,100
you're putting me in the reserve?

181
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,740
Isn't Sister Wen

182
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
being too unfair to me?

183
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,780
Qi Yue,

184
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,180
you better think through

185
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
carefully on where you did wrong.

186
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,340
Otherwise, this Master of yours

187
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,380
can't help you anymore.

188
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,790
Ji Xiang Kong.

189
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,550
Ji Xiang Kong,

190
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,430
when were you

191
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,990
and Mi Ya together?

192
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,310
Did Mi Ya return to develop

193
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,990
because of you?

194
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,030
When will the official annoucement be?

195
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,870
-Say something.          -Everyone,

196
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,750
we still have

197
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,470
many competiitons,

198
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,390
please do us a favour.

199
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,310
We need to rest now,

200
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,270
okay?

201
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,550
-Qiu Ying is out.          -Quick.

202
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,070
Qiu Ying, you broke up other's relationship.

203
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,830
Shameless.

204
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,670
Anybody would like Mi Ya

205
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,550
and not you.

206
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,860
They were childhood friends

207
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
and you have to get involved.

208
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,300
Xiang Kong.

209
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
I did not break

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
up anyone's relationship.

211
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,800
Not in the past

212
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
and never in the future.

213
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,280
Trouble you to stay far away

214
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,040
from Ji Xiang Kong.

215
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Stay far away.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,560
Xiang Kong,

217
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,440
you mustn't go over.

218
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,920
What are you doing?

219
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,920
What are you doing?

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,160
Follow me.

221
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,120
You can't go.

222
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't leave.

223
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm here.

224
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,250
Teacher Luo,

225
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,330
thank you.

226
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,770
Today,

227
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,890
let the work

228
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,810
you have on hand be.

229
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,650
Don't think about anything else.

230
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,970
Rest well.

231
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,290
I'm sorry,

232
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,970
I'm the cause of

233
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,360
such a big mess.

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
You did not let anyone down.

235
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Those let those

236
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,800
messy voices

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,680
affect you.

238
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,770
He's my first love.

239
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,210
I'm finally successful now,

240
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,330
I can give him support

241
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,210
and help him fulfil his dreams.

242
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,920
Xiang Kong said,

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
he'll always be by my side.

244
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,980
Yi Yi,

245
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,420
what brings you here?

246
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,700
If I do not come,

247
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,820
what will become

248
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,820
of you from the bullying?

249
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,460
Who dares to bully me?

250
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,010
How's my first

251
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,390
commentary?

252
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,190
Don't change the topic.

253
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,590
Let me ask you,

254
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,390
do you already know about

255
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,830
Ji Xiang Kong and Mi Ya?

256
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,270
You went to Mi Ya's fanmeet

257
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,470
with Ji Xiang Kong

258
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,670
and came back drenched.

259
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,910
Does that have to do with this issue>

260
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,710
Mi Ya is Ji Xiang Kong's ex-Girlfriend.

261
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,270
Now,

262
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,230
she's back for him.

263
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,870
Then what are you?

264
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,430
Lin Yi Xuan even said,

265
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,750
that day,

266
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,350
he booked a secret garden restaurant

267
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,230
to confess to you.

268
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,060
I thought

269
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,500
he really likes you.

270
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,540
Yi Yi,

271
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,660
maybe we misunderstood him

272
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,180
from the start.

273
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,000
You don't know

274
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
what Mi Ya and Ji Xiang Kong

275
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
has been through together.

276
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,120
How much they sacrifice for each other.

277
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
At the venue just now,

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
when Mi Ya announced their relationship

279
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,200
infront of so many people,

280
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,270
I really admire her.

281
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,630
Mi Ya can really

282
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,630
give up everything

283
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,470
for Ji Xiang Kong.

284
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,020
No,

285
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,900
are you dumb?

286
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,700
She's your rival,

287
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,900
yet you're

288
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,140
speaking up for her?

289
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,090
I'm not speaking for anyone.

290
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,850
Maybe he only noticed me

291
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,890
because I imitated

292
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,970
Mi Ya's dance

293
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,050
at the start.

294
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,610
Rather than to suffer

295
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,320
in this relationship,

296
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
I should give up as soon as possible.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,600
But

298
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,550
can you really do it?

299
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,260
From now onwards,

300
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,500
I'll put all my focus

301
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,820
on my career.

302
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,020
Alright,

303
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,660
as long as you thought it through.

304
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,780
Qiu Ying,

305
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,220
wait till you become Iconquer

306
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,580
best female commentator,

307
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,900
the whole stadium would

308
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,650
definitely

309
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,650
not be enough for those who wants to woo you.

310
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,850
Don't cry anymore.

311
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,330
What did you buy?

312
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,770
A gift for you

313
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,890
but you can't open it now.

314
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,710
Okay, I'll settle this issue. Yes.

315
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,710
Okay.

316
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,350
Yes.

317
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,470
This matter is my mistake.

318
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,790
Yes, it's my mistake.

319
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,910
I'll settle this matter well.

320
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,910
Yes.

321
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,790
Brother Tony,

322
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,790
Sister Mi Ya followers on Weibo

323
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,670
has dropped by a few thousand,

324
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,630
it's still going down.

325
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,470
Also, there's fans who wants Sister Mi Ya to....

326
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,500
Why don't I go on Weibo

327
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,740
and talk about the issue?

328
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,060
No way,

329
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,660
you can't do that.

330
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,520
I'll settle it.

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,640
Kai Lun,

332
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,520
post a statement under

333
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,000
the company's name.

334
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
-Hurry.           -Okay.

335
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
Hello, President Li.

336
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,440
Yes.

337
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,400
I'll get it settled as soon as possible.

338
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Yes.

339
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,040
Give me two days time.

340
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes.

341
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,510
It's my dereliction of duty.

342
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,470
I apologise,

343
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,270

Tony,

345
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
what did President Li say?

346
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,060
President Li said

347
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,620
that the company will stop

348
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,140
the production for your new album.

349
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,260
We also lost some business activities

350
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,850
but don't worry,

351
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,650
I'll get them back.

352
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,210
Hello,

353
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,050

354
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,010
Don't worry about your loss,

355
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,250
we'll definitely compensate you

356
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,970
so the following collaboration...

357
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,690
Sorry.

358
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,930
My apologises.

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,240
I want to head out for a breather.

360
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,870
I'm sorry, Tony.

361
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,500
Hello.

362
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,260
Eat up quickly.

363
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,580
You eat first,

364
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,780
I'm not hungry.

365
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,660
What's happening

366
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,780
between you and Mi Ya?

367
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,170
You're really good,

368
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,970
hiding it from me too.

369
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,490
Have you seen Weibo?

370
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,610
It's only been a few hours,

371
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,680
Mi Ya followers

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
has dropped by a few thousand.

373
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,360
Qiu Ying got it worse,

374
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,400
all the comments are scolding her.

375
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,600
Can you give

376
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
me some peace?

377
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,020
Aren't I just worried about you?

378
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,740
Although you're my Brother Kong

379
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,660
but  I siding Qiu Ying this time round.

380
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,460
It's not that Im afraid of Yi Yi scolding me

381
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,860
but I really think that you and

382
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,100
Qiu Ying are made for each other.

383
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Put it down,

384
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,820
Can you not annoy me?

385
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,740
Go back to your room.

386
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,860
Okay,

387
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,540
I shalln't annoy you.

388
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,180
Calm yourself down,

389
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,300
okay?

390
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,140
Eat up.

391
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,910
Xiang Kong,

392
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,110
are you okay?

393
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,800
Are you angry at me for

394
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,920
causing such a mess?

395
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,320
I an very angry.

396
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm only angry

397
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,840
at why didn't you

398
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,120
discuss it with me beforehand?

399
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
At least let me be mentally prepared.

400
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,200
If I were to discuss it with you beforehand,

401
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
will you still allow me to annouce it?

402
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,550
Mi Ya,

403
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,710
I've been with you for so many years.

404
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,910
Do you not trust me enough?

405
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,300
It's too late to say anything now.

406
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,860
You made such a big sacrifice

407
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,860
but the result might not be what you wish for.

408
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,780
Xiang Kong and I

409
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,180
been through a lot together.

410
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,850
Despite what the result may be,

411
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,490
I want to prove it to this relationship.

412
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,210
Is it worth it?

413
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,400
Through these years,

414
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,110
I've been living

415
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,190
under then fans' imagination and anticipation.

416
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,110
Dare not allow people to see-through me,

417
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,020
all the more I don't want them to be disappointed

418
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,060
but I want to be myself now,

419
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,580
just like any normal being

420
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,780
being able to date.

421
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,260
I'm prepared for the worst

422
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,620
when I decided to announce it,

423
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,100
just that I got you involved.

424
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,620
I'll think of a solution

425
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,250
to settle the company.

426
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,650
As for the media and sponsers,

427
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,450
we're still trying.

428
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,050
What's important now

429
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,650
is for the fans to accept your

430
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,930
relationship with Ji Xiang Kong soon.

431
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,160
You should know my situation now

432
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
better than I do,

433
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
you really don't have to go against the company

434
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,300
and delay your future

435
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,060
just for me.

436
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,820
I'll naturally leave

437
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,220
when you're of no value anymore.

438
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,420
Tony,

439
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,380
I've known you for many years

440
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,220
but I don't seem to know you well.

441
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,220
Sometimes,

442
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,860
you seem as cold as

443
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,140
a stranger

444
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
but now,

445
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,410
you're the only one I can depend on

446
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,090
when I'm in trouble.

447
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,070
Qiu Ying.

448
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,950
Qiu Ying.

449
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,230
Qiu Ying.

450
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,270
Can we have a chat

451
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,820
on some things?

452
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,300
I know you don't wish to see me

453
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,740
but some things isn't

454
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,560
like what you've seen.

455
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,160
Let us have a chat

456
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,920
okay, Qiu Ying?

457
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,830
Sorry,

458
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,070
give me some time.

459
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,310
I'll get it settled.

460
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,370
Cry if you want to.

461
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,130
You can take it as I'm not here.

462
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
Head out for a breather.

463
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Feeling better?

464
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,460
You broke up with Ji Xiang Kong?

465
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,010
We

466
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,130
were never together.

467
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,560
That's good.

468
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,080
Now

469
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,080
there's many people scolding you online.

470
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,780
Pei Xi,

471
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,620
I thought

472
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,900
you only know how to play games,

473
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,620
you won't even look at

474
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,780
those gossips online.

475
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,460
I'm only concern about you

476
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,980
and Ji Xiang Kong.

477
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,940
Pei Xi,

478
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,660
thank you.

479
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,660
I'm feeling better now.

480
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,580
You should head back and rest since

481
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,420
you have competition tomorrow.

482
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,420
I'll go first.

483
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
Wait,

484
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,970
if you need help,

485
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,250
I can be your Boyfriend.

486
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,910
There are many other girls that like you,

487
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,550
you don't have to waste

488
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,070
your time on me.

489
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,670
You think too much,

490
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,390
I don't like you.

491
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,870
I only hope that you'll

492
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,510
not trouble Ji Xiang Kong.

493
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,550
I

494
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,750
trouble

495
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,230
Ji Xiang Kong?

496
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,950
This...

497
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,070
Time preparation for the competition is tight.

498
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,750
He's already in the losing group,

499
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,070
he can't lose anymore.

500
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,020
Both of your matters will only affect him.

501
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,780
Netizens will stop scolding you

502
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,660
if I'm your Boyfriend.

503
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,420
That way,

504
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,540
he can prepare for the competition at ease.

505
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,720
Pei Xi,

506
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
you're willing to be my Boyfriend

507
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,960
because of Ji Xiang Kong?

508
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Your thoughts are really weird.

509
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
He's someone I admire a lot,

510
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,560
I hope that I'm able to play

511
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,440
against him again during competition.

512
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,870
You can

513
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,990
sacrifice yourself

514
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,630
just because you admire him?

515
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,030
It's not like I'm really being your Boyfriend,

516
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,630
I'm still willing to

517
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,820
make such a small sacrifice.

518
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,060
Why did you chase him out of Legends

519
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,700
if you admire him so much?

520
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,020
I did not.

521
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,130
I joined

522
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,010
Legends back then

523
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,010
because of him.

524
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,370
My only condition for joining Legends is

525
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,050
for Ji Xiang Kong to continue being the captain

526
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,730
but Zhao Yang lied to me.

527
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,730
When I wanted to leave after

528
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,970
knowing the truth,

529
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,050
Ji Xiang Kong told me

530
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,330
the responsibilities of what a

531
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,490
professional player should be,

532
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,920
can't just abandon our teammates.

533
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,000
Then why didn't you explain?

534
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,560
Don't you know

535
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,040
that all of us thought that

536
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,640
you chased Ji Xiang Kong out.

537
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,950
I don't care

538
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,870
what others think.

539
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,110
I only want Ji Xiang Kong to know

540
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,110
but

541
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,710
you guys don't

542
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,380
give me a chance.

543
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
You mean that time at Meng Lu Ren?

544
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,260
You gave us food and drinks

545
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,260
just so that you can speak to him?

546
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,500
Alright,

547
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,100
don't worry.

548
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,050
I'll not trouble him.

549
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,170
What do you intend

550
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,730
to do next?

551
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:00,970
How are you going to

552
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,760
deal with the questions?

553
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,640
Maybe

554
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
you really need a Boyfriend

555
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
as a shield.

556
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,540
Even so, I don't have to trouble you.

557
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,220
Otherwise,

558
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,060
you'll be my best guy friend.

559
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,300
What kind of expression is that?

560
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,620
If only I brought a

561
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
lollipop along.

562
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,540
What lollipop?

563
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,780
I'll go back now.

564
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,140
Head in quickly.

565
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,290
Turning of your phone won't solve the problem.

566
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,170
Xiang Kong,

567
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,950
you have to face it regardless.

568
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,110
I said whatever I have to,

569
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,030
I don't understand

570
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,390
why did she still do that.

571
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,350
Nobody is able to

572
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,470
let go of such relation

573
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,710
of so many years.

574
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,350
Furthermore,

575
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,430
she thinks that

576
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,470
the problem between the both of you

577
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,270
is that she's

578
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,150
unable to go public

579
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,270
with your relationship.

580
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,550
Brother Sun,

581
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,910
do I really have to

582
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,790
tell it to everyone that

583
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,390
I've already

584
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,580
broke up with her long ago?

585
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,620
Do you bear to do that?

586
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,000
Online says that her company

587
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
has stopped all the schedules.

588
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,280
If you step out now to say

589
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
that both of you are over,

590
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,040
isn't she going to be the biggest joke

591
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
in the entertainment industry?

592
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,600
Her career will be completely ruined.

593
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,080
But what about Qiu Ying?

594
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
She's innocent.

595
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,830
The three of you are all innocent.

596
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,070
No matter what

597
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,950
decision you make now,

598
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,790
one of them will definitely be hurt

599
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,110
or maybe even three.

600
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,620
Think about it after the competition.

601
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,730
You're not to blame for losing this match,

602
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,210
that Qi Yue

603
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,850
has terrible moodswings.

604
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,130
Luckily,

605
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,170
the problem is shown now.

606
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,210
Do your best to face

607
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,530
and solve it.

608
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,050
It's just that

609
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,410
you can't afford to lose anymore.

610
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,370
I know that.

611
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,120
Sister Wen must be the

612
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,840
most stressful one now.

613
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,380
Eat some fruits.

614
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Eat up.

615
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,220
Let me tell you

616
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,420
this restaurant is really expensive.

617
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Just to treat you to this meal,

618
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,780
I search for a long time.

619
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,300
Eat more.

620
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,580
Cheer me on later.

621
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,770
I don't have to mood to

622
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,850
eat these.

623
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,290
Don't even know

624
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,200
if Qiu Ying is feeling better.

625
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,320
She's busy now,

626
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,840
I don't want to disturb her.

627
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,500
Brother Kong is being too secretive,

628
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,660
he didn't even breathe a word

629
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,860
to me about his

630
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,900
relation with Mi Ya.

631
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,140
Right?

632
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,260
You say how scary can he be

633
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,580
to not even tell you about it.

634
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,740
Do you know?

635
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,580
Every official and marketing account

636
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,220
are spreading about Mi Ya and

637
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,100
Ji Xiang Kong's past

638
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,500
about how they were childhood friends

639
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,460
and how much Ji Xiang Kong helped

640
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,140
and supported her when she was

641
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,820
just a trainee.

642
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,940
It's Ji Xiang Kong's love

643
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
that lifted her dreams.

644
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,940
They seperated for 5 years

645
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,580
but never give up till the end,

646
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,130
finally together because of love.

647
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,770
Writing it as if it's a romance novel and even

648
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,250
hope that fans will give them their blessings.

649
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,370
Let me have a look.

650
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,730
Quick.

651
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,790
There's even a video.

652
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,030
Brother Kong

653
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,230
is really someone who priortise relationship.

654
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,750
No wonder he didn't have a

655
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,750
Girflfriend for a long time.

656
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,870
As if.

657
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,710
If he does,

658
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,230
why did he get close to Qiu Ying?

659
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,310
Don't get angry,

660
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,190
I'm definitely on your side,

661
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,990
right?

662
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
What's the use of it?

663
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,420
Main point is what does Ji Xiang Kong

664
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,180
treat Qiu Ying as?

665
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,140
A substitute for Mi Ya?

666
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,020
No,

667
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,960
I can guarantee for him that

668
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,200
he never had feelings for

669
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
any other girls before.

670
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,840
Really.

671
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
He definitely likes

672
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,000
Qiu Ying,

673
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,680
otherwise he wouldn't have confessed.

674
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,800
Now, Mi Ya

675
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,160
has already admitted

676
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,960
and announced it.

677
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,040
Why didn't he

678
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,040
step out and clear the air

679
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,280
if he has no relation

680
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,200
with Mi Ya?

681
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,230
What now,

682
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,710
everybody is saying that

683
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,390
Qiu Ying broke them up.

684
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,830
Evetybody is scolding her.

685
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,990
This issue is difficult,

686
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,460
new love on one side while the other is his old love.

687
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,100
How difficult.

688
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,780
Still new and old love,

689
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,170
let me tell you.

690
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,970
Birds of the same feather flock together,

691
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,250
you're not any thing good either.

692
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,250
What does it have to do with me?

693
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,650
Tell him that I said

694
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,130
if I see anyone

695
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,370
bullying Qiu Ying,

696
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,210
I'll be the first to

697
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,210
find him accountable.

698
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,610
It has nothing to do with me,

699
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,570
don't get mad at me.

700
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,490
Waiter, bill please.

701
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,650
Isn't it my treat today?

702
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,680
I don't care for your treat.

703
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,880
This...

704
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,520
Isn't approriate, is it?

705
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,160
This Mi Ya and Ji Xiang Kong

706
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,230
is pretty compatible.

707
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,350
Someone actually wants to be a third party.

708
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,780
The both of them

709
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,060
supported each other and

710
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,060
go through thick and thin together.

711
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,580
It's difficult to seperate

712
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,540
a couple like them,

713
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,700
someone actually harborevil intents

714
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,260
taking such advantage.

715
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,260
Even if this Ji Xiang Kong is a playboy,

716
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,620
he's just playing anyway.

717
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,660
To think that you believe

718
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,740
such act,

719
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,740
don't you even take a look at yourself?

720
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,290
What are you all talking about?

721
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,170
Seen all the information?

722
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,410
Yes.

723
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,970
Start the meeting.

724
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,580
Your followings are increasing again.

725
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Never thought that

726
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
there'll be people who understands me.

727
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,380
The discussions are slowly

728
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,820
inclining towards us.

729
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,500
There's a few artistes

730
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,820
who spoke up for you yesterday.

731
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,020
They say,

732
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,060
it's everyone's freedom to date.

733
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,460
Everything an artiste do shouldn't

734
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,700
be controlled by their fans.

735
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,340
I can finally

736
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,860
let go of my burden.

737
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,900
Thank you too, Tony.

738
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,410
You have to thank yourself too.

739
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,730
Everyone got moved by

740
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,210
your persistence.

741
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,810
To be honest,

742
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,730
I'm also moved by you.

743
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,930
I still have to thank you

744
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,230
for everything you've done.

745
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,630
Tony,

746
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,270
Xiang Kong just lost in his competition.

747
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,470
Can I visit him?

748
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,190
Go ahead.

749
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,830
Keep it low profile, come back quickly.

750
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,950
-I'll let Kai Lun make the arrangements.         -Okay.

751
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,590
This is the

752
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,710
statistics for the practice round just now.

753
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,670
Liu Miao,

754
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,110
you played with us less so

755
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,390
you've shown a number of mistakes this time.

756
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,790
You're good at jungling

757
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,630
but not so good

758
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,550
for a support.

759
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,510
Shen Yue,

760
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,390
practice with him more.

761
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,830
Heighten up your teamwork.

762
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,070
Okay.

763
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,100
We don't have much time left.

764
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,740
How is it?

765
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,740
Going on smoothly?

766
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,220
-Sister Shu Wen.          -Sister Wen.

767
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:15,960
Sister Wen.

768
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,240
you don't have

769
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,000
to be too nervous,

770
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,120
cooperate with everyone more.

771
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,800
Mi Ya is here.

772
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,120
Sister Wen,

773
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,350
we're still having a meeting.

774
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,310
We still have to

775
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,270
practice later.

776
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,590
Alright,

777
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,710
I'll settle it for you.

778
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,950
Thank you, Sister Wen.

779
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,340
You guys continue.

780
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,500
All the best.

781
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,330
Let's continue.

782
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,610
Sister Wen,

783
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,570
Is Xiang Kong still okay?

784
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,890
I couldn't contact him for the past two days.

785
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,770
He also lost in his competition,

786
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,890
I'm pretty worried about him.

787
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,920
Xiang Kong is well,

788
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,920
don't worry.

789
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,840
Just that Wei Teng has

790
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,600
entered the losing group,

791
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,240
the following match

792
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,640
is very important to us.

793
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,680
We can't let the

794
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,030
the players get distracted.

795
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,150
Sister Wen,

796
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,030
I just want to tell him something.

797
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,230
It shouldn't

798
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,230
take up a lot of his time.

799
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,740
But Wei Teng

800
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,300
is now having

801
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,700
an enclosed practice training.

802
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Xiang Kong is the leader,

803
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,820
he has to set an example.

804
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,020
You should understand him.

805
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,620
If you've anything to say,

806
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,060
tell him after the competition,

807
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,380
okay?

808
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
I really don't know

809
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,560
how can I express my

810
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,960
gratitude towards you.

811
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,520
No need to.

812
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,320
The tumblr you gave,

813
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,360
I like it a lot.

814
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,420
Qiu Ying,

815
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,540
Teacher Luo.

816
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,980
I found your notebook.

817
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,340
Where did you find it?

818
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,420
The cleaner

819
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
picked it up from the dustbin.

820
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:30,900
Just don't know who

821
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,260
tore it up.

822
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Dustbin?

823
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,260
I spent a

824
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,940
long time writing these notes.

825
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,570
You see if

826
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,810
there's anything useable.

827
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,970
Talk about this later.

828
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,050
Go get prepared

829
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:56,950
for the competition,

830
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,030
I'll be right back.

831
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,070
I'll go prepare then.

832
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,750
Sure, let's watch the competition together.

833
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,060
-I'll bring you there.        -Okay.

834
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,100
Qiao Xin.

835
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,860
Teacher Luo.

836
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,180
Teacher Luo.

837
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,540
You can go home now,

838
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,860
We don't need to host today.

839
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,720
Go home?

840
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,840
Why?

841
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,080
Yes, Teacher Luo.

842
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,760
Really,

843
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,920
Qiao Xin's performance

844
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,480
recently is especially good

845
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,320
so I...

846
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,320
Why?

847
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,320
Normal personnel transfer,

848
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,920
do I need a reason for it?

849
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,350
Teacher Luo.

850
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,470
I say this Luo Tiean is really....

851
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,310
What did you do

852
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,540
to offend him?

853
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,700
Teacher Luo,

854
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,660
I'm ready.

855
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,620
Okay,

856
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,610
if you have anything in the future,

857
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,370
tell me.

858
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,130
Don't get pushover by others.

859
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,970
Let's start.

860
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,770
Still okay?

861
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,560
Hello everyone,

862
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
welcome to the venue

863
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
of one of the final match of Iconquer.

864
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm the commentator for today,

865
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,200
Luo Tian.

866
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,000
Hello everyone,

867
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm commentator, Qiu Ying.

868
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,880
Legends will be up against

869
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,350
Dragon today.

870
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,430
The losing team will

871
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,190
enter the losing group automatically

872
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,390
to play against Wei Teng.

873
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,190
Yes.

874
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,190
So Qiu Ying,

875
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,150
who do you think will do better

876
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,350
among the two team?

877
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,580
Teacher Luo,

878
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,900
you're asking the obvious.

879
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,580
Both teams are equally as outstanding,

880
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,940
I can't offend any of them.

881
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,500
Dragon has been really eye-catching

882
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,300
throughout the entire season.

883
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,260
They have a very unique way of playing.

884
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,580
The top player has more economic

885
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,980
as compared to other players.

886
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,100
Also, their marksman is resistance to pressure.

887
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,380
Legends has met with lots of

888
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,850
difficulties in this season.

889
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,130
After changing their captaint twice,

890
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,410
they finally adapted to

891
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,570
Pei Xi's tactic of 4 protecting 1

892
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,130
throughout the season.

893
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,130
Indeed.

894
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,410
Legends are up against

895
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,410
Dragon today.

896
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,280
I believe it will bring us

897
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,720
a very different match.

898
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,960
I'll pass the time to

899
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,440
Ah can who's on stage now.

900
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,460
Attack.

901
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,100
Can attack, go.

902
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,420
Wait for me.

903
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,460
My skill is still around,

904
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,020
skill is around.

905
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,940
Lu Feng, damage.

906
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,660
Go.

907
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,540
Top, attack.

908
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,260
Middle, come here.

909
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,300
Lu Feng, damage.

910
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,100
I'm detouring.

911
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,540
Attack.

912
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
This wave of attack is okay.

913
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,980
Attack.

914
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,470
Sir, you've drink

915
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,790
too much today

916
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,790
and we are also closing soon.

917
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,710
Why don't you...

918
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,990
What now?

919
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,780
Afraid that I can't pay, is that so?

920
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,940
That'snot what I meant.

921
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,940
Even you look down on me too.

922
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,780
Qi Yue,

923
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,680
stop drinking.

924
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,120
Sorry.

925
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
I'll take care of him.

926
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,400
Howdo you know I'm here?

927
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,800
Didn't you look for other guys?

928
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,920
Didn't you say I have no future?

929
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,080
Qi Yue,

930
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,520
you know it very well

931
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,480
on how I treated you these years.

932
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,990
I just want to be successful

933
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,590
but at the end of the day,

934
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,030
everything I do

935
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:25,550
is for

936
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,190
considering our future.

937
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,500
At times like this,

938
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,340
all the more I won't leave you.

939
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,900
Unless,

940
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,330
you don't want to see me.

941
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,730
Then I'll go.

942
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,490
Qi Yue.

943
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,450
Don't go.

944
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,130
If you were to leave,

945
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,650
I really have nothing left.

946
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,440
We are pretty similar,

947
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,800
we only want to be successful

948
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,950
but we don't get recognised.

949
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,190
Everybody looks down on me,

950
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,110
only you treat me the best.

951
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,340
Be careful.

952
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,740
What rights do they have to look down on you?

953
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,660
What Wei Teng has today

954
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,740
is all because fo you.

955
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,220
In the end,

956
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,330
they put you in the reserve.

957
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,570
There's no reason for me to stay

958
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,850
after they treat me like this.

959
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,480
At most, we'll go our own ways.

960
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,920
Are you dumb?

961
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,640
If Wei Teng were to get the champion,

962
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,640
that glory

963
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,920
will only belong to Ji Xiang Kong.

964
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,220
How will that even relate to you?

965
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,740
Unless,

966
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,380
you're willing to watch what's

967
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,700
belong to you get snatched

968
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,220
by others?

969
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,300
Even if they were to get champion,

970
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
it should be you who lead them

971
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,980
to the championship.

972
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,780
I have a plan,

973
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,820
are you willing to try?

974
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:35,850
Master.

975
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,290
I'm back.

976
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,310
It's my wrong previously.

977
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,550
Even cause you and Sister Wen

978
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,510
to fall out.

979
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,590
I promise you that

980
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,670
I'll never drink again.

981
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,350
Qi Yue,

982
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,150
I'm the one that taught you

983
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,870
and you're someone I trust most.

984
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,310
You should know it very well

985
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,630
on Wei Teng's situation.

986
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,750
I thought it through these few days,

987
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,750
if it's not for you to me a chance

988
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,150
to join Wei Teng,

989
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,220
I'll probably never be able to fulfil

990
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,900
my dream of a professional player.

991
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,740
Now that Wei Teng is in the finals,

992
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,140
it's just a step away from the champion

993
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:18,540
so

994
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,080
as long as I'm able to help the team,

995
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm willing to listen to you.

996
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,200
Master,

997
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,800
forgive me.

998
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,080
It's good that you understand.

999
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,800
Yesterday,

1000
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,880
Dragon lost to Legends.

1001
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,840
We will be up against

1002
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,080
Dragon who also entered

1003
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,040
the losing group.

1004
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,880
This is our only chance.

1005
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,920
Master,

1006
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,110
I've watch a number of

1007
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,190
dragon videos recently.

1008
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,590
I want to interact with the rest.

1009
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,950
Have not eaten right?

1010
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,350
Sit down and eat.

1011
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,780
Talk later.

1012
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:03,850
President Guo.

1013
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,170
You're here, sit.

1014
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,930
Why did you look for me for?

1015
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,410
What's the reason for

1016
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:11,850
changing Qiao Xin away?

1017
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,170
Normal personnel transfer.

1018
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:16,650
Technically,

1019
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,970
I shouldn't be involved

1020
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,130
in the commentator arrangements

1021
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,440
but Qiao Xin's performance

1022
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,240
is not bad in the analyzing table.

1023
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,400
Her popularity is good too.

1024
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,920
I can't accept

1025
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that reason for

1026
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,920
changing her away.

1027
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,000
After all, Qiao Xin is cultivated by

1028
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,070
You Xing and us.

1029
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,790
You have to give her more opportunities.

1030
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:34,710
When she has the potential,

1031
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,070
I'll naturally give her the chance.

1032
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,270
Luo Tian,

1033
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,590
commentary is the pride

1034
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,020
of Ji Guang.

1035
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,460
Skills

1036
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,340
as well as character

1037
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,860
are very important elements.

1038
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,660
Yu should've heard about it.

1039
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,140
Qiu Ying

1040
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,940
is a big problem.

1041
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:51,780
President Guo,

1042
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,980
these are just rumours.

1043
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,220
I don't if they are rumours

1044
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,220
or the truth,

1045
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,380
what I see is

1046
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,660
Ji Guang's repuatation.

1047
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,010
With all the negative news,

1048
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,330
can you guarantee Qiu Ying's

1049
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,810
working condition?

1050
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,850
If Qiu Ying were to cause any problems

1051
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,810
at work,

1052
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,360
I'll take full responsibilities.

1053
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,400
Luo Tian,

1054
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,680
work and personal matters are different.

1055
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,040
I hope you do not bring your feelings

1056
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,800
into work.

1057
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,140
President Guo,

1058
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,700
I don't quite understand what you mean.

1059
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,780
I've never seen you

1060
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,460
being so nice to someone.

1061
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,500
Furthermore, it's to a rookie commentator.

1062
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,340
Sister Qiao Xin,

1063
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,140
you're early.

1064
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,220
Morning.

1065
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,020
How's preparation?

1066
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,220
Almost done.

1067
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,740
Have you heard?

1068
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,290
Wei Teng is in trouble.

1069
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:53,730
What happened?

1070
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,130
I heard Ji Xiang Kong

1071
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,570
fainted in the meeting room.

1072
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:59,170
Sister Wen is going crazy.

1073
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,210
So serious?

1074
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,590
Don't they still have a

1075
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,950
competition tomorrow?

1076
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,870
Seem like

1077
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,150
Ji Xiang Kong can't play tomorrow.

1078
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,150
Wei teng is in trouble.

1079
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,750
What to do?

1080
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,830
It's a pity.

1081
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,870
Why isn't he picking up?
