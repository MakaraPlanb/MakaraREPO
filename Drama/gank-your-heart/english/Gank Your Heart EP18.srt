00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,100
Episode 18

2
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,540
Xuan ge, you're back.

3
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,140
Why did you adjust me back?

4
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,980
Since everyone is here,

5
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,660
let's start practicing.

6
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,370
in as your gurantor,

7
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,370
If it wasn't because leader stood

8
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,210
in front of Chairman Jin,

9
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,930
do you think Zhao Yang would let you go?

10
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,850
Since the changes have been made,

11
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,290
control your temper.

12
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,290
Don't start anything.

13
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,270
Pei Xi.

14
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,910
Don't think that by doing this.

15
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,790
I will appreciate it.

16
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,230
Let me tell you, I don't care.

17
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,350
Lin Yi Xuan.

18
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,830
Go back to practicing.

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,110
Let's go.

20
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,310
Quickly go and practice.

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,510
This is our practice round with New Land.

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,710
Be more serious.

23
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,030
Four protecting one.

24
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,060
Whether we're serious or not, it'll be the same.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,020
Stop saying nonsense, hurry.

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,520
Why are you here?

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
I've already been here for half a day.

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,760
You didn't even see

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,560
someone so handsome?

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,600
You're too hardworking.

31
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,510
Who called me to be dumb?

32
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,150
I can't escape once I

33
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,190
insert my head into the sea of questions.

34
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,830
But how did you know

35
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,870
that I'm here?

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,950
You're not at Dream Journey cafe.

37
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,710
I'm guessed that

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,780
you'd be here.

39
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,380
And I really guessed correctly.

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,860
Your eyebrows are going to get tangled.

41
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,660
What's wrong?

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,980
You're met with trouble again?

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,410
I went to ask Teacher Luo Tian to be my teacher.

44
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,370
But,

45
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,930
I got rejected.

46
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,210
No.

47
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,210
You asked him directly?

48
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,050
You're too excellent.

49
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,490
Go and ask Summer ge

50
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,450
in the past few years

51
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,930
has Teacher Luo ever accepted any students?

52
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,450
I know.

53
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,210
But Summer ge told me,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,160
he said,

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,880
since Teacher Luo Tian is willing to scold you,

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,880
it means that you have potential.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120
That's why he was so strict to me.

58
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
You're willing to believe in

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,230
Summer ge's words?

60
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,550
He and Luo Tian,

61
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,270
are best friends for many years.

62
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,990
How could he lie?

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,100
Is he trying to comfort me?

64
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,820
Maybe I'm really not good.

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,140
I shouldn't have listened to you from the start

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,530
and chose to be a professional commentator.

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,690
If you made the choice but don't work hard,

68
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,050
will you be able to reach your goal?

69
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,010
Besides,

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,930
you don't want work hard because

71
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,090
Teacher Luo didn't accept you as a student?

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Your dream is to

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,000
become a commentator.

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,480
Not to become someone's disciple.

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,960
If this time,

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,760
you can win on

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
tomorrow's star,

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,640
naturally,

79
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,080
you'll be able to successfully enter

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,460
the commentator role.

81
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,180
You're right.

82
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,580
But I really feel like

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm a little stupid.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,260
I've answered so many questions

85
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,860
and finished the questions I have,

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,300
but I still only know how to answer questions.

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,300
I absolutely can't find

88
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,420
the feeling of being a commentator.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,020
Do you still remember

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,140
I thought you how to play 'ladder'?

91
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,060
Using battle to replace practice

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,980
is the best way to bring up the mood.

93
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,500
Just like Teacher Luo,

94
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
competitions previously.

95
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
he partook in professional

96
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
And he became the best commentator.

97
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,820
He also went through

98
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,740
continuous self practice,

99
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,140
this is better than

100
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,570
just memorising.

101
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,390
You mean

102
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,590
I should directly go for the competition,

103
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,430
and find someone to pinpoint.

104
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,870
I mean

105
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,790
after that, go and find Teacher Luo directly.

106
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,230
At most, you'll be rejected.

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,390
but what if

108
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,630
he's willing to teach you?

109
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,270
Right.

110
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,270
You're too awesome, Ji Xiang Kong.

111
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,830
There's so many people here.

112
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,590
Be mindful of your image.

113
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,390
Don't start any gossip.

114
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,310
I was too happy.

115
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,550
Thank you.

116
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,780
What are you thanking me for?

117
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,540
Don't be so polite between your friends.

118
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,300
Okay.

119
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,180
After finishing this milk tea,

120
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,380
to the team and rest.

121
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,380
I should probably also return

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
Lin Yi Xuan, stop gifting others your points.

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,600
I did it purposely.

124
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,150
Lin Yi Xuan.

125
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,590
Don't cross over the tower.

126
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,150
You're already taking another route.

127
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,030
I know.

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,380
Xuan ge, put more people behind you.

129
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,860
No money, make it yourself.

130
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,860
Wait for me.

131
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,620
Me and the opposite team

132
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
have a difference of more than 100 knives.

133
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,570
How do I play?

134
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,450
You're only this standard?

135
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,570
Yes, I'm only at this level.

136
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,450
At most, put me back into the subsitute position.

137
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,360
So this is Ji Xiang Kong's

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
top support?

139
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,200
You're as good as a newbie.

140
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
What do you mean?

141
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,350
Kong ge looked for you?

142
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,430
No.

143
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,230
God of bringing trouble.

144
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,270
I'm talking to you.

145
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,700
Kong ge looked for him before?

146
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,620
He looked for Kong ge before?

147
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,100
I don't know.

148
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,810
Why are you standing there for?

149
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,930
Let's start.

150
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,850
I really don't know

151
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,960
what you want to do.

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,400
What are you doing?

153
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Don't you know how to play basketball?

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,720
Can't be right?

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
It's written on your information

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,360
that you're good at basketball right?

157
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
That's in the past.

158
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,740
Three years ago,

159
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,860
you were the China's mid-solo player.

160
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,940
Your results are not too bad.

161
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,100
So?

162
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,180
I don't believe

163
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,340
you don't want to return.

164
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,820
I don't want to.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,820
Are you willing to continue losing?

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,500
Previously,

167
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,420
I watched your competitions.

168
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,970
did a strong kill

169
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,970
When you crossed the tower and

170
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,930
my coach told me

171
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,630
young people like you are scary.

172
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,750
But the way you are currently,

173
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,350
only makes me think of four words.

174
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,070
No desire, no requests.

175
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,430
I really can't understand

176
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,110
this Ji Xiang Kong.

177
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,510
What exactly is he doing?

178
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,670
It's good to have ideas.

179
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,150
Gaming tactics and playing basketball

180
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,190
are two different things.

181
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,070
Using practice time to play basketball.

182
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,390
Is this acceptable?

183
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,790
Li Gan.

184
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,910
In the past I only knew

185
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,910
about Lu Sheng begging to be stable,

186
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,380
If it's not because this time

187
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,740
he rejected the mid-solo position,

188
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,980
I almost didn't notice

189
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,300
Lu Sheng became like this.

190
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,260
but wish to not make any mistakes.

191
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,260
Don't beg to make progress,

192
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,040
Almost lost my fighting spirit.

193
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Lu Sheng,

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,600
has balanced statistics.

195
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
Is stable in his play.

196
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,240
I don't see any problem.

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,520
Don't you think that he's too stable?

198
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
He's always defending.

199
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
He never initates attacks.

200
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,600
He even reject

201
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,800
any risky things.

202
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,460
Maybe Ji Xiang Kong

203
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,300
is using his own method

204
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,940
to awaken Lu Sheng's fighting spirit.

205
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,620
Even if it's so,

206
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,620
this isn't

207
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,260
something that can be resolved

208
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,650
by playing a few rounds of basketball.

209
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,770
You and Ji Xiang Kong

210
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,490
still haven't gave up

211
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,930
on the idea of letting Lu Sheng play mid solo?

212
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,930
Should I give up?

213
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,070
Why are you not practicing but looking for me?

214
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,670
Why is your face so sad?

215
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,070
Kong ge.

216
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Is it you

217
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,580
who asked Pei Xi to switch me back?

218
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,660
Since you're back,

219
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,460
practice well.

220
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Why are you asking so much?

221
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,980
Why did you beg him?

222
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Why did you beg him?

223
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,500
At first, it was him

224
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,140
who pushed you off the position of a leader.

225
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,500
You know I don't get along well with him

226
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,850
yet you still went to beg him.

227
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,410
I'm not going back.

228
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,290
I don't want to be grateful to him.

229
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,210
Why are you still being arrogant?

230
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,570
If you don't go back where do you go?

231
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,690
So many teams

232
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,930
which team will want someone

233
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,040
like you that has no team spirit?

234
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
Anywhere is good.

235
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,200
a internet cafe manager

236
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,200
I'll go to Sun ge's place to be

237
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,200
be a pratice buddy,

238
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
in the current Legends team.

239
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
I'd still be stronger compared to staying

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
You're sure?

241
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
- Yes.

242
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,140
You don't want your brothers anymore?

243
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,620
No.

244
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,020
Let's go.

245
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,060
No. What are we going to do?

246
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,260
Let's go, end the contract.

247
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,100
Wait a minute.

248
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,860
Let us discuss a little.

249
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,540
Why are you so nervous?

250
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,380
You said it yourself.

251
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,620
How can you go back on your words?

252
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,620
You're good.

253
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,260
From today on you're my Xuan ge.

254
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,260
A two years contract,

255
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,060
you're ending it because you want to.

256
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,180
The breach of contract fees are so high

257
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
yet you don't even blink.

258
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,420
I don't have money.

259
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,860
If I had money, I would have left long ago.

260
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,780
I have.

261
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,180
Sell the bike, let's go.

262
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,100
Wait a minute.

263
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,100
- Go.

264
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,100
Stop.

265
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Stop.

266
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,860
Come back.

267
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,010
I'm wrong, is that okay?

268
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,170
But I have to be clear.

269
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,890
I'm not going to be grateful to Pei Xi.

270
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,530
I'm only grateful to you.

271
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,710
Enough.

272
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,910
Go back.

273
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,310
No, it's still early now.

274
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,270
Let's talk for a while more.

275
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,190
If you're not going, treat me to a meal.

276
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,350
Kong ge, bye.

277
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,030
Thank you everyone for watching, bye.

278
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,980
Look at you.

279
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,740
Since early morning till now,

280
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,820
this is the N plus N times,

281
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,980
you've recorded the commentary video.

282
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,140
How is this recording?

283
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,340
Up till now,

284
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,380
it's one of the best.

285
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,800
But its still terrible.

286
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,360
I feel embarassed to show it to Teacher Luo.

287
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,120
Everything

288
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,840
requires a step by step process.

289
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,640
Right?

290
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,960
Just bravely

291
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
take this for Luo Tian to see.

292
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
This way, you'll be able to improve.

293
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Right?

294
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,760
Logical.

295
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,760
Then this will be it.

296
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll copy the video out now.

297
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,750
Right, Qiu Ying.

298
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,350
How long have you not been contacting Yan Yan?

299
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,670
Yan Yan?

300
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,180
For a few months probably.

301
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Previously, she came to my house

302
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,460
and told me she quarreled with her boyfriend.

303
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,420
She stayed for the night.

304
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,140
Later, I tried calling her again.

305
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,900
She just kept saying she's busy.

306
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,730
Why do you suddenly ask about her?

307
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,490
Nothing.

308
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,930
I'm just simply asking.

309
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,770
Okay, then I'll talk to you later.

310
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,810
I have to quickly take this

311
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,530
video to Teacher Luo.

312
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,210
Do you need to be in such a hurry?

313
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,090
Seek opinions while it's early.

314
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,970
Help me pack the things a little.

315
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,010
You-

316
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,010
It's cloudy outside.

317
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,640
before heading out.

318
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,640
Remember to bring an umbrella

319
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,500
You can only do bold things

320
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,780
if you're shameless.

321
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,900
Sorry.

322
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:29,890
Teacher Luo.

323
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,490
Why are you here?

324
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,330
This is my game commentary.

325
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,050
Please teach me.

326
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,080
Pick up your umbrella and go back quickly.

327
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Thank you Teacher Luo.

328
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
- Bye Teacher Luo.

329
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
Go.

330
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,700
Bye teacher.

331
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,340
Nice.

332
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,260
Look at how you tortured yourself.

333
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,660
Come.

334
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,780
Quickly finish drinking this.

335
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,300
Be careful, it's hot.

336
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,700
You're really able.

337
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,620
You really treat yourself as a King Kong?

338
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,210
Stayed up overnight.

339
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,050
in a few hours of rain.

340
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,050
And you ran out and drenched yourself

341
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,650
Do you still want your body?

342
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,850
Who knows the rain would be so heavy?

343
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,650
Be careful, it's hot.

344
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,750
Yi Yi.

345
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,670
How much ginger did you put in?

346
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,910
You'll be able to recover faster if I put more.

347
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,070
Drink quickly.

348
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,950
Finish drinking.

349
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,790
And quickly crawl into bed and sleep.

350
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,270
How am I able to fall asleep now?

351
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,070
At this time,

352
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,110
Teacher Luo should be off work.

353
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,310
What if he's watching my video?

354
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,550
No way, Yi Yi.

355
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,910
I'm so nervous.

356
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,510
What are you nervous for?

357
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,550
Why don't you

358
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,030
give him a call?

359
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,790
Ask him.

360
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,300
I'm not calling, I don't dare.

361
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,500
What's there to not dare to do?

362
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,780
I put in so much effort.

363
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,340
To help you get

364
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,380
his phone number.

365
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Now you're telling me that

366
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,780
you don't dare.

367
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,800
If I were you,

368
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
I would have called him

369
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,880
a long time ago.

370
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,520
I will

371
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
continuously ask him.

372
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,400
What are you scared of?

373
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Hello?

374
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,920
Hello?

375
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,560
It went through.

376
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
Hello Teacher Luo.

377
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,550
Hello.

378
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,430
Hello, I'm Qiu Ying.

379
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,030
Hello.

380
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,590
Have you watched the video I gave you?

381
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,220
I can't open your thumb drive.

382
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,020
Can't open?

383
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,700
Maybe it's because it's raining today.

384
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,100
Really so sorry.

385
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,620
Teacher Luo,

386
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,740
I'll copy it right now

387
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,730
and send it to you.

388
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,850
Sorry.

389
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,410
There was only one chance.

390
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,930
Hello Teacher Luo?

391
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,330
He hung up?

392
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,410
How could you spoil the thumb drive?

393
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,450
It's raining today.

394
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,970
I dropped it in a puddle.

395
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,890
Dropped it in a puddle?

396
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm really so stupid.

397
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,280
Forget it.

398
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't be too upset.

399
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
But, this Luo Tian too,

400
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,320
he's too harsh.

401
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,150
You didn't do it on purpose.

402
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,070
If the earth lost him,

403
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,230
it can't revolve anymore...

404
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,030
Believe me.

405
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,310
Sooner or later, one day

406
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,150
you'll show him how the

407
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,020
Qiu Ying who's standing on the commentator table

408
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,900
is so excellent.

409
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,700
Make him regret.

410
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,580
Let him see.

411
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,140
Hurry.

412
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,900
Yi Yi, hurry.

413
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,260
Hand me your thumb drive.

414
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,740
What for?

415
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,180
Tomorrow he's going to watch the game.

416
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,460
I don't care if he gives me a chance or not.

417
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,060
I must let him see.

418
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,650
Let's go.

419
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,370
Quickly.

420
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,410
Help me get it.

421
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,010
Okay.

422
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,570
I'll take it for you.

423
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Wen jie.

424
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Wen jie are you done eating?

425
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,600
Why are you eating

426
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
such simple food today?

427
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,020
We are grown men.

428
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,420
Is it not okay to eat simply?

429
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,100
Lu Sheng.

430
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,340
Why are you injured?

431
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,700
He fell while playing basketball, Wen jie.

432
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,300
The most important thing

433
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
to a professional gamer are his hands.

434
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,980
He practiced till it's like that.

435
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,060
How to continue practicing?

436
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,340
Lu Sheng.

437
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,940
You're injured while playing basketball.

438
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,060
Does it hurt?

439
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,900
It's fine, Wen jie.

440
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,420
I just scrapped some skin.

441
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,210
It's fine if you're okay.

442
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,130
Xiang Kong.

443
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,810
Be careful of your safety while playing basketball.

444
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,570
Eat slowly.

445
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,710
Shen Yue.

446
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,070
Do you know what will happen after a

447
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,950
player with bad hands practice basketball?

448
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,190
What?

449
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,030
Still bad with his hands.

450
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,710
Let's meet later.

451
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,230
Let's meet later.

452
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,940
Lu Sheng.

453
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,740
Just now, Qi ge and I were helping you.

454
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,620
Why did you say it's fine?

455
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,420
Because it's really fine.

456
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
Be more energetic.

457
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
You must take revenge today.

458
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,720
Teacher Luo.

459
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,240
About that,

460
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,880
I made a new

461
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,000
commentary video.

462
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,000
I said before.

463
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
There's only one chance.

464
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,590
But that day, it was raining.

465
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,030
When you're doing a commentary,

466
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,310
can you stop mid way?

467
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,190
Stop finding excuses.

468
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,060
So awkward.

469
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,860
Just nice that I saw it.

470
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Qiu Ying.

471
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,060
Actually,

472
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,260
I should really thank you.

473
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,700
On the finals stage for

474
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,930
"Tomorrow's star",

475
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,330
With you as a contrast,

476
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,810
I'm already a little bit embarassed.

477
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,210
Qiao Xin.

478
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,730
Aren't you tired?

479
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,930
Acting like a bluff everyday.

480
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,810
Never putting your efforts into

481
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,690
finding out how to improve

482
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,690
yourself professionally.

483
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,370
Just thinking of

484
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,890
how you can make use of others to climb further.

485
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,250
You're so speculative.

486
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,250
Are you not scared that

487
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,090
the success you receive,

488
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,440
will bring you to a down fall?

489
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,840
You have no right to say this to me.

490
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,470
clear the obstacles just now.

491
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,470
Thank you for helping me to

492
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,870
How is it?

493
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,500
Are you willing to

494
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,460
play a good round with me today?

495
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,380
let out your advance guard abilities.

496
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,620
I only have that little abilities.

497
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,460
You really don't need to waste your efforts.

498
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,260
It's useless.

499
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,020
VNG's target is to be world champion.

500
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,420
If you really have no abilities,

501
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,940
I wouldn't put you as mid-solo.

502
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,020
But if you want to think that you're useless,

503
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
then I'm incompetent too.

504
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,250
I don't care if you're injured.

505
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,050
Waiting for you to show some powerful moves.

506
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
This tactic...

507
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Ji Xiang Kong

508
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,560
on battlegrounds.

509
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,560
Ji Xiang Kong is the master of deception

510
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,940
So good.

511
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,180
So good.

512
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,620
What's this?

513
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,100
Qi ge.

514
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,140
How good is he?

515
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,140
Tell us.

516
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,500
No.

517
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,540
How many days has it been?

518
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,300
And you became

519
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,780
Ji Xiang Kong's follower?

520
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,740
He asked me to watch this video.

521
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,100
Is that it?

522
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,260
Who should you listen to?

523
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,250
Think about that carefully.

524
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,250
Got it, Qi ge.

525
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,570
I'm thirsty.

526
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,090
Go and buy some drinks for me.

527
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,310
Teacher Luo is here.

528
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,870
Sorry.

529
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,310
I made a commentary

530
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,070
video.

531
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,860
I want to show it to Teacher Luo Tian.

532
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,300
Hello everyone.

533
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,140
I am Qiu Ying.

534
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,260
Today I will be commentating on

535
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,620
Conquer's 2017

536
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,460
worldwide finals, third round

537
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,440
2 out of 3 rounds.

538
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,440
where the team won by

539
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
Legends versus Super feeling.

540
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,240
Team battle, start.

541
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
crowd in a twinkle.

542
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
Brambles queen has entered the

543
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,040
Used three skills,

544
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,800
and she wants to capture Chariot man.

545
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
But the Mogra beside

546
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,160
the Chariot man,

547
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,880
encircled the Brambles queen

548
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
with one skill

549
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,640
at this moment.

550
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,000
The two worked together to eliminate-

551
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
I can make a video of this standard too.

552
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,360
Exactly.

553
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,350
I can too.

554
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,950
Embarrassing, over estimated herself.

555
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,510
At this time,

556
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,550
the sword saint chose to

557
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,710
enter into the crowd from the side.

558
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,510
And show his powerful moves.

559
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,500
But when he rushed till mid way,

560
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,460
he suddenly got sent back to square one

561
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,300
with one move from the powerful statesman.

562
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,780
And got killed in seconds.

563
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,650
Laughing stock, this counts as commentary?

564
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,090
Sorry.

565
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,410
I wasted everyone's time.

566
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,050
Sorry Teacher Luo Tian.

567
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,730
Wait.

568
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,800
I believe that

569
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
in the audience

570
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,550
are like Qiu Ying.

571
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,110
Holding onto the dream of becoming

572
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,830
a professional commentator.

573
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,230
That's why you guys came to my

574
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,670
video commentaries after competitions.

575
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,870
Today,

576
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,910
I'll use this opportunity

577
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,070
to explain to everyone

578
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,500
what's required

579
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,900
for a live commentary

580
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,700
and a comentary after competition.

581
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,900
Just now, everyone saw

582
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,780
Qiu Ying's commentary.

583
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,940
She only

584
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,940
told everyone

585
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,220
about the competition

586
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,260
in full detail.

587
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,620
This type of repeating

588
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,860
has no meaning entirely.

589
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,580
Because the purpose of a commentary

590
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,860
is to allow the audience to

591
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,380
understand the situation better

592
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,490
while watching the battle.

593
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,970
I want to lead the audience to understand

594
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,690
that you must posses the following points

595
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,890
in order to be a good commentator.

596
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,490
First and foremost,

597
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,840
go between

598
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
explaining

599
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
and skills analysis.

600
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,720
But in amongst which,

601
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
there's one more important point that

602
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
everyone must be aware.

603
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,400
It is to carry the emotions of the audience

604
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,900
Okay.

605
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,900
Now, let's watch this competition.

606
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,580
The most important point

607
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,460
of this group battle,

608
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,420
is when wild horse chose a

609
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,940
very good time to cut in.

610
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,140
And directly cut to

611
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,460
the center of the battle.

612
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,060
He not only made use of one skill

613
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,180
to exhuast three opponent's blood levels,

614
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,740
he used a second to control

615
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,940
and prevent the opponent's escape.

616
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,300
The opponent's core is being controlled.

617
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,140
They're unable to escape.

618
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,180
So,

619
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,140
the current situation on the ground

620
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,580
has became 4 versus 5 immediately.

621
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,610
What they can do now is to await death.

622
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,530
Or

623
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,290
conceal the attacker and allow him to escape.

624
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,090
But what's the most surprising is that

625
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,010
wild horse

626
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,650
chose a speed deduction fit before it started.

627
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,670
speed to slow down.

628
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,670
This causes the opponent's escaping

629
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,830
So, he achieved the team's success by

630
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,310
exchanging four for one.

631
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,150
Next time,

632
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,350
don't ever let me see such

633
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,590
useless things.

634
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,790
Sorry Teacher Luo Tian.

635
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,230
now we'll move onto the main topic.

636
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,230
Okay,

637
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,310
Summer ge.

638
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,260
You're becoming good.

639
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,220
Where?

640
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,260
If there was a hole just now,

641
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,020
I would have crawled in.

642
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,780
But, at least the result was good.

643
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,720
Which part was good?

644
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,080
Which part isn't?

645
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,120
What did Luo Tian last say?

646
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,080
Didn't he just say

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,400
in future,

648
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
don't ever let me see such useless things.

649
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,200
Didn't he already say?

650
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,640
There's a next time.

651
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,360
Next time.

652
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,190
There's still a next time.

653
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,140
Xin Xin,

654
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,700
how was it?

655
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,860
What do you want to eat in the afternoon?

656
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,340
Have a shot with me first.

657
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,340
It's broad day light, why are you drinking?

658
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,140
Crazy.

659
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,010
Why? Are you angry?

660
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,010
Who made you angry?

661
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,210
Who else?

662
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:57,930
It's that

663
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,450
thick skinned Qiu Ying.

664
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,810
Qiu Ying?

665
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,490
Didn't she already leave UXStar?

666
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,650
She can't be a threat to you right?

667
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,050
Our Xiao Xin Xin is the best.

668
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,730
Stop saying nice things.

669
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,770
Do you know?

670
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,800
Today, Luo Tian

671
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,120
was doing a commentary at Dream Journey.

672
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,440
Didn't you see how

673
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
Qiu Ying treated Luo Tian?

674
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,960
Clingy.

675
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't care.

676
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,160
I must get

677
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,320
the championship for "Tommorow's star".

678
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,470
Or else,

679
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,750
even if I get into GDV,

680
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,550
I would still have no way

681
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,670
to stand beside Luo Tian.

682
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,590
Then how can I be

683
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,590
the first female commentator?

684
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,150
Do you think it's true?

685
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,870
You're worried about Luo Tian.

686
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,620
Then you can keep your feelings.

687
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,020
Really?

688
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,260
Of course, it's true.

689
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,020
Am I not familiar enough with Luo Tian?

690
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,660
He hates clingy and persistent people.

691
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,100
So, the more Qiu Ying clings to him,

692
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,180
the more he will feel repelled.

693
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,620
About this,

694
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,380
I've also considered that before.

695
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,900
But today,

696
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,330
personally taught

697
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,730
Qiu Ying how to do commentary.

698
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,690
This isn't possible.

699
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,450
Why not?

700
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,850
Not only Luo Tian,

701
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,360
Qiu Ying

702
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,120
also became a waitress at Dream Journey.

703
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
I heard that Summer

704
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,920
wants to guide her.

705
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
He wants to help her secure championship.

706
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,840
Just based on their

707
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
position in the industry,

708
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,780
it's going to be really easy.

709
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,020
So what if Luo Tian helps Qiu Ying.

710
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,860
I know someone

711
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,900
in GDV who can help.

712
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,700
Baby.

713
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,420
If you need to,

714
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,420
just let me know anytime.

715
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
Okay?

716
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,620
Our Xiao Xin Xin

717
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,300
is really work orientated.

718
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,540
Let me tell you.

719
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,620
Right now, UXStar

720
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
can't really help me anymore.

721
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,220
But this champion position,

722
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,140
I definitely must get it.

723
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,460
I know.

724
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,860
So,

725
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,780
when it's time,

726
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,530
I might have to do

727
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,290
some things that I can't not do.

728
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,530
Don't be mistaken.

729
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,210
I'm sincere towards you.

730
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm doing this

731
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,290
for the sake of my career.

732
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,630
Okay.

733
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,830
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

734
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,870
Wait a minute.

735
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,310
No, this is-

736
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,340
Help me make a check on this.

737
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,900
Why are you checking this?

738
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,660
It's not easy to check this.

739
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,860
I know.

740
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,740
Otherwise, I wouldn't ask you to check.

741
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,520
Are you sure that you want to find out?

742
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,640
Once you have news,

743
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,160
let me know immediately.

744
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,200
Yi Yi, I'm back.

745
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,920
- Yi Yi.

746
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,920
Qiu Ying.

747
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,640
Let me tell you.

748
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,150
Today, Luo Tian told me that

749
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,670
next time, don't let me see such

750
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,030
useless things anymore.

751
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,550
At first, I didn't understand.

752
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,910
I only realised later.

753
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,750
He said next time.

754
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,190
The meaning of "next time" is

755
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,020
he'll still give me feedback next time.

756
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,460
What's wrong with you?

757
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,620
You're not even excited.

758
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,660
No.

759
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,020
What's wrong?

760
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,380
Look.

761
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,460
Who's here?

762
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,970
Yan Yan.

763
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,050
Why did you come?

764
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,650
Two days ago,

765
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,010
Yi Yi was still mentioning about you to me,

766
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,850
saying that you came.

767
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,050
No,

768
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,610
Why are you crying?

769
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,770
Who bullied you?

770
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,490
Don't cry.

771
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,570
It's

772
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,210
your boyfriend isn't it?

773
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,960
It's okay, Yan Yan.

774
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
Tell her.

775
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,470
What happened?

776
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,580
Sorry, Qiu Ying.

777
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,300
What's going on?

778
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,940
That fake fighting video

779
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,660
was actually uploaded by me.

780
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,250
When did you upload it?

781
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,040
Last time,

782
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,960
when I went to your house to stay.

783
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,240
I used your computer to secretly upload it.

784
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,000
No.

785
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,260
Why did you do that?

786
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,980
Because she was threatened.

787
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,940
Threatened?

788
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,580
Qiao Xin said

789
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,300
she'll introduce me

790
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,460
to a lingerie commercial.

791
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,260
It pays well.

792
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,220
So I agreed.

793
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,220
Who knows after I finished shooting it,

794
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,300
I received

795
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,090
the photos and videos of me changing.

796
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,090
Sorry Qiu Ying.

797
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,410
But.

798
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,510
I've already checked the situation.

799
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,590
The person who called me

800
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,630
is called Wang Bin.

801
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,030
Zhao Yang

802
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,790
wants to kick Ji Xiang Kong out of legends.

803
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,510
So he thought of

804
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,390
faking the video of Ji Xiang Kong fighting.

805
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,670
Qiao Xin

806
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,830
wants to chase you out of UXStar.

807
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,510
It coincidentally fits with Zhao Yang's plan.

808
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,030
So Qiao Xin

809
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,310
lied and asked Yan Yan

810
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,230
to shoot the lingerie commercial.

811
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,990
In the end, during the process,

812
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,270
Zhao Yang's assistant

813
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,150
snapped pictures of her changing

814
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,660
and forced her

815
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
to use your laptop

816
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,860
and send out the fake video.

817
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,200
It's all my fault.

818
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm too stupid, too weak.

819
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,320
And caused you to leave UXStar.

820
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,040
And even have to sell your home.

821
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,350
Forget it.

822
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,870
Anyway, the thing is over.

823
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,630
You're also a victim.

824
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,140
I don't blame you.

825
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,540
Yes.

826
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,500
Those that really made the mistake

827
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,860
definitely can't be

828
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,260
able to live so peacefully.

829
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,810
Qiu Ying.

830
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,170
Qiu Ying why are you back?

831
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,490
President Liu isn't in today.

832
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,730
Qiu Ying. Qiu-

833
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,930
Why did you come here?

834
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,210
You can't be here to beg President Liu

835
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,090
to let you come back right?

836
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,410
I know.

837
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:52,810
You came because

838
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,410
of "Tomorrow's star" competition right?

839
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,720
UXStar is the one of the sponsors.

840
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,640
You calculated carefully the

841
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,960
relationship between President Liu and GDV.

842
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,320
You want him to help you put in a good word.

843
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,640
Qiao Xin.

844
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,630
My respect for you has increased.

845
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,470
After doing so many dirty things,

846
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,670
you still can act as if it's nothing.

847
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,310
I still have a show to film.

848
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,430
I don't have time to waste on you.

849
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,470
How did you threaten Yan Yan?

850
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,020
How did you force her to harm me?

851
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,380
Do you want me to say it out now?

852
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,900
Everyone in the office knows

853
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,980
you and Yan Yan are best friends.

854
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:21,820
You think that

855
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,980
based on the both of your bad acting skills,

856
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,220
it's able to help you turn your life around?

857
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,220
I contributed so much for the company.

858
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,540
Will President Liu

859
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,660
make me leave the company based on

860
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,700
the things you two say?

861
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,060
Right now,

862
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,180
it's definitely not worth to act like this.

863
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,450
President Liu.

864
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,970
Qiu Ying is slandering me.

865
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,570
Conquer is our most important project

866
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,490
since the company transformed.

867
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,210
I definitely will help the company

868
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,280
win the championship of "Tomorrow's star".

869
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,360
But you definitely can't

870
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
be tricked by them.

871
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,680
Is that amazing, Qiao Xin?

872
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
No one can beat your talking skills.

873
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,380
A black object can be

874
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,420
described as a white one by you.

875
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,580
Throughout these years,

876
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,980
how much resources did the company use

877
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,100
to allow you to transform.

878
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,740
But did UXStar successfully transform?

879
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,060
President Liu.

880
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,180
Did you never think of why that's so?

881
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,860
Because Qiao Xin

882
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
you completely didn't put your efforts

883
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
into how to

884
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
raise your professional level.

885
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,780
And is immersed in becoming the top.

886
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,380
Exclude any person

887
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,820
that could be a competitor to you

888
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,260
If the whole company acknowledges

889
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,500
the way you handle things,

890
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,900
then I should really be thankful

891
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
that I left previously.

892
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,690
You should carefully consider

893
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:27,890
what right do you have

894
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,130
to stand on "Tomorrow's star" stage.

895
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,930
Competing with me.

896
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,010
Qiu Ying, wait a minute.

897
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,730
Are you willing to come back?

898
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,110
Represent UXStar for the competition.

899
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,230
If you're willing to come back,

900
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,830
the company will do its utmost

901
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,870
to train and create you.

902
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,990
Thank you.

903
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,310
President Liu.

904
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,670
You

905
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,710
really want to let her come back?

906
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,870
Do you still want to let her be the ace

907
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,030
What position are you putting me at?

908
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,390
I did so much for the company.

909
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,500
I-

910
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,700
Qiao Xin.

911
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,580
You were someone I cultivated.

912
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,740
I'm very clear of how much

913
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
you've done for the company.

914
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
I hope that when you have time,

915
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,720
think about

916
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
how much the company has given you.

917
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
[Cousin]

918
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,140
Are you sure it's them?

919
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,140
There's sufficient evidence.

920
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,340
it's just as you predicted.

921
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,780
Then just directly call the police.

922
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,370
What are you guys doing?

923
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,530
I asked you guys to cooperate.

924
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,850
Stand on stage for the store.

925
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,210
Is it that difficult?

926
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,170
You're making excuses one by one,

927
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,570
no time,

928
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,810
busy with practice.

929
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,040
Usually why don't I see

930
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,440
you guys working so hard?

931
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,840
Forget about others.

932
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
Huo Yao.

933
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,310
Why are you dragging me?

934
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,430
You have weak skills and you're old.

935
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,910
Your hand speed

936
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,870
for another 100 years.

937
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,870
is still the same even if you practice

938
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,950
Finding excuses for me,

939
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,700
messing with me?!

940
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,100
Manager Zhao,

941
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,900
this is

942
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,180
a little overboard now.

943
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
The competition is nearing.

944
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,500
Increasing the team's practice

945
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,300
is logical right?

946
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,500
Besides, Huo Yao's recent condition

947
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,340
is pretty good too.

948
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,940
Exactly.

949
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,460
When the previous few leaders were here,

950
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,050
all said that Yao ge could resist stress.

951
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,130
Made little mistakes.

952
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
The degree of your glasses,

953
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,720
did it increase again?

954
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,000
If it did, get a new one.

955
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,260
The leader is sitting opposite you.

956
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,020
Can't you see?

957
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,420
Previous leader

958
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,540
What previous leader?

959
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,220
Your leader left.

960
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,820
Do words they've said count?

961
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,620
Resisting stress.

962
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,940
Made little mistakes.

963
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,940
During the internal trial competition,

964
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,740
isn't he swapped out by

965
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,420
our Pei Xi?

966
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,580
Huo Yao.

967
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,660
During the internal trial competition,

968
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,780
what kind of

969
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
bull shit was your performance?

970
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,450
You still want me to renew your contract.

971
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,370
What are you doing, Yi Xuan?

972
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,970
What are you doing?

973
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,430
What are you doing?

974
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,870
Zhao Yang

975
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,750
you're playing the "framing" card right?

976
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,790
Pushed my Kong ge out.

977
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,270
The dirty things you did

978
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,550
it's time I made you pay.

979
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,750
Lin Yi Xuan what are you saying?

980
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,030
That fake video

981
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,070
was made by you, asshole.

982
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,230
Nonsense.

983
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,430
You-

984
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,390
He not only did that.

985
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,670
He used the contract renewal to threaten me.

986
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,230
He made me purposely lose on the competition.

987
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,510
So that Ji handsome could leave Legends.

988
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,060
Zhao Yang, you jerk.

989
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,380
What are you doing? Go back.

990
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,860
What are you doing?

991
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,340
Didn't you say I was not skilled?

992
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,300
Didn't you say I was old?

993
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,980
- Yes.

994
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,980
You-

995
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,340
I lost the competition.

996
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,220
The problem is me.

997
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,280
But this has nothing

998
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,440
to do with Ji handsome.

999
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,600
You guys.

1000
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,520
You guys are casually opining here,

1001
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
what evidence do you have?

1002
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,720
Take out the evidence.

1003
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,080
What are you saying if you have no evidence?

1004
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,880
Still insulting a manager here.

1005
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,320
Do you believe that I'll fire you guys?

1006
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,990
I am the leader.

1007
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,550
No one has the right to punish my members

1008
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,950
without my permission.

1009
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,620
Pei Xi, I'm helping you here.

1010
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,100
It's all because of me?

1011
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,300
How would I feel it's for your benefit?

1012
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,740
Who said

1013
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,740
was if I become leader.

1014
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,740
The condition that I could join Legends

1015
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,010
Pei Xi.

1016
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:18,810
Now

1017
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,530
isn't time to talk about this.

1018
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,650
No, I want to talk about it now.

1019
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,170
Sure.

1020
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,770
Pei Xi.

1021
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,770
You understand I, Zhao Yang.

1022
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,730
I have the abilities to

1023
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,960
recruit you from somewhere else.

1024
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,720
I also have the ability to kick you out.

1025
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Think before opposing me.

1026
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,440
It's not your turn to fire others.

1027
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,510
Chairman Jin.

1028
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,990
There's someone leaving.

1029
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,110
Zhao Yang.

1030
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,870
You're fired.

1031
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,860
No.

1032
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,740
No, Chairman Jin.

1033
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,580
You're mistaken.

1034
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,420
You're mistaken.

1035
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,660
No.

1036
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,620
Listen to me explain.

1037
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,620
This group of kids

1038
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,300
are talking nonsense.

1039
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,500
Don't listen to them.

1040
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,980
I- really

1041
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,300
How is it possible for me to do that

1042
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,180
right?

1043
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,300
Think about it.

1044
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,250
I worked with you for so many years.

1045
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,650
We went everywhere.

1046
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,370
For you,

1047
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,930
I signed so many sponsorship contracts.

1048
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,650
So the company could have it's success today.

1049
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,730
Now you want to fire me?

1050
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,600
Then our company's sponsorship contract

1051
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,600
will be gone within minutes.

1052
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,680
What has it got to do with you?

1053
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,040
Sponsors came because of me.

1054
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,020
Wang Bin is already caught.

1055
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,860
Maybe the next one will be you.

1056
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,820
You're still refusing to admit?

1057
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,940
Yes.

1058
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,660
I really value

1059
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,140
Legends' business operations.

1060
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,620
endless money to earn.

1061
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,620
But what I want is not

1062
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,020
I wanted to create the

1063
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,140
top world wide best team.

1064
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,060
Earning money isn't my purpose.

1065
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,500
These money

1066
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,620
are so that the kids.

1067
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,300
can create a miracle

1068
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,170
without caring about anything.

1069
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:13,850
Zhao Yang.

1070
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,010
You've followed me for so many years.

1071
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,230
Yet, you're becoming more blur now.

1072
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,550
I understand.

1073
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,190
Chairman Jin.

1074
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,510
Thank you for your care and guidance

1075
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,990
throughout the past few years.

1076
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,070
Legends mission.

1077
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,670
Never give up.

1078
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,320
Kong ge.

1079
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,800
Ji handsome.

1080
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,640
Why are the few of you

1081
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
not practicing but staying here?

1082
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,080
Kong ge.

1083
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,400
The dirty things that Zhao Yang did

1084
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,160
Everyone knows about it.

1085
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,640
Leader.

1086
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,750
Ji handsome.

1087
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,230
We lost during the competition

1088
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,950
because of me.

1089
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,750
Nothing to do with you.

1090
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,630
Now, Chairman Jin

1091
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,990
already knows the truth.

1092
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,140
I let you down.

1093
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,330
Ji Shuai.

1094
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,570
If you're unhappy,

1095
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,810
we'll help you teach him a lesson.

1096
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,850
Enough.

1097
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,090
It's over now.

1098
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,610
The rest of you don't find trouble for me.

1099
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,250
I'm pretty good here.

1100
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,850
No.

1101
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,530
Kong ge.

1102
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,530
Everyone

1103
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,560
wishes that you can come back.

1104
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,720
And be our leader.

1105
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,800
When you're not around

1106
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,040
we don't even have energy to practice.

1107
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,920
Besides, you also know Pei Xi.

1108
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,550
Leader.

1109
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,870
We need you.

1110
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,740
Thank you.

1111
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,820
But when I was at my lowest,

1112
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,460
VNG accepted me.

1113
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,370
Say something.

1114
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,320
Then I'll speak.

1115
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,960
Kong ge.

1116
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,840
We aren't asking you to betray VNG.

1117
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,320
Everyone of us just hope that

1118
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,480
you'll be back on the right path.

1119
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,160
Don't forget.

1120
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,340
You promise leader Gu Fang previously.

1121
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,380
You will bring us to championship.

1122
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,060
Sorry.

1123
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,700
I won't go back.

1124
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,020
Leader Gu Fang said that

1125
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,780
no matter what team you're in,

1126
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,420
you must trust your members.

1127
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,100
No matter what kind of opponents you face,

1128
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,660
you have to give your all.

1129
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,140
So, at the competition venue

1130
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,810
I will do my best to defeat you guys.

1131
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,970
This is the spirit of gaming.

1132
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,930
You guys are my best bros.

1133
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,330
At the competition,

1134
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,600
you are also my most respected opponent.

1135
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,430
All of you be more energetic.

1136
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,430
Let's meet at the Spring competition.

1137
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,950
Kong ge.

1138
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,830
See you at the Spring competition.
