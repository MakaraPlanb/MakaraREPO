[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,280
Why haven't you said anything
all this time?

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,930
Because

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,430
I'm your brother.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,440
You should've at least
not made me hate you.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,330
You should've at least
been someone I could lean on.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,750
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,660
The only way to protect you from him

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,990
was to live the life that he wanted.

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,570
It’s why I didn’t have the time
to check in on you

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,380
or to acknowledge your hardship.

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,830
Why did you live that way?

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,900
What was it all for?

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,880
We're all given a role in life.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
I devoted myself

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,810
to the life I chose,
and will keep doing so.

17
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,110
This is my calling

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,230
which has nothing to do with you.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,430
You go ahead and live yourself.

20
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,020
Freely.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,940
It's a freedom
that's the fruit of your sacrifice.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm fine with it.

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,180
Let me take you home.

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,250
Let's go.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,460
Thank you...

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,910
for finally telling me the truth.

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,620
[Youth Villa]

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,710
[Father]

[Youth Villa]

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,260
[Good night.]

31
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,740
[Again, I'm filled with hope.]

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,570
[It might lead to another heartache,]

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,180
[but it's what I can only do.]

34
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,710
Professor,

35
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,060
why do we fall in love?

36
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,730
I'd rather spare myself from the pain.

37
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,710
Exhausting your emotions on love?

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
You're going to say it's useless, right?

39
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,450
No.

40
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,190
It's better to do so at your age.

41
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,140
Even at this age, heartaches burn.

42
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,250
I know it does.

43
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,200
But when you're older?

44
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,260
It's just worse.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,480
You can't unconditionally
follow your heart

46
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,280
and there's a lot to consider.

47
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,390
That includes other people, so it's worse.

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,110
There's no age limit to dating.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,959
Even my grandma has a boyfriend.

50
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,330
She's one admirable woman.

51
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,640
I hope Jun's not in any kind of trouble.

52
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,630
I'm sure he'll be fine.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,980
So Professor.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,140
Go ahead, Soo-hyun.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,400
The gukbap that day was delicious.

56
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,120
I appreciate your advice too.

57
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,200
It's been a huge help.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,800
Are things better for you now?

59
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,900
I wanted to ask,
but I didn't want to pressure you.

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,690
I received help

61
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,490
from a friend.

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,790
Good job.

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,730
So, where's Jun?

64
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,640
Something urgent came up, so he left.

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,780
He left?

66
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,600
But I was thinking about
inviting Professor Yeo.

67
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,930
Professor Yeo Jun-wan?

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,350
It'll be nice to get to know each other.

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,030
I figured he'd come
if his brother was here.

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,950
Why are you back?

71
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,120
I should sleep at home, right?

72
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,320
Did everyone make it back too?

73
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes.

74
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,680
I guess I ruined it for everyone.

75
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,190
We had enough fun anyway.

76
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,860
That only makes me feel worse.

77
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,100
Did the talk go well?

78
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,750
Are you actually asking me first?

79
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,730
I'm touched.

80
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,230
Over there.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,740
I'd like to check it out.

82
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,480
Sure, let's do that.

83
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,780
As a boy,
I told everyone I was an only child.

84
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,460
Why?

85
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,409
Because I hated my brother.

86
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,740
It was of no use though.

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,140
Despite the big age gap,

88
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,370
people still knew me
as Yeo Jun-wan's little brother.

89
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,060
I was always compared
to the model student.

90
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,730
I saw a brother that other people saw,

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,210
but that wasn't the real him.

92
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,790
Then one day, he said this.

93
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,220
That I didn't have a family.

94
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,330
No brother and no parents.

95
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,800
I don't know why he said that

96
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,760
or what went through his mind

97
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,020
as he lived on.

98
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,760
I just don't get it.

99
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,409
At first,

100
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,450
I didn't get you at all either.

101
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,950
Likewise.

102
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,770
Why was spending money so easy for you?

103
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,730
Why were you flashing
fake smiles at people?

104
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,630
And why did you keep bothering me?

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,830
Meanwhile, you were prickly,

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,590
had only complaints about the world,

107
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,990
and were annoyed by me
when others loved me.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,210
I was annoyed by you.

109
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,430
Some things about you
still get on my nerves.

110
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,700
Likewise.

111
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,470
Maybe there will come a day

112
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,580
when you and your brother
will reminisce about your past

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,409
like we're doing right now.

114
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,610
Will that day

115
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,090
easily come?

116
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,660
Yes.

117
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,210
I'm sure it will.

118
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,410
So, what about me annoys you?

119
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,590
Do you have all night?

120
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,710
What are they?

121
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,990
Just name three then.

122
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,600
You annoy me in a lot of ways too,
you know.

123
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,550
[Jun, how did your talk
with your brother go?]

124
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,490
[What's going on?]

125
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,980
Fold a finger if you like
one of the ladies who are here now.

126
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,140
[It's probably Mi-ju.]

127
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,030
[It's probably Young-ran.]

128
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,670
[Youth Villa]

129
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,840
Soo-hyun,

130
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,950
wait for me. Let me come with you.

131
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,890
Give me five minutes though.

132
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,690
Is that really
how you're leaving the house?

133
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,930
Why?

134
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,560
I see you didn't get
much sleep last night.

135
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,540
Actually, I did.

136
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
Come over here.

137
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,730
-But I'm late.
-Come on!

138
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,280
Darn, you're strong.

139
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,400
Follow me in here.

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,990
Frowning like that
will only wrinkle your skin.

141
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,330
-Apply it on yourself.
-I already have.

142
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,870
Trust me, will you?

143
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,720
Should I lend you a hand?

144
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,230
I'll do it.

145
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,960
-How do I use this?
-Under the eyes.

146
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,620
That's it. Above the lips.

147
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,700
And your neck.

148
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,590
- Happy now?
-Finally, you're glowing.

149
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm leaving.

150
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,820
While you stay here, I'll iron out

151
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,820
your frown and personality.

152
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,100
Don't you dare use this
without my permission!

153
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,650
I bet I made you worry.

154
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,240
Hardly.

155
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,270
Didn't you get much sleep?

156
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,440
I slept like a baby.

157
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,400
Why are you being aloof?

158
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,080
You won't even look at me.

159
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,100
You're blinding, that's why.

160
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,960
Jeez, what a line.

161
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,990
Are you all right?

162
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,590
Then we're good.

163
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,930
I suddenly feel like a puppy.

164
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,310
You don't have to say if--

165
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
I asked my brother what I wanted to,

166
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,160
-and he gave me an answer.
-That's great.

167
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,280
The misunderstanding has been cleared too.

168
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,780
That's even better.

169
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,660
Is it though? I'm still not sure.

170
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,380
It is.

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,060
When you mentioned Professor Yeo,

172
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,880
your eyes held a softer gaze.

173
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,710
They were ice-cold before, you see.

174
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,570
I'm sure you're aware
of a leader's role in an organization.

175
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,720
What's the most important quality

176
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,790
one must have to be a good leader though?

177
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
Who'd like to answer?

178
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,180
Guys, where's your grit?

179
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,080
Confidently answering questions like this

180
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,010
will help you do well in job interviews.

181
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,420
Unbelievable.

182
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,920
You, with the red pen.

183
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,660
-Sorry?
-What do you think?

184
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,220
A good leader

185
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,710
understands their teammates and--

186
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,380
That's the most basic quality.

187
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,600
A true leader is someone
who produces good results.

188
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,940
Then what do successful leaders
have in common?

189
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,960
Good self-management.

190
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,010
Those who are successful
invest a lot in themselves.

191
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,650
You with the red pen.

192
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,970
Yes?

193
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,130
What do you do
in the name of self-management?

194
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,590
Self-management?

195
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,100
In my case,

196
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,350
I play basketball with friends at times.

197
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,820
Basketball. So to stay healthy.

198
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,450
-Yes.
-What else?

199
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,360
-Is that all you do?
-Yes.

200
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,150
I wake up at 4 a.m., do Pilates,

201
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,040
read, meditate,

202
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,890
and plan my day out in minutes.

203
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,100
I do so even when I'm a professor,

204
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,470
so I'm sure you're doing
at least that much too.

205
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,990
Guys, this isn't a world you can navigate
by living absentmindedly

206
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,750
without any self-management.

207
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,530
I'm sure this is something you can answer.

208
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,120
Who here has a role model
they can look up to as a leader?

209
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,370
Jun, I didn't know you were in my class.

210
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,310
Well, your reputation speaks for itself,

211
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,470
so I sneaked in today
even though I'm a freshman.

212
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,440
Is that okay?

213
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,640
That's commendable.

214
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,670
So tell me. Who is a role model for you?

215
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,610
In my case,

216
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,130
it's Soo-hyun.

217
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,340
Nam Soo-hyun?

218
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,720
What about him made you think that way?

219
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,870
He doesn't lean on others

220
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,810
nor does he care about being popular.

221
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,930
He couldn't care less about

222
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,530
what others think about him.

223
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,180
How can that alone
make him a good leader though?

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,710
He's the same inside and out,

225
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,620
he tries to keep his words at all times,

226
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,600
and he's responsible.

227
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,990
His qualities make others

228
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,070
want to depend on him.

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
And here I thought
you only got good grades.

230
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,510
Soo-hyun.

231
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,930
I'm seeing you in a new light.

232
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,040
You two. What is it that you want from me?

233
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,060
-I'm just fond of you.
-Me too.

234
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,670
Could you keep the fondness between you
and keep me out of it?

235
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,280
Hey, Mom. You know how I said

236
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,510
that I'd like to transfer schools.

237
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,370
Should I give it a try while I can?

238
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,370
It's something I've been talking about.

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,550
I thought it was too late,

240
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,640
but I figured I should at least try
to leave no regrets.

241
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,870
-Do it.
-No way. I can't!

242
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,280
There's no way I'm doing it.

243
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,930
Jun.

244
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,849
We're good, right?

245
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,670
Oh Chun-guk, this darn jerk!
What is wrong with him?

246
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,690
He has crossed the line big time!

247
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,849
I was against him calling your girlfriend.

248
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,349
Don't think we're just as bad.

249
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,280
Are you cutting ties with him?

250
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,010
-You guys were close.
-Not me.

251
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,400
Besides, we're the ones
who told Young-ran.

252
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,520
-And she--
-She's younger than you, remember?

253
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,740
She treated us to makgeolli, you know.

254
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,300
Besides, one should be rewarded
for notifying authorities.

255
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,060
The drinks must've been good.

256
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,390
We almost got tied with Chun-guk.

257
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,160
-Traitor.
-And you're not?

258
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,630
Aren't we being too obvious?

259
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,100
That's exactly how I want to be.

260
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,300
So that everyone knows we're a couple.

261
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,570
All right. Before we begin today's class,

262
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,170
I'd like to ask you all a question.

263
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,080
What assignments
do you find it hardest to do?

264
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm thinking about

265
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,860
considering your answers
for next semester's assignments.

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,100
-Team projects!
-Team projects!

267
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,100
Why do you hate team projects?

268
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,230
Isn't it better to work in a group?

269
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,510
I hate it.

270
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,910
After team projects,
I found myself hating people more.

271
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,240
And now I believe that we were born evil.

272
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,540
Right. That's too bad then.

273
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,910
In that case, let me give you
another simple assignment.

274
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,660
Write about how you felt
after the recent team project.

275
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,660
Fill an entire A4 page in font size ten.

276
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,280
You can't live this world on your own.

277
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,460
I'm sure you've learned something
by working in a team

278
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,580
and cooperating.

279
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,830
Let's begin today's class then.

280
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,960
Mi-ju?

281
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,810
Soo-hyun,

282
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
can you spare me some time?

283
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,520
Well...

284
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,200
Sure.

285
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,590
-So...
-Yes?

286
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,700
Is Young-ran the one you like?

287
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,770
Then I'll give up on you.

288
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,280
I guess that's funny to say

289
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,140
since I was already rejected by you,

290
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,010
but I thought you'd be more at ease

291
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,080
if I made myself clear.

292
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,490
-Right.
-By the way,

293
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,930
aren't you curious
as to why I was attracted

294
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
to you?

295
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,990
I am.

296
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,080
I couldn't ask because I had no right to.

297
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,010
I first saw you at the convenience store

298
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,780
[on a particularly]

299
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,100
bad day for me.

300
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,380
[I dropped the beer can and it busted.]

301
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,420
[I had to pick it back up,]

302
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,840
clean up, and pay for it,

303
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,150
but I was in such a daze
that I got locked in place

304
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,040
like a fool.

305
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,200
But then you came up to me
and started cleaning up

306
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,940
as if it was just another day.

307
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,750
Are you going to drink that?

308
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,710
[At any given time,
if I had someone like you by my side,]

309
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,490
I knew I'd be able

310
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,410
to get past anything.

311
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,030
Nonchalantly but with affection.
You seemed like a solid tree

312
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,580
who'd take my hand and guide me the way.

313
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,420
You're also a handsome tree.

314
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,570
I don't regret it though.

315
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,050
For the first time in my life,
I tried my best.

316
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,420
Even if I travel back in time,

317
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,120
I'd have fallen for you,

318
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,290
developed a crush on you,

319
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,890
and told you how I felt.

320
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,510
I'm sorry...

321
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,200
for not being able

322
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,510
to give you anything.

323
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
Please accept this.

324
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,280
I can't keep it nor throw it away.

325
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,590
It's my drawing of you.
Didn't I do a good job?

326
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,930
Thank you for appearing in my life

327
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,150
so that I got the chance

328
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,150
to have a crush on you.

329
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,590
I said I'd walk you home.

330
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,650
For some reason, I want to be
the one to walk you home today.

331
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,340
I'm fine though.

332
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,000
I have had the wrong idea
about my brother for a long time.

333
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,290
I thought that he beat me.

334
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,750
That he hated me.

335
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,700
I've always craved love, you see.

336
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,100
From my parents and my brother.

337
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,020
I told myself to give up.

338
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,050
To suffer the pain and move on.

339
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,740
But hope washed over me.

340
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
So what's why.

341
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,160
What do you mean?

342
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,180
What you said before

343
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,350
about me and Chan-ki.

344
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,970
I figured you had a crush on someone too.

345
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,710
I guess there was no alternative.

346
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,620
Because we can’t easily find someone

347
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,390
that will fish us out from this fiery pit

348
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,790
where we find ourselves craving for love.

349
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,310
It is unrequited love.

350
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,050
You must've felt pity toward me

351
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,850
since our situations were similar.

352
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,620
That too,

353
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,280
but I mostly didn't like
you being hurt by him.

354
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,570
I wonder why
when I was only your senior back then.

355
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,310
Beats me. Why did I hate it so much

356
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,550
when we weren't even friends?

357
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,390
Gosh, for how long
have you had feelings for me?

358
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,400
Just a second.

359
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,680
Who's she?

360
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,820
-What brings you by?
-Am I not allowed here?

361
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,710
Follow me.

362
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,650
I need to head inside.

363

00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,810
I think

545
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,710
my mom called me.

546
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,030
Really?

547
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,760
Are you sure it's her number?

548
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,080
Yes.

549
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,180
I thought I forgot about her already.

550
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,350
You tried to forget her,
but your brain remembers.

551
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,600
Just like how I can't forget you.

552
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,620
What?

553
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,710
Nothing. Why didn't you answer her call?

554
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,690
Why should I?

555
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,410
She's the one who never
picked up my calls.

556
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,650
So why do I have to?

557
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,030
You're upset, right?

558
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,200
If you're upset, that means
you still care about her.

559
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,040
And he seems a bit upset.

560
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,760
I'll get going.

561
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,950
I'm also upset.

562
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,490
I said I wanted to get to know you,

563
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,790
but I never got to tell you about me.

564
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,120
When I was eight,

565
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,890
my parents got a divorce,

566
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,010
and my mom left.

567
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,780
I see...

568
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,760
I got a call today.

569
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,600
I recognized her number

570
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,640
right away.

571
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,290
I'm sure she had her reasons.

572
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,710
But I don't want to talk to her.

573
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,030
I guess I want her to hurt
as much as I did.

574
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,830
I'm awful, right?

575
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,690
I would've been worse.

576
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,710
Even when I'm happy,

577
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,420
I told myself that it will never last.

578
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,190
A part of my heart will never be filled.

579
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,140
Even though I accepted it,

580
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,620
sometimes I was sad.

581
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,970
We can neither forgive

582
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,440
nor understand our parents.

583
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,910
Let's just forget about them and be happy.

584
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,990
As I'm happy now that I have you,

585
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,720
it made me look at my mom differently.

586
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,350
How so?

587
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,890
I felt bad for her.

588
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,450
I have you,

589
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,800
but my mom doesn't have anyone.

590
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,360
She'll be sad and lonely.

591
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,490
I wanted to show her

592
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,110
that I was living this perfect life
without her.

593
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,510
But,

594
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,410
I was always missing something.

595
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,600
You're stupid.

596
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,230
-Stupid?
-You're already perfect.

597
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,660
You're the only one who doesn't know that.

Why are you so surprised?

601
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,700
I'm not surprised at all!

602
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,240
I'll buy you meat.

603
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,730
I'm supposed to be careful of
someone who buys me meat.

604
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,040
Are you going to buy me beef?

605
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,110
Yes.

606
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,920
Beef is a bit dangerous.

607
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,390
I thought you said it's dangerous.

608
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,380

Just wait a moment.

613

Yes.

How much was it?

It's okay.
He said he bought it a while ago.

a few days ago.

Don't worry.

625
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,500
This only cost half of the truffle.

626
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,390
Half of the truffle? Then it's...

627
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,210
So it was 150,000 won?

to my office?

or something?

No, not at all.

the best advice for you young people?

you'll stop contacting me.

That's not true, So-bin.

There was nothing I could do for you,

You don't seem to be doing
that much better. Why did you call me?

I missed you. That's why.

I know you didn't abandon me.

00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,670
I know you had no choice but to leave.

I was really happy to see her.

I get more things done in five minutes

725
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,310
than lazy people get done in five days.

726
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,500
Do you realize that?

727
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,830
I'm sorry, Professor.

728
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,320
Goodness.

729
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,910
You're "sorry"?

730
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,020
Why would you do something
you must apologize for?

731
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,130
Find it now.

732
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:25,890
Okay.

733
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,470
She needed someone to take it out on.

734
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,460
Take it out on me all you want.

735
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,640
I won't be around for long.

736
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,680
-Your father sent me.
-My dad?

737
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,860
There's no way you searched
the entire campus to find me.

738
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,390
Have you been tailing me?

739
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,530
-Let's go.
-I still have a class left.

740
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,240
Let's go.

741
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,110
Are you here to catch
a rich runaway heir or something?

742
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,470
He's asking for you.

743
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,850
You know how he is.

744
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,150
I have no choice.

745
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,110
I have to go home.

746
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,020
Did something happen?

747
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,270
No, I suppose my dad misses me.

748
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,380
Okay, go.

749
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,990
I shouldn't be worried, right?

750
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,540
Professor, do you have some exciting plans
for the day?

751
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,350
I'm just meeting someone. That's all.

752
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,820
I'm curious who it is.

753
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,370
Why isn't he picking up?

754
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,850
-By any chance...
-Yes, Professor.

755
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,650
Can you reach Jun?

756
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,440
I guess you're meeting Jun today.

757
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,530
Yes, he used to ignore my calls,

758
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,080
but I don't know
why he's not picking up now.

759
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,810
-Jun went home.
-"Home"?

760
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,750
It was unexpected, so he probably
didn't have a chance to call you.

761
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,020
We were supposed to meet by the gate
after class.

762
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,280
It looked like he was going home
to see his father.

763
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,600
Did Jun say he was going home
to see his father?

764
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,930
No, it's not that...

765
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,230
Did someone take him?

766
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,330
Yes. He said Jun's father sent him.

767
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,240
-Mother, where are you?
[-Hi, Jun-wan.]

768
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,020
-Are you home now?
[-Why didn't you answer my call?]

769
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,650
Did Dad call Jun home?

770
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:48,950
[-Jun?]
-You didn't know?

771
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,650
[I know nothing about it.
I stepped out to take care of something.]

772
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,510
Head home immediately. I'm on my way too.

773
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,150
[Okay, Jun-wan.]

774
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,420
Hurry.

775
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,760
Listen carefully.

776
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,150
If you hurt Jun again,

777
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,790
I will kill you all.

778
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,930
Jun-wan.

779
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,390
What are you talking about?

780
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,590
You know I can do anything
I set my mind to.

781
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,370
I'll do everything you say,
so just don't make Jun

782
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,240
go through what you did to me.

783
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,470
Everything you did is recorded here.

784
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,140
-How could you...
-As of this moment,

785
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,620
I'm your only son,
and it'll be this way until you die.

786
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,230
Jun...

787
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,010
As of today, he has no family.

788
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,130
What have you been up to?

789
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,670
Dad, what is this about?

790
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,600
I told you to stay away from trouble.

791
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,950
Did I cause trouble?

792
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,070
Your brother teaches at your school,

793
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
so I told you to be careful.

794
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:26,650
I'd never do anything to embarrass him.
I don't even say hi to him.

795
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,390
It's my fault for believing you.

796
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,070
Hey.

797
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,910
Are you trying to embarrass me now,
on top of Jun-wan?

798
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,060
Jun-wan turned down the offer
from the top university

799
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,590
and chose your school because of you.

800
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,620
You shouldn't have been born.

801
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,400
You're so inept, full of flaws...

802
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,150
-Dad.
-I don't want to hear it.

803
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,080
Move back home.

804
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,330
I don't want to.

805
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,850
You don't want to?

806
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,490
No, I don't want to.

807
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,950
I don't want to move back here.

808
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,900
I see that you've learned
to talk back to your father.

809
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,780
What? You don't want to move back here?

810
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,600
Say that again.

811
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,430
You don't want to do it?

812
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:27,560
Why are you just standing there? Come in.

813
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,560
Come on.

814
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,190
[At a Distance, Spring is Green]

815
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,040
Whose money is this?

816
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,850
Do you earn money
so you can have a reason to beat us?

817
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,830
[I thought everything would be okay]

818
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,380
[if I kept you away from the family
and handled Dad on my own.]

819
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,160
[I'm sorry.
It only ended up hurting you more.]

820
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,880
[Every now and again, I realize]

821
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,950
that clinging to you
was the best thing I've done.

822
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,460
There's something I need to say
in front of everyone.

823
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,400
[So we'll be each other's stand-in?]

824
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,990
[-You should go on a date.
-How do I do that?]

825
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,420
[Mind your own business.
I wish you and So-bin all the best.]

826
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,540
Why aren't you asking me how Jun is doing?

827
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,090
[I'll miss him more
if I start talking about him.]
