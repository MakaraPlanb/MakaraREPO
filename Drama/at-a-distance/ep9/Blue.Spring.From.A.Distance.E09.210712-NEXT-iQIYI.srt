Not really.
I would've told him sooner or later.

To So-bin?

537
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,345

She did?

539
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,135

I'm sorry I stood you up and that
I didn't even give you an explanation.

I couldn't sleep all night.

- Nightmare?
- It was so agonizing

555
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,695
and I didn't want you to see me like that.

That's crazy. Oh, sorry.

565
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,889
Why would you even talk about youth
with those youngsters?

566
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,179
Did you want to talk about 12th graders
when you were one?

567
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,779
Did you want to talk about the unemployed
when you were one?

568
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,429
They're youths. Why would they want
to talk about youth with their professor?

569

Well, I just thought it'd be helpful.

570

00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:11,385
There was something I believed to be true
for a long time.

699

I used to think that my ex-girlfriend
dumped me because I was poor.

throughout my youth.

I was very insecure.

702
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,125
Whenever anyone glanced at me,

703
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,675
I thought it was because I looked poor.

704
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,315
It took me years to learn the truth.

705
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,395
She was very ill at the time.

706
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,445
I had no idea,

707
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:43,325
so I cursed her for dumping me
and called her materialistic.

708
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,379
Don't let your memories or thoughts
trap you

709

could reveal itself.
