Whose notes will you take?

Are you feeling better now?

205
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,785
I returned home that day after
everything was sorted with my father,

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,715
She might report you for stalking.

361
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,965
It's dangerous.

362
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,615
I want us to be each other's.

363
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,349
Then it wouldn't show
since we're always affectionate.

364
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,995
- I'm affectionate?
- No, I am.

365
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,235
Let's discuss it right away.

366
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,665
Where should we go? Someplace fancy...

367
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,665
- I don't have my credit card.
- The school cafeteria will do.

368
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,815
I'd like to buy everyone a drink.

369
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,265
What?

370
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,649
A sudden change in a person
indicates imminent death.

371
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,975
Take it easy, will you?

372
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,209
Then you can sit this one out.

373
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,065
It'll save me half the money.

374
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,349
Of course, I'll come!

375
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,545
Hold on a second.

376
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,275
Guys, wait.

377
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,765
Well,

378
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,865
I'd like to buy drinks
as a means to apologize.

379
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,025
That's new.

380
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,465
Jun, So-bin, I bet you don't want to.

381
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,909
Right?

382
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,995
As if kneeling is enough
to make her forgive you.

383
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,085
- Maybe some other time--
- Let's go.

384
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,805
What?

385
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,135
Don't go if you don't want to.

386
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,659
Well, I'm not a part of this,
so I'm just going to go.

387
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,165
I'll go

388
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,665
if everyone else goes.

389
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,895
We'll decide on the Secret Santa
when we get there.

390
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,985
Let's go.

What's wrong? Is it me?

393
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,845
Could be.

394
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,355
Next.

395
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,995
What are you doing? Did you pick me?

396
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,035
Of course not.

397
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,325
You already got caught, Soo-hyun.

398
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,455
Did you get me too?

399
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,045
Why is everyone frowning?

400
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,679
Come on everyone. Eat up and stop pouting.

401
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,025
Don't order too many snacks.

402
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,209
We need to leave some room for drinking.

403
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,155
It's not because snacks are expensive.

404
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,929
Excuse me. Can we get a spicy
stir-fried chicken and fish cake stew?

405
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,655
I thought you weren't feeling well.

406
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,824
Hye-ji, you like
spicy stir-fried chicken, right?

407
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,054
How did you know that?

408
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,309
I didn't follow your channel on YouTube.

409
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,675
I just read the comments.

410
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:33,009
Why would you say something like that?
You're making her feel uncomfortable.

411
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,784
Don't worry about him, Hye-ji.

412
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,804
You're the one
making me feel uncomfortable.

413
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,449
So what does a Secret Santa have to do?

414
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,949
Whatever works.

415
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,748
Why? What are you going to do for me?

416
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,945
What?

417
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:48,025
I'm not your Secret Santa.
Don't get the wrong idea.

418
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,594
I don't think we need to order anymore.
Everyone seems full.

419
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,235
No, go ahead.

420
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,435
You can order whatever you want.

421
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,129
And there's no need for
you to pay, Yeo Jun.

422
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,215
I'm not the ATM anymore.
I don't have a gold card.

423
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,225
Congratulations on becoming a human.

424
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,785
You've changed, Soo-hyun.

425
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,465
Since we're done with Secret Santa,
let's talk about group project.

426
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,815
You really haven't changed.

427
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,449
Come on, guys. Let's drink.

428
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,339
Come on. Cheers.

429
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,699
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

430
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,069
You have to do it too, Soo-hyun.

431
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,325
- Cheers Soo-hyun!
- Cheers.

432
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,115
Bottoms up!

433
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,405
My smile is not fake anymore.

434
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,815
What took my mask away?

435
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,755
Bottoms up!

00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,385

439
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,095
Yeo jun!

440
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,519
Get up. You're going to be late for class.

441
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,339
Okay. Five more minutes.

442
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,105
I can't let this slide for your sake.

443
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,005
Wake up!

444
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,365
Please! Stop being my Secret Santa.

445
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,135
Wake up. You're going to be
late for class.

446
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,735
Let me sleep just a little more.

447
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,329
You're going to be late! Get up!

448
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,935
Please just leave me alone!

449
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,215
Thanks to me, you're not going to be late.

450
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,245
Thanks a lot.

451
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,975
Who is my Secret Santa?

452
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,625
He's not doing anything for me.

453
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,805
Maybe your Secret Santa is just that good.
You don't even know what he did for you.

454
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,955
Yes, I have no idea.

455
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,335
He really is good.

456
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,795
How's your script going?

457
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,085
Don't get me started.

458
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,425
I'm not getting enough sleep
because of my creativity

459
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,225
and my Secret Santa wakes me up
every day early in the morning.

460
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,685
Soo-hyun does that?

461
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,255
Why do you seem so worried?

462
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,685
If I want my boyfriend's work
to stand out,

463
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,375
I have to cast good actors.

464
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,265
I don't know who to cast.

465
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,065
I have no connections.

466
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,015
So what? Just cast anyone.

467
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,965
I'm sure they'll get hooked by
how attractive you are.

468
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,239
I want you to be the hero.
Myungil University hottest guy, Yeo Jun.

469
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,265
I'll pull some strings
and cast my own boyfriend.

470
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,155
My pay is pretty high.

471
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,535
Talk to my manager.

472
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,605
- Manager?
- Yes.

473
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,065
BA major, Kim So-bin. She's my manager.

474
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,385
Well, let's go to your
next schedule, Mr. Hotshot.

475
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,025
I don't want to go to work.
I want to meet my girlfriend.

476
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,005
I miss her so much.

477
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,695
Well, you'll have to endure it
if you want to succeed.

478
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,779
I don't want to work.

479
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,499
No, you have to work.

480
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,079
- I do?
- Yes.

481
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,505
- You're doing what?
- I'm going on a blind date.

482
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,975
You do that?

483
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,925
My friend wanted me to go in her stead.

484
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,855
In her stead?

485
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,725
Then does that mean you'll date
and get married in her stead too?

486
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,945
Wait, are you jealous?

487
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,885
You shouldn't just meet anyone.

488
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,049
He's not just anyone.
He works at the school library

489
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,505
and he's a junior majoring in law.

490
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,285
I checked him out in secret.

491
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,305
The library?

492
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,365
He looks good when he wears glasses
and he seems smart.

493
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,035
He's totally my style.

494
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,045
I am a little creeped out since
I've never been on a blind date before.

495
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,245
Should I not go?

496
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,045
I won't go if you don't want me to.

497
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,855
Go ahead.

498
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,365
What?

499
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,709
You want to go.
I mean, you already checked him out.

500
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,755
I only saw him because
I had to go to the library.

501
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,079
I know you don't go to the library.

502
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,039
What are you talking about? I go to
the library for the vitamin drinks!

503
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,075
The vending machine there
sells really good ones.

504
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,595
I'm going to the library
to buy vitamin drinks.

505
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,135
Young-ran.

506
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,245
Were you the one who left
the vitamin drink when I was sleeping?

507
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,725
I don't know!

508
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,845
[ I won't go if you don't want me to. ]

509
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,045
[ Go ahead. ]

510
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,125
He told me to go.

511
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,255
- Hey, Wanted Criminal.
- Hi, Girl With a Story.

512
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,019
I have an upset stomach.
Let's go get some ice cream.

513
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,389
When you have an upset stomach...

514
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,749
Go day drinking?

515
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,645
No, you need a nice cup of
rich chocolate milk.

516
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,735
Oh, this is so sweet. Why drink this
when you have an upset stomach?

517
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,465
You have to coat your stomach
with something sweet.

518
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,089
I'm not feeling well either.

519
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,369
I heard you got dumped
after telling a girl how you feel.

520
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,565
Is there something else?

521
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,945
Of course, there is.
I still have feelings for her.

522
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,565
Feelings are so stubborn.
They don't know when to give up.

523
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,865
How did you go through this
for seven years?

524
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,785
Well... Seven years just passed by.

525
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,305
No one intends to have
a crush on someone for seven years.

526
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,755
Things happened
and your crush just continues.

527
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,055
Will it last seven years for me too?

528
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,675
I told Soo-hyun
I was going on a blind date.

529
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,769
What did he say?

530
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,585
He didn't tell you to go
right away, did he?

531
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,815
He did.

532
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,155
I got dumped
