2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,395
Excuse me.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,755
Are you Kim Hye-yoon
in Journalism and Communication?

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,985
I'm Yeo Jun,
a freshman in business administration.

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,375
Yeo Jun? Yes, I've heard of you.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,665
There's something we'd like to ask.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,955
So could you spare us some time?

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,019
Sure. Let's hear it.

[ Why Kim Hye-yoon though? ]

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,249
She reminds me of you when we first met.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,235
- What?
- Is she a psycho too?

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,455
I mean, is she a unique soul as well?

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,655
Did she agree to it?

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,109
She's like to know the concept first.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,749
The concept will be a bright

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,289
and vibrant youth.

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,359
Would displaying a fantasy work?

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,719
It'll only seem unrealistic.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,415
I also agree that
it should be more realistic.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,399
So you want to go for hyperrealism?

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,949
This is a PR video, not a documentary.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,995
Tough reality isn't what
we wish to see in ad campaigns.

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,815
That could be true for a commercial ad.

24
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,845
We'd be right to only highlight
the joy of youth.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,259
But this is a school assignment.

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,419
Must it be dark and heavy though?

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,539
Let's be mindful
of Professor Park's lessons.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,095
Would highlighting
the positive side of youth

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,629
speak out to him?

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,539
It only has to be fun
and exude positive energy.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,999
There's no need to consider
the professor's preference.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,895
But our grades are on the line.

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,749
Although as a freshman,
you probably wouldn't care.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,695
What does being a freshman
have to do with this?

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,365
Team leader is right, you know.

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,235
As you all know,
I tanked my last group assignment.

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,195
I need a good score to make up for it.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,345
Me too.

39
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,859
Still. What's fun to do

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,195
leads to a good outcome.

41
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,275
I see we can't get on the same page.

42
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,035
Well, I have a class to get to.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,009
I'll be home late after my shift.

44
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,555
I won't be home anyway.

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,155
Is something up between you and Soo-hyun?

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,245
No, we're as good as ever.

47
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,195
Jun, you should reconsider
Soo-hyun's opinion.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,685
Wait. Didn't you take my side earlier?

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,985
Of course, I'm on your side.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,925
But...

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,265
I also think it's better

52
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,275
to have it reflect our reality
and not just the positive sides.

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,935
Even in my case,
I'm only happy when I'm with you.

54
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,095
My life's dark too. Actually,

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,855
that's how it used to be.

56
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,165
But wouldn't we want
to only remember happy memories

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,685
when we look back on this time?

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,665
But the one in pain is still you as well.

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,705
I'd rather discard him somewhere.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,715
I'll then pick him up
and carry him around in my pocket.

61
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,295
Won't it be uncomfortable at home
with Soo-hyun?

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,905
You know I don't let things get to me.

63
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,615
Besides, Soo-hyun may be prickly,
but he's not one to stay angry.

64
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,065
You should go first.

65
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,379
No, you go ahead.

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,965
I'm not that desperate, you know.

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,345
- Me neither.
- Elders first.

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,285
It doesn't extend to peeing.

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,939
Right. Since I'm younger,
I'll go first then.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,085
No.

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,985

Just so you know, I really need to go.

74
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,115
I'm craving a late-night snack.

75
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,955
Maybe pizza? Or fried chicken?

76
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,505
Tteokbokki?

77
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,679
Gosh, this looks good.

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,065
I wonder how far the smell will travel.

79
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,605
It's too much for just one person.

80
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,425
I guess I have no choice.
I'll throw it away.

81
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,285
What? This is just for me.

82
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,079
It's only one portion.

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,995
One portion?
People just love to waste food.

84
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,275
Have some.

85
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,265
If there weren't any food,
you'd pretend to be asleep.

86
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,299
Why are you worked up over the assignment?

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,359
I'm not.

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,535
Is it the assignment
or are there hard feelings toward me?

89
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,615
I'm against
that dark concept you suggested.

90
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,109
It's weird that you're
this invested in it.

91

I guess that's true.

But aren't you sick of it?

93

It's been hard enough for us.

94
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,019
Why must the assignment--

95
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,739
We should view reality as it is.

96
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,499
Can't we escape it though?

97
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,819
Once we run away from it,

98
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,149
we'll one day see that we escaped it.

99
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,999
One should try to overcome hardships.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,629
I don't want to do it right now though.

101
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,339
Will putting it off make it any better?

102
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,489
It could.

even if they want to.

We're already on an edge of a cliff.

109

Are you challenging me
to see who has it worse?

110

- Bring it on!

More you than me though.

Don't tell me you argued all night.

118

Why is my ear so itchy?

131

you can fund whatever dream I have.

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,609
Anyway, I hope you show me a favor.

181
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,799
With what?

182
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,785
Once she leaves, I thought...

183
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,559
You think you'll take her place?

184
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,465
Of course.
Who else could possibly assist you?

185
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,589
- Not you.
- Sorry?

186
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,919
I don't know what you'd lie about next.

187
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,155
What do you mean?

188
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,105
You know exactly what I mean.

189
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,545
What's this? I don't see a name.

190
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,705
Oh, it's mine.

191
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,575
Please utilize it however you want.

192
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,949
But that--

193
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,725
Lies only lead to more lies.

194
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,889
If that's how you get by in life,
it'll stick with you.

195
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,095
Change your ways before it's too late.

[ Father ]

197
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,625
You should head in.
I'll need to take this call first.

198
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,895
There's nothing going on, right?

199
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,755
No, so don't worry.

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,235
Right.

201
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,065
Yes, Father.

[ 2021 Myungil University Student Body ]

203
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,285
Soo-hyun, can we talk?

204
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,089
We're late for our team gathering.

205
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,585
It won't matter if we're late.

206
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,659
We made a promise with our teammates,

207
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,205
so of course, it matters.

208
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,965
- You want to blend both concepts?
- Yes.

209
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,429
Darkness will be a character
representing the dark sides of youth

210
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,509
while Light will represent its beauty.

211
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,749
We’ll have Darkness

212
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,485
realizing the light within it
after meeting Light

213
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,865
who lives in a completely different world.

214
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,285
What do you say?

215
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,089
We're out of time, so let's do that--

216
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,979
Then we should all tell our stories.

217
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,795
Regarding the light and shadow of youth.

218
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,265
It's our team project,
so it should be about us.

219
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,525
- While sober?
- My life only knows darkness.

220
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,595
I have nothing to add.

221
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,575
We'll start with the team leader then.

222
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,645
Tell us about your shadows.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,195
Well...

224
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,945
Not being financially stable
took a toll on my life.

225
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,585
And it still does.

226
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,035
I was most depressed
before serving in the military.

227
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,045
Whenever my future seemed uncertain,

228
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,645
I escape reality through video games.

229
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,515
I had too many thoughts and worries
which led me

230
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,625
to lack confidence.

231
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,075
It’s why I gave up things without trying.

232
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,275
Hye-ji, what about you?

233
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,985
Life hasn't been hard for me,
but I've been stuck recently.

234
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,735
It's not completely dark though.

235
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,085
- I--
- Don't force a sob story.

236
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,285
As if you would've had it hard.

237
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,485
- We all spoke, so--
- I haven't yet.

238
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,065
You don't have to since you're
highly against the shadows of our youth.

239
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,519
- I respect everyone's opinion.
- Now you do?

240
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,935
I agree.

241
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,485
I see you haven't read
the article on my father.

242
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,095
Was an article published?
Regarding his wealth and fame?

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,089
I lived many years in darkness

244
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,345
due to my father's physical abuse.

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,285
Jun...

246
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,885
Don't you worry though
for I'm all better now. I'm in the light.

247
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,355
See? I said we should stick to
the brighter side of youth.

248
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,735
Hey, you didn't have to openly mention it.

249
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,455
Why not?

250
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,395
- It doesn't faze me anymore.
- Take it easy.

251
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,745
Scars don't heal instantaneously.

252
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,314
All I can come up with
are the dark sides of youth.

253
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,425
We'll start working on it though.

254
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,285
Let's work on it together!

255
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,155
What? Unbelievable.

256
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,855
Who are you kidding?

257
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,275
Give it back!

258
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,129
Why should I?

259
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,085
- Hand it over.
- No.

260
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,375
Must Darkness be this mean?

261
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,005
What do you mean?

262
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,265
"Get lost" is a bit harsh,
don't you think?

263
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,155
It hurts to hear that.

264
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,365
Then I chose the right words.
They stirred up emotion.

265
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,315
Then Light should cry upon hearing them.

266
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,199
Why would Light cry?

267
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,049
Who wouldn't?

268
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,629
Did you cry when I said it to you?

269
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,665
Of course not. I'm not Light, am I?

270
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,955
You're the one just like your character.

271
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,579
I'm not as mean as Darkness.

272
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,935
As if. You're Darkness in the flesh.

273
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,755
Why don't we change its name to yours?

274
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,645
You think I'm Darkness?

275
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,665
But this was creative writing.

276
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,339
Check out these lines.

277
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,905
They're what you said to me.

278
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,705
Unbelievable.

279
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,469
My poor old self.

280
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,035
What did I even like about you?

281
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,755
I'm ticked off just by looking at you.

282
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,419
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Put what to a vote?

283
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,445
What do you think?
Of course, it's about Darkness.

284
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,679
You act exactly like Darkness would.

285
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,579
I'm nothing like Darkness.

286
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,899
You so are.

287
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,365
You're not Light or Darkness.
You're Mr. Ambiguous.

288
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,075
Who do you think Darkness is like?

289
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,675
Me?

290
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,069
Shouldn't you play this role?

291
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,225
You'd be a killer in it
since it's just like you.

292
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,709
Aren't Light's lines better?

293
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,095
I'm loving the banter between
Darkness and Light.

294
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,335
Maybe it's because
you bicker all the time.

295
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,315
I just did a good job on the script.

296
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,549
Maybe I should be a novelist.

297
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,585
I didn't know I had this talent.

298
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,895
Don't waste your time
and dream of doing something else.

299
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,779
I only say this for your sake.

300
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,685
No way. I'll be a grand novelist.

301
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,135
Why you...

302
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,485
I'll publish the best novel ever.

303
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,325
- Sorry. I'm late, aren't I?
- What took you so long?

304
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,455
- Nice.
- Soo-hyun!

305
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,405
- This is great.
- Right?

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,989
- Jung-ho, here you go.
- No, take one first.

307
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,935
- I'm good.
- I'm good too.

308
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,049
- I'm good.
- You should drink one.

309
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,435
- Go ahead.
- I already have one.

310
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,579
So-bin, Kim Hye-yoon's asking for you.

311
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,215
Okay, I'll be right over.

312
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,009
Finish your meal first.

313
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,825
You aren't at her beck and call.

314
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,849
She's taking time out of her schedule
to be in our video for free.

315
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,885
We should tend to her. See you.

316
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,475
Always the Ms. Goody Two Shoes.

317
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,785
Hey, Ki-sun.

318
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,355
- Would you like some gimbap?
- But I already ate.

319
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,795
It's just that you like
the ones with fermented kimchi and tuna.

320
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,045
All right, fine.

321
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,089
It's a gift.

322
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,409
- A gift?
- Yes.

323
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,299
- Healthy fluids?
- Of course.

324
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,969
You should stay hydrated.

325
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,565
This just made my day.

326
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,745
- Sorry about it not being cold.
- It's fine.

327
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,545
Is it?

328
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,745
You have indigestion, don't you?

329
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,895
How did you know?

330
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,219
There's discomfort in my chest.

331
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,125
I know from experience.

332
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,475
Take this.

333
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,189
Where did you get this?

334
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,085
The pharmacy, of course.

335
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,095
Thanks, Hye-ji.

336
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,205
I played my part then.

"The two who represent
the light and darkness of youth"

338
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,415
"are different in every aspect."

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,839
"Their background, preference in food,"

340
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,655
"and everything in general."

00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,909
Must you act like
you've worked on this project alone?

343
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,369
Should I forget my lines
and tank the project?

344
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,135
I bet you've already memorized your lines.

345
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,979
From what I saw at the festival,

346
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,909
you clearly don't have stage fright.

347
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,385
I was born to take center stage,

348
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,689
but knowing that our team's fate
is in my hands makes me nervous.

349
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,635
Why is our team's fate in your hands?

350
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,089
How about we discuss

351
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,855
whose hands our team's fate is in tonight?

352
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,479
Go to bed, will you?

353
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,245
Being tired leads to under-performing.

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,465

355

"Whether it’s family or friends,

443
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,805
When we’re older,

444
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,755
we’ll probably say this to others as well.

445
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,645
But even they valued relationships
highly in their youth

446
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,875
which led to sleepless nights
being in love,

447
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,565
then brokenhearted, being in love,

448
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,205
and then brokenhearted again.

449
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,895
So this is how we define youth.
A time in our life

450
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,245
when we are brave enough
to befriend just about anyone.

451
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,145
Even though we’ll regret it someday,

452
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,265
we’ll take center stage in our youth

453
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,705
to love, to be hurt,

454
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,355
and then to love again
with all our hearts.

455
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,985

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,665
I'm not that kid anymore.

531
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,534
I'm still the same kid.

532
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,405
I still have hope for you.

533
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,364
I have hope that my super cool senior

534
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:31,989
will come back.

535
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,129
That's not going to happen.

536
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,435
You're my role model,
so I won't give up without a fight.

537
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,315
I wanted to become like Song Soo-kyung.

538
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,975
Park Si-jae.

539
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,585
What are you doing after class?

540
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,884
- Why do you ask?
- I was just thinking...

541
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,445
Do you want to grab dinner?

542
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,295
I don't know.

543
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,995
I won't ask again.

544
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,255
Park Si-jae, let's have dinner.

545
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,595
I said, let's have dinner.

546
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,499
I guess it's possible
to get the first place.

547
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,349
This is the first time
I came in first place

548
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,425
in group projects since school started.

549
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,335
Oh, who filmed the making?

550
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,945
Hye-yoon.

551
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,795
I sent it to you. Check your phone.

552
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,299
When I worked on projects like these
I always recorded makes as well.

553
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,295
When you look at it later,
it'll be a nice memory for you.

554
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,779
We did really well.

555
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,419
If you do your best while making it,

556
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,529
the result doesn't really matter.

557
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,305
And strangely,
the results are even better.

558
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,235
It was for me.

559
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,175
Thanks.

560
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,055
I always worry too much,
so I really couldn't enjoy anything.

561
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,815
I'm thankful too.

562
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,485
I had fun making this.

563
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,185
I guess you should never
really trust rumors.

564
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,945
The rumors about Hye-yoon

565
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,895
and you weren't true.

566
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,745
So all the rumors were fake?

567
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,035
Some of them were true.

568
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,489
Let's all reveal our Secret Santas.

569
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,735
You go first.

570
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,635
You really don't know?

571
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,739
I've done a lot for you.

572
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,775
What? Really?

573
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,435
Wow, I thought I didn't have
a Secret Santa.

574
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,035
What?

575
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,059
When you had classes in the morning,

576
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,565
I woke you up three times.

577
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,345
- Please!
- You didn't wake up though.

578
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,725
When you left...

579
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,405
Gosh...

580
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,729
I cleaned the bathroom.

581
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,645
It was really hard, but I didn't show it.

582
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,655
And I prayed that you and So-bin
would have a good relationship as couples.

583
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,685
[ Youth Villa ]

584
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,535
[ Youth Villa ]

585
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,419
I told you ways to get good grades,

586
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,865
but you were barely listening.

587
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,849
Jun, if you want good grades,
you need to learn the basics.

588
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,349
Write down everything the professor says.

589
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,329
And go through them when you get home.

590
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,089
Check the important parts

591
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,609
and when you recheck them
before tests, you'll get good grades.

592
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,945
And...

593
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,369
And I saved you a seat
in the lecture room.

594
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,645
You didn't sit there though.

595
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,055
Thanks.

596
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,015
I had no idea you were so talkative.

597
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,095
Soo-hyun, you were really serious about
this whole Secret Santa thing.

598
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,555
Then let's cheers to my Secret Santa,
Soo-hyun's happiness.

599
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,309
Cheers!

600
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,019
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

601
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,715
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

602
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,285
I didn't hate you because I wanted to.

603
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,645
I hated you because I wanted to be loved.

604
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,315
Hye-ji, have some water.

605
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,095
I started my own YouTube channel because
I wanted to become a film producer.

606
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,705
But I don't have any subscribers
and have lots of hate comments.

607
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,135
I don't have the money nor the skill.

608
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,659
I was living a normal life.

609
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,869
But you were living so diligently.

610
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,055
I was annoyed by it,
but I was also envious.

611
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,305
I felt so pathetic.

612
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,685
It was my inferiority complex.

613
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,455
I'm so sorry.

614
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,045
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,155
What?

616
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,525
Okay.

617
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,299
Guys?

618
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,965
Why doesn't anyone talk about
their problems to me?

619
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,579
Jun! I just don't feel like
talking to you.

620
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,249
You're just too well-off.

621
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,675
Jung-ho, you can talk to me.

622
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,355
Soo-hyun can't really
empathize with other people.

623
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,205
No wonder people call him, "UP".

624
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,255
- What?
- What?

625
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,535
Right?

626
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,775
I didn't say anything wrong.

627
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,295
Chan-ki.

628
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,875
What's with that look?

629
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,195
So-bin.

630
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,095
What are you going to say this time?

631
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,515
I'm leaving.

632
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,375
I'm enlisting in the military.

633
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,945
- When do you leave?
- Soon.

634
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,685
This is too sudden.

635
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,795
Are you sad?

636
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,265
We've never been apart.

637
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,275
Right.

638
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,525
Thanks, So-bin.

639
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,875
I realized I had never thanked you once.

640
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,315
Thank you, So-bin.

641
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,685
Why are you talking as if
you're leaving for good?

642
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,965
I'm such a loser, but you always
listened to me and comforted me.

643
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,715
Thanks to you, I always felt cared for
and never felt lonely.

644
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,735
I only realized it
after you became distant.

645
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,465
Why did I think

646
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,975
I could take you for granted?

647
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,825
I was like an immature kid playing
on the lawn you had laid down for me.

648
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,595
Now that I'm standing alone
in a barren field...

649
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,475
To be honest,
I still haven't figured out what to do,

650
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,765
but I'll figure out
how to be myself without you.

651
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,625
I'll find

652
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,705
my true self.

653
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,435
You can do it.

654
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,139
You can do anything you set your mind to.

655
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,505
That's right.

656
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,325
You know me better than I do.

657
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,969
Don't just pack up and leave.
You have to tell me when you're leaving.

658
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,425
Will you throw a going-away party?

659
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,725
I'll take you out for some pork belly,
your favorite.

660
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,625
Just once...

661
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,195
Can I get just one hug
from my friend, Kim So-bin?

662
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,579
- So-bin, close your eyes.
- What?

663
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,985
I'll turn around and run
on the count of three,

664
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,255
so don't look at my face no matter what.

665
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,595
- Why not?
- Just promise me you won't look.

666
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,235
One, two...

667
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,735
Three.

668
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,355
Hey, Soo-hyun.

669
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,565
I'm sensing
something's a bit different today.

670
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,905
Look who's talking. Did you drink?

671
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,845
Yes.

672
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,695
After the group presentation.

673
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,505
- Soo-hyun.
- You've called my name almost ten times.

674
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,285
You know that I have feelings for you,

675
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,685
and yet you're not saying anything.

676
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,715
I know what that means.

677
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,785
I knew

678
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,125
but still couldn't give up.

679
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,115
I've decided to give up though.

680
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,605
I think it became a habit.

681
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,245
Habits are hard to break,
so I kept putting it off.

682
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,995
It sounds like you're saying
you'll never see me again.

683
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,225
I can't cut you out of my life, idiot.

684
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,265
Just cut ties with a loser like me.

685
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,825
You're too good for me.

686
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,865
I know.

687
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,815
But Soo-hyun.

688
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,435
If you ever fall for someone again

689
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,005
when you absolutely can't afford to,

690
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,665
don't let her go no matter what.

691
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,675
A lost opportunity never returns.

692
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,835
You sound as if
you're going somewhere far.

693
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,065
I am going to stay away from you,

694
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,005
but I don't know
if I want to cut off all contact.

695
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,159
Leave the decision up to me.

696
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,495
If I decide to stay friends with you,

697
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,565
you can't go anywhere.

698
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,305
Where would I even go?

699
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,205
Just wait and be on your best behavior.

700
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,485
Hey, you.

701
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,785
- Another coincidence?
- Or is this fate?

702
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,955
I wanted to go for a run,
so I came here and saw you running.

703
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,065
I'll beat you.

704
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,989
I'm an athlete.

705
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,695
And I'm a wanted criminal.
I'm a pro at running away!

706
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,575
