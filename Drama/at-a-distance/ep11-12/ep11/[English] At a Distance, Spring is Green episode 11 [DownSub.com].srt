00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,160
Why are you just standing there? Come in.

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,570
Get in, you little brat.

4
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,810
And you call yourself a man?

5
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,010
[How dare you!]

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,700
You don't want to? Say that again.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Must I seem like a loser because of you?

8
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,410
Must I?

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,180
You inept piece of trash!

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,770
Do you know what should become
of useless brats like you?

11
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,310
Jun, open up!

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,440
[Jun, open this door!]

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,370
-Don't.
-Jun, open the door!

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,000
-Let go.
[-Jun!]

15
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,500
-Father, stop this.
-Move!

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,039
-Let go of me.
-Please stop.

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,670
-You won't let go?
[-Jun!]

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,950
-Open this door!
-Father!

19
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,009
Let go!

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,680
Jun!

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,750
You little...

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,950
Jun-wan.

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,490
Jun-wan?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,140
Leave us.

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,070
Jun-wan, you see...

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,870
Go.

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,270
Jun-wan...

28
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,720
Jun-wan, it's not like you saw.

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,820
You.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,340
Have you been beating him behind my back?

31
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,890
Jun-wan, listen to me.

32
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,280
I warned you

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,850
that Jun's off limits.

34
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,060
But that little brat

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,770
acted out--

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,120
You've gotten weaker.

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,810
It hurts me to see that.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,470
Doesn't this get old for you?

39
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,600
Haven't you done this enough?

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,090
Just stop, darn it!

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,470
What's going on?

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,560
Tell me what's going on! Where's Jun-wan?

43
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,570
Jun-wan?

44
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,079
Jun-wan, open up.

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,060
Jun-wan, open this door!

46
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,740
Open this door, Jun-wan. Jun-wan!

47
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,210
Jun-wan, no!

48
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,880
Jun-wan, open this door!

49
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,010
This is that day all over again.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,770
Ever since that day,
Jun-wan shut down completely.

51
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,390
He no longer laughed.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,150
No...

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
Jun-wan, open this door! Jun-wan!

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,070

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,370
Mom, I'm sick.

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,529
Step aside, darn it!

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,250
Jun-wan, please open this door.

59
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,490
Jun-wan...

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,510
Hello? Hello?

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,870
Please...

62
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,520
Please save my son.

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,659
Please save my son.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,770
Jun-wan, oh no.

[Youth Villa]

66
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,110
Hey, So-bin.

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,370
Soo-hyun, is Jun back?

68
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,600
Not yet.

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,820
He's unreachable at the moment
and I'm worried.

70
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,980
I'll tell him to call you
when he gets back.

71
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,550
-Soo-hyun.
[-Yes?]

72
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,230
It probably won't be of help,

73
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,960
but I can at least listen.

74
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,990
At times,

75
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,570
Jun seems miles away.

76
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,320
I want to close the distance,

77
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,690
but I'm worried
that maybe it's not something

78
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,690
he wants.

79
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,510
If you're patient,
he might close the distance himself.

80
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,770
That's who he is.

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,670
[I bet that didn't help.]

82
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,110
It did.

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
Thanks, Soo-hyun.

84
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,340
What will happen to Father?

85
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,650
He'll be punished
and the world will know about him.

86
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,110
So this is what it comes to.

87
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,790
Once the media gets wind of this,
your life will be disrupted.

88
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,530
It's all right.

89
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm no stranger

90
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,330
when it comes to fame.

91
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,880
I made up my mind the day I found you

92
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,010
passed out from his beating.

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,890
That I'd protect you from him.

94
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,970
I thought I only had
to cope with him alone.

95
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,730
That I only had to keep you out of range.

96
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,390
I believe it'd then be all right.

97
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,970
Jun-wan.

98
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,090
It made things worse for you.

100
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,900
You used to be a pretty boy
as bright as the sun.

101
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,330
I'm still unbelievably pretty, you know.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,230
So don't worry.

103
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,960
I'll shake this off

104
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,650
and live a happy life.

105
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,350
As if nothing had happened.

106
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,130
-What about you?
-What?

107
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,060
What about your life?

108
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,410
You never did anything you wanted

109
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,150
and went down the path
our parents wanted for you.

110
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,460
I'm fine.

111
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,710
You should live your life
doing what you want to.

112
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,080
That doesn't exist.

113
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,380
You should go on a date too.

114
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,340
How do I do that?

115
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,970
Take your own advice

116
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,230
and build a healthy relationship
with So-bin.

117
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,480
I'd rather you do things
that are less by-the-book.

118
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,240
Got it?

119
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,150
I'll be watching you.

120
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,270
I'll get going then.

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,470
Get going.

122
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,420
I always walked away
without seeing you off.

123
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,150
Head inside.

124
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,710
I won't until you go.

125
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,520
[The only way to protect you from him]

126
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
[was to live the life that he wanted.]

127
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,450
You go ahead and live your life.

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,650

[and the advice.]

132

[But moreover, thanks for reminding me]

[You beat the crap out of me!]

136
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,440
I see you've already
erased it from your memory,

137
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,960
but I'm reminded of it every day.

138

My eyes are bored.

151
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,790
Don't tell me you still--

152
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,130
Of course not.
It's just how you feel with celebrities.

153
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,380
Why hasn't he been to school?

154

Being his girlfriend, she'd know.

-Me?
-Yes.

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,960
When did I start speaking casually to you?

164

It didn't take you long with Jun.

00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,680
Is that so?

166
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,660
I didn't know
you two would become friends.

167
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,560
I bet me living with Jun
is uncomfortable for you.

168
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,220
Hardly. I rather feel reassured.

169
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,630
To know
he has someone like you by his side

170
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,050
reassures me.

171
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
But I can't pack a punch.

172
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,600
Even when I'm not around,

173
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,640
he has you beside him.

174
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,300
He'll have moments to laugh thanks to you.

175
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,320
Is that what is like
to have feelings for someone?

176
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,070
You wish for that person's happiness
even when you're not beside them.

177
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,640
Is there no one like that in your life?

178
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,410
I doubt that's what you want to know.

179
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,760
Why aren't you asking me how Jun's doing?

180
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,750
Because talking about him
only makes me miss him more.

181
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,610
Don't worry too much about Jun.

182

Why are you still standing there
and ruining the mood?

186
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,820
To hand you my class notes.

187
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,130
Here you go.

188
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,860
What's important are marked,
so keep that in mind.

189
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,590
And here's mine.

190
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,200
What's up with you two?
This isn't exactly what I need right now.

191
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,440
Don't be ridiculous.

192
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,820
After missing classes,
a student should make up for them.

193
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,720
Whose notes will you take?

194
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,320
You can only choose once
and you only get one chance to choose.

195
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,350
Forget it. I'm done taking any classes.

196
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,660
I have two people
who love me enough to take notes,

197
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,200
so why bother?

198
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,340
-No way.
-No way.

Always the mood-wrecker.

202
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,680
Just a second.

203
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
Yes, Professor.

204
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,100
Are you feeling better now?

205
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,640
I returned home that day after
everything was sorted with my father,

206
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,080
but seeing you brought on the tears.

207
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,820
What hurt me for a long time

208
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,730
was no longer a big deal for me
which seemed futile.

209
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,860
I guess the pain became my friend.

210
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,630
I coped with it for too long.

211
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,280
So leaving it behind

212
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,370
felt like I was parting ways
with myself from the past.

213
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,440
That's why you cried your eyes out.
From the pain of a breakup.

214
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,680
We're even now.

215
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,110
-What do you mean?
-I saw you cry too once.

216
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,570
Me?

217
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,860
I've never cried though.

218
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,800
Then I guess you didn't.

219
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,230
Maybe I saw you cry on the inside.

Every now and again,

223
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,350
I realize that clinging to you

224
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,690
was the best thing I did.

225
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,080
Yes, you have a knack for that.

226
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,430
I actually can't do it well

227
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,330
because I'm scared of rejection.

228
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,490
Why did you do it then?

229
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,950
I just wanted to.

230
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,160
Are you speaking informally to me?

231
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,680
I was deeply hurt back then, you know.

232
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,230
But I'm glad I didn't give up.

233
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,010
If I hadn't met you,

234
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,690
I wouldn't have made it this far.

235
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,660
I would've stayed as someone
who couldn't speak his heart.

236
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,490
I guess I'm grateful in a way.

237
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,310
What if I never met you though?

238
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,970
I won't think about it.

239
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,370
I really don't want to.

240

While backed into a corner,

241
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,990
I thought about ending it all.

242
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,640
But I guess my ending
isn't mine to decide.

-No.
-No way!

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,030
I know you hate that it's over...

326
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,430
which is why I'm giving out an assignment.

327
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,910
It can be a company, brand, or product.

Decide on one as a team

329

and film a PR video.

330
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,980
Content and format are at your discretion.

331
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,340
Doesn't it sound like fun?

332
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,180
Will it be part of our grade?

333
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,460
You'll be tested on the content
of the last team project.

334
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,840
Your final grade will be
a half that and a half this.

336

This is your chance to make up for it.

Iâ€™ll be grading you on planning,
creativity, and execution,

338
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,160
so play your roles within your team.

339
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,860
Do we choose our teammates freely
like last time?

340
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,880
Your teams?

341
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,830
Stick with your old ones.

342
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,260
This is how most of you felt

343
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,840
according to the team project review.

344
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,760
I don't want the activity
to be a negative experience,

345
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,740
so I'm giving you another chance.

346
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,630
Why?

347
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Are you dreaded to work again
with people you hate?

348
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,590
-Yes.
-Yes.

349
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,620
Enduring those you hate

350
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,460
and finding a way
to overcome that hardship

351
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,870
are part of being in a society.

352
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,130
Trust me and give it another shot.
Dismissed.

353
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,500
Oh, one more thing.

354
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,570
While working on the project,

355
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,430
why not play Secret Santa
with your teammates?

356
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,500
-Are you serious?
-Who would want to do that?

357
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,790
-What?
-Secret Santa?

358
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,900
Secret Santa?
As if it wouldn't be obvious.

359
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,490
What if I got chosen as So-bin's?

360
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,570
She might report you for stalking.

361
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,820
It's dangerous.

362
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,470
I want us to be each other's.

363
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,210
Then it wouldn't show
since we're always affectionate.

364
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,850
-I'm affectionate?
-No, I am.

365
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,090
Let's discuss it right away.

366
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,520
Where should we go? Someplace fancy...

367
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,520
-I don't have my credit card.
-The school cafeteria will do.

368
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,670
I'd like to buy everyone a drink.

369
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,120
What?

370
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,510
A sudden change in a person
indicates imminent death.

371
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,830
Take it easy, will you?

372
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,080
Then you can sit this one out.

373
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,920
It'll save me half the money.

374
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,210
Of course, I'll come!

375
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,400
Hold on a second.

376
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,130
Guys, wait.

377
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,620
Well,

378
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,720
I'd like to buy drinks
as a means to apologize.

379
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,880
That's new.

380
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,320
Jun, So-bin, I bet you don't want to.

381
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,770
Right?

382
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,850
As if kneeling is enough
to make her forgive you.

383
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,940
-Maybe some other time--
-Let's go.

384
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,660
What?

385
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,990
Don't go if you don't want to.

386
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,520
Well, I'm not a part of this,
so I'm just going to go.

387
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,020
I'll go

388
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,520
if everyone else goes.

389
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,750
We'll decide on the Secret Santa
when we get there.

390
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,840
Let's go.

391
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,810
What's wrong? Is it me?

392
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,700
Could be.

393
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,210
Next.

394
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,850
What are you doing? Did you pick me?

395
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,890
Of course not.

396
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,180
You already got caught, Soo-hyun.

397
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,310
Did you get me too?

398
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,900
Why is everyone frowning?

399
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,540
Come on everyone. Eat up and stop pouting.

400
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,880
Don't order too many snacks.

401
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,080
We need to leave some room for drinking.

402
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,010
It's not because snacks are expensive.

403
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,800
Excuse me. Can we get a spicy
stir-fried chicken and fish cake stew?

404
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,510
I thought you weren't feeling well.

405
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,679
Hye-ji, you like
spicy stir-fried chicken, right?

406
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,909
How did you know that?

407
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,170
I didn't follow your channel on YouTube.

408
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,530
I just read the comments.

409
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,880
Why would you say something like that?
You're making her feel uncomfortable.

410
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,639
Don't worry about him, Hye-ji.

411
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,659
You're the one
making me feel uncomfortable.

412
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,310
So what does a Secret Santa have to do?

413
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,810
Whatever works.

414
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,610
Why? What are you going to do for me?

415
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,800
What?

416
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm not your Secret Santa.
Don't get the wrong idea.

417
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,449
I don't think we need to order anymore.
Everyone seems full.

418
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,090
No, go ahead.

419
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,290
You can order whatever you want.

420
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,990
And there's no need for
you to pay, Yeo Jun.

421
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,070
I'm not the ATM anymore.
I don't have a gold card.

422
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,080
Congratulations on becoming a human.

423
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,640
You've changed, Soo-hyun.

424
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,320
Since we're done with Secret Santa,
let's talk about group project.

425
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,670
You really haven't changed.

426
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,310
Come on, guys. Let's drink.

427
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Come on. Cheers.

428
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,560
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

429
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,930
You have to do it too, Soo-hyun.

430
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,180
-Cheers Soo-hyun!
-Cheers.

431
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,970
Bottoms up!

432
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,260
My smile is not fake anymore.

433
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,670
What took my mask away?

434
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,610
Bottoms up!

435
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,240
Drink!

436
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,670
[Youth Villa]

437
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,010
Yeo Jun, wake up!

438
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,950
Yeo jun!

439
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,380
Get up. You're going to be late for class.

440
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,200
Okay. Five more minutes.

441
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,960
I can't let this slide for your sake.

442
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,860
Wake up!

443
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,220
Please! Stop being my Secret Santa.

444
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,990
Wake up. You're going to be
late for class.

445
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,540
Let me sleep just a little more.

446
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,140
You're going to be late! Get up!

447
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,740
Please just leave me alone!

448
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,020
Thanks to me, you're not going to be late.

449
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,050
Thanks a lot.

450
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,780
Who is my Secret Santa?

451
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,430
He's not doing anything for me.

452
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,610
Maybe your Secret Santa is just that good.
You don't even know what he did for you.

453
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,760
Yes, I have no idea.

454
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,140
He really is good.

455
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,600
How's your script going?

456
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,890
Don't get me started.

457
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,230
I'm not getting enough sleep
because of my creativity

458
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,030
and my Secret Santa wakes me up
every day early in the morning.

459
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,490
Soo-hyun does that?

460
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,060
Why do you seem so worried?

461
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,490
If I want my boyfriend's work
to stand out,

462
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,180
I have to cast good actors.

463
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,070
I don't know who to cast.

464
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,870
I have no connections.

465
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,820
So what? Just cast anyone.

466
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,770
I'm sure they'll get hooked by
how attractive you are.

467
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,050
I want you to be the hero.
Myungil University hottest guy, Yeo Jun.

468
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,070
I'll pull some strings
and cast my own boyfriend.

469
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,960
My pay is pretty high.

470
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,340
Talk to my manager.

471
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,410
-Manager?
-Yes.

472
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,870
BA major, Kim So-bin. She's my manager.

473
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,190
Well, let's go to your
next schedule, Mr. Hotshot.

474
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,830
I don't want to go to work.
I want to meet my girlfriend.

475
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,810
I miss her so much.

476
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,500
Well, you'll have to endure it
if you want to succeed.

477
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,590
I don't want to work.

478
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,310
No, you have to work.

479
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,890
-I do?
-Yes.

480
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,310
-You're doing what?
-I'm going on a blind date.

481
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,780
You do that?

482
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,730
My friend wanted me to go in her stead.

483
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,660
In her stead?

484
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,530
Then does that mean you'll date
and get married in her stead too?

485
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,750
Wait, are you jealous?

486
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,690
You shouldn't just meet anyone.

487
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,860
He's not just anyone.
He works at the school library

488
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,310
and he's a junior majoring in law.

489
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,090
I checked him out in secret.

490
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,110
The library?

491
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,170
He looks good when he wears glasses
and he seems smart.

492
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,840
He's totally my style.

493
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,850
I am a little creeped out since
I've never been on a blind date before.

494
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,050
Should I not go?

495
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,850
I won't go if you don't want me to.

496
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,660
Go ahead.

497
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,170
What?

498
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,530
You want to go.
I mean, you already checked him out.

499
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,560
I only saw him because
I had to go to the library.

500
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,890
I know you don't go to the library.

501
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,850
What are you talking about? I go to
the library for the vitamin drinks!

502
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,880
The vending machine there
sells really good ones.

503
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,400
I'm going to the library
to buy vitamin drinks.

504
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,940
Young-ran.

505
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,050
Were you the one who left
the vitamin drink when I was sleeping?

506
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,530
I don't know!

507
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,650
[I won't go if you don't want me to.]

508
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,850
[Go ahead.]

509
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,930
He told me to go.

510
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,060
-Hey, Wanted Criminal.
-Hi, Girl With a Story.

511
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,830
I have an upset stomach.
Let's go get some ice cream.

512
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,200
When you have an upset stomach...

513
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,560
Go day drinking?

514
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,450
No, you need a nice cup of
rich chocolate milk.

515
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,540
Oh, this is so sweet. Why drink this
when you have an upset stomach?

516
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,270
You have to coat your stomach
with something sweet.

517
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm not feeling well either.

518
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,190
I heard you got dumped
after telling a girl how you feel.

519
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,370
Is there something else?

520
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,750
Of course, there is.
I still have feelings for her.

521
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,370
Feelings are so stubborn.
They don't know when to give up.

522
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,670
How did you go through this
for seven years?

523
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,590
Well... Seven years just passed by.

524
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,110
No one intends to have
a crush on someone for seven years.

525
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,560
Things happened
and your crush just continues.

526
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,860
Will it last seven years for me too?

527
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,480
I told Soo-hyun
I was going on a blind date.

528
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,580
What did he say?

529
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,390
He didn't tell you to go
right away, did he?

530
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,620
He did.

531
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,960
I got dumped
when I didn't even confess, right?

532
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,970
I'm not going to answer that.
It hurts me more.

533
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,830

00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:44,190
Read one poem a day.

715
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,600
It'll purify your heart.

716
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,680
Did someone ask you to do this?

717
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,760
No, I just wanted to give it to you.

718
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,560
I thought you'd find the poems helpful.

["Poems for the Heart"]

720
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,550
A poetry book...

721
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,840
Only Jung-ho would be this thoughtful.

722
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,870
Oh, he must be my Secret Santa.

723
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,680
Anyway, tell him I said thanks.

724
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:04,910
Bye.

725
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,770
I'm his Secret Santa.

726
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,500
Am I not thoughtful?

727
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,790
I gave it to her.

728
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,150
-Here.
-Hey, it's okay.

729
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,600
What's with you?

730
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,300
I did it for free.
You don't need to be sorry. I'm off.

731
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,030
Why is he acting all nice?

732
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,720
Where is my Secret Santa?

733
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,280
Soo-hyun saved seats for us.

734
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,610
-Let's sit there.
-No, let's sit somewhere else.

[Fashion Brand Z, Promo Video]

736
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,290
Let's begin.

737
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,480
We made a promo video for fashion brand Z.

738
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,710
What's the brand tagline?

739
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,350
The tagline is, "Don't look any further.
You are the answer."

740
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,560
There's a girl who no one ever notices.

741
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,760
She's a college freshman

742
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,840
with no unique style or her own
or a good sense of fashion.

743
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,220
But she meets a popular guy at her school

744
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,770
who has tens of thousands of followers
on social media.

745
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,280
This is a story of how
their encounter changes her.

746
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,610
It's not just about fashion.

747
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,690
We focused on her journey
of finding her true self.

748
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,410
Let's watch the video.

749
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,300
Let's talk about what we thought

750
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,840
of the other teams' presentations.

751
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,440
They were good.

752
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:54,340
They were all creative,
and I liked their stories.

753
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,190
Why do you ask?

754
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,670
We won't get the highest mark
at this rate.

755
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,030
You wanted the highest mark?

756
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,230
He always gets the highest mark.

757
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,960
We'll try to make our story stand out,

758
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,370
but it has its limits.

759
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,920
Do you have any other ideas?

760
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:15,070
Then why don't we focus on casting?

761
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,490
Casting?

762
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,130
Excuse me.

763
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,990
Are you Kim Hye-yoon
in Journalism and Communication?

[At a Distance, Spring is Green]

765
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,230
Kim So-bin!

766
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,030
-Hold on.
-Let's do it again.

767
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,280
Let's try that again.

768
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,390
-One more time.
-Just this one scene.

769
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,010
My gosh.

770
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,390
-What's the matter?
-What was that sound?

771
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,930
-Sorry?
-Try that again.

772
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,070
Okay!

773
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,390
It's okay.

774
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,330
It's fun to tease him.

775
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,310
You can do it with me. Bye, guys.

776
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,150
Do what?

777
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,780
-Wait.
-Cut.

778
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,760
But...

779
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,430
-Cut, good.
-Okay.

780
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,620
What?

781
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,360
Action!

782
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,220
Where's Mi-ju going?

783
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,550
-It's the other way.
-Oh, right.

784
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,500
Let's do that again.

785
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,790
Put it to a vote?

786
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,420
Cut. Let's try that again.
