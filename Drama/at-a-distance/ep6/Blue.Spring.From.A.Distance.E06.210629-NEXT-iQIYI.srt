how come there are only three of you?

531
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,979
Aren't there six people in this group?

532
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,465
We, unfortunately, had no choice
but to leave the group.

533
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,115
Tell me why you had no choice
but to do that.

534
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,069
Even though
we did our duty as members of the team,

535
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,675
we got kicked out because of
Nam Soo-hyun's arbitrary decision.

536
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,095
Soo-hyun made that decision by himself?

537
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,955
So-bin, aren't you the leader of the team?

538
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,545
Well, that's...

539
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,755
We actively participated
and attended the meetings.

540
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,539
But because of
Soo-hyun's personal grudges,

541
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,345
- the team broke up.
- My gosh.

542
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,415
I suppose Soo-hyun had
a lot of power in the group.

543
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,755
So?

544
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,475
You got kicked out like that.
And that's it?

545
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,899
Did you not try to reconcile?

546
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,315
You should've done something.

547
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,779
Soo-hyun bossed everyone around.

548
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,399
So-bin can't speak up,

549
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,989
and Jun is only a clueless freshman,

550
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,535
so there was nothing we could do.

551
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,309
However, we continued to study
and do our own research on the topic.

552
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,605
Can you prove it?

553
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,119
If you can't, you'll get in trouble.

554
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,415
Then let me ask them a question.

555
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,535
Pingpong was once a failed product.

556
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,709
However, it achieved success
through the story of the Pingpong Family.

557
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,455
This family consists of grandparents,
parents, a son, and a daughter.

558
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,925
The brand described them
as "a perfect family."

559
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,675
I'll watch it for you.

560
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,045
Go ahead. Don't worry.

561
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,885
Thanks. I'll be right back.

562
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,740
[ Hye-ji ]

563
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,575
[ Hye-ji, I got my hands
on So-bin's notes for the presentation. ]

564
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,830
[ Hye-ji ]

565
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,149
[ Nice! ]

566
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,535
[ Send me a photo of it.
I'll buy you lunch all week. ]

567
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,959
[ Expected Questions ]

568
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,375
[ "A perfect family"? ]

569
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,399
So any family that doesn't have
all those family members

570
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,645
is incomplete?

571
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,369
Isn't it unethical for a company
to derive benefit

572
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,399
from such a discriminatory value?

573
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,345
- Oh, that's...
- I'll answer that question.

574
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,935
No. Soo-hyun, you stay out of this.

575
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,205
I need to find out whether Jun and So-bin

576
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:44,295
are just riding on your coattails,
or they actually worked on this

577
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,715
with you.

578
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,439
Jun did work hard on this with us,

579
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,605
but please keep in mind
that he's a freshman.

580
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,509
Okay, he gets a pass.

581
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,245
Then, So-bin.

582
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,675
Come forward and answer it.

583
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,105
Sure.

584
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,475
What's she doing?

585
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,525
- Why is she just standing there?
- What's with her?

586
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,589
Answer the question!

587
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,219
Why is she just standing there?

588
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,815
- Come on.
- What's with her?

589
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,125
Did Soo-hyun actually do all the work?

590
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,045
- Come on.
- What's she doing?

591
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,435
Kim So-bin.

592
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,465
- Yes.
- This isn't good.

593
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,935
Did Soo-hyun do all the work?

594
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,945
Then all of you will get a zero
on this presentation.

595
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,089
I'm sorry, but...

596
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,655
What? I can't hear you!

597
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,055
Do you mind

598
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,095
repeating the question?

599
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,909
What's your take on the negative impact
of such a discriminatory marketing copy

600
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,985
on the public?

601
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,665
Do you know why people collect
Pingpong's product label?

602
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,385
The label?

603
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,645
To recycle it?

604
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,229
We only went through the brand's
marketing strategies in our presentation,

605
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,705
but if we were to go
into some more details...

606
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,429
On the front of the label,
you see the character.

607
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,175
But on the back of it,
you'd see the family's story.

608
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,645
Each of the ten family members' stories.

609
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,805
What does that have to do
with my question?

610
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,219
Once you collect all the stories,

611
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,525
you discover how the Pingpong Family
became a family.

612
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,085
The grandpa was once homeless
because his children abandoned him.

613
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,925
The grandma met him and fell in love
for the first time in her life.

614
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,965
The dad lost his entire family
in an accident.

615
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,385
The mom is terminally ill.

616
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,725
The son was abandoned
by his birth parents.

617
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,555
The daughter ran away
from her abusive birth parents.

618
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,395
The marketing copy, "perfect family",

619
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,345
could be misleading and off-putting.

620
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,209
However, the brand actually used
such a negative response

621
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,945
to stimulate consumer interest
in the product.

622
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,385
They used it as a strategy
to pull consumers into the story.

623
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,325
I guess she did work on it.

624
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,045
Good answer, I must say.

625
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,845
- Well, but...
- I suppose you only saw the question,

626
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,869
and not the answer.

627
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,999
What? Are you saying I stole a look
at your list of expected questions?

628
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,809
Anyone could've asked that question.

629
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,015
Anyone who studied

630
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,285
would have known this much.

631
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,605
Be quiet.

632
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,895
Did it answer your question?

633
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,785
Looks like
we've got a serious problem here.

634
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,885
Okay, that's it for today.

635
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,245
Professor Park.

636
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,485
Then what will happen to our team?

637
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,305
Only the three of you who did
the presentation will get marks for it.

638
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,545
Good work.

639
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,565
Well done.

640
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,195
Attention, please.

641
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,739
Professor Park said the final exam

642
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,945
will be based on your presentations.

643
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,969
Especially the materials
from the best presentation.

644
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,825
The details will be posted soon.

645
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,639
- Jun, can I see your notes?
- Please...

646
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,239
- Give us your notes.
- Let's swap notes.

647
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,695
- Please...
- I need to pass the exam.

648
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,335
I don't need your notes.
I wrote down everything.

649
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,659
Hey. You knew about this, didn't you?

650
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,075
You did this to mess with us.

651
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,245
Why would I? I'm barely hanging on myself.

652
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,815
We wouldn't have done this
had we known it'd be on the exam.

653
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,375
You reap what you sow.
We should be graded fairly.

654
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,715
Wait, Jun.

655
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,905
- My hands are still trembling.
- You were good.

656
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,415
I feel a sense of achievement.

657
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,299
Give me five.

658
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,755
- Yes!
- Yes!

659
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,255
My gosh.

660
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,515
- Soo-hyun.
- I thought you were a ghost.

661
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,539
I'll buy lunch.

662
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,085
I have a shift.

663
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,489
A shift?

664
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,735
I was just imitating someone.

665
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,635
I have a shift.

666
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,719
Come on. Can you just take the day off?

667
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,339
The three of us should celebrate.

668
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,935
I guess you got the job back.

669
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,385
What job?

670
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,015
You knew I got fired?

671
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,775
I stopped by, but you weren't there.

672
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,895
I just thought they fired you
because of your personality.

673
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,335
Did you not get my text? Let's talk later.

674
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,485
Sorry, I don't have time.

675
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,149
Are you busy too, Jun?

676
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,535
No. I'm available, of course.
Where shall we go?

677
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,265
Let's be more clingy.

678
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,025
Soo-hyun!

679
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,505
[ I made a friend ]

680
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,635
[ for the first time in my life. ]

681
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,835
You really don't want to eat?

682
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,125
I can never stay on a diet
because of my roomies.

683
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,935
I should do it when I'm at school.

684
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,915
Take a seat.

685
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,495
Enjoy.

686
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,835
Enjoy.

687
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,925
Enjoy.

688
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,615
Do you want more?

689
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,705
Don't you remember me?

690
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,295
Give me more. A lot more.

691
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,205
Enjoy.

692
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,009
My gosh.
You didn't get the chicken breast salad?

693
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,465
Aren't you on a low-sodium diet?

694
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,975
As of today, I'm on a spicy pork diet.

695
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,479
Hey! This is super high in sodium.

696
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,245
Have some rice at least. Want some rice?

697
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,805
This spicy stir-fried pork is very good.
The meat is high-quality.

698
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,105
They only gave you lean meat.

699
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,215
I guess they know you don't eat fat.

700
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,995
No, he knows nothing.

701
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,055
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

702
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,035
You seem to have a fever.

703
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,815
- What?
[ - Hey, what's up? ]

704
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,355
He answered.

705
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,279

through sports...

Yes. You were always so excited
when you beat me.

712

713

This isn't the first time.

716

- Pick up my phone calls.
- You could've come to school to meet me.

717
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,539
I didn't go on purpose.
I was seeing when you'd pick up.

- Why would you waste your energy on that?

719

I'm not going to be
friends with you anymore.

720

- Yes.

Okay.

Fine. It's a promise.

723

anyway. I should just get rid of it.
