00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,235
[ gather the materials
and go over them instead? ]

187
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,135
[ I'm really, really, really sorry. ]

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,055
Maybe I should skip school today.

189
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,155
[ Can't you tell the time? ]

190
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,479
I'm only ten minutes late.

191
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,715
[ Just ten minutes? ]

192
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,729
[ I told you to be on time. ]

- I think I'm lost.

195
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,989
I'm at the fountain, so meet me here.

196
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,145
Bye!

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,345
Such a nagger.

198
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,889
I took time off practice

199
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,355
to meet him between his classes.

200
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,069
He'll be a while, right?

201
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,445
Let's take a look around.

202
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,425
Him over there.

203
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,059
Seriously? Not again.

204
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,829
Bleaching your hair
damages your roots and scalp.

205
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,549
Is it your roots or scalp though?

206
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,935
- Mind your own business.
- I know from experience.

207
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,995
Soo-kyung,

208
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,195
you think I'm a boomer.

209
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,879
I'm most certainly not.

210
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,335
Then what are you?

211
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,239
All I wish
is to talk about life with students

212
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,535
over a meal.

213
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,675
There's so much I've experienced
that I want to tell them about.

214
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,535
That's what makes you a boomer.

215
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,375
It sure is hot outside.

216
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,739
What is he doing?

217
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,425
Can you believe it?

218
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,655
- Unbelievable.
- He's not that good though.

219
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,125
- Why isn't he getting up?
- He's good.

220
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,955
Soo-hyun!

221
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,905
We're in matching colors today.

222
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,805
Did you copy my look?

223
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,635
Take your pants off too
while you're at it.

224
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,095
Stride in your underwear.

225
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,639
You have a unique talent.

226
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,335
What would that be?
I have so many, you see.

227
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,145
You ignore what others say

228
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,345
and get in their faces with a smile.

229
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,385
Not to everyone, you know.

230
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,229
Just like you said,

231
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,745
I'm more like this
because you're hard to win over.

232
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,085
I just think
you're being pretentious like me.

233
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,505
Pretentious?

234
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,359
I laugh in people’s faces

235
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,275
and it seems like
you’re trying hard not to like me.

236
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,905
Isn’t that being pretentious too?

237
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,675
Hey, you laughed!

238
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,145
I don't know
why I'm trying to patronize you,

239
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,855
but listen up.

240
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,255
In this world,
there are people who don't like you.

241
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,465
That's true.

242
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,465
But I don't think you're not one of them.

243
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,449
I apologize.

244
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,559
I could see right through you

245
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,455
which is why I bothered to converse.

246
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,995
But, just forget about it.

247
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,749
You know how I am

248
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,475
and I treat everyone the same.

249
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,265
You can apologize

250
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,225
by treating me to a meal.

251
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,485
No one has ever
been treated to one by you,

252
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,375
and I'd like to be your first.

253
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,978
You won't agree to a meal that I buy,

254
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,715
- so treat me to one instead.
- Why would I?

255
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,205
You've got to be kidding me.

256
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,635
Look at him.
He can't take his eyes off Mi-ju.

257
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,495
You haven't found a model yet, have you?

258
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,915
- What about him?
- Forget it.

259
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,559
Excuse me.
Are you perhaps interested in modeling?

260
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,319
Sorry? A model?

261
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,365
- Don't.
- She's looking for one.

262
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,559
You'll be seeing her at least once a week.

263
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,239
What? Every week? With her?

264
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,749
- Stop it.
- Do you think you can handle it?

265
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,705
Of course.
I'm confident in the body I carry.

266
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,595
Why don't I show you?

267
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,465
What do you think you're doing?

268
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,665
Soo-hyun, it's...

269
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,095
Let's go.

270
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,895
Just a second!

271
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,509
Did I ask you to strip?

272
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,795
No, that was just me.

273
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,195
He's looking at us
as if we were sexually harassing you.

274
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,089
- Weren't you?
- Of course not!

275
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,505
Then I guess I misunderstood.

276
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,055
It's just that you were all ogling him.

277
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,885
Then apologize.

278
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,839
Apologize for the misunderstanding.

279
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,125
I don't think I can.

280
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,405
Who knows what's actually true?

281
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,245
Come on.

282
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,675
Hi, I'm Yeo Jun,
a younger classmate of Soo-hyun's.

283
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,785
What? A classmate?

284
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,865
This temperamental jerk
has one that talks to him?

285
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,805
Unbelievable.

286
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,389
I'm at least not as immoral as you.

287
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,025
Hold on, will you?

288
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,025
Thank you for being his friend.

289
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,829
I'm Nam Koo-hyun,
Soo-hyun's one and only brother.

290
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,969
It's good to meet you.

291
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,095
This is just fascinating.

292
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,045
Why is someone like you
friends with my brother though?

293
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,175
Does he have some kind of leverage on you?

294
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,189
Quit the nonsense and get going.

295
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,695
That hurts, darn it!

296
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,179
You said we'd see our room,

297
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,809
so I skipped practice and my meal.

298
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,779
I'm telling Mom.

299
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,379
Go ahead. Brag about

300
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,185
stripping in front of the girls too.

301
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,265
Would you like to eat with us?

302
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,059
I'd appreciate the saving.

303
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,055
- His nagging is just--
- Koo-hyun!

304
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,395
- Sure. Let's go.
- Sweet.

305
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,215
What should we have?

306
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,110
[ Cash, Credit cards only ]

307
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,815
- What's good?
- The pork cutlet.

308
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,215
I'll have the pork cutlet
and ramyeon with cheese.

309
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,555
I'll pay for it.

310
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,975
I thought that was a given.

311
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,225
No, this is a first.

312
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,235
Choose.

313
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,375
Go ahead.

314
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,689
What should I have

315
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,985
that would say I ate well?

316
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,075
Budae jjigae?

317
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,309
This hair isn't appropriate
for someone who wants to be police.

318
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,865
I won't be able to bleach my hair
as an officer,

319
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,275
so I'm enjoying these moments.

320
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,475
You sure are a nutjob.

321
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,859
Have some beef too.

322
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,205
- What about you?
- Eat your fill.

323
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,425
And comb your hair.
Just look at this mess.

324
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,109
Have some beans too.

325
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,665
Go on and stop being a picky eater.

326
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,995
Eat up.

327
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,065
Eat.

328
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,615
Unbelievable.

329
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,455
I'm off to the restroom.

330
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,945
That's a sweet watch you have.

331
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,965
Do you like it?

332
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,705
I'll get going then.

333
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,905
Come back here.

334
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,405
Why? What are you going
to nag about this time?

335
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,055
Don't skip your meals
and open the windows often.

336
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,705
Look after yourself more
and get some sleep.

337
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,019
Get going already.

338
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,225
Don't abandon my brother.

339
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,889
He's a poor guy, you see.

340
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,219
- Aren't you leaving?
- I'm going!

341
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,125
I'll see you around.

342
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,115
Aren't you going too?

343
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,625
I should.

344
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,985
You're quite affectionate
toward your brother.

345
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,065
Affectionate? What's that?

346
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,065
How you treat your brother
is exactly that.

347
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,935
What about you? Any siblings?

348
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,895
No, I'm an only child.

349
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,975
It's easy that way.
You have no one to be mindful of.

350
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,005
You should get going then.
Thanks for the meal.

351

Sure.

- What now?

353
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,069
Can I call you again?

354
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,145
No, don't.

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,915
You might call me first, you know.

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,915
That won't ever happen.

You did a vast research.

388

However,

I researched three marketing strategies.

I got carried away with the brand concept,

394

395

Mijin Foods is a big company.

396
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,669
You ignored
the distribution network it has

397

and only focused on marketing
which is why it's not realistic.

398
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,899
There were many typos too

399
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,905
which are a result of you
not knowing proper grammar.

400
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,968
A lot of the materials overlapped too.

401
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,105
Are you sure you didn't
just copy and paste?

412

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,389
You need to learn to enjoy
the small things in life.

540
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,245
You're always so serious.

541
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,545
Just pass the exam, please.

542
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,015
Let go!

543
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,755
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

544
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,335
It's cash.

545
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,445
Where did you get this?

546
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,859
Come on. It's just 100,000 won.

547
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,715
Hey, "just 100,000 won"?

548
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,885
You always work so hard,
so I did some gig work just for the day.

549
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,949
You'd better tell me the truth.

550
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,379
Hey, just let it go. It's really nothing.

Nam Koo-hyun.

552
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,415
Well, I just sold something
I got for free.

553
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,115
From your rich friend.

554
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,065
- Yeo Jun?
- Yes.

555
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,339
I told him I liked his watch,

556
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,749
and he said I could have it.

557
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,689
- And you accepted it?
- Hey.

558
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,179
Of course, I did. It's expensive.

559
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,849
Are you a beggar?

560
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,309
That's a mean thing to say.

561
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,905
What's wrong with accepting something
he doesn't need?

562
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,429
Is this it?

563
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,329
It's what's left
after paying for the gosiwon.

564
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,475
Hey!

[ Youth Villa ]

566
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,245
- Soo-hyun?
- [ I'm in front of your place. Come out. ]

567
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,739
Now?

568
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,345
Yes, I'll wait here until you come out.

569
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,375
Okay, give me a minute.

570
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,375
Soo-hyun.

571
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,555
Koo-hyun told me what happened.

572
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,975
Oh, that.

573
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,985
- Why did you do that?
- I gave it to him because he wanted it.

574
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,745
I can just buy another one.

575
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,905
I'm sorry.

576
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,235
For what?

577
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,529
I can't pay you back right away,
but I will.

578
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,115
Will that make you feel at ease?

579
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,665
You said I'd call you.
Were you referring to this?

580
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,295
- Did I say that?
- So, it all went according to your plan.

581
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,229
You made me call you first
and practically beg you.

582
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,785
That wasn't my plan.

583
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,905
You may never have found out.

584
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,245
What do you want from me?

585
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,795
What could it be?

586
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,695
Forget about the money.

587
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,945
I don't need money.

588
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,875
As you know, I can get it easily.

589
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,835
Can you warm up to me?

590
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,245
Nobody warms up to you
because they genuinely like you

591
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,695
without you having you trick them
like this or spend money on them?

592
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,555
That's right.

593
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,505
Nobody.

594
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,115
Don't you pity me?

595
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,395
Don't look at me like that.

596
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,159
You need money,

597
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,145
and I need love. It's the same thing.

598
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,095
You do everything in your power
to earn money.

599
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,965
I'm just doing what I want to do
to get what I want.

600
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,225
All right.

601
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,525
You won. I'll do as you say.

606
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,365
So-bin, are you mad at me?

607
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,649
I knew you had your tutoring session here,

608
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,229
so I came to pick you up.

609
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,735
Who has such an amazing friend?

610
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,585
You do!

611
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,485
So-bin, don't be mad at me.

612
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,155
Leave me alone, please.

613
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,349
Why did you have to come by that day?

614
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,889
Someone told me

615
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,875
that was the best day to go to your place,

616
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,995
but I ended up humiliating myself.

617
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,755
Who told you that?

618
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,695
Don't tell me... Yeo Jun?

619
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,549
That's right!

620
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,189
My boyfriend said
that promises must be kept

621
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,565
and told me to go that day.

622
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,835
Are you actually seeing him?

623
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,635
You're joking, right?

624
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,755
- That's...
- You're not seeing him, right?

625
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,235
Right, no way! I knew it.

626
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,475
"I knew it"?

627
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,769
- What I meant was...
- What did you mean by that?

628
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,465
Were you saying I shouldn't even dream
of dating a guy like him?

629
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,019
Now, I'm relieved.

630
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,819
Yes, this is the So-bin I know.

631
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,239

who can only yell at me.

Hey, were you not joking?

634
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,779
Hey! We've stayed friends

Don't call him like that.

Don't trust him.

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,045
He knew I'd have a girl over that day.

640
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,255
I told him.

641
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,749
So what?

642
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,705
Are you saying he told me to go over
to your place that day on purpose?

643
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,685
That's absurd.

[ If he says no, just come meet me now. ]

647
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,715
I can't believe you called
right on time though.

648
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,425
Worry swept over me.

649
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,625
And regret.

650
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,765
He's been kind of creeping me out.

651
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,879
People like him aren't good for you
because you trust others easily

652
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,979

You can tell me about that later.

I want to ask you something.

678

What is it? You can ask me anything.

You know,

that day... The day I went
to Chan-ki's place to tell him how I feel.

681
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,695
Did you know

682
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,165
that his girlfriend would be over
that day?

683
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,195
Do you think I intentionally made you
run into her?

684
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,235
No.

685
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,435
Did you

686
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,555
see him?

687
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,785
Yes.

688
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,705
He came to pick me up
after my tutoring session.

689
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,185
Forget it, if that's not the case.

690

To tell you the truth,

691
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,035
I did wonder if you did it on purpose.

692
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,455
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,315
I did.

694
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,785
- What?
- I sent you there because I knew about it.

695
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,085
I wasn't sure whether
the timing would work out,

696
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,115
but I thought it could.

697
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,365
What you were wondering is true.

698
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,359
Why did you do that?

699
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,995
I wanted to end it for you.

700
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,385
I'm sure it's hard for you
to keep getting disappointed.

701
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,049
Was that the only way though?

702
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,335
It'd help you give up quickly.

703
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,699
Are you sure
you didn't want to see me get hurt?

704
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,305
Was it fun for you to watch me cry
like an idiot?

705
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,425
So he rejected you,
just as I had expected.

706
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,135
You should've stopped being so foolish
a long time ago.

707
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,475
Didn't I tell you?

708
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,415
You told me to use you.

709
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,799
What did you mean by that?

710
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,825
I hurt you,

711
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,255

that you gain something from me.

Yeo Jun.

713
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,145
That's the only thing
I've learned in life.

714
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,125
Give and take.

715
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,505
Nothing's free in life.

716
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,165
I was bound to get hurt
even if you didn't get involved.

717
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,445
I'm not trying to put the blame on you.

718
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,625
But I can't figure you out.

719
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,415
You scare me.

You promised we'll be close friends

00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,585
As your boyfriend.

[ So he rejected you,
just as I had expected. ]

733
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,505

Okay, let's meet up.

736
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,615

- [ Soo-hyun. ]
- Hey.

740
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,915
You picked up.

741
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,425
[ Of course. I still owe you. ]

[ I'm working. ]

- Yes. At such a late time.

744
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,485
I hurt someone

745
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,045
and I want to know
how to go back to the way things were.

746
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,499
[ What are you doing over there?
Get back to work! ]

- That's it?
- You're bad at that.

750
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,025
Just do what you're bad at.

[ Bye. ]

752
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,689
I must be out of my mind.

753
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,229
Why am I doing this?

754
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,299
Hey, good actions lead to good fortune.

755
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,279
Do you want me to die of muscle cramps?

756
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,679
Do you have to say it like that?

757
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,179
Why do you get so many cramps?

758
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,979
Because I work my butt off
to make a living.

759
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,099
It's probably because
you're drinking all the time.

760
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,865
[ So-bin! ]

761
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,115
Hey, did you hear that?

762
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,345
[ - So-bin! ]
- Who is that?

- Yeo Jun?
- So-bin!

764
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,649
Did he follow me here?

765
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,775
Why do you think it's you?
Maybe he's looking for me.

766
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,935
- It's not you!
- It's not you!

767
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,575
Gosh...

768
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,905
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

769
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,505
Am I a joke to you?

770
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,929
I came because I didn't want things
to get out of hand. Just go.

771
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,379
I wanted to tell you how I feel.

772
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,085
So everything I heard until now
had nothing to do with your feelings?

773
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,625
Yes.

774
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,175
Please give me a chance.

No.

776
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,945
I don't want to hear this.
I won't be fooled anymore.

777
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,415
Telling you how I feel

778
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,845
is awkward and difficult for me

779
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,035
because I worry that you'll hate me.

780
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,955
Because love is something
you have to earn.

781

When I saw you have a hard time
with your crush

782
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,385
it felt like I was seeing myself.

783
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,565
I wanted to see that you couldn't
succeed even if you try

784
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,985
when I couldn't give up myself.

785

I thought I had control over everything

786
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,135
when I had no idea
I couldn't even control my feelings.

787

What are your feelings?

788
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,725
The moment I saw your tears I realized

789
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,285
what I did was wrong.

790
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,785
I realized if the girl I like is in pain,
it hurts me too.

791
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,265
I never knew that before.

792

If you're going to be informal,
just keep being informal.

Do you remember collapsing
at the construction site?

815

They said you have malnutrition.

816

Didn't you hear me? You have malnutrition.

817

I don't care.

818

I'm going to call your brother and mother.

819
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,119
I heard that
you told them not to call your family

820
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,625
when you were rushed to the ER.

821

What are you doing here?

822
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,935
I called you and a nurse
at the hospital picked up.

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,415
I guess it's because my life sucks.

I don't even have time
to think about things like that,
