00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:32,320
= Episode 39 =

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Jia Shi assigned Su Mucheng on the last round of Arena Contest.

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
The league's top Launcher versus the master of first generation.

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,480
It's a battle between gunpowder and magic.

6
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,320
How will the Arena Contest end?

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,480
We'll see in the game.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Some tactical adjustments were made on the spot.

9
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
It's normal.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,840
Be cool about it.

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
Since Mucheng is wearing Jia Shi's uniform

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
sitting on Jia Shi's player seat,

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,040
it means that you're ready

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
to fight for Jia Shi.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't think too much.

16
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,320
Mr. Tao,

17
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,200
You're putting her in a dilemma.

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,680
You choose Mucheng to play

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
in such a sensitive match,

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
She would be suspected

21
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
even though she wants to win

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,280
but just lose the game normally.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,760
Then play well

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,760
if she doesn't want that.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
But when it comes to games like this,

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,040
if you dig out the details with preconceived,

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,000
Any operation that isn't in place

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
will be seemed as intentional.

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
She has only one option,

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,720
win.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
That's just what we want.

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
The last Arena Contest,

33
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Jia Shi assigned the top Launcher

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Su Mucheng to challenge the veteran,

35
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
Wei Chen, the winner of last round.

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,800
Captain Yu, what do you think of this game?

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
Both teams' players are

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
experienced and mature.

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,720
They both know each other well.

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,080
And they operate long-handed professions

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
that are good at long-distance consumption.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
This could have been

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
a close game.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,400
But captain Wei lost nearly half of his blood last round,

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
and has consumed too much HP,

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
this should be a tough fight for him.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
Well, we all know that

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Su Mucheng didn't renew her contract with Jia Shi,

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
it is said that

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
they may not cooperate.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,040
But Jia Shi assigned her

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,200
in such a crucial competition,

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
we have no idea what

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
the tactical arrangement of the Jia Shi Team is.

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,000
Game begins.

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
There seems to be a change

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
in the style of Dancing Rain.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Sister Su didn't start

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
like her style at all.

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,520
Why did Su Mucheng move

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,200
completely different from before?

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
She's not really going to let him win, right?

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,880
No, she won't.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't give up your professional honor

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,240
for helping Ye Qiu.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm just saying that women aren't good enough.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
She's just not tough enough.

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Dancing Rain keeps moving her position

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,120
to find the opponent,

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Windward Formation keeps quiet,

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
he did not rush out.

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,600
Windward Formation's HP is in great disadvantage,

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,560
it's right to choose a more conservative way.

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Dancing Rain mounted gun.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,520
Captain Yu,

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
How do you evaluate the opening

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,560
of Su Mucheng's blocking.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
The style of her blocking has really changed.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,000
She no longer makes long-distance outflank,

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
but in a more aggressive way.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,120
We can see that

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
Windward Formation begins to move his position.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
He's finding Dancing Rain's position.

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Su Mucheng still occupies a high place,

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,880
She has a very wide vision.

86
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
But she's easy to be discovered.

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
They are all long-distance professions.

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
It is better to

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
find the opponent first

90
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
and hold the upper hand.

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Windward Formation seems to have found her opponent.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,840
He starts to release Arrow of Curse.

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Hasn't Dancing rain found him yet?

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,440
Found him.

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
The fire is too strong.

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,880
Windward Formation can't keep casting magic

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
and begins to find shelters.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,880
But Dancing rain's marksmanship was too precise.

99
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Every bullet is restricting

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,360
the position of Windward Formation.

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,760
That's too violent.

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,400
Go wild.

103
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,840
Su Mucheng's attack rhythm

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,920
for Launcher is almost perfect.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
Her skills convergence and output cycle

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
are the textbook of Launcher of Glory.

107
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
But captain Wei's dodging

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,840
is just so-so.

109
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,040
He has to find a interval between her attacks,

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,760
releases the skills,

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
But Su Mucheng did not give him

112
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,360
such an opportunity at all.

113
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,200
Sure enough,

114
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
Dancing rain makes full use of

115
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,040
the advantages of high spot,

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,520
her attack was too wide-ranging.

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
Windward Formation is in danger.

118
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Sister Su is so strong.

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
The series multi-skill of Mounted Gun,

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Few people in the league can do it.

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Using the recoil of skills and common attack

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,920
to adjust her position and dodge the skills,

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
She's stronger than we can imagine.

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,840
It's rare for a female player

125
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
to play so powerfully and brilliantly.

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
They are fighting to the limit.

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
Sister Su, come on!

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm sure Wei will win.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
Dancing Rain is still accurately output

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
in the course of positioning.

131
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,040
Nice.

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Her skills hit the target after floating in the air.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
Windward Formation's HP is empty.

134
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
The final of Arena Contest,

135
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
Su Mucheng wins.

136
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,880
Congratulations on Su Mucheng.

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Congratulations on Jia Shi.

138
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,000
So as the final of Arena Contest,

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,280
We can see that Su Mucheng is

140
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,840
as powerful as male player,

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,880
and we also saw Wei Chen's persistence and elegance.

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you for bringing us

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,840
such a wonderful game,

144
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
and letting us feel

145
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,840
the glorious spirit behind the game.

146
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,480
That little girl

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,960
really grew up.

148
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
The young people are really something.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
We old people have to catch up.

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,480
Su Muchueng won the game.

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Congratulations on Su Mucheng. Congratulations on Jia Shi.

152
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,080
# You are as always #

# I am as always #

155
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
This is the end of

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
my relationship with Jia Shi.

157
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,440
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,440
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

159

Stay,

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,920
and play well.

176
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
For our Jia Shi,

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,160
for our

178
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,600
ten years.

179
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,920
We can't be teammates in tomorrow's game.

180
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
We can't play together as a team

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
in the later game, right?

182
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
Xing Xin and Jia Shi

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,760
will eventually meet in the Challenge.

184
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,200
Then,

185
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,200
welcome to be an opponent.

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,080
I still want to be

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,440
your fifth best partner

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
rather than an opponent.

189
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
But,

190
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
How long will it take

191
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
to fight together again?

192
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
# We will go together and shake the world #

193
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:45,880
# We will go together to the legend #

194
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm Su Mucheng.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
Today, I officially returned to the team.

196
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,440
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

197
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,080
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

198
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,440
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

199
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

200
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,840
It seems that

201
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,240
I've really been away for a long time.

202
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Leave it to me then.

203
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,960
# I have seen the legend before. #

204
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,200
The Arena Contest is over.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
The score of Jia Shi to Xing Xin is 10 to 8.

206
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,320
The total score is 34 to 29.

207
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,360
Jia Shi entered the Team Competition

208
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
with a five-point lead.

209
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,080
Captain Yu and Shaotian, please have some rest.

210
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Suit yourself.

211
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,680
OK.

212
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,720
I don't know

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
what your sponsor's thinking about,

214
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
they ask Wang Jiexi to comment on

215
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
the Team Competition.

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
That guy has two different eye pixels,

217
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,520
I really doubt if he can see

218
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,320
the broadcast screen clearly then.

219
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,480
You're here.

220
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,920
It's doesn't matter whether I can see it clearly,

221
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,360
but I saw clearly the game that

222
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,480
Wei Cao eliminated Lan Yu.

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,840
Of course

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
you can see that clearly,

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,240
because you are in good health,

226
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,960
you pay attention to the health care,

227
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
An old man like you

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
drinks such bitter things.

229
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
We young people all drink sweets.

230
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm really worried about you suffer from the bitter

231
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,680
from the throat to the tips of your toes.

232
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,240
It's bitter in the mouth after drinking tea,

233
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,960
but it's bitter in your heart

234
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,680
after losing the game.

235
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Do you think I made a good point,

236
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,840
anchor Pan?

237
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,160
I think... I have no idea.

238
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm thirsty.

239
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
Well, wasn't Wei Cao

240
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,440
also blocked by Ambitions before the finals?

241
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,160
My coffee is as bitter

242
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,960
as your tea.

243
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,040
If Wei Cao play with Ambitions one more time,

244
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
they may not win.

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,240
Captain Han.

246
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Anything to drink?

247
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,720
Water.

248
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Nothing else?

249
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,040
The water is so ordinary,

250
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
nothing new.

251
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,800
It's normal for Ambitions to win,

252
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,920
there's no need for new ideas.

253
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
Captain Wang just said that

254
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
Ambitions doesn't necessarily win Wei Cao,

255
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
what do you think, anchor Pan?

256
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
What... what do I think...

257
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,280
I... I...

258
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,360
I've got a phone call.

259
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,600
You guys go on.

260
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,280
Hello, director Li,

261
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,920
when on earth will you come back?

262
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,000
The exciting Team Competition is about to begin.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
If you think the Arena Contest is not enough,

264
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,760
You'll have the privilege of witnessing a brilliant confrontation

265
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
between the two great tacticians,

266
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,800
Xiao Shiqin and Ye Qiu.

267
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,280
Will the steady master of detail dominate the situation,

268
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,640
or the genius Freelancer with frequent tricks

269
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,480
control the game?

270
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,880
Let's see it in the game.

271
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
There's five-point difference between Xing Xin and Jia Shi,

272
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,320
It's not easy to comeback.

273
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,843
It is very likely that

274
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,240
Jia Shi will continue their victorious pursuit.

275
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,440
Every player is eager to win.

276
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,040
Especially those veterans

277
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,720
who have countless games left.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,920
Go to the victory,

279
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,040
or go to the end.

280
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,760
Now both teams please take your place.

281
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Lao Ye.

282
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,400
Lao Ye come on! Lao Ye come on!

283
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Audience friends,

284
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,840
The final of Challenge of Glory,

285
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,480
Team Competition between Xing Xin and Jia Shi

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,280
will begin soon.

287
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,640
All players have entered the battle room.

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
After the Arena Contest,

289
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Jia Shi is five points ahead of

290
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,520
Xing Xin in total points.

291
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,640
For Xing Xin,

292
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
if they want to win the championship,

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
this Team Competition...

294
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Back to Alliance,

295
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
enjoy the game.

296
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
OK. All the characters enter the map.

297
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,760
The game officially starts.

298
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
Xing Xin's opening formation was well maintained

299
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,000
under Ye Qiu's command.

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
The purpose of the positioning is clear.

301
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,080
This is very important

302
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,160
in Team Competition.

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,640
Right. We can see that

304
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,040
after Xiao Shiqin's joining,

305
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,000
Tactical discipline

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,160
has also been improved.

307
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,480
Tactical positioning.

308
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,960
The formation of Jia Shi begins to change.

309
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
They don't want to get in touch with Xing Xin too early,

310
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
although they are still far away...

311
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,520
Plan B.

312
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
...they are still cautious about their position.

313
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,640
Well,

314
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,960
tactical positioning was adopted on both teams at the beginning.

315
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,240
Every detail before the two teams

316
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,120
meat each other is crucial

317
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
in such a game.

318
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
Jia Shi stops moving at this point.

319
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,040
We see that

320
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,440
Xing Xin also stops moving.

321
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,200
Master Jiexi,

322
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
what do you think of this?

323
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,720
Xiao Shiqin and Ye Qiu are

324
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
both experienced commanders.

325
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
They know very well that

326
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
taking the lead in discovering the opponent

327
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,280
will have some advantages.

328
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
Therefore, quiet approaching

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and find the opportunity is preferred.

330
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
We are suddenly enlightened

331
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
after Master Jiexi's explanation.

332
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,640
Jun Moxiao suddenly fired a shot.

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,040
This way.

334
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,080
Jia Shi will judge Xing Xing's position

335
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,320
according to the sound of shot.

336
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Ye Qiu deliberately sent out signals to the opponent.

337
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,440
This is part of the tactics.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,320
Turn left.

339
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,040
Xing Xin immediately

340
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,200
began to move quickly.

341
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,520
Another shot.

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
Jia Shi immediately stopped moving.

343
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
They haven't met yet,

344
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,480
But both the tacticians

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
have begun to compete.

346
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,080
The third shot.

347
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,320
The three shots came from

348
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
three different directions.

349
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
It's a diversion.

350
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,840
They split up into two teams.

351
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,920
Jun Moxiao must go alone.

352
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,520
Let's hit it.

353
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,000
Sun Xiang and Qiu Fei plug in,

354
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,840
I bet you catch up with Jun Moxiao.

355
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Copy that.

356
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,440
We see that Jia Shi has branched out into two teams.

357
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,560
Combat Form is with Leaf of Autumn,

358
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
the other three are together.

359
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,800
Xiao Shiqin found the target according to

360
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,440
- the time and location of the shot. - Found him.

361
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,800
Leaf of Autumn found

362
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
Jun Moxiao alone.

363
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
Assign two Battlemages to chase me,

364
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,040
what an amazing intuition.

365
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,480
The diversion is working.

366
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,480
Now it's double pin down time.

367
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
I dragged their two main players.

368
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,880
Those three guys are up to you four.

369
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,360
Copy that.

370
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,120
The battlefield is now divided.

371
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Jun Moxiao confront with

372
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,960
Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form alone,

373
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,000
Xing Xin's absolute core

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
separated from his teammates,

375
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,640
Jia Shi obviously won't let go of

376
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,520
this opportunity easily.

377
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,320
On the other side, Xing Xin's playing four on three,

378
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,200
but it will not be difficult for Jia Shi

379
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,160
to have Xiao Shiqin in the battle.

380
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
Now Leaf of Autumn catches up with Jun Moxiao.

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,440
Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

382
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
Jun Moxiao is blown up.

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,960
Meanwhile, Combat Form has arrived.

384
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,640
Jun Moxiao is intercepted.

385
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,200
No way.

386
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
You've learned all I taught.

387
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,840
How dare you intercept me here?

388
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,800
I dare to do

389
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,080
anything to win.

390
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
It's Shadow Tactic.

391
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,920
Combat Form

392
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,320
becomes Leaf of Autumn's wingman.

393
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Jun Moxiao was trapped

394
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,080
under the attack of those two.

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,080
Sun Xiang,

396
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
don't you like solo?

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,920
This is Team Competition.

398
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,560
I think in this era of stars,

399
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,760
very few teams

400
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,040
will use this tactic.

401
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
Today Qiu Fei's performance

402
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,680
makes us reconsider

403
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,920
what is the real Shadow Tactic.

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,640
Where's he?

405
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,360
Shadow Separation.

406
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,720
Jun Moxiao suddenly disappeared.

407
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,840
Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form start seeking.

408
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,543
The launching scope of Shadow Separation

409
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,240
is fifteen position unit.

410
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
He won't go too far.

411
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,560
Sun Xiang and Qiu Fei judged that

412
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,160
the location of Shadow Separation won't be too far.

413
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
They continue to seek for him.

414
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,760
But we can see that Master Ye Qiu's dodging

415
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
is very smart,

416
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
he hasn't been found yet.

417
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,000
Jun Moxiao's HP has been consumed

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,680
by 70% at present.

419
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,920
The whole state is quite passive.

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Dragon Soaring.

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Too decisive.

422
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
Mechanical Rotor, dodging in the air,

423
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
and found Combat Form at his convenience.

424
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,440
Cloud Seize.

425
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,200
Your Shadow Tactic

426
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
is not flawless at all.

427
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,640
This is an opportunity, Ye Qiu counterattacked.

428
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,760
You're the support,

429
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,400
why do you stand in the way of mine?

430
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,920
What are you dawdling behind?

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
Put up or shut up.

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
Fine.

433
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,600
Ye Qiu seized the opportunity to disrupt

434
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,760
the main attacker position and the attack rhythm of support.

435
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
Sun Xiang was forced to stand in the support Position.

436
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Qiu Fei could not stop Ye Qiu's attack.

437
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
It's not so easy to break through.

438
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,960
Shadow Tacti has not just one main attacker position.

439
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,280
Such a pity.

440
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
Your tactic didn't work.

441
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Xiao Shiqin told us that

442
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,840
you make the diversion,

443
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,920
we'll beat you at your own game.

444
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
Everyone else in Xing Xin is a piece of loose sand

445
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,840
as long as we hold you back.

446
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,440
Yifan. They are in danger.

447
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,120
Be careful of the traps.

448
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Let's turn our attention to the other part of the battlefield.

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
It's bounding mine.

450
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,800
Most players of Xing Xin

451
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,720
has been ambushed by Jia Shi.

452
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,840
It's the bounding mine arranged by Sheng Lingmie.

453
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,680
They are nearby.

454
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Be aware.

455
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
Xing Xin doesn't lack of harm face to face,

456
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,520
Their best choice is

457
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,640
to focus on fighting the Cleric Woven Shadow.

458
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,720
meanwhile they must pay attention

459
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,560
not to rush forward, or they'll be sneak attacked.

460
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,080
Found Woven Shadow.

461
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,960
Catch him up.

462
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,372
Han Yanrou's Dragon Breaks the Ranks

463
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,280
is intercepted by Successive Strike.

464
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,840
Woven Shadow counterattacks.

465
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,360
Han Yanrou, Yi Cunhui,

466
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,400
Bao Zi, the Invader are all consumed.

467
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
Xiao Shiqin had long anticipated that

468
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Xing Xin will try her best to kill the Cleric...

469
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,480
Nice.

470
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,400
...and laid out a counter-attack strategy in advance.

471
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,320
Jia Shi is constantly accumulating advantages.

472
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,960
Right. Let's see.

473
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,120
After this fight,

474
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
Xing Xin team lost a lot of HP.

475
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
Only 70% left.

476
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,400
Xing Xin is at a disadvantage in both battlefields.

477
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
Someone needs to help Jun Moxiao out of trouble.

478
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,880
Yes.

479
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,880
We can see that Jun Moxiao is still

480
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,760
entangled by the two Battlemages of Jia Shi.

481
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,480
When you get back to your teammates,

482
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
they're all dead.

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm wrong.

484
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,720
you won't go back.

485
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Critical moment.

486
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,200
He hit Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form.

487
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,680
They all fell to the ground straight and stiff.

488
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,120
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

489
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,640
Thanks.

490
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Wu Chen.

491
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,160
Xing Xin indeed holds back a trick.

492
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
It took some time to climb up.

493
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Nice timing.

494
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,760
Next,

495
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,960
it's your turn, Lian Jin.

496
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,120
Copy that.

497
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
Launcher who occupies high spot without any interference,

498
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,920
It's horrible.

499
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,320
Dawn Rifle continupusly releases the skills.

500
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,920
The dodging of Sheng Lingmie and Woven Shadow is restricted.

501
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,280
They are very passive.

502
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,000
The Counterattack Begins.

503
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,920
He killed Successive Strike with a series of skills.

504
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,200
Jia Shi lost one person.

505
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,240
This is Ye Qiu's Screen Gun Tactic

506
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,120
founded in Jia Shi.

507
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
Today Xing Xin suppressed Jia Shi

508
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,280
with this classical tactic.

509
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
This is undoubtedly another

510
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
psychological strike to Jia Shi.

511
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,080
Now it seems that

512
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,440
Xing Xin is more like a former Jia Shi.

513
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,160
Exactly.

514
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,240
Now the momentum of Xing Xin

515
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,760
has undoubtedly reached to the top.

516
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
Long live Xing Xin!

517
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,400
Long live Xing Xin!

518
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,160
We can't lose to them.

519
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
Jia Shi will win!

520
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,400
Long live Xing Xin!

521
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,320
Jia Shi! Jia Shi!

522
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Jiaxing, pay attention to our HP.

523
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,360
Sharpshooter, prepare for support.

524
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,960
Copy that.

525
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,840
On my way.

526
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,760
We can see that

527
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
Jia Shi's substitute Matchstick is in.

528
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Baozi, Tang Rou.

529
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,600
The coordination is 373 480.

530
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,280
Climb over directly,

531
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,000
kill the Cleric.

532
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Understood.

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
Jia Shi's substitute is in,

534
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,280
and will arrive in half a minute.

535
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,280
Senior Wu Chen,

536
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
captain will arrive one and a half minutes.

537
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,160
Understood.

538
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,200
One and a half minutes.

539
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,760
I'll stall their Sharpshooter.

540
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,800
Well, in order to intercept Matchstick,

541
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,080
Dawn Rifle gives up the advantage of long-range,

542
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,760
and fight close with Matchstick.

543
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,960
Matchstick makes full use of

544
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
sharpshooter's flexible advantage,

545
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
Keep dodging and finding shelters.

546
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,600
This is what Xing Xin would like to see very much.

547
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,040
If Matchstick doesn't return quickly,

548
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,280
Xing Xin will fight one man more,

549
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,240
and kill Jia Shi's Cleric.

550
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,880
What are you doing? Come over quickly.

551
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,400
On the way.

552
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,000
The Launcher of Xing Xin

553
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,960
keeps following me.

554
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,800
It's obvious that

555
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,160
Matchstick is suffering from Dawn Rifle's stalling.

556
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
His teammates are also under a lot of pressure.

557
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,320
It has to be said that

558
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
his performance so far has been crucial.

559
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,360
He is the greatest contributor

560
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,720
to Xing Xin's advantage.

561
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,520
Exactly.

562
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
The Launcher operated by Wu Chen

563
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
is too aggressive,

564
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
he dares to stick close to the Sharpshooter.

565
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
We know Launchers would suffer a lot in close combat.

566
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,800
This is the tactic. he chose to entangle his opponent.

567
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,200
My god. Launcher fight me close.

568
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,120
Is he crazy?

569
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,040
It's not like

570
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,880
a duel between

571
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,520
two Launchers at all.

572
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,480
He's trading his own HP consumption for time

573
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
to hold his opponent back.

574
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,120
Is this man crazy?

575
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,600
Matchstick seizes the opportunity, headshot.

576
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
Dawn Rifle is in danger.

577
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,920
Baozi,

578
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,400
hold on,

579
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,240
Healing the low HP.

580
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,040
Don't worry about me.

581
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,840
You cover Tang.

582
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,840
Ten more seconds.

583
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,160
Be there in nine seconds.

584
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
Hang in there.

585
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Dawn Rifle and Matchstick have turned white-hot

586
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
on the other side of the battlefield.

587
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,000
They both aim each other.

588
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,600
Nice.

589
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,160
Dawn Rifle is killed first.

590
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,600
Wait.

591
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,960
Dawn Rifle launched his skill at the last minute,

592
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
there's no time for Matchstick to dodge, he's killed, too.

593
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,480
Master Jiexi,

594
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Can you give us an analysis of

595
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,240
the current situation on the battlefield?

596
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,360
These techniques are critical.

597
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,000
Dawn Rifle successfully killed Matchstick,

598
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
mission is beautifully accomplished.

599
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Now Jia Shi's substitute has been killed,

600
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,920
Xing Xin's substitute Cleric, Cold Hands

601
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:24,971
will soon join the battlefield.

602
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,200
= You've killed by Matchstick. =
will soon join the battlefield.

603
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,749
= You've killed by Matchstick. =
Then,

604
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:26,880
Then,

605
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,560
I'll leave it to you guys.

606
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,120
Wu Chen,

607
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,000
great game.

608
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
He killed Woven Shadow with a close hit.

609
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,480
Long live Xing Xin.

610
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,120
Ye Qiu is the master.

611
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,640
Xing Xin goes a step further,

612
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,200
They've killed three people, the situation is very good.

613
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,880
Then,

614
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
leave it to us.

615
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
So far Xing Xin still has five people left in the battlefield.

616
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,040
Jia Shi only has three left.

617
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Xing Xin's Launcher gave up the long-range advantage,

618
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,880
took away Jia Shi's Sharpshooter

619
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,280
with himself,

620
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,440
won over lots of time for the team.

621
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,320
It can be said that

622
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,120
he is the match point in this game.

623
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,320
Moreover, Jun Moxiao arrived in time,

624
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,760
helped the team kill Jia Shi's Cleric.

625
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,640
Now Jia Shi lost three in row,

626
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,800
the situation is far from good.

627
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
But why did captain Xiao

628
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
send the two main players out?

629
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,440
If it weren't two main players,

630
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
Jia Shi can't hold Ye Qiu back.

631
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,400
But captain Xiao thought

632
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,160
the winning point was Ye Qiu,

633
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,880
He didn't expect the other players

634
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,120
in Xing Xin to grow up so fast.

635
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,880
Even the newcomer Qiao Yifan

636
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,520
can take the lead.

637
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,920
Xiao Shiqin,

638
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,960
you are poor of HP,

639
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
I say you just surrender.

640
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,800
If that makes captain Ye happy.

641
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,640
Sheng Lingmie stops suddenly.

642
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,520
Does the tactician still have any trick?

643
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,160
The situation is too tense.

644
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,640
Any operational details can make

645
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,920
a world-shaking change in the situation.

646
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Sheng Lingmie is self-destructing.

647
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,280
Stand back.

648
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,640
An instantaneous explosion.

649
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,440
It's a self-destruction.

650
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,560
Xiao Shiqin let the situation reverse directly.

651
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
It's amazing.

652
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,120
The points before with the points of Arena Contest,

653
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,080
Xing Xin has to remain

654
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,840
three players to win.

655
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,680
Han Yanrou, Yi Cunhui,

656
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,400
Bao Zi, the Invader are all low HP,

657
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,560
if Sheng Lingmie's self-destruction

658
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,640
can kill all three,

659
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,600
Jia Shi will win the game in advance.

660
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Let's see

661
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,560
the effect of this self-destruction.

662
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,800
Yi Cunhui's out.

663
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
Bao Zi, the Invader is out.

664
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,480
Han Yanrou's HP is only 5% left.

665
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,920
How did she survive?

666
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,320
Come on!

667
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,360
Come on! Come on! Come on!

668
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,600
Han Yanrou's HP is nearly empty,

669
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,760
we can win in advance if we hit her.

670
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,920
Combat Form and Leaf of Autumn

671
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,160
are chasing after Han Yanrou,

672
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,640
Leaf of Autumn intercepts.

673
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,720
A Freelancer and a Battlemage

674
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,280
versus two other battlemages.

675
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,760
Jia Shi concentrates attack on Han Yanrou,

676
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,040
whose HP is only 5% left.

677
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,680
Xing Xin conducts a desperate struggle.

678
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,280
Tang Rou.

679
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,480
Two minutes and fifty-eight seconds left.

680
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,200
They have to be aced.

681
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
We have to remain three people.

682
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,160
Tang, hang in there.

683
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,600
Understood.

684
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,800
Nice.

685
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,240
Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart. He hit Han Yanrou.

686
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
Jun Moxiao's healing

687
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,480
is almost at the same time.

688
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,560
Han Yanrou's little HP goes up again.

689
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,880
It remains at 1%.

690
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,040
Magic Shield.

691
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,400
Han Yanrou didn't give up the chance to attack

692
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,360
while she's HP is almost empty.

693
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,960
Keep consuming.

694
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,960
Let's kill her now.

695
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
As Jun Moxiao battles his opponent,

696
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
he needs to find a chance

697
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,680
to heal Han Yanrou.

698
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
Only Ye Qiu can do this.

699
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,560
But now Jun Moxiao's healing skills

700
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,720
are all cooling down.

701
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,640
He won't save Han Yanrou this time.

702
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,800
Now no one can save you.

703
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,320
Leaf of Autumn hits back Han Yanrou.

704
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,040
Danger.

705
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,920
She still has 1% HP left.

706
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,600
How could this happen?

707
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,760
It's Cold Hands.

708
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,680
Xing Xin's substitute Cleric arrived

709
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,600
at time at the critical moment.

710
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,360
Everyone,

711
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,560
sorry for the waiting.

712
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
How about it?

713
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,440
Even if I'm worse,

714
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm Xing Xin's Cleric.

715
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,440
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

716
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
# sailing with the wind and converge into the Milky Way #

717
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,240
# standing on the top and claiming that #

718
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,560
# We will regain our glory #

719
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,600
# Push the clouds aside and shine the light #

720
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,080
The Team Competition is drawing to an end.

721
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,480
The last sixty seconds.

722
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,593
Will Xing Xin tries their best

723
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:29,760
to turn back the situation and win,

724
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,400
or Jia Shi makes a breakthrough and defend the Glory?

725
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,320
# The past overlaps the present #

726
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,200
# The glory we've missed #

727
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,000
# The pride in the future #

728
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,240
# Intertwined between the fingers #

729
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,800
# Composing the great song of battlefield #

730
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,440
# The only light during the long night #

731
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,880
# Is us from the ordinary life #

732
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,760
Kill Combat Form.

733
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,160
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

734
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,600
# We are the brightest fireflies #

735
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,360
# I came from the past and will write the future #

736
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,560
Go for it.

737
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,080
Go for it, Tang.

738
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,440
Long live Xing Xin!

739
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,080
Hold out!

740
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,800
All of you, hold out!

741
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Leave them to me.

742
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,120
Don't hold back.

743
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,360
Go straight up.

744
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,800
Do you know what you're talking about?

745
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,040
Our goal is to win the championship.

746
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,240
It's not the win or lose of the game.

747
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,080
Do you know that?

748
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,480
Tang,

749
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,040
run.

750
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
Now Han Yanrou's HP is only 10%.

751
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
Cold Hands' HP

752
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,240
is only 30%.

753
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,560
Hit them.

754
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,920
But Combat Form's last skill,

755
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
Destroying the World,

756
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,160
consumes too much.

757
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
Jun Moxiao wants to support,

758
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
but it's too late.

759
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,600
Han Yanrou, Cold Hands and Combat Form's

760
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
HP are all empty.

761
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,440
# We are the brightest fireflies #

762
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,920
So now the two teams are tied in the Team Competition.

763
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
But the totol points of Xing Xin is still

764
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,000
five points behind Jia Shi.

765
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,040
Even if Jia Shi is aced by Xing Xin and gains points,

766
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,240
Xing Xin will still lose by one point.

767
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,000
In other words,

768
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,240
Jia Shi has already locked in the championship.
