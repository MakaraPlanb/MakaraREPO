00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,660
= The King's Avatar =

2
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,300
= Episode 23 =

3
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,390
It's Yifan's email.

4
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,070
Deploying Killing Every Ten Steps failed.

5
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,510
Wei Cao Team mainly took the method of attack,

6
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,950
supplemented by debuff.

7
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
It's rival was aced quickly.

8
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,070
Yunxuan Pavilion,

9
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,950
no one survived.

10
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,830
Overtime.

11
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,190
Miracle,

12
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,070
one survived.

13
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,630
It took 28 minutes 51 seconds.

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,390
These are the teams that just played with Wei Cao.

15
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,870
Yes.

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,550
It seems that Yifan arrived at the scene very early.

17
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,510
And he also did a lot of research in advance.

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,510
I'll find him.

19
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,150
Me too.

20
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,950
That's fine.

21
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,590
If he doesn't want to play,

22
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,430
it still doesn't make sense

23
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,190
that we force him back.

24
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,110
Where are you going?

25
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,670
The game is begining.

26
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,270
Who are you?

27
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,390
Do you remember that scrap-pick?

28
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,670
You robbed Praisage of too much equipment.

29
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,030
At first I thought you were a master.

30
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,910
But, after some research, I found out

31
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,430
that you are a newbie.

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,430
You can't even dispell debuff,

33
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,190
and need to find game leveling.

34
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,430
I am curious to know

35
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,110
how you cheated everyone during this time.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,190
But, I'm more curious about

37
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,710
when so many people watch you to paly,

38
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,110
what will you do?

39
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,910
Who are you?

40
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,630
Take it easy.

41
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,350
I just came to make a deal with you.

42
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,350
How?

43
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,190
That's simple.

44
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,630
As long as you play negatively,

45
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,470
and let Xing Xin Team lose the game,

46
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,990
how much they pay you,

47
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,830
I will pay you double.

48
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,830
As a student in the finance department,

49
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,470
you know that this is the best deal.

50
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,830
You've got the offer.

51
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,390
Why you still saty in a team without future?

52
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,950
Don't you tell me

53
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,990
that you're gonna help them,

54
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,270
and you want to be one of them.

55
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,070
Are you done?

56
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,030
What I should do.

57
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,710
It's none of your business.

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,270
If I tell everyone

59
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,630
about your game leveling,

60
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,270
what will they do to you?

61
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,270
Either

62
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,430
you get our payment,

63
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,390
or

64
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,950
you lose all reputation.

65
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,430
Here are two roads,

66
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,750
that you can choose.

67
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,670
We get together as a team,

68
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,350
only for one goal,

69
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,550
to become real Glory professional players.

70
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,070
Now, the goal is already in sight,

71
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,390
are you really going to get cold feet?

72
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,270
If you don't want to give up,

73
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,550
now play with me

74
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,310
seriously
.

75
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,270
Captain.

76
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,750
You are hesitating.

77
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,350
Do you want to play or escape?

78
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,590
Make up your mind.

79
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,990
I don't want to hesitate.

80
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,230
Once more.

81
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,590
What comes from hesitation

82
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,510
is to be contained.

83
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,630
I don't want to be contained.

84
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,910
Continue.

85
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,070
You were dominant in the game,

86
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,430
now you are very passive.

87
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,990
Captain.

88
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,670
I don't want to be passive.

89
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,470
What do you want?

90
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,390
I want...

91
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,350
I want to win.

92
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,270
The only way is

93
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,790
to fight against me.

94
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,070
Yifan.

95
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,310
What are you afraid of?

96
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,470
I'm afraid...

97
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,470
I am afraid that I cannot take responsibility.

98
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,830
I am afraid that we lose the game

99
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,070
because of me.

100
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,030
I'm afraid...

101
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,990
that let you down.

102
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,670
# as usual, I #

103
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,830
# I haven't change my mind #

104
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,630
# as usual, you #

105
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,510
I 'm sorry.

106
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,470
Captain.

107
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,270
I disappointed you.

108
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,150
# as usual, I #

109
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,150
Yifan.

110
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,550
Glory

111
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,790
never was and won't be a game for one person.

112
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,830
# Unwilling to mediocrity #

113
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,630
# Not limitied by the success #

114
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,550
We are waiting for you.

115
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,750
# We've agreed to meet again one day #

116
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,910
# I'll coming back with a larger scale than I left #

117
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,190
# Floating with the stream, #

118
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,990
# Standing at the peak of the star, #

119
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,470
# At that moment, I finally understand me of the past, #

120
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,310
# Always being my own hero. #

121
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,630
# I once saw the legend. #

122
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,590
I am back.

123
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,070
Welcome to the live internet broadcast

124
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,830
of the 9th Tutor Selection of Glory.

125
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,510
The Tutor Selection is the basic screening

126
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,870
in the Glory Professional Alliance.

127
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,150
Yes, it's more like a teaching guidance

128
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,070
than a competition.

129
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,430
The strong team in the Professional Alliance serves as a mentor.

130
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,590
Every members of the challenge team

131
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,870
needs to complete the task of crossing the finish line.

132
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,950
under the interception of the instructor.

133
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,310
Within the set time,

134
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,110
one person crossing the line counts a point,

135
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,110
and finally ranks according to the points.

136
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,910
Captain.

137
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,790
Isn't yifan supposed to fight today?

138
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,110
Is he too stressed out

139
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,310
to fight against Wei Cao Team?

140
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,270
During two seasons in Wei Cao Team,

141
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,710
Yifan was very competitive all the time.

142
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,310
Although he didn't have a chance to participate in the official competition,

143
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,990
he never stops to

144
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,990
compete with himself.

145
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,110
Will he come this time?

146
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,950
If he is a professional player,

147
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,670
he will come.

148
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,910
The last member of Xing Xin Team has finished the roll-call.

149
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,030
Another highlight of today

150
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,150
is that Master Ye Qiu

151
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,230
enabled a new account, Jun Moxiao.

152
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,150
And he chose Freelancer as his prefession.

153
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,030
That's true. Freelancer means no profession.

154
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,910
The only thing he can rely on

155
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,510
is the homemade weapon in his hand, A Thousand-Machine Umbrella.

156
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,870
His weapon can transfer its form

157
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,910
according to 24 different professions

158
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,430
which are under level 20

159
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,910
before they change theire profession,

160
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,190
which means 120 kinds all together.

161
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,110
So in other words,

162
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,190
It can change every shapes without cooling.

163
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,550
Both advantages and disadvantages are obvious.

164
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,550
His umbrella is extremely difficult to use.

165
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,310
Let us look forward to Master Ye Qiu

166
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,070
to watch how he plays around with  every profession.

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,590
Tutor Selestion First round

168
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,390
Xing Xin Team VS. Wei Cao Team.

169
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,790
The game is about to begin.

170
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,830
Members of Xing Xin Team,

171
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,990
can they reach the destination safely,

172
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,030
and win their first game.

173
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,470
Game starts now.

174
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,110
Xing Xin Team members marched forward

175
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,390
under the leadership of Jun Moxiao.

176
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,670
At present, all members of Xing Xin Team

177
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,990
has completed 3%.

178
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,750
I want to know

179
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,270
how Wei Cao Team will arrange interception tactics.

180
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,950
I think,

181
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,110
According to the style of Wei Cao Team,

182
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,110
their captain, Wang Jiexi

183
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,990
will surely find the most suitable position

184
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,710
to do the ambush.

185
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,590
In the Kongzhi Forest.

186
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,430
lives many kinds of trees,

187
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,590
which is a perfect place for ambush.

188
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,430
Xing Xin Team is progressing smoothly

189
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,830
and has not encountered any obstacles for now.

190
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,630
Snapshoting.

191
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,830
Wei Cao really did ambush.

192
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,190
The Sharpshooter strikes first.

193
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,230
Lava flask.

194
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,230
Mu En follows.

195
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,070
By releasing skills to contain movement of Xing Xin Team,

196
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,990
Wei Cao Team seize the initiative.

197
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,990
Xing Xin's situation is not optimistic.

198
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,710
This will seriously delay their progress.

199
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,390
Team HP  is gradually being consumed.

200
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,430
Xing Xin is fighting back.

201
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,910
In this bad situation,

202
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,950
this is their only way.

203
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,590
Nice cutthroat.

204
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,750
Successful sneak attack by Jun Moxiao.

205
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,510
Magic bomb.

206
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,590
He is a Magician indeed.

207
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,430
He can still fight back when he is attacked.

208
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,150
Yes, we can see

209
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,670
that Yi Cunhui is adjusting his position.

210
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,510
The scene is steady.

211
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,630
The two sides are into a stalemate.

212
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,670
Wei Cao surrounds Xing Xin.

213
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,110
But they are not in a hurry to start the next round of attack.

214
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,230
The scene is not good for Xing Xin Team.

215
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,110
If Xing Xin is dragged here,

216
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,390
their progress will be seriously affected.

217
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,550
And there is no advantage in Xing Xin's HP.

218
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,150
We are cut off.

219
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,430
Now the progress of all members of Xing Xin is 25 percent.

220
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,590
The Wei Cao Team

221
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,390
is looking for a chance

222
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,750
to start a new round of attack.

223
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,550
Wei Cao Team has two Witches.

224
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,470
They have strong mobility.

225
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,630
If Xng Xin is held back,

226
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,310
it will be hard to get out.

227
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,910
Only by dragging two Witches,

228
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,510
can we get to the finish line.

229
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,350
I

230
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,910
Can I do it?

231
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,110
I' ll hold him off.

232
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,390
Yifan.

233
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,950
Are you all right by yourself?

234
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,990
Of course.

235
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,510
No problem.

236
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,110
We find out

237
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,310
Xing Xin leave Yi Cunhui alone.

238
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,470
Others starts running in the map.

239
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,230
Nice!

240
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,030
Yi Cunhui is deploying the Ghost Array on the tree.

241
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,350
He is a  very thoughtful player.

242
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,390
This idea of interception

243
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,110
is very creative.

244
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,510
The restriction for Wang Bu Liu Xing

245
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,510
is very effective.

246
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,270
The Ghost Array on the tree

247
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,110
interrupts  Wang Bu Liu Xing's pace.

248
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,550
Wei Cao Team want to block Xing Xin

249
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,550
by controlling HP.

250
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,190
Han Yanrou and Bai Zi, the Invader

251
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,150
are casted with debuff.

252
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,510
Their HP is reducing rapidly.

253
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,230
The Cleric of Xing Xin Team

254
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,030
should come on the stage.

255
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,390
Jun Moxiao is in the last row of the formation

256
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,150
and helps his teammates cover a retreat.

257
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,950
Nice dodge.

258
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,190
Now they need the Cleric

259
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,790
to dispell debuff off their teammates.

260
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,550
Bai Zi, the Invader is casted by debuff of decelerating.

261
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,510
He was hit by this skill.

262
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,350
What is Cold Hands doing?

263
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,710
When they need him most, he doesn't seem to be in the state.

264
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,950
he doesn't seem to be in the state.

265
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,150
The players of Wei Cao Team are still chasing after them.

266
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,670
Wei Cao  uses skills to interfere with Xing Xin constantly.

267
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,070
The HP of their team is reducing.

268
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,670
Cold Hands doesn't

269
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,870
help trammates to dispell debuff.

270
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,710
As a newcomer, An Wenyi

271
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,230
maybe this is his first time to play.

272
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,830
He is probably a little nervous.

273
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,350
He didn't see the situation clearly.

274
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,230
So the weakness of Xing Xin

275
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,270
is a little obvious.

276
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,870
In this way,

277
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,030
they might lose the game

278
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,950
because of the Cleric mistake.

279
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,950
You go ahead.

280
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,630
Jun Moxiao turns back.

281
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,270
He wants to help his teammates

282
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:49,903
stop the four players from Wei Cao.

283
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,310
Bao Zi, the Invader and Han Yanrou are still sprinting.

284
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,670
But their HP is very low.

285
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,270
It 's time for Cold Hands.

286
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,190
An Wenyi

287
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,550
Dispell debuff!

288
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,230
Quickly!

289
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,270
At last, Cold Hands take his anction.

290
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,310
He dispelled the debuff.

291
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,590
Xing Xin will have two players successfully completed the progress.

292
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,310
What?

293
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,190
Why it's invalid?

294
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,750
They died.

295
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,590
The HP of Han Yanrou and Bao Zi, the Invader is clear.

296
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,030
So they fell before the finish line.

297
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,990
What a pity!

298
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,510
Xing Xin's progress has fallen back from 95 percent

299
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,590
to 80 percent.

300
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,350
The ability of Xing Xin Team's Cleric is too poor.

301
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,830
What did you do?

302
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,310
Why you even can't cast the diepell skill correctly.

303
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,590
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,830
Fine, add blood for me.

305
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,990
Jun Moxiao haven't given up yet.

306
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,990
He is struggling to fight back.

307
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,830
Oh, no.

308
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,030
Jun Moxiao is going to die.

309
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,510
His HP is runing out.

310
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,110
It's Star Ray.

311
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,830
They can't hide.

312
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,230
The blood adding is just in time.

313
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,670
Jun Moxiao's HP remains 7 percent.

314
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,430
He still alive.

315
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,230
The final attack.

316
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,870
His HP is running out.

317
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,030
He adds blood again.

318
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,190
Back to 10 percent.

319
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,390
It is very very essential.

320
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,110
Continue to attack.

321
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,750
Oracle Curing!

322
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,510
This pre-read skill is great.

323
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,230
Now.

324
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,310
Cold Hands' rhythm of adding blood is very good.

325
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,070
The time of casting skills is also accurate.

326
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,830
The skill is really professional.

327
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,230
compareing with the clumsy dispelling skill

328
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,030
we can see the obvious contrast.

329
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,910
Great Healing.

330
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,670
Well done!

331
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,830
Now, I understand

332
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,670
the value of Cold Hands for Xing Xin.

333
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,550
Good job.

334
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,510
That was a good performance.

335
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,270
Split up.

336
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,750
Kill the Cleric first.

337
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,430
Wei Cao Team changed their goal.

338
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,750
Because the Cleric brings too much threat to them,

339
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,030
so they must kill the Cleric first.

340
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,590
Wang Bu Liu Xing is back.

341
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,110
Magic bomb hit.

342
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,350
Cold Hands was been slain.

343
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,030
Lava flask.

344
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,910
Mu En is going to restrain Cold Hands' movement.

345
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,710
A Thousand-machine Umbrella

346
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,550
In this critical moment

347
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,190
It becomes a shield,

348
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,190
and resists DPS.

349
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,590
Run!

350
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,830
He is about to cross the finish line.

351
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,030
Xing Xin is finally going to win the first point

352
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,950
What? Why did An Wenyi stopped?

353
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:13,590
Either

354
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,430
you get our payment,

355
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,470
or

356
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,590
you lose all reputation.

357
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,350
What's wrong with you?

358
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,110
Run.

359
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,430
Why did you stop?

360
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,070
Mu En seized the moment when Cold Hands was dazed.

361
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,910
Magic bomb.

362
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,990
Yi Cunhui.

363
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,350
He is back.

364
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,710
An Wenyi, run.

365
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,710
Yi Cunhui helped Cold Hands

366
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,790
then he was knocked down.

367
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,910
Get up.

368
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,590
Yi Cunhui starts to help Xing Xin's Cleric

369
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,230
But, what is Cold Hands thinking?

370
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,590
Why he stand still.

371
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,470
An Wenyi, run.

372
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,310
They did it.

373
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,670
The Cleric of Xing Xin Team.

374
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,470
Cold Hands.

375
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,710
100% progress

376
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,790
Congratulations to Xing Xin for its first win,

377
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,030
against the Strong Team Weci Cao.

378
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,950
Chen Yehui,

379
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,310
I wanna tell you,

380
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,070
I'm not afraid of you now.

381
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,550
You can tell them whatever you want.

382
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,430
I made this decision

383
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,430
at my own risk.

384
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,110
Captain.

385
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,590
Actually,

386
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,750
I don't know how to dispell debuff,

387
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,310
I lied to everyone

388
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,790
for money.

389
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,590
If you learn to dispell debuff,

390
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,750
you can

391
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,470
cover up your lie, right?

392
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,790
But dispelling debuff is not

393
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,790
that easy to learn.

394
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,790
Stay!

395
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,110
I'll teach you.

396
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,950
Captain!

397
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,590
Well done.

398
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,350
Xing Xin Team

399
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,830
is a right choice.

400
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,550
Yifan!

401
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,550
We'll waiting for you in the League.

402
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,670
Fighting! Yifan!

403
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,430
Come on!

404
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,070
Yifan, fighting!

405
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,590
We'll meet again

406
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,110
at the arena.

407
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,070
Good luck.

408
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,470
Let's have a look at

409
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,990
the team we'll battle aginst next time.

410
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,830
Is it my turn? I'll do it then.

411
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,750
Anyway,

412
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,870
I'm afraid of no team now.

413
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,310
Yifan,

414
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,670
did you remember the All-Star Game?

415
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,670
Do you remember the No.1 Ghostblade in the league?

416
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,990
Yifan, do you know Murphy's Law?

417
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,950
Just kidding.

418
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,910
Blockhead.

419
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,910
What's the trouble?

420
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,190
I believe that

421
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,590
sometimes a man

422
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,270
should believe in fate.

423
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,990
Whose fate?

424
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,790
Murphy's and your's.

425
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,670
Murphy's and your's.

426
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,230
I'm coming.

427
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,070
Here.

428
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,230
Any boss who talks about only feeling but not payments

429
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,350
is a bastard.

430
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,070
I've thought about it.

431
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,030
Our team will be more and more normalized.

432
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,710
I'll do what a boss should do.

433
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,270
I'll guarantee each member's welfare.

434
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,470
You're a great boss!

435
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,110
If you have any questions,

436
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,190
you can ask our boss.

437
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,350
I'm fine.

438
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,950
Me too.

439
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,550
No question.

440
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,430
I have a question.

441
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,990
Tell me.

442
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,190
I wanna change my period of the contract.

443
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,950
How?

444
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,990
I want to end the contract

445
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,670
until Xing Xin Team become the champion.

446
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,590
# Writing an end for the story #

447
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,390
# Unwilling to mediocrity #

448
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,550
# Not limitied by the success #

449
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,950
# We've agreed to meet again one day #

450
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,870
# I'll coming back with a larger scale than I left #

451
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,110
Ye Xiu, Tang, Bao Zi,

452
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,070
Qiao Yifan, Luo Ji

453
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,110
and An Wenyi.

454
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,230
It is your hard working

455
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,470
that brings Xing Xin to here and today.

456
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,230
Thank you for everyone's joining.

457
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,790
I'm proud of you.

458
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,630
Yifan,

459
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,310
hmmm,

460
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,870
the equipments you bought for me

461
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,350
don't worth it.

462
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,750
You pay them for

463
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,790
twice the market price.

464
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,230
We had a game the next day,

465
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,390
but you are lack of equipments.

466
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,750
That's all I can do.

467
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,510
Beside,

468
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,270
We can't reach the highest

469
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,750
cost performance in every deal.

470
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,790
That make sense.

471
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,550
We shouldn't consider cost performance

472
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,310
when it comes to the fact that you play game with me.

473
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,590
No thanks.

474
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,590
the game against Xing Xin Team next week,

475
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,310
what's your opinion about it?

476
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,630
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

477
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,710
Who's in danger?

478
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,190
Obviously, I'm saying the grass root team

479
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,670
you were talking about.

480
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,990
It's the team of your senior, Ye Qiu.

481
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,030
Are you kidding?

482
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,670
That guy is not my senior.

483
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,150
He is just a little hogweed

484
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,870
in my heart now.

485
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,270
Hogweed

486
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,270
which  will grow again when spring wind breeze.

487
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,030
No.

488
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,190
There is no spring wind at all.

489
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,070
Once they meet us,

490
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,430
they can't get any wind.

491
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,110
You should know that, captain,

492
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,030
they can rise in rank

493
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,390
only if they get five point.

494
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,750
They have no countermeasures at all.

495
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,350
They are anxious to death.

496
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,190
How do you know that?

497
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,070
I've called them.

498
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,510
I've called them to humiliate them.

499
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,270
How dare they rise in rank by beating Lan Yu?

500
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,590
It is absolutely impossible.

501
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,110
In fact, I don't think you even need to take part in the game.

502
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,670
I can beat them a thousand times

503
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,590
in different way only by using one finger.

504
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,830
I don't need to take part in the game. Why?

505
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,870
Do you think that I am no match for them?

506
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,590
No no no!

507
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,710
It's defenitly not what I mean.

508
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,630
I mean that you, my captain,

509
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,790
don't need to use even one finger,

510
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,750
just your smile

511
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,310
will make them shivering,

512
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,470
especially Ye Xiu.

513
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,150
However, Lao Ye plays pretty well now

514
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,070
He has both tactics

515
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,430
and skills.

516
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,070
Yeah.

517
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,110
He plays really well.

518
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,070
But captain you are better.

519
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,310
Look at you, you have not only tactics and skills,

520
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,910
but

521
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,470
me.

522
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,550
Aren't you better?

523
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,630
So

524
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,230
you can totally handle this competition right?

525
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,790
Right.

526
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,710
I think I can.

527
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,190
As long as I 'm here,

528
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,110
they shall never think of rising in rank.

529
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,030
I'll beat them like I beat Sun Xiang.

530
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,230
It's up to you this time.

531
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,030
Shaotian.

532
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,830
Lao Ye!

533
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,870
Do you know what I've been through right now?

534
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,190
Yu Wenzhou is not a normal person.

535
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,510
He's a devil who can read mind.

536
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,710
Are you tired to type so much words?

537
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,750
Do you need some red dates to help taking care of your body?

538
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,870
Lao Ye, do you know that

539
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,630
my captain

540
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,150
is not just a devil who can read mind,

541
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,350
he is totally a ghost hanging behind me.

542
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,350
And you should know that

543
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,150
it's all your fault.

544
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,110
You made my training courses doubled!

545
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,870
I am also asked to eat gumbos fried pork meet,

546
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,630
gumbos in garlic sauce,

547
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,350
boiled gumbos,

548
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,070
gumbos in oyster sauce,

549
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,870
gumbos and sashimis,

550
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,350
and the most terrifying one, gumbos mixed with rice!

551
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,110
That guy now,

552
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,470
knowing that I hate gumbos,

553
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,550
asks the cafeteria to cook food with gumbos delibrately.

554
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,070
They selling them with sliced cold chicken!

555
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,790
I'm feeling myself sticky now.

556
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,710
I really want to follow the phone line to get to him

557
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,390
and kill him.

558
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,630
Calm down.

559
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,030
We should be familiar with his trash talk.

560
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:23,870
Hello?

561
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,870
Are you still listening?

562
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,790
Yes, I am.

563
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,630
So what is your point

564
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,110
except for gumbos?

565
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,190
Right.

566
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,350
Now seriously,

567
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,350
The Tutor Selection this time.

568
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,750
Lan Yu will be serious.

569
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,630
Which means,

570
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,910
Yu Wenzhou will take part in it?

571
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,550
Yes.

572
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,350
Not just take part in.

573
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,030
We'll try our best this time.

574
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,030
Think about it.

575
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,790
The man who work and rest like an old

576
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,390
stay up late to find tactics against you.

577
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,990
You are the only one who have this treatment.

578
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,110
Don't say your brother isn't loyal to friends.

579
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,070
It's hard for me to give you a match-fixing when he takes part in.

580
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,350
It's impossible for Xing Xin

581
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,390
to get five point anyway.

582
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,390
However,

583
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,470
If you beg me,

584
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,750
I can keep you in contenance

585
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,670
and let you get through half people.

586
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,390
What's that voice?

587
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,390
Nothing.

588
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,430
Talking so big that

589
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,830
blow yourself up.

590
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,070
Lao Ye, you bastard.

591
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,430
You do think I'm talking big right?

592
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,630
Of course.

593
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,150
You?

594
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,350
Do you have the qualification to make a match-fixing?

595
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,670
Why do you bite the kind?

596
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,070
I get nothing paid to be the good guy.

597
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,750
Yes.

598
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,870
Lao Ye, you're dead.

599
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,870
Let's meet in the arena.

600
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,470
At that time,

601
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,790
the one who fail is Sun Xiang.

602
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,590
The loser, Sun Xiang.

603
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,230
Did you hear...

604
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,590
The world become peace and quiet again.

605
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,150
The elements

606
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,630
that descide whether we could get through include

607
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,950
the moving speed of our side,

608
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,350
the position of the obstacle

609
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,590
and the blocking rate of the opposite side.

610
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,590
I've put all of these

611
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,150
into my motion model.

612
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,870
The final chance of

613
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,910
all five of us getting through is

614
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,150
4.444444

615
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,750
That's ok.

616
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,750
According to Lanyu's old line-up,

617
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,830
those who most likely

618
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,870
stand in front of us will be

619
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,390
Guardian Angle,

620
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,710
Ammunition Specialist锘?

621
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,270
Qi Master,

622
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,270
and the double core of Lan Yu,

623
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
the sword and the curse.

624
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,710
Yu Wenzhou will be responsible for the intercept

625
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,390
while Huang Shaotian take care of the killing.

626
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,470
So

627
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,430
our rate of fighting back will be very low.

628
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,430
Unless,

629
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,510
There is someone who can influence their cooperation.

630
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,550
That's right.

631
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,230
This person must

632
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,830
know Lan Yu well.

633
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,870
He can fight against Yu Wenzhou

634
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,430
as well as stop Huang Shaotian from finding chances.

635
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,590
By charging he can attack,

636
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,310
by fleeing he can defend.

637
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,950
The skills and tactics

638
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,590
would better be quite

639
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,470
different from Lan Yu.

640
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,190
It would be better if he is

641
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,630
a Warlock.

642
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,790
Captain, do you mean that

643
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,110
you have the choice?

644
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,190
Some old guy

645
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,750
should come out to have a try.

646
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,030
The dust on your coffin is pretty thick now.

647
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,630
Do you want to stay inside until you starts to decay?

648
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,190
Go away.

649
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,270
You grandpa, I am full of beans.

650
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,950
Do not cursing me like that.

651
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,110
You reply in a fast speed.

652
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,030
Looks like you are always online.

653
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,270
Shut up.

654
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,470
I'm doing business online.

655
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,870
Gaining more than a hundred thousand Yuan in a few minutes.

656
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,150
I don't have time to tell tall tales with you.

657
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,710
Great, Lao Wei.

658
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,550
You didn't face your midlife crisis.

659
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,550
Congratulations.

660
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,350
Get away as far as you can.

661
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,670
Are you still playing Glory?

662
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,110
How old am I?

663
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,070
I'm busy with dealing the business.

664
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,830
I don't even have time to count the odd

665
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,510
of my bank account.

666
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,350
How could I have time playing Glory.

667
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,390
What's wrong with you?

668
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,630
Why would you choose to end your term?

669
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,670
Have you figured out that

670
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,150
you are willing to live a life like a normal person?

671
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,150
No, I haven't.

672
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,270
What?

673
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,670
Do you still want to play Glory?

674
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,990
I built a team.

675
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,750
Would you like to come with us?

676
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,990
I understand that you are exciting,

677
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,910
but do you really need to type with face?

678
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,910
No, thank you.

679
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,350
Thank you for what?

680
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,710
Why would I give up a rich business

681
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,310
and go to play in a team with you?

682
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,630
Don't you know that I was a professional player?

683
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,030
Professional players look decent,

684
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,350
but it's not a job for a person.

685
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,350
I gave up a long time ago.

686
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,430
Life winner.

687
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,590
I do want to see you by myself.

688
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:51,895
= What's the name of your team?
Which club is the investor? Who is the boss? =

689
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,950
Captain,

690
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,150
I've found the address of the IP that he's using.

691
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,150
If you are not interested in it,

692
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,350
I won't force you.

693
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,470
Let's stop here.

694
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,430
Is it your attitude to recruit talents?

695
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,870
You left me nothing.

696
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,830
Why can you beg me once, bastard?

697
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,150
Did you find out?

698
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,510
Why are you so slow?

699
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,310
Hurry up, please.

700
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,670
Where's my instant noodle?

701
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,990
I'm coming boss.

702
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,670
Here is it, boss.

703
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,310
Got it, boss.

704
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,510
The IP he was using

705
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,670
is located in this city.

706
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,790
I'll sent you the address.

707
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,470
The real talent is coming to your door.

708
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,590
If you don't accept him, you are a real fool then.

709
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,190
it is his fault

710
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,350
to make himself too much enemy.

711
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,670
Good bless him.

712
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,590
Brother,

713
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,470
what is this?

714
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,870
It's a Internet Bar

715
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,910
opposite Jia Shi.

716
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,550
Nan Ke Road 147.

717
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,190
It's here.

718
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,830
That's right.

719
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,630
It's not a big company.

720
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,870
Who are you looking for?

721
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,910
Your boss.

722
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,990
I'm his friend.

723
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,710
An internet bar.

724
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,350
How dare he said it's a team.

725
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,790
Putting these here in front of Jia Shi,

726
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,550
the boss has some guts.

727
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,230
What time is it now?

728
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,630
Does he still have fans?

729
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,710
I am his fan.

730
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,390
I'm also the boss of this internet bar.

731
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,470
Is there any problem?

732
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,830
It's a nice company.

733
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,990
They got a few computers

734
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,230
as their property.

735
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,550
Girl,

736
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,510
why are you so fool that

737
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,630
you choose to be a fan of Ye Qiu?

738
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,790
What do you mean?

739
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,990
All of the fan in the circle of Glory,

740
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,710
everyone is better than being a Ye Qiu's fan.

741
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,110
He didn't exist after the competition.

742
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,230
He had no sources and

743
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,550
no flow which are bearable.

744
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,470
But why did him choose to leave?

745
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,470
Now he's likely to disappear,

746
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,110
but the fans have no way to find him.

747
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,630
Spending more than a half of my youth on him,

748
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,670
but I don't know what is him look like.

749
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,510
Once you starts playing Glory,

750
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,190
When is your time to come back, Ye Qiu?

751
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,950
Don't be too sad.

752
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,110
It has been ten years.

753
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,550
It's not easy.

754
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,470
However, Ye Qiu will come back one day.

755
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,270
I'll promise to you.

756
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,270
Looks like,

757
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,630
you know that Ye Qiu is building a team?

758
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,910
I am the boss of the team.

759
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,230
Your family must be rich.

760
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,470
No, I'm not.

761
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,630
You must have some relationship with the League.

762
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,350
Why?

763
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,350
No.

764
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,510
I want to say that,

765
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,790
being a fan of Ye Qiu

766
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,030
is already a hard thing.

767
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,750
If you are the boss of his team,

768
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,590
you must have some hardware or software.

769
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,470
Yes, I have.
