= Episode 24 =

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,600
Just an Net Café

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
can be boasted to be a team.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,120
Put this in front of Jia Shi,

6
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
how dare this boss here.

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,480
What era is this now?

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,720
How can this guy still get fans?

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm his fan.

10
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
Also the owner of this Net Café.

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
Is there any problem?

12
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
This lady,

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,120
what are you thinking about?

14
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
To be a fan of Ye Qiu.

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
What do you mean?

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
In the whole Glory,

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,320
is there anyone more tragic than Ye Qiu's fans?

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,640
No one can find him after competition.

19
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:35,794
He got no resource.

20
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:36,480
No popularity.

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
That's no big deal.

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
But why did he suddenly retire?

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Now he's been vanished.

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
His fans can't even put up a notice.

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
They've been his fans for more than a half of their youth,

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,240
without knowing the appearance of their idol.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
A player of Glory is never free.

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,840
Ye Qiu, when would you come back?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
Don't be this sad.

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
It has been ten years.

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,320
It's not easy for all of us.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,120
But Ye Qiu will definitely come back.

33
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
I promise you.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Could it be said that

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,200
you know that Ye Qiu has formed a team?

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm the boss of this team.

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,280
That means

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
your boss has always been in the E-sports circle

39
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,000
these years.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,240
And it's the Glory circle.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,400
That's right.

42
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,600
He said himself that

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,360
all his skills of making a living

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
are in the Glory.

45
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:37,451
Without the Glory,

46
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,640
90% of him would be a good-for-nothing.

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,080
I knew.

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
What about the remaining 10%?

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,080
It's his face.

50
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
He said his face is equal to hard currency.

51
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:49,960
It'll be easy for him to live a well-to-do life

52
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:50,760
with his face.

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Forget it.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,800
Hey, man.

55
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,600
Be careful!

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,320
This is the treasure of our boss.

57
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:08,125
Sorry.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,000
Sorry.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
This...

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,160
is silver equipment?

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
It's a wand reached level 60.

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
AD 530.

63
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,200
AP 777.

64
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,251
This is a top-level silver equipment made by our boss for years,

65
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:23,000
specially designed for warlock.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
Warlock?

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,280
Is he still playing warlock?

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,005
Yes.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
Since his beginning of Glory,

70
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,508
he has always been playing warlock.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,680
Making a silver equipment in such conditions,

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
he's real something.

73
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Our boss is stubborn.

74
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,160
You know, the price of silver equipment

75
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,600
has been driven up.

76
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,840
But he would never sell it.

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,120
That's right.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,080
He would neither play a game,

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,040
nor join a team.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,680
What this top silver equipment is made for?

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
That's right.

82
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Made such effort.

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
What is it for?

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,600
You must be a rich second-generation.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm not.

86
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,000
Then you must have some connection with the league.

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
What do you mean?

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,640
No.

89
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,920
I don't mean that.

90
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:22,868
What I'm saying is

91
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:24,057
as a fan of Ye Qiu,

92
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm a tragic myself.

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,280
You're the boss of this team.

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,800
You must have either software or hardware, right?

95
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
I do have.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,680
I have this Net Café,

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,840
and a group of people

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,800
who follow Ye Qiu.

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
How many people are they?

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,760
If me included,

101
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:47,440
there are eight.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
Where are they from?

103
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:50,834
Recruited from Glory.

104
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:51,840
Although they're all new faces,

105
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:53,040
they all enjoy great potential.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Even worse than a poorly-equipped troupe.

107
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,542
No wonder they would cheat me.

108
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:00,280
What?

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,320
I mean

110
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
you really have a good sense.

111
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,120
Xing xin must have a bright future.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,720
Are you short of player in Dungeon?

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,640
Why don't you tell me the online coordinates?

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
My team can help you attack.

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,840
Online coordinates?

116
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,400
He went to search for it himself?

117
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,120
It's not easy to be a bounty hunter.

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Besides, this is a big order.

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
KPI of the whole year is depended on it.

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Surely he'd do it by himself.

121
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,560
Really?

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
What kind of order it is?

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
Follow me.

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Look.

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
Here it is.

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,120
Our mission.

127
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
Kill Jun Moxiao.

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
We're not lack of player in the Glory.

129
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,120
But I know.

130
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,931
It's not easy for you to come here from afar.

131
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
I still have one.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,840
So here you are.

133
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,382
What's this?

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Signature of Ye Qiu.

135
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
Don't tell other fans.

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
Boss!

137
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,480
Time for meeting!

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,880
Got it!

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Excuse me.

140
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Task for this week is

141
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,120
to attack the following maps.

142
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,131
The coordinates of next Dungeon is...

143
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,880
Just pass by.

144
00:07:58,948 --> 00:07:59,691
Pass by.

145
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
Let's continue.

146
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
Here you are, boss.

147
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,640
Go aside.

148
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Boss.

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,560
The online coordinates of Jun Moxiao...

150
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:16,685
Don't even mention it.

151
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,982
That woman's mouth

152
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:20,914
is as close as the burglar-proof padlock.

153
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,120
No matter what I asked,

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,080
nothing of Jun Moxiao's whereabouts can be told.

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,720
She's so alert.

156
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,760
It's reasonable that

157
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,257
you can't find it.

158
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:31,800
Boss.

159
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:32,880
We've found it.

160
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:34,840
What?

161
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,880
At 4 p.m..

162
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,302
At Zone A in Miluo Ancient City.

163
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,028
- Yes. - The coordinate is

164
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,422
3958 2564.

165
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,840
You guys are bravo!

166
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
Thanks to boss's good leadership.

167
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
That's right. Boss is excellent!

168
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:47,360
Let's have a meeting.

169
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,348
Our mission this time

170
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:50,560
is to thoroughly intercept and kill

171
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:52,617
Jun Moxiao in Glory.

172
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:54,800
The reward is priced at 500 per time.

173
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
No upper limit of attack.

174
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,160
Do you know what it means?

175
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,880
The setting in Glory

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,560
is to decrease one level after Penta-Kill.

177
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,954
Then making a player reached level 70

178
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,325
to level zero,

179
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:12,640
the accruing amount will be

180
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,148
175,000 yuan.

181
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
If the Cleric brought him back to life,

182
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,240
the profit will be doubled.

183
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,160
That is 350,000 yuan.

184
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,600
350,000 yuan.

185
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,600
This is merely in the Field of God.

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
If we chase him into common area and kill again,

187
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
we'll gain 700,000 yuan.

188
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
700,000 yuan.

189
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,468
You know what I'm saying?

190
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes.

191
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:42,868
Finish this order,

192
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,560
we'll have our year-end bonus.

193
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,520
What do you think?

194
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,520
Wanna have a try?

195
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:48,388
Yes!

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,680
Boss! Boss!

197
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,680
Jun Moxiao is online now.

198
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
How many people are they?

199
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,240
Just him alone.

200
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,200
Hey, man.

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Here comes our God of Wealth.

202
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,040
Let's welcome our guest!

203
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,057
All right!

204
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:28,400
Team two, lift-off.

205
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,290
Team one, get ready for point fire.

206
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:29,920
Roger that.

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,160
Double hack.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Oh my!

209
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
How many changes does this umbrella have?

210
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,320
His operation is still this bravo!

211
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,440
Go in batches!

212
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:28,720
Run out of his Patience.

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
Half of our team have been killed.

214
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,840
Why don't you attack, boss?

215
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Wait a sec.

216
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
Right now!

217
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
= Glory =

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,160
We got Jun Moxiao!

219
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,880
Boss!

220
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:49,691
Bravo, boss!

221
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:51,131
That 700,000 is ours!

222
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Finally got this crafty piece of shit.

223
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,760
People who got killed today

224
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,222
will have a red packet!

225
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,600
Especially those who got Jun Moxiao's online coordinates.

226
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,960
You deserve a good reward!

227
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:01,880
Thanks, boss.

228
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:02,754
What I want to say is

229
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:03,920
our boss has a wide connection.

230
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,474
But for your friend

231
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,440
who helped us find the online coordinates,

232
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:06,754
we...

233
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:07,154
Wait a moment.

234
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,040
My friend?

235
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,640
What friend?

236
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
A man came here this afternoon.

237
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,320
He said he's your friend.

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,040
Oh, no.

239
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,800
That's a substitute!

240
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
My friend.

241
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Long time no see.

242
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:36,960
You asshole!

243
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:37,908
You set me up!

244
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:39,565
How could that be set you up?

245
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,348
I know you're suffering from investigation.

246
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,640
So I sent you information on purpose.

247
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:43,657
What?

248
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:44,754
I helped you so much.

249
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,640
You complain for your own failure of catching me.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
Cut off this shit!

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
Release me!

252
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,040
And lie down to let us have the money!

253
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,440
Then all will be written off!

254
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,120
Or else,

255
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,080
Lao Wei.

256
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,800
You even got a silver equipment.

257
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
It seems that your conditions are becoming better.

258
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:01,800
Let me have a look.

259
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:02,502
I warn you.

260
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:03,942
Don't even think about it.

261
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:05,382
Or else I'll go after you forever.

262
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,960
Go kill him, buddies!

263
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
He doesn't have a lot of blood.

264
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:09,840
Let's defeat him!

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,960
This is the benefit of team work.

266
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,360
You're here alone with little blood.

267
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,840
Just wait for the mass brawl and being defeated!

268
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,160
Who tell you that I'm alone?

269
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,760
Come on!

270
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:41,400
It's your turn.

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,954
Roger that.

272
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
This is the helper that you called again and again?

273
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,680
A Ghost to support?

274
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:54,760
Like a piece of cake.

275
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,274
To fight you,

276
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:57,120
it's enough.

277
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Do you see the opposite old dog?

278
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't be irresolute.

279
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,360
Go decidedly!

280
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,080
Got it!

281
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,160
Slow down.

282
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,200
You sounds young.

283
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,800
Why are you so irritable?

284
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,840
Sorry.

285
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Hey, bro.

286
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:21,880
Good skills!

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,360
Look at your operation and mentality.

288
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,514
You don't like a player of Glory.

289
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,800
Are you a professional?

290
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
From which team?

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
Team Wei Cao.

292
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Team Wei Cao is great!

293
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,800
I have a good relationship with Wang Jiexi.

294
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
Later I'll tell him

295
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
to let you play the first launch.

296
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,960
You're good.

297
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,520
But just lack of an opportunity.

298
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,600
Senior.

299
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,320
Sorry.

300
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,154
But I probably won't need it.

301
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,840
No, you need it.

302
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:53,480
Young lad.

303
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,531

Young lad.

This is your time.

This is your time.

00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:55,714
Don't be shy.

Zhou Yebo.

316
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
You got wrong.

317
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,160
Great.

318
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,120
Still humbug him when facing imminent disaster.

319
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,720
The one you searched is not him.

320
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:23,577
He's my teammate.

321
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:24,560
Why did you search for Team Wei Cao.

322
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,057
Shit.

323
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
You're unreliable.

324
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,605
Where can I find information of your poor team?

325
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,720
This wand

326
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,440
looks like disgusting.

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,280
What kind of aesthetics does its owner have?

328
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
Cry now. Lao Wei.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
Your baby wand is mine now.

330
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,154
You bastard!

331
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,160
Give my silver equipment back right now!

332
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:42,982
Boss.

333
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,520
Their computers are off-line.

334
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,040
Ye Qiu! You asshole!

335
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,240
We'll see!

336
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,120
= Xing Xin Net Café =

337
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,200
- Boss. - Boss.

338
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,120
Have a seat. Boss.

339
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,200
Clear the site.

340
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,920
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,040
Clear the people.

342
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
Or you want to book the whole Café?

343
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,600
I want Ye Qiu to come out

344
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,720
and see me.

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
It's none of his business if you want to book this Café.

346
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,760
You can talk to me directly.

347
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,240
You deserve?

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,320
I think,

349
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,240
you look familiar.

350
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,560
Who am I is not important.

351
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
But what I lost

352
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,160
must be taken back by myself.

353
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,680
People who pretend to be Brother Xiaoma here

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,080
will at least bring a toothpick.

355
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Here.

356
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,000
It's for you.

357
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,320
Your label comes out.

358
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Stop pretending.

359
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Little fan.

360
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,760
Who's that?

361
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
With so many people.

362
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,000
Give Wand of Death back to me right now!

363
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,480
Or I have a hundred ways

364
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,200
to make you miserable!

365
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
A hundred?

366
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,080
You're creative.

367
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
I wander around the world,

368
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
have been known as heartless and cruel.

369
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,120
My buddies stand here today.

370
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,440
I promise you within days,

371
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,760
this Café will have to close.

372
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:35,942
A few days ago, boss was saying that

373
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,200
we need to hire several people to keep the Café.

374
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,600
That's all right now.

375
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,000
We can save the salary.

376
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,440
Old chap.

377
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,651
You know how much painstaking effort it took

378
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:48,360
for me to make this equipment?

379
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:50,160
Thousands of nights.

380
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:51,782
Dozens of versions modified.

381
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,880
Finally I got this top silver equipment.

382
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,400
It's not what I crow about.

383
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,160
Look at warlocks in the whole professional circle.

384
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
If I were the second,

385
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
no one dares to be the first.

386
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,960
You must be lonely.

387
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,440
Lao Wei.

388
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,868
What an effort is was to make this silver equipment done!

389
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,920
It'll be a waste to fight common players.

390
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,080
Unless you want to come back to the competition.

391
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
Save your shit.

392
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,880
Say it.

393
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,720
How could you return the Wand of Death?

394
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
It's rather simple.

395
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,280
Have a Tutor Selection for Team Xing xin.

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,600
If we win,

397
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,480
I'll give it back to you.

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,920
I knew it.

399
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,360
You want me to help.

400
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
This poor troupe can't work, right?

401
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,520
I have a big company.

402
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,360
Just a lifting of my hand

403
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:39,760
means tens of millions business.

404
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,160
How could I have time to kick up a row with you here?

405
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
Well,

406
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
see you then.

407
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,880
Listen.

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
Boss has already decided

409
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,765
to remould that wand.

410
00:20:58,777 --> 00:20:59,880
For my usage.

411
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,840
I'll have a silver equipment from now on.

412
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,840
Bao Zi.

413
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:03,782
That silver equipment

414
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,097
cannot be owned by you alone.

415
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,805
What?

416
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:06,331
Shut up now.

417
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,400
Let me introduce this silver equipment to you.

418
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,342
In terms of INT,

419
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,400
Magic Strike,

420
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,760
Personal Attribute Bonus,

421
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,120
and Magic Singing,

422
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,520
this silver equipment has almost been perfect.

423
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:19,200
It's one of the best silver equipment I've seen before.

424
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,937
If we can dismantle it,

425
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,760
Its INT material can be used to

426
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,840
update Tang's Lance.

427
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:27,040
Its Magic Singing can transform into attack speed for Bao Zi.

428
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:28,400
Xiao An can have its Magic Strike.

429
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:28,971
- That's great! - If so,

430
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:30,651
we can form a team of violence output.

431
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,000
There should be no problem for that.

432
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,400
When you are dismantling,

433
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,200
you must be very careful.

434
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,720
In case we failed,

435
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,120
that silver equipment would be ruined.

436
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
We won't lose anything.

437
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
We don't need that wand after all.

438
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,245
Just tear it apart.

439
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
It's good that the owner of this equipment is not here.

440
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
If he was here,

441
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,102
stand and watch his equipment

442
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:49,291
got dismantled,

443
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,982
how cruel it would be!

444
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,628
That's heartrending.

445
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:58,982
Deal.

446
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,240
Wish we have a fruitful cooperation.

447
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
You can leave now, buddies.

448
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,000
I have to stay here.

449
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
Boss.

450
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,880
Don't worry.

451
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Don't be reluctant.

452
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
I'll be back as soon as

453
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,640
I got my Wand of Death.

454
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Boss.

455
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,960
I mean...

456
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,880
It's near the return deadline of our suits.

457
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Stick it back.

458
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
See you, boss.

459
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:41,320
Let's go. Go.

460
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,102
Come on, go.

461
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's go back to our company.

462
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,760
Boss said that we're going to use containment.

463
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,520
What is containment?

464
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:57,165
Containment

465
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:58,400
is a representative tactic of Team Lan Yu

466
00:22:58,434 --> 00:22:59,874
in ancient times.

467
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,005
Containment means that

468
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,600
without conflict with the opposite side,

469
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,760
you can keep harassing him.

470
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,988
You don't even have to make any frantic effort.

471
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,760
It can help you achieve your goal.

472
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,200
Look.

473
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,542
This is what I found online.

474
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,520
The containment.

475
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,440
It's Tom and Jerry.

476
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,205
This old tactic

477
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:19,640
is from centuries ago.

478
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:20,800
It has been out of date.

479
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:24,262
Tom and Jerry is

480
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:25,497
a classic animation

481
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,154
produced by MGM

482
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
in 1939.

483
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:30,057
It is a bit old.

484
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,080
But none of us is grown up without it.

485
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,760
Containment?

486
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Have you guys heard it before?

487
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Containment has never been old-fashioned.

488
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,920
Only of you're not good at it.

489
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
If you can do it well,

490
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
it is classic.

491
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,880
Today I will let you see

492
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,800
what is the real containment.

493
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,920
Pick a map that you have the highest rate of winning.

494
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Or else you'll find excuses,

495
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,480
if you lose.

496
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,400
Then we choose Tower of Babel.

497
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,640
Our win rate is 87.6%.

498
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,360
What do you think?

499
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
You want to win me with such a low rate?

500
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,760
Except the map,

501
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,680
I'll give you one more right.

502
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,800
You decide the rule of this game.

503
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
Then we climb the Tower.

504
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,080
The one who gets to the top of the Tower

505
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,880
is the winner.

506
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:20,560
Here we go.

507
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,160
Three.

508
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:33,880
Two.

509
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:34,680
One.

510
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,462
Race start.

511
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,188
Bao Zi.

512
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:54,040
Help me to observe

513
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,360
which route would he go.

514
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,640
He doesn't move at all.

515
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,720
How come?

516
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,314
It seems that containment

517
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:04,377
is not a big deal.

518
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,840
The first principle of containment

519
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,160
is to keep calm no matter what happened.

520
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
You can't even climb.

521
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,022
Cut off this shit of keeping calm.

522
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,800
No matter how fast you climb,

523
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,800
you're just my stepping-stone.

524
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,800
You...

525
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,600
What a dirty trick!

526
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,280
The second principle of containment

527
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:22,011
is to gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck.

528
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,880
Yi Cunhui.

529
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,228
Your reaction

530
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,560
and mentality are all not bad.

531
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Thanks, senior.

532
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,708
So do you know the 36 frequently-used

533
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,908
combos of Ghost?

534
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,080
What are they?

535
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,200
You've gone to far!

536
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,697
Kill him when the game is almost finished.

537
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:01,531
That's foul.

538
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,160
The third principle of containment

539
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,788
is to play hard.

540
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:06,400
That's the best way of playing games.

541
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm so kind that I'll give you the last lesson.

542
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
The so-called containment

543
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,280
is to play not by the conventional wisdom.

544
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,560
The essence of it

545
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:18,160
is the best opportunism.

546
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
Let's play again.

547
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,000
Young players are eager to win.

548
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,040
That's good.

549
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
However,

550
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that'll be all for today.

551
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:37,040
I've got something else to do.

552
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:37,920
Got to go.

553
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,800
How do they prepare?

554
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,080
Not bad.

555
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,480
Then next,

556
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,800
I'll start to prepare for

557
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:50,200
the Challenge.

558
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:50,880
You guys busy now?

559
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,680
No problem.

560
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Just do it.

561
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,920
By the way,

562
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,440
have we got enough money?

563
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,200
What are you looking at?

564
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,360
Don't worry about money.

565
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:09,080
I'll get it ready.

566
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,880
I want to see you smiling at me.

567
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
The coffee tastes so bitter.

568
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,680
But you smile,

569
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,280
is my sugar.

570
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,040
He who touches rouge will be stained with red,

571
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
but he who gets in contact with you

572
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,160
will feel sweet.

573
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,160
This woman is easy to deal with.

574
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,360
I didn't even try my best.

575
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,640
She just went away.

576
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,080
What do you intend to say?

577
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
And can't say it in front of the boss.

578
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,302
These young players,

579
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,440
they really can't make it.

580
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,800
No matter how I taught,

581
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:03,280
they can't learn it well.

582
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,160
Is it because they don't understand,

583
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,080
or they don't admit you?

584
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
In a word, don't count on them.

585
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
Just give up.

586
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,920
Things like competition,

587
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
are still depend on us older generation.

588
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm not part of you.

589
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
When you say the word "old",

590
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
don't include me.

591
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm serious.

592
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
Playing competition

593
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:26,171
needs players like you and me.

594
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,760
We got both competence and experience.

595
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
My Wand of Death,

596
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
is the key to success.

597
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,640
You must give it back to me.

598
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
Or else we'll definitely lose.

599
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
You want to get it back so eagerly.

600
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
Who are you going to fight?

601
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm invincible.

602
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,160
Do I look like someone has any rival?

603
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,360
In today's Glory League,

604
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,080
is there no player that you regard as rival?

605
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,200
No matter who he is,

606
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,520
if fights with me,

607
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
I'll hit him hard.

608
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,920
There's no sugar in my coffee too.

609
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,360
Lao Wei.

610
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,840
Give me a smile.

611
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,880
Bao Zi, here you are.

612
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
Until now, I've realized

613
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,560
what is the "Return of the King",

614
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,600
and how intrepid it is!

615
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,120
Don't lag behind, King.

616
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm afraid when you arrived at the competition terrain,

617
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:46,840
you can't even find the right door.

618
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,040
We're going to fight Team Lan Yu, will you be afraid?

619
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,560
Team Lan Yu?

620
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,680
What do you mean?

621
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,560
Why didn't you tell me we will fight Team Lan Yu earlier?

622
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,080
I know you're a bastard!

623
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
You lie to me so that I can fight Team Lan Yu for you.

624
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,360
Captain?

625
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,960
Why are you here?

626
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,280
Captain.

627
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,280
Where have you been for such a long time?

628
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,920
Do you know how long have we been finding you?

629
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,754
You should at least tell us now that you have retired.

630
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:23,960
Don't you miss our team?

631
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:25,062
Don't you miss me?

632
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:28,685
I won't let you go this time!

633
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,720
I finally find you.

634
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,080
Do you know how much I miss you?

635
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,628
I even write a song for you.

636
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,320
Named "In the World only Captain's Dear".

637
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,400
You little jerk.

638
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
After just several years,

639
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,800
you become this heavy.

640
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,680
Captain Wei.

641
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,640
Long time no see.

642
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,080
You've been here too.

643
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,560
Lao Wei.

644
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,720
Time to get in.

645
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,160
I'll go bananas right here, right now!

646
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,360
Come here!

647
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,080
Don't go there!

648
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,920
What are you doing?

649
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,320
Lao Wei said,

650
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,400
see you later.

651
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
See you around.

652
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,440
Ye Qiu, you're so shameless that you even lie to me!

653
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,680
Lan Yu,

654
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,920
is not easy to defeat.

655
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Come on.

656
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,680
Give me the Wand of Death.

657
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,560
Right now!

658
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Wand of Death,

659
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
weighs 3kg,

660
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
attack speed 2.

661
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,240
No matter how I observe,

662
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,600
this weapon seems to be designed for Yu Wenzhou.

663
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,760
Am I right?

664
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
Where's my weapon?

665
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,760
The competition is going to start.

666
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,240
Here you are.

667
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,040
= Purple Wand =

668
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,480
What can I do with a chicken claw?

669
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,120
Where's my Wand of Death?

670
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,160
Give it to me!

671
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,360
I promised it'll be returned after winning this game.

672
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,680
Why should I waste my time if you don't give it back?

673
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,440
For your face or your moral quality?

674
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,240
Aren't you clear?

675
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,040
I'm a retired old player.

676
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,760
To fight the leader of Team Lan Yu with a primary weapon?

677
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,160
Am I mad?

678
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Without my silver equipment,

679
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,720
I won't help you fight.

680
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,560
My helper is you,

681
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,680
not your weapon.

682
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,080
Don't lie anymore.

683
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,480
In a word,

684
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,880
will you give it back to me?

685
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,400
Last round of Tutor Selection.

686
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,400
Team Xing Xin vs. Team Lan Yu.

687
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:19,400
Ready to start.

688
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,205
This is a life or death battle of Team Xing Xin.

689
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:22,617
Good.

690
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,440
It's you who want me to die.

691
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,685
Don't regret.

692
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,120
It means that if Team Xing Xin want to promote,

693
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,720
all of their teammates have to survive.

694
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,880
Facing Tactic Master Yu Wenzhou,

695
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:34,680
and Blade Master Huang Shaotian,

696
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:35,577
it's impossible for all of them

697
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:36,400
to pass.

698
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,760
Ult.

699
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,200
Chaotic Rain of Swoksaar.

700
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,800
No interruption.

701
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,800
Team Xing Xin must get away from the ult as soon as possible.

702
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:17,960
As we expected, Troubling Rain

703
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:18,880
is going for Jun Moxiao.

704
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:19,417
There you go!

705
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,000
Lao Ye.

706
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,880
Take that!

707
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:21,600
Dragon Cut.

708
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,440
Phoenix Cut.

709
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:23,320
Triple Cut.

710
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:24,680
Cut!

711
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,160
Finally, it's our battle!

712
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,080
Are you afraid?

713
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,880
Now I tell you,

714
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:30,320
don't cry after losing the game.

715
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Take it!

716
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,960
Slow down.

717
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,480
It's too violent for the beginning.

718
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm afraid you'll be short of momentum later.

719
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,594
I won't.

720
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:40,537
You'd better worry about yourself.

721
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:41,588
Don't you believe

722
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,097
you'll win with the help of Captain Wei.

723
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,280
Unfortunately, your rival is me today.

724
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,440
I'm a corgi if I can't hit you to near death.

725
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,520
Top-level confrontation at the very beginning.

726
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:51,200
That's right.

727
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,160
We can see at the very beginning,

728
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,880
it's the long-anticipated confrontation.

729
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:56,040
Troubling Rain vs. Jun Moxiao.

730
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,240
They keep a distance to seek for opportunity.

731
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,920
Jun Moxiao attacks first.

732
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,640
And then slip away.

733
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,994
I guess he doesn't want to waste time here.

734
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:14,217
Stop! You shameless.

735
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,880
Come fight with me!

736
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
All right. The first confrontation

737
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:21,400
between Troubling Rain and Jun Moxiao

738
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,520
ended up with Jun Moxiao's tactical retreat.

739
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
At another side of the map,

740
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:29,000
What is the Warlock of Team Xing Xin doing?

741
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,280
No one in Team Lan Yu attacks him.

742
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:31,240
They just leave

743
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:32,520
Windward Formation here alone.

744
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:34,560
At this time,

745
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:35,598
Windward Formation should finish the schedule

746
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,040
as soon as possible,

747
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,480
or go meet with his teammates.

748
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,457
Waste his ability?

749
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,530
It seems Windward Formation doesn't want to fight.

750
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
It's a good place to have a walk in the town.

751
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,228
But in such a serious battle,

752
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:52,457
I wonder what would players of Team Xing Xin think

753
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:54,040
when they find what he is doing.

754
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
Besides, we also noticed that

755
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,520
Windward Formation's weapon is a purple equipment.

756
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,314
He just sits down.

757
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:14,434
Doesn't worry at all.

758
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,931
Is this a part of

759
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,240
Master Ye Qiu's tactics?

760
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,000
I've never seen

761
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,280
such tactics before.

762
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,502
Yi Cunhui vs. Brilliant Edge.

763
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:29,960
Dodge.

764
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,160
Two against one can be achieved here.

765
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:33,485
But Windward Formation looks like haven't noticed.

766
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,285
Senior Wei.

767
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
I need your help.

768
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,600
Thanks, senior.

769
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,640
Don't get me wrong.

770
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Well,

771
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
don't get me wrong.

772
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Go on fighting.

773
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:01,931
That's right.

774
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:02,822
Hit him. Hit!

775
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:08,548
Captain.

776
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,274
There's a Warlock sitting beside me.

777
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,280
He doesn't attack or retreat.

778
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,440
I don't know what's wrong with him.

779
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,800
Where are you?

780
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,657
Coordinates:

781
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,360
312 662

782
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
Qi Master, cover me.

783
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,360
Got it.

784
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:25,485
Here comes the Qi Master of Team Lan Yu. Cloud Seize!

785
00:38:25,485 --> 00:38:26,834
He successfully got Windward Formation.

786
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Sneak attack!

787
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,160
You said it so loudly.

788
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,680
Could it be called as a sneak attack?

789
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,840
Do you need me to teach you?

790
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,480
Lao Ye.

791
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
I got caught.

792
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,200
What can I do?

793
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,160
It's good.

794
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
It's your style to be caught and hit,

795
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,560
and finally throw in the sponge.

796
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,520
You wanna be against me?

797
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,640
All right. I'll let you see how I lose.

798
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,600
Senior.

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,360
Who ever asked you to save me?

800
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,000
Senior.

801
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,040
Am I wrong to save you?

802
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,034
Of course you are.

803
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,280
Waste time to make the array of ice

804
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:12,240
is not as good as leave me and run.

805
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:14,217
But you said,

806
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,280
the essence of containment

807
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:16,120
is to gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck.

808
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:17,320
If I run just now,

809
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,040
what if they attack you in the rear?

810
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,360
This lad has a good memory.

811
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,160
You're so despicable.

812
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
Let the Warlock lie there to attract me to attack,

813
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,360
and then let the Ghost attack me in the rear.

814
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,520
Shameless.

815
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,577
Haven't your leader told you

816
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:33,840
the formation of Team Lan Yu is all about containment?

817
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,520
Yifan.

818
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,920
Let's show him

819
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,520
what is the real containment.

820
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:42,360
Okay.

821
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:43,080
Senior.

822
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,360
Can you stop running?

823
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,057
Lao Ye.

824
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,560
Are you imitating Sun Xiang today?

825
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,480
Don't be afraid.

826
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:50,800
Let's have a confrontation if you were a man.

827
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,205
Troubling Rain is still chasing for Jun Moxiao.

828
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:55,154
But it seems that

829
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,160
he has lost his goal.

830
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:03,371
Lao Ye.

831
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:04,662
Every dog has its day.

832
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,045
In order to save your life,

833
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,600
you can't even dare to go face to face with me.

834
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm gonna catch you now.

835
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,520
There you go.

836
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,520
There's no love in the corner.

837
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:24,760
But in the rear.

838
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
That's unbelievable.

839
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,000
Troubling Rain has been kicked by Jun Moxiao...

840
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:28,760
What are you thinking about?

841
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:29,360
Shaotian.

842
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm by your side.

843
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,080
Why don't you turn around?

844
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,320
You shameless bastard!

845
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:40,434
You make me get stuck like a boss in the Dungeon.

846
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,148
Good, Lao Ye.

847
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Wait for me getting out!

848
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:43,840
We'll see!

849
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,628
Why can't I get out?
