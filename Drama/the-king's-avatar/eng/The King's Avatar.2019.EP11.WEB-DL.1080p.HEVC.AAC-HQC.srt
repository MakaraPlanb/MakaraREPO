00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,360
We're having hot pot.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Having hot pot?

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,004
Kicking down the ladder when you have succeeded,

5
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:40,760
you're so ungrateful!

6
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,000
How could you go out to have hot pot without the meritorious man?

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Who are you eating with?

8
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,120
Where are you eating?

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,880
Why didn't you invite me?

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,480
Even if we had invited you, would you be able to come?

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll think about going over there

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
if you reimburse me for the fare!

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
I finally see

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,160
what big plot you've been brewing.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,520
No wonder the captain said that

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,680
you would come back sooner or later.

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Have you already planned to

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,800
team up with those around you

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
and bring a rookie team back to the league?

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Honestly, is it true?

21
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,120
Hello?

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
Hello? Hello? Hello?

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,920
Have more, have more!

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Master, please try this.

25
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,080
Cheers!

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Am I going to form...

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,560
a rookie team?

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,000
Master! Master!

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
Miss! Miss!

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Miss!

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,920
Are you going in or not?

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,520
Are you going in?

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm going in. Thank you.

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
Miss, you dropped your admission ticket.

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
Master! Master! Master!

36
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,360
Thank you.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:06,720
Master! Master! Master!

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Master!

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,760
Master! Master! Master!

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,880
Master!

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,920
Master! Master! Master!

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Thank you!

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:21,320
Master! Master! Master!

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Master! Master! Master!

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,040
Master! Master! Master!

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,760
We are always here to support you all the way!

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,320
Master! Master! Master!

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Hello everyone.

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
The booing makes me feel like

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,280
I came to a competition scene all of a sudden.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,400
Actually, I know that

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
why everyone is booing.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,720
I was asked by the media earlier that

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
for what reason Jia Shi recently lost

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
three consecutive rounds of matches.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,720
Because we've come in midseason,

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,280
all the players have been suffering from fatigue.

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,880
However,

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,720
those are just meaningless official statements.

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
The real reason was that

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,520
Jia Shi had been going through

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
the pains of running-in,

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
which was the price that must be paid

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
when bringing in new blood.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,440
But we can't give up renewals and iterations

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,440
because of fear.

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
In the last three games,

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,960
Sun Xiang was obsessed with going rogue.

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,640
His damage only accounted for 14% of the team,

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
far lower than Ye Qiu's career average

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,440
which was 72%.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,520
Besides,

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
in the game against Lan Yu,

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
if it hadn't been for

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
Sun Xiang's reckless attack at the last moment,

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
the rival team wouldn't have been able to turn the match around.

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,800
You just said that

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
that was the result of the iteration of Jia Shi.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
But now we've seen that the iteration is a total failure.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
Why did you insist on doing it?

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
Exactly! Why?!

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Ye Qiu is obviously still a top player.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Why did you give his position to Sun Xiang?

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
Alright! I'll give you guys an answer.

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,223
The reason why Ye Qiu retired

86
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:06,880
and we gave his position to Sun Xiang

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
was that...

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
If you cancel the contract,

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
you won't be able to get a dime.

90
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
I choose to retire.

91
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
The decision was made by Ye Qiu himself.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,520
How could that be? It couldn't be!

93
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
It couldn't be!

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Believe it or not,

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,160
for you guys, Ye Qiu

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
is the master of Glory,

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
the hero of Jia Shi,

98
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
but for me,

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,480
he is an old friend who has

100
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,880
worked side by side with me for ten years.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
As his old friend,

102
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I have never regretted

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,760
supporting his decision,

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,320
and sometimes I even felt that

105
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,080
this was the best for him.

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,160
Why gave you the right to say that?

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,840
Why gave you the right?!

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,280
Ten years!

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,040
He dedicated ten years of his prime

110
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,640
to Jia Shi.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
But a man is vulnerable

112
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,000
when facing time

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,320
no matter how strong he is.

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
So if this time

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,320
he really wanted to leave,

116
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
could we just be considerate

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
of him for once?

118
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
Just for once!

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Hereby,

120
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
I would like to say thank you to everyone here

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,320
for my old friend.

122
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,840
These are all the honors that Ye Qiu

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
earned for Jia Shi.

124
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,400
Three championship trophies,

125
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,200
the MVP awards of three seasons,

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,080
and a variety of

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,000
other awards.

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
However, after this day,

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
I will have to seal them up

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,000
and put them in the honor room of Jia Shi.

131
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Let's come together to commemorate the legendary era

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
that has passed!

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,880
Your old coat is like an umbrella,

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,120
propping up my sky

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,160
and sheltering me from the cold.

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,828
Even if it's just a bowl of instant noodles,

137
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,800
you would give me half...

138
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,240
If I have to say goodbye,

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,320
I hope it doesn't mean that we'll never reunite,

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,560
but that one day we'll be able to see each other again.

141
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,840
Leaf of Autumn, see you again.

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,280
He dedicated ten years of his prime

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
to Jia Shi.

144
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,280
But a man is vulnerable

145
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,280
when facing time

146
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,720
no matter how strong he is.

147
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,160
We're doomed.

148
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,560
Boss are gonna be so mad when she comes back.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,880
He really wanted to leave.

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,600
I wish I had answered the call

151
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,680
and gone there with her.

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,640
Just for once!

153
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,360
Hereby...

154
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,760
She's back.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Guoguo, you're back.

156
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,000
You flaked out on me!

157
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,520
Do you know how serious the consequence would be?

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:35,880
I...

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,120
Don't try to explain. No excuses.

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,040
I have to punish you.

161
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Guoguo, my phone...

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Don't plead for yourself.

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,600
I need to give it a lot of thought.

164
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,000
Should I ask you to buy a garage kit for me,

165
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,920
or to clean the warehouse for me?

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Guoguo...

167
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll put it on your tab

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,080
and take time to think about

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,240
how I should torture you.

170
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,720
Guoguo...

171
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,360
And you!

172
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,640
And you!

173
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,440
You are the main culprit!

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Net cafe manager, if it hadn't been for you...

175
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
Tang flaked out on me

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
to meet you.

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,360
As her boss,

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,320
I found it very disrespectful to me.

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,920
Alright, punish me if you want.

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Of course I have to punish you!

181
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
Every pot of plants here,

182
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
every leaf of them,

183
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,520
you have to

184
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,640
wipe them clean.

185
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
And those cups,

186
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,240
you have to clean

187
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,520
every rim of the cups.

188
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
Guoguo,

189
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,840
you...

190
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm so tired, so tired.

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
I need to go back to my room to rest up.

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Didn't you see that

193
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,120
she was in a bad mood?

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Every word Tao Xuan said

195
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,720
poked a hole in her heart.

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,640
I saw it.

197
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
So?

198
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,560
I didn't want to expose her feelings.

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,560
Why?

200
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Only those who are vulnerable need comfort.

201
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,760
Our tough boss is completely able to

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,440
heal by herself.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Washing cups at this hour?

204
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
It's the punishment you gave me.

205
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
Those were just casual words.

206
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
You don't have to take it seriously.

207
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
I've heard too many

208
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,920
casual words today,

209
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
casually talking about letting go,

210
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,600
casually talking about leaving.

211
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
And all of them believed it,

212
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
except me. I didn't believe it.

213
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,160
I believe it.

214
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,920
I believe your casual words.

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,720
Look.

216
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,040
I've really gotten the knack of

217
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
washing cups.

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Thank you for your casual words.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
Now I'm able to be

220
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,600
a semi-professional net cafe manager.

221
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
Brat.

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,400
What's up?

223
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
If you had been the manager

224
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,160
of my net cafe for ten years,

225
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
wouldn't you be reluctant to leave?

226
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
If I had been doing the same thing for ten years,

227
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,960
I must have gotten tons of joy from it.

228
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,520
Since I had gotten joy from it,

229
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,800
I wouldn't care

230
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
if I left.

231
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,440
As long as the heart is still here,

232
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
it's not really leaving.

233
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,400
But what if

234
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,080
he had given up in his heart?

235
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
How did you know that he had given up?

236
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,760
Doesn't the fact that he left mean that he had given up?

237
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,080
The cup is a vase now.

238
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,280
Maybe he has walked on a new path to start over.

239
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,440
Boss, what do you think?

240
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,680
Wake up, wake up, guys.

241
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
Time to raid.

242
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Where have they gone?

243
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,160
Guild master, they're all creating new accounts down there.

244
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,080
The guild has more than one hundred accounts.

245
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,760
What the hell are they creating new accounts for?

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
Do you not remember? Last time in the Kongzhi Forest,

247
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,240
Jun Moxiao made more than 90 accounts

248
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,520
of our guild trash accounts.

249
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,720
Is there anyone able to

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
teach Jun Moxiao a lesson?

251
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,560
The captain is upstairs.

252
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,400
He must have a way.

253
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,840
I am going to talk to the captain.

254
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,480
If I don't make it back,

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
please take care of the guild.

256
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
Boss, you only have one minute.

257
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
Wenqing, there will be an exhibition match tomorrow.

258
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,840
I'd like to send a few players there.

259
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
It's now midseason.

260
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,040
The team's training would be affected.

261
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,800
But...

262
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,600
If there's nothing else,

263
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,480
please leave now.

264
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,320
Good day, Boss.

265
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Are you here to meet the captain as well?

266
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
No, no, no. I'm here for the vice captain.

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,760
Vice Captain!

268
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
Vice Captain, finally I found you!

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,000
The thing is,

270
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,680
there's a Jun Moxiao in the 10th District.

271
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,120
He's a really strong player...

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
=Lunch Preparation Time=
=Lunch Time=

273
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
So you came here for me

274
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,360
in the hope that I could help you

275
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,560
kill Jun Moxiao, right?

276
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,360
Exactly!

277
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,400
You are our vice captain.

278
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,360
I want you to step up and...

279
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Frankly speaking,

280
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,600
I feel really uncomfortable

281
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
when talking to you,

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
because your second button is not buckled.

283
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,840
Alright now?

284
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,960
Alright.

285
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Now we can talk about

286
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,320
Jun Moxiao.

287
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,680
One Canyon.

288
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
Jun Moxiao will have to pass through here, right?

289
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, Vice Captain.

290
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,120
Alright, let's get going.

291
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,000
Action.

292
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
Sabre, 113, 224.

293
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
Guns, 156, 281.

294
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
The initial position put you at an advantage.

295
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,040
And your blocking was watertight.

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
However, it was such a shame, Xinjie,

297
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
that your teammates were too weak

298
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,320
and your opponent was me.

299
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
I didn't expect it to be you.

300
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
It seems that I was careless.

301
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,200
Vice Captain, do you know Jun Moxiao?

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
What kind of tricks are you playing?

303
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,928
The vice captain of Ambitions personally

304
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:37,840
brought people here to block me.

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,960
I came here for you

306
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,440
because the guild entrusted me with the task

307
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,680
in the hope that you would not mess with

308
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
the dungeon records of Ambitions ever again.

309
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,280
I was wondering if it was something big.

310
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,920
Xinjie, how come you are now

311
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
worrying about the affairs of the guild?

312
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,200
You know that I won't listen to your trash talk.

313
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,480
It's not only about the dungeon records.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,360
Nobody is allowed to break the rules in Glory.

315
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,080
What are the rules of Glory?

316
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,040
Isn't it that the top player is the king?

317
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Alright, then let's do it

318
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,040
according to the rule of Glory.

319
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Let's PK.

320
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,760
Whoever wins has the final say.

321
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,200
Me against you?

322
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,840
It'll be us against you guys.

323
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
3 p.m., the Arena.

324
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,800
Team battle.

325
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,200
If you lose,

326
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
never interfere with the dungeon records in Glory again.

327
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,240
If they shut me out of the dungeons,

328
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,160
I would not be able to access the hidden bosses.

329
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,080
If I would not be able to access the hidden bosses,

330
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,160
there would be no chance for me to get

331
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
the rare materials to upgrade the Thousand-Machine Umbrella.

332
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,240
I have to win this bet.

333
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,600
Vice Captain.

334
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,240
Not now.

335
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,240
The captain is in training.

336
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,280
How much longer will the captain train for?

337
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,440
This is the captain's daily training program.

338
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,160
It starts at twelve o'clock

339
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,600
and lasts half an hour.

340
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
There are 20 minutes to go.

341
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,920
For a veteran who has been in the league

342
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
for ten years,

343
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,600
stamina would be his biggest problem.

344
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,760
We admire his fighting spirit that has been

345
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,240
shown in trainings and matches.

346
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,080
But we have to admit that

347
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,680
sheer fighting spirit

348
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
is not enough to help him resist the ravages of time.

349
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,720
If he is unable to climb the peak,

350
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,280
he may slide all the way to the abyss.

351
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,080
Leaving

352
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,040
may be his best choice,

353
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,360
because the peak of glory is so cruel.

354
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,760
Behind the radiant glory

355
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,480
is the courage to fight against your own age.

356
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
Let's bid farewell to the veteran who is about to retire.

357
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Cap... Captain.

358
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,440
1.3 seconds slower than last time.

359
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,080
Time is not the only standard.

360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
But time is the most reliable standard.

361
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
Something happened in the guild?

362
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Captain, so the thing is,

363
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
the newly-opened 11th...

364
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,200
Get to the point.

365
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
We came across a player

366
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,040
named Jun Moxiao in Glory.

367
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,920
After the fight, we found that he was Ye Qiu.

368
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,360
Isn't Ye Qiu retired?

369
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,800
How come

370
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,080
he went in the world of Glory?

371
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
He is very active in Glory.

372
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,000
In three days, he broke two of

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,080
the dungeon records of the Ambitions.

374
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,240
To abuse noobs in Glory,

375
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,680
for sure he would be active.

376
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,160
After the encounters

377
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
in two finals of the seven seasons

378
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,200
and the numerous confrontations in Glory,

379
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,680
tonight, on the stage of the All-Star Game,

380
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,840
they are fighting for glory again!

381
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,680
Wasn't it too aggressive?

382
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,360
That was because the opponent was you.

383
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
I won't let you win next time.

384
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay.

385
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't be a deserter by then.

386
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,240
I would only fight to the end,

387
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,080
never retreat halfway.

388
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,200
Then see you at the All-Star next year!

389
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,840
See you next year.

390
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,800
I'd like to see

391
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,400
how weak he has become now.

392
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,280
The warming up!

393
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,280
Okay!

394
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
Boss!

395
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,360
Boss!

396
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,320
I know that these gears

397
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,200
are in line with my temperament at first glance.

398
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,480
Take your pick.

399
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,360
Hooray!

400
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,680
Later, we are going to have a match against the Ambitions.

401
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
The Ambitions Guild?

402
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,520
The Ambitions Team?

403
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,000
That's right.

404
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,080
The Ambitions Team fights in a very fierce style,

405
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,000
even the healer is able to fight

406
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,600
and his damage is no joke.

407
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,360
But the key to winning for the Ambitions is tactics.

408
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
So for us,

409
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,800
the initial position is very important.

410
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,040
It's time.

411
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
So...

412
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,080
Let's go.

413
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Seckill the saber on the right flank with force.

414
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,360
Roger that.

415
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Awesome! Got him! Got him!

416
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,240
With only a little bit of HP left, he's about to die!

417
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm dead, I'm dead.

418
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,120
I'm being focused. I'm about to get seckilled.

419
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,360
Switch your position.

420
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm here. They won't be able to seckill you.

421
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,720
Holy crap.

422
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,720
The healer is unreal!

423
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,520
As I said, I'm here with you.

424
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,880
To seckill my people? In their dreams.

425
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,000
Vice Captain, the healing has overflowed.

426
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,400
Next time they focus fire you,

427
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm going to make them pay a price.

428
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,360
Master, if Zhang Xinjie doesn't get seckilled,

429
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,840
the Ambitions would never have a depletion of numbers.

430
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
I repeat.

431
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,233
Seckill the Sabre with force,

432
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,320
feign attack tactics, Ranger outflank and attack from the rear.

433
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,360
Okay.

434
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,320
If one hit is not enough to seckill you,

435
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
take another hit!

436
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,000
Only one more hit was needed!

437
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,440
The healer

438
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,120
is like my kryptonite.

439
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Sabre, 114, 236.

440
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,920
Guns, 178, 319.

441
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,160
Reset your skills.

442
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,160
Let them know the price of trying to seckill.

443
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,400
I didn't expect Ye Qiu to have a head of steel.

444
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,280
It seems that the top four tacticians

445
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
need be re-ranked now.

446
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,800
Of the top four tacticians, only three are still around.

447
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't waste time. Draw the net in.

448
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,280
Yifan, give me a ghost array.

449
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,880
Roger that.

450
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,680
They have taken the bait.

451
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,080
Why did I get no healing?

452
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
We were tricked.

453
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,320
As I said, we were gonna seckill the Sabre with force.

454
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,400
Your heart is still so dirty.

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,080
You were right. Of the top four tacticians,

456
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,200
only three are still around.

457
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,200
What happened?

458
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,160
My bad.

459
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,680
He made two feign attacks

460
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
to trick me into relaxing my vigilance

461
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,480
and changing the formation

462
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,640
so that he would get a chance to seckill you with force.

463
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,360
Back in the old days,

464
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
you would never be more than

465
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,240
120 position units away from your teammates,

466
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
which is the maximum distance that a mega healing allows.

467
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Xinjie, your abilities have deteriorated.

468
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,120
Do you think this is over?

469
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
We have a big advantage now.

470
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,280
Advantage?

471
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,153
It seems that you have

472
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,080
greatly underestimated not only the Ambitions

473
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,920
but also the profession of healers.

474
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,360
Back off! Back off!

475
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Finally, you're here.

476
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
I didn't even get to see who was coming for me

477
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
before I was killed.

478
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,560
This guy...

479
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,360
That guy

480
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,280
is a totally different person.

481
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,600
I was wondering who was

482
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,040
the great guy that had come in Glory.

483
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,720
Turns out to be a deserter

484
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
leading a bunch of noobs.

485
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
Why didn't you change at all?

486
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,960
You fought so aggressively at the very beginning.

487
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,360
You need to control the rhythm to save your stamina.

488
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,000
So that I could be a deserter like you?

489
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
I would only go forward,

490
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
never retreat halfway!

491
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,800
Don't get involved, you guys.

492
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm going to PK him

493
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,520
alone.

494
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,160
Are you going easy on me?

495
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,040
Going easy on me

496
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,480
is equal to playing with fire.

497
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,560
At least I have the capital to play with fire.

498
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,880
What have you got?

499
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,560
If you were meaning to let me win,

500
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
just kill yourself, alright?

501
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,600
No need to put on such an act.

502
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,360
I just wanted to know

503
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,360
if you got yourself out of there

504
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,840
or got kicked out.

505
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,680
Do you need me to prove it to you?

506
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
Seems like you got yourself out of there.

507
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
See you in the matches of Glory.

508
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
That would be the real victory.

509
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
I have no plans to retire.

510
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,520
What about you?

511
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
My career

512
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,760
has to be one day longer than yours.

513
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,320
Bluffing.

514
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,640
We'll see!

515
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
The way you are looking at me

516
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,560
is making me think that

517
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,080
you got a hidden agenda.

518
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,360
The fact that you are in the mood to make a joke

519
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,120
means that your stamina is still good.

520
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,480
It's just a false image that my stamina is still good.

521
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,080
Your hands are out of strength?

522
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Not only my hands.

523
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,400
My whole body is now so weak,

524
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,360
heart racing and short of breath, dizzy and light-headed.

525
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
I really can't open this...

526
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,120
I'll help you.

527
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,720
Actually, I don't want to open it.

528
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,240
You should give me a bottle of liquor.

529
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
I promise to drink it up in one second.

530
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,400
You were saying that you felt sick a moment ago,

531
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,560
but now you're asking for liquor.

532
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,400
From today on,

533
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
the dungeon records and I will become

534
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,280
two parallel lines that never intersect.

535
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
Isn't it a tragic story that would make anyone's heart go racing

536
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,280
and short of breath, dizzy and light-headed?

537
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,240
From today on,

538
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,280
are you really going to stop breaking the dungeon records?

539
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,560
If I lost the bet, I lost the bet.

540
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
But what about the materials from the dungeons?

541
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,680
If this road is blocked,

542
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,600
let's get on another one.

543
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Why is it that the more I know about Glory,

544
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,200
the more I feel weak?

545
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,600
As I said before,

546
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
you should see the gap.

547
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,200
It's a big, big world in Glory.

548
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
You're really unlucky to have met the

549
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,800
- peak of glory at the very beginning. - The peak of Glory.

550
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,040
Sometimes I really don't know

551
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,840
whether you are telling the truth or not.

552
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,280
But as I said that I wanted to beat you,

553
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,960
I would definitely make it,

554
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,720
even if you were really the highest

555
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,520
and most insurmountable peak.

556
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,880
I'll be waiting for you at the top.

557
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,840
Thanks.

558
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,800
Ye Qiu is going to come back,

559
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,680
right?

560
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,880
Of course.

561
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,360
From today on,

562
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,640
I will pay attention to collecting information about Freelancer.

563
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Freelancer

564
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
is going to be a profession

565
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,120
that would turn the league upside down.

566
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,680
What are they doing?

567
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I was about to report to you.

568
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,240
The boss invited a House of eSports reporter over

569
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,880
to do an interview.

570
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,080
This is the interview outline.

571
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,351
=Just a few days ago, =

572
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:19,099
=Jia Shi held a retirement ceremony for Ye Qiu. =

573
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,475
=But it was a pity that =

574
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:19,940
=Master Ye Qiu did not come to

575
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:20,525
the scene to bid farewell to his fans.=

576
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,000
= What's your opinion on that?=

577
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Just a few days ago,

578
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,040
Jia Shi held a retirement ceremony for Ye Qiu.

579
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,080
But it was a pity that Master Ye Qiu

580
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,400
did not come to the scene

581
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,640
to bid farewell to his fans.

582
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,120
So we interviewed

583
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Han Wenqing, the captain of the Ambitions team.

584
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,080
As Ye Qiu's old rival and friend

585
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,440
who has great respect and empathy for him,

586
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,400
what would he say?

587
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,440
What do you think

588
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,160
about Ye Qiu's retirement?

589
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,240
Ye Qiu is not a person who would choose to give up

590
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,600
when he encounters difficulties.

591
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
Since the first league game,

592
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,160
he has been an opponent

593
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,920
that I have to deal with carefully at all times.

594
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't know why

595
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,800
he chose to retire at this point.

596
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
But I believe that

597
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,800
he will return to the league.

598
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,920
You're saying that he's going to return to the league?

599
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,760
Yes, because I didn't hear it

600
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,280
from Ye Qiu's own lips that he would give up.

601
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
So he must be continuing his fight

602
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,680
for glory at some place.

603
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,440
He didn't say that he would give up.

604
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,440
You just said that

605
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,360
that was the result of the iteration of Jia Shi.

606
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
But now we've seen that

607
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,440
the iteration is a total failure.

608
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,400
Why did you insist on doing it?

609
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Why?!

610
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
Ye Qiu is obviously still a top player.

611
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
Why did you give his position to Sun Xiang?

612
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,880
Alright! I'll give you guys an answer.

613
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,080
Actually, the reason why Ye Qiu retired

614
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,880
and we gave his position to Sun Xiang...

615
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,440
The decision was made by Ye Qiu himself.

616
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,160
He was lying to us.

617
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,120
How did you know that he had given up?

618
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,160
Doesn't the fact that he left mean that he had given up?

619
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,880
The cup is a vase now.

620
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Maybe he has walked on a new path to start over.

621
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,320
Boss, what do you think?

622
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,600
Ye Qiu will come back.

623
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,120
He will come back for sure.

624
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,600
Ye Qiu is not a person

625
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,440
who would choose to give up when he encounters difficulties.

626
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,680
Since the first league game,

627
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
he has been an opponent

628
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,800
that I have to deal with carefully at all times.

629
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,480
I don't know why

630
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,880
he chose to retire at this point.

631
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
What was Han Wenqing implying?

632
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,640
Use whatever means you can.

633
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,560
I don't want to see

634
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
any news related to Ye Qiu ever again.

635
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,800
So he must be continuing his fight

636
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,240
for glory at some place.

637
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,600
Have you watched Han Wenqing's interview?

638
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,280
Even he said that Ye Qiu would definitely return to the league.

639
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,800
And Ye Qiu never said that

640
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,680
he would give up.

641
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,080
So we must believe that

642
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,360
he is continuing his fight.

643
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
I don't believe that

644
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,920
there would be any insurmountable obstacles to him.

645
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
He has always been a person

646
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
who makes the impossible possible.

647
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,160
Let's wait for him to come back together!

648
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
=Send Red Packet=
=200.00RMB=
=Wish you prosperity!=

649
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,990
=Thank you!=

650
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,600
We'll wait for you to come back.

651
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,480
No way! Master!

652
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
You promised to help the Lanxi Pavilion

653
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,200
to raid the Line Canyon Dungeon.

654
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,480
Why are you suddenly unable to do it?

655
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,600
Don't ask me to help you to break the dungeon records again.

656
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,080
What happened?

657
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,760
Who the hell paid to get the exclusive access to your service?

658
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,920
I don't care.

659
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,880
I can give you more materials.

660
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,800
Offer another price for the Line Canyon Dungeon.

661
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,720
The new record has to be set by the Lanxi Pavilion!

662
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
A higher price won't make any difference.

663
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,498
The business of loginning to your accounts

664
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:46,320
to raid dungeons is also over.

665
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,160
What? What? What?

666
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,997
Are you really going to say goodbye

667
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:50,960
to all those precious materials

668
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,920
and go out of the business?

669
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,760
Master, you wouldn't mean to

670
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,800
retire, would you?

671
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,040
You can't!

672
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,320
You know what happened in the Kongzhi Forest.

673
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,960
The Lanxi Pavilion was not involved!

674
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,240
I won't login to your accounts again.

675
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,440
But I will get the Lanxi Pavilion

676
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,680
a new dungeon record.

677
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,680
Hold up, hold up. Let me get this straight.

678
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,280
You won't help the Lanxi Pavilion to raid the dungeon.

679
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,880
But you will get us a new record.

680
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,240
Master, your logic doesn't make any sense.

681
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,720
Please look if the adjustments are okay.
