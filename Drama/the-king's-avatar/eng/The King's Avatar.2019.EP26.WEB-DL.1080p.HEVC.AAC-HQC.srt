= Episode 25 =

3
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,253
Lao Ye, I've been tied up.

4
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,134
- What shall I do? - Fine.

5
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,523
You'll be tortured to say uncle.

6
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:41,768
It's your style!

7
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,609
Bastard, set yourself against me?

8
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:46,537
Then let me say uncle now.

9
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:59,725
- Sir. - Why did you save me?

10
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:04,135
- Sir, was I wrong? - Absolutely.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,364
You'd run away rather than spend time arraying ices.

12
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,338
You're so despicable.

13
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,385
Tricked me into attacking before stabbing me from behind.

14
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,456
Disgusting.

15
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,892
Don't you  know Lan Yu was formed on the base of Containment?

16
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,609
Yifan,

17
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,600
let's show him now what the real Containment is.

18
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,631
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:30,718
Can't you stop running away like Sun Xiang, Lao Ye?

20
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,805
Let's fight face to face if you are a man.

21
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,607
Lao Ye, it's unexpected.

22
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:55,544
You even don't dare face me today.

23
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:57,844
I'm gonna get you now.

24
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:08,346
Stop!

25
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:18,959
What're you thinking about, Shaotian? I'm just beside you.

26
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:20,712
Why don't you see me?

27
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:23,553
So the great Blade Master has been stuck, hasn't you?

28
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,893
You've got no bottom line.

29
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:28,195
You're trapping me as if I were a dungeon boss.

30
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,415
Lao Ye. I'll settle accounts with you when I come out.

31
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,168
I'm stuck.

32
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,158
On the other side,

33
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:43,095
Yi Cunhui and Windward Formation are advancing.

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,723
Brilliant Edge is gonna stop them.

35
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,553
Though Xing Xin outnumbers the opponent,

36
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:48,372
they're weak as regards their classes .

37
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:52,813
But Bao Zi appears suddenly.

38
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,282
With his brick, he's knocked down Brilliant Edge from behind.

39
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,076
It's their typical style.

40
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,824
Good job, Bao Zi.

41
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,078
The essence of Containment is never confronting enemy head-on.

42
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,887
You're a scholar now.

43
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,828
Firing from the roof,

44
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,939
Bullets Rain of Lan Yu is trying to stop Xing Xin.

45
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:28,421
Sir, our path is blocked. What shall we do now?

46
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:30,182
They've got terrain advantage.

47
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,975
Xing Xin is dodging their opponent's attack.

48
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:34,482
Using the tactic of Blocking-sight,

49
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,951
they've managed to elude the Launcher.

50
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,442
Magic Chaser!

51
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:42,322
Han Yanrou has defeated the Launcher and met his teammates.

52
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:43,655
A perfect fight won by Xing Xin.

53
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,544
Lao Wei, why are you running away?

54
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,900
We've agreed to ambush them, haven't we?

55
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
You have the right to be despicable,

56
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,487
but your teammates are innocent.

57
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,670
What? Am I wrong?

58
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:57,709
We're getting to the destination.

59
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,296
It's in the bag.

60
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,755
Before getting to the destination, XingXin are stopped by Lan Yu.

61
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,080
The ultimate fight is imminent.

62
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,468
How to fight this time?

63
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,109
I'll show you the essence of Containment.

64
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,490
Wait.

65
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:28,838
Is there anything you know about your captain and me?

66
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:33,385
Did you see that he was respectful to me when I entered the room?

67
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,669
Attack now.

68
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,190
Xing Xin made a surprise attack.

69
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:43,523
Yes, they're fighting excellently...

70
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:46,007
- Good job. - that's what you teach us.

71
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,300
Being hell-bent is always the best way to win.

72
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:56,736
Six-light Prison.

73
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,450
Facing the former captain, Yu Wenzhou doesn't hesitate at all.

74
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:00,751
The head-on fight begins...

75
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,536
between the captains of Lan Yu,

76
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,053
the operators of Swoksaar and the great warlocks

77
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,414
To fight a character he used to operate,

78
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,496
I don't know what Wei Chen is thinking about.

79
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:13,470
Captain Wei, how are you?

80
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,057
- Who is the next? - Me, captain.

81
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:30,620
Yu Wenzhou.

82
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,381
- Come here. - OK.

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,071
200 Actions per Minute is the minimum standard in pro games.

84
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,904
Some people can  even approach 400.

85
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,364
But you barely reach 200,

86
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,935
so you have to rely on your awareness to compensate for your APM.

87
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,395
For example, predict the opponent's next position.

88
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:17,063
It's a surprise that he's predicted my ambush,

89
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,828
and calculated the time I would spend arriving here.

90
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,376
Interesting.

91
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:24,605
Well done.

92
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,025
I'm just too tired. Do it again.

93
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:28,922
OK.

94
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,313
He thought he could defeat me again with the same trick.

95
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:38,294
A serious underestimation of pros.

96
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,431
Just same as the previous one.

97
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,914
Good job. One more time. I'll fight you seriously this time.

98
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,371
Thank you for your teaching.

99
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,711
You're great.

100
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm going to buy a Coke.

101
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,576
He played it steadily this time.

102
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,203
- He's improved enormously. - Yes.

103
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,164
Captain, where are you going?

104
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,415
To get a Coke, just as I said.

105
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:10,010
I'm shocked. I can get it for you.

106
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,778
But that guy, Yu Wenzhou, was so lucky to meet you.

107
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,040
You're building his confidence by deliberately losing to him.

108
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:26,525
Keep advancing.

109
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:51,049
The Arrow of Curse may kill Windward Formation if he is hit.

110
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:54,398
But it is stopped by Green Gun from Jun Moxiao.

111
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,834
How could you attack your former captain so furiously?

112
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,080
You should respect the elders.

113
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,237
Yu Wenzhou, let him go.

114
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,546
Show your kindness to him.

115
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,394
He's been under the shadow of upset since you defeated him.

116
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,553
That's why he retired abruptly.

117
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,108
Bullshit!

118
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,710
I just wanted to give young people a chance.

119
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:19,902
How dare you laugh at me like this? Let me defeat you first.

120
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,670
Are you crazy? You can't hurt your teammate.

121
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:27,232
I just want to kick your ass. I enjoy it.

122
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,541
This is an explosive situation.

123
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,977
Green Gun is going off, but the target is Windward Formation.

124
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,279
Though he can't be hurt,

125
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,342
it means something is wrong inside Xing Xin.

126
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,525
An internal conflict?

127
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,577
The situation is unexpectedly weird now.

128
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,167
Captain, I'm coming out.

129
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,238
Come on, let's kill Ye now.

130
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,439
Shit!

131
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:43,866
All the members of Lan Yu have been buried by collapsed walls.

132
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:50,595
Awesome! The members of Lan Yu must be shocked now.

133
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:53,009
Congratulations! Everyone in Xing Xin has qualified.

134
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,463
Good cooperation, Lao Wei.

135
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,240
I knew you were prodding me.

136
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:14,915
If I hadn't perceived your trick, who would cooperate with you?

137
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:18,319
When you're playing...

138
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:20,898
how did you feel?

139
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:23,580
Cut your crap. Give my Silver Equipment back to me.

140
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:30,860
= Wand of Death =

141
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:34,257
Bastard, you didn't give me my Equipment until now.

142
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:36,193
Weren’t you afraid of losing the game?

143
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,367
On the contrary,

144
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,835
relying too much on your weapon and giving up your own advantage,

145
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,319
you would lose the game.

146
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:50,241
Lao Wei,

147
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:54,416
your awareness is more important to your success...

148
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,455
than your weapon and operation.

149
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,812
Lao Wei, good job.

150
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,105
Mr. Wei, you're awesome.

151
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,509
Your tactic worked.

152
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:07,072
Now you know what Containment is.

153
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:10,071
You'll have to learn more in the future,

154
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,872
because I've got many tactics yet to teach you.

155
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:16,125
I'm thirsty. I need a Coke.

156
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:41,635
Captain Wei.

157
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:44,429
Good job.

158
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:46,944
You're better.

159
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:52,934
I'm not talking about this game.

160
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,654
The year before last, Swoksaar changed his weapon.

161
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,034
With Killing-gods Curse, he fought against Ambitions.

162
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:14,716
He won the game and just lost 15% of his Hit Points.

163
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,026
Everyone was stunned.

164
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,469
The upgrading of weapons last year...

165
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:22,706
lifted Swoksaar's attack by two levels.

166
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:30,416
The final in which Lan Yu won the championship was pretty good.

167
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,454
The audience...

168
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,941
In a word, you have been playing well in recent years.

169
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,669
You deserve to be called the First Warlock.

170
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:49,731
Swoksaar was passed on to me by you.

171
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,643
And you taught me how to play.

172
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,999
What I passed on to you was just an account.

173
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:02,117
The person making him success in League is you.

174
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,030
Speaking of teaching,

175
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,120
it seemed I didn't do it.

176
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:18,089
Do you remember when you and Shaotian played the guiding game...

177
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,217
in the training-room?

178
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:23,208
When Troubling Rain was locked by Swoksaar's Six-light Prison,

179
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,740
you told Shaotian:

180
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:31,580
" Though I can't see you because you're behind the rock,

181
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:35,024
not only can I guess what your next step will be,

182
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,675
but calculate the position you'll move to,

183
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,404
and the time you need.

184
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,857
This is predicting.

185
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:44,531
It's an ability that every warlock has to practice and master."

186
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:46,768
It's like what I said then.

187
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,110
You took care of every trainee and taught them diligently.

188
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,426
That made me raise my hand...

189
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:54,855
to ask you for a game.

190
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,966
As I said, I had never taught you.

191
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,441
You've got an exceptional talent.

192
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,249
Though I won the game,

193
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,590
I had learned all your tactics.

194
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:11,900
I couldn't succeed without you.

195
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,399
It was your inspiration that brought me here.

196
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,861
For these years,

197
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,387
I've always wanted to tell you...

198
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,151
Thank you, captain.

199
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,470
Yu Wenzhou.

200
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,883
Passing Lan Yu and Swoksaar on to you...

201
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,903
was a right thing I did.

202
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,640
Mr. Wei, Mr. Wei...

203
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:02,886
Sir...

204
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,599
In order to prevent you from disappearing again,

205
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,988
I bought all kinds of Coke for you.

206
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,280
See? Flavor of ginger, vanilla, the best-selling blue one,

207
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:14,305
and the pink cherry flavor you like best.

208
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,289
But promise: never run away again.

209
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:22,886
This time,

210
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,456
I won't.

211
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,606
Mr. Wei's tactics are still unorthodox.

212
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:35,550
But...

213
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:37,636
I like them.

214
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,064
Really?

215
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:44,881
So do I.

216
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,750
Leaving Lan Yu and quitting Glory...

217
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,368
Do you think...

218
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,590
it's a bad decision then?

219
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,121
Why do you like to talk such nonsense?

220
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:15,970
The defeat still haunts you, doesn't it?

221
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:21,072
The defeat was really one of the main reasons why I retired.

222
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,127
Denying it...

223
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,808
because I don't want to admit it.

224
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,824
I'd have been playing in Glory for another two or three years.

225
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,195
But it was impossible.

226
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,338
My time has passed.

227
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:43,670
 If you like,

228
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,019
anything is possible.

229
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:49,741
Do you think...

230
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,468
 I am still as good as I used to be?

231
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,384
It's true that tactics and people would be out of date.

232
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,653
But all the tactics are created by the successors...

233
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:05,169
standing on the shoulders of their predecessors.

234
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:07,741
Being outdated may be an disadvantage,

235
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,867
but it can be transformed into an advantage.

236
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,136
Yu Wenzhou understood it then.

237
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,112
Don't you understand it now?

238
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,032
So you really lost to him.

239
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:33,264
These kids can easily surpass me.

240
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,709
So can the kids under you.

241
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,193
I thought they would ignore the old tactics.

242
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:46,397
But, it turned out...

243
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,937
the game made me excited when I was playing.

244
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:56,865
So...

245
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:58,523
join Xing Xin?

246
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:12,901
= Team Xing Xin =

247
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,827
= Team Xing Xin =

248
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,230
= Ye Xiu, Tang Rou, Qiao Yifan, Bao Zi, Luo Ji, An Wenyi =

249
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,930
= Ye Xiu,Tang Rou,Qiao Yifan,Bao Zi,Luo Ji,An Wenyi, Wei Chen =

250
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,714
We have qualified.

251
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:24,647
Really?

252
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,931
Jia Shi is the first, and we are the last.

253
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,694
It's humiliating.

254
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:33,359
So you have to practice diligently.

255
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,442
Our ranking is not good,

256
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:39,877
but we've qualified.

257
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:43,313
That means the first and the last are on the same starting line.

258
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:49,214
OK, that's all for today.

259
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:50,538
= Team Jia Shi =

260
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:51,650
Thank you.
= Team Jia Shi =

261
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,047
Captain Xiao.

262
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,220
Our team won the first in the Tutor Selection.

263
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,538
- We should celebrate, OK? - Yes.

264
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,339
Let's go to Eagle's Nest.

265
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:01,505
- OK. - Good.

266
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,100
Though we can't drink,
= Team Xing Xin =

267
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:04,639
we can enjoy the food.

268
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,805
Xing Xin has qualified, too.

269
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,756
It's par for the course.

270
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,533
We'll meet them some day.

271
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,596
That's not necessarily true.

272
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:18,406
You go to celebrate. I've got something to do.

273
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:21,051
= News on Glory =

274
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:23,693
20 teams qualifying for the Challenge have emerged.
= News on Glory =

275
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,835
But a private arrangement has been made...
= News on Glory =

276
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,598
between Jia Shi, rated No.1, and Xing Xin, rated No.20.
= News on Glory =

277
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,621
They're going to have an extra game,

278
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,844
whose result will affect Xing Xin's advancing in the League.

279
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:46,710
Although it conforms to the rules,

280
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:50,233
the Demolish style is opportunistic.

281
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,003
I didn't know until today...

282
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,328
that Xing Xin succeeded in qualifying with this tactic.

283
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,311
Why are you coming back...

284
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,033
with such an embarrassed manner?

285
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:04,588
Captain Sun.

286
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,771
It's more meaningful to study your opponent's tactics...

287
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:09,865
than to laugh at them.

288
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:11,056
Besides,

289
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm here today just as a friend,

290
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:18,380
not the Chairman of League, OK?

291
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,491
A stolen win.

292
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:22,601
- Shameful. - Is Jia Shi scared...

293
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:25,338
that I'm coming back?

294
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:26,449
Captain Ye,

295
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:27,909
what's your point?

296
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:29,209
You don't know us.

297
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,233
We haven't had a fight yet.

298
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,487
So let's have a fight.

299
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:35,153
The problem of strength should be solved by strength.

300
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,755
I'm afraid...

301
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,566
you won't win anyone in my team without cheating.

302
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:40,993
Captain Ye,

303
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:43,167
do you dare to fight?

304
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,530
If Xing Xin fails,

305
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,197
it will voluntarily withdraw from Challenge.

306
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,283
I'd also like to know...

307
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:54,100
if you've got the strength qualifying for Challenge.

308
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,560
Sooner or later,

309
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,100
we'll inevitably fight against Jia Shi.

310
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:02,838
This fight is an excellent opportunity to practice.

311
00:23:03,186 --> 00:23:05,884
We're gonna have a real fight with the real pro team.

312
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:08,788
Only in this way can we expose all our problems and shortcomings.

313
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:09,939
This fight,

314
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:11,542
we have to take.

315
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:13,223
Mr. Tao.

316
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:15,016
Do you have any idea...

317
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:18,936
why Sun Xiang strongly proposed to have a fight with Xing Xin?

318
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,722
Since his transfer to Jia Shi,
= Team Jia Shi =

319
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:24,840
Sun Xiang has in fact been thinking of beating Ye Qiu.

320
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,666
Captain Ye Qiu left Jia Shi,

321
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,768
and Sun, the best rookie, became the new leader.

322
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,625
It's a big pressure for him.

323
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:35,410
Now Jia Shi has been demoted into the Challenge.

324
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,822
Sun Xiang is surely feeling more stressed.

325
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,845
He's making trouble with Ye Qiu.

326
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:42,988
He's anxious to prove that he is as good as Ye Qiu.

327
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:45,892
Stubbornness will stick into the subconscious...

328
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,193
after existing for a long time.

329
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,725
This would be a fatal problem...

330
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,066
in the Challenge.

331
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,263
Not only Sun Xiang,

332
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,454
but everyone in Jia Shi thinks so.

333
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:01,802
Though Ye retired from Jia Shi,

334
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:05,214
his imprint left in it is too deep.

335
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,190
We've been fighting against his shadow.

336
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,452
This is bound to affect our own pace.

337
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:14,423
So, in your opinion,

338
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,708
what should Jia Shi do now?

339
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,739
Defeating Ye is just a small step on our way to championship.

340
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,318
We can strategically despise our opponent,

341
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,421
but have to tactically attach weight to them.

342
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,778
But...

343
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,721
if Xing Xin wins...

344
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,507
Then it would rather be an encouragement for Sun.

345
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:42,003
Sooner or later, we'll fight against Jia Shi.

346
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,757
The extra game is our best chance to investigate our opponent.

347
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:47,042
Luo Ji, it's your turn.

348
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,597
Though we need to kill just one player...
= Starting line-up of Team Jia Shi =

349
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,271
in the fight against Jia Shi,

350
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:55,588
we'll be under much greater pressure than usual because of him,

351
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,308
Xiao Shiqin.

352
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:03,180
Like our captain, he is one of the Four Best Tacticians.

353
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:06,533
There are few flaws in his awareness and operation.

354
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,607
He's always been the leader in the previous team games.

355
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:14,281
Jia Shi neglected tactics before Xiao joined it,
= Xiao Shiqin =

356
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,431
so it always lost in team games.

357
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,621
But everything has changed since he joined it.

358
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,946
He is now claimed to be the central core in Team Jia Shi.

359
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,217
How to defeat them?

360
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,640
= Xiao Shiqin =

361
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:31,156
Cut the central core off, then smash it.

362
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:32,322
Cool.

363
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:34,305
Who will do it?

364
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:40,797
The weakness of Mechanics is that they are slower and less HP.

365
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,740
We need a character who is highly explosive and lethal,

366
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:46,701
and can launch a surprise attack to kill him with one blow.

367
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:50,581
It's better if he is very familiar with the terrain,

368
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,700
so he can hide himself if necessary.

369
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,866
That would be perfect.

370
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,159
I've got a candidate.

371
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:25,448
Take it easy.

372
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,058
I'm not here to fight.

373
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:30,685
Do you know Team Xing Xin?

374
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,392
You should know eSports...

375
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:44,161
and I'm the Bossy Captain.

376
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:10,847
He's stubborn as a mule.

377
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,616
That's a problem.

378
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,515
You've got a girlfriend?

379
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,619
- Yes. - How do you feel?

380
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,443
It's hard to say...

381
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:25,958
There's nothing hard about it.

382
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:29,450
Are you messing around with me?

383
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:31,259
Such a useless boy!

384
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:34,838
Is he really "Deception"?

385
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,386
His real name is Mo Fan, the cashier of the cafe.

386
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:40,766
My information has always been accurate.

387
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:46,583
You don't think he is too old, do you?

388
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,288
Playing Glory in his age means he loves the game.

389
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:52,129
- But... - Are you blind?

390
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,573
- He's too fat. - Don't you see me here?

391
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:58,525
In fact he's very agile, and you can see it from his Ninja.

392
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,143
Now!

393
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:03,040
Such an asshole!

394
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,253
- He's too fierce. - Fierce?

395
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,260
A Ninja has to be fierce.

396
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:12,038
If he's not fierce, how could he break into enemy's camps?

397
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,657
Sir, what shall we do now?

398
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:18,045
He's a fierce and grim guy,

399
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,250
so we can't confront him.

400
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:24,097
We should influence him.

401
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:28,858
Do it now.

402
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,814
What?

403
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:44,076
It's your duty, Bossy Captain.

404
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:07,123
Hi, I'm Jun Moxiao.

405
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,115
Mr. Jun, what can I do for you?

406
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:15,812
Three cups of...

407
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:19,637
Flat White.

408
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:22,755
= Americano =
= 3 cups,  ￥72 =

409
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:27,414
I want Flat White, not Americano.

410
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,533
It doesn't matter here. Take it easy.

411
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:33,095
Three Flat Whites.

412
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:36,540
- Buddy, are you... - Boss!

413
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:39,922
Sir,

414
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:41,747
what're you doing here?

415
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,675
Just passing by.

416
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:47,776
Wait.

417
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,941
Let me see...

418
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,877
They are Flat Whites,

419
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:59,130
but on the bill, it's the price of Americano.

420
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:01,083
What the hell is it?

421
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:02,542
You!

422
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:04,280
What the hell is it?

423
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,415
What's your name?

424
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,795
Sir, come here.

425
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:10,684
Sir.

426
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:12,580
Take a seat.

427
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:14,017
Sir.

428
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:18,174
He's a rookie who knows nothing.

429
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,507
It's all my fault.

430
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:24,172
Mr. Liu, you're too kind.

431
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,275
- Here you are. - How could you manage the cafe like this?

432
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,241
Last time, it was me who found out...

433
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,106
some employee was swapping our goods in kitchen.

434
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,227
Listen:

435
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:38,561
every rookie has to be scrutinized.

436
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:41,442
Come here.

437
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:43,261
Now!

438
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,386
Apologize to our boss.

439
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,671
Cut your crap!

440
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:51,393
Is this a problem you can fix with an apology?

441
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,464
You, bring me all the bills here.

442
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:55,646
Let me check them.

443
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,752
Sir,

444
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:09,203
raise your foot.

445
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:21,440
Glory Card.

446
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,178
I see.

447
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,470
You've been embezzling the money in cafe,

448
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,400
to buy equipments in Glory?

449
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:29,351
I shouldn't have trusted you!

450
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:37,025
How dare you snatch the card?

451
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,406
Don't you want the job?

452
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,161
Shit. He's gone away. Mo Fan is him.

453
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,803
Let him go. He is a mute kid.

454
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,589
He maybe won't express clearly his coordinates during the game.

455
00:31:58,613 --> 00:31:59,501
Forget him.

456
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,080
No, we need him.

457
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:02,960
But...

458
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:06,730
a special guy has to be recruited in a special way.

459
00:32:16,954 --> 00:32:17,747
I'm coming.

460
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:20,421
Don't worry. I've got everything.

461
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:36,880
= Wanghe Pavilion =

462
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:49,647
= Deception is on line =

463
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,320
Wanting a guy like him to talk,

464
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:22,090
you must start with something he knows well.

465
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:24,103
If Glory is the only thing he cares about,

466
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:27,277
we'll have a chance to recruit him.

467
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,399
What do you think about joining Xing Xin?

468
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:21,724
Join us?

469
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,413
= Deception is on line =

470
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:53,602
No way to escape.

471
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,355
Want to be killed again?

472
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,509
Your tactic has forced him to kill himself.

473
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,747
Even as a senior opportunist , I can't do this.

474
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:24,699
If a tactic works, it doesn't matter whether it's dirty or not.

475
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:27,722
If Glory has something very special for him,

476
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,571
I have to destroy the special element.

477
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:33,095
However,

478
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,967
he'll be downgraded in this way.

479
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:39,506
Then, even if he is recruited, he won't be able to compete.

480
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,252
Fair enough.

481
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:55,025
Think about it.

482
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:56,889
Join us.

483
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:00,127
Forget it.

484
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,906
He'll never escape the well.

485
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,565
What a torment! But I like it.

486
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:06,740
He wants to kill himself.

487
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,144
Sometimes, it's also not easy to die.

488
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:28,623
How are you feeling as being trapped inside the well?

489
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:32,851
You're crazy. What do you want from me?

490
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:36,684
From now on,

491
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,057
the well is your only area you can move freely in Glory.

492
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:47,654
It's the address of our team.

493
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:50,375
If you want to join us or seek revenge,

494
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:51,716
come here.

495
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:55,152
Of course, I personally hope you'll join us,

496
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:57,008
because I don't like to fight a rookie.

497
00:37:57,635 --> 00:37:58,381
Right?

498
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:00,975
Xing Xin Net Cafe.

499
00:38:05,555 --> 00:38:07,737
Look, he is off line.

500
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:09,102
We're waiting.

501
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:10,776
He'll be back.

502
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,365
Bao Zi, it's your turn.

503
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:11,769
Hi, we meet again.

504
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,998
Windy or rainy, I'll always be waiting for you here.

505
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:20,462
OK.

506
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:58,742
= Team Xing Xin =

507
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,868
I'll take back my Glory.

508
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:05,722
In other companies,

509
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,888
I heard something called "Team Building",

510
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,111
which is very useful.

511
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:12,831
Jun Moxiao.

512
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:23,091
Welcome to Xing Xin.

513
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:29,836
Sporting area.

514
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:32,549
You can relax here during training.

515
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,501
Massage chairs.

516
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,088
I like them.

517
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:42,675
This is where everyone practices.

518
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:45,515
This is our power supply.

519
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,817
Never touch it when you're training.

520
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,841
Otherwise, all the computers will be dead.

521
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:54,761
- You got it? - Yes.

522
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:01,928
Everyone's account card is kept here.

523
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:03,341
So is yours.

524
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,420
Who was so careless,

525
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:10,515
putting my Jun Moxiao here?

526
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:14,538
If I lose it, I'll lose the most precious Umbrella in Glory.

527
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:22,641
I'm done.

528
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:24,291
Go around here by yourself.

529
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:25,401
OK.
