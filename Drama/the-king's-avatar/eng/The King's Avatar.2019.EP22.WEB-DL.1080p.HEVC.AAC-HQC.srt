Met an incompetent teammate.

4
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,180
Real bad luck.

5
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,730
I admit my defeat.

6
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,410
I'm ashamed to ask for a contract.

7
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,980
Bye!

8

Captain.

15
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,780
It was my fault.

16
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,902
I wasn't a good commander.

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,700
Stay with us.

18
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,690
I'll grant...

19
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,880
your additional requests, too.

20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,977
I look forward to a smooth cooperation.

21
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,097
For the team's long-term development,

22
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:17,860
we need to cultivate new talents for the second echelon.

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,205
Do you have plans about the future development?

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,660
It's kinda early to talk about things that are far away.

25
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,660
Then let's talk about the present.

26
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,611
How should we pay An Wenyi? Any idea?

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,150
I need to do some cost calculation.

28
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,410
Then sign him as soon as possible.

29
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,070
I...

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,300
haven't think about it...

31
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,930
You haven't?

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,420
You should have figured out these before the interview.

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,460
Look.

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,140
An Wenyi's Exclusive Program.

35
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,980
There are three parts in An Wenyi's Exclusive Program.

36
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,970
Skills.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,020
Life.

38
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,110
Mental health.

39
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,580
Three things need to be improved of his skills.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,222
Pressure resistance training.

About compression resistance training...

47
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,400
I understand all those.

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,140
But...

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,725
Why mental health?

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,060
Mental health is the most important of all.

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,380
It will affect the whole team's morale.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,950
How should we dissolve their negative emotions?

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,020
How should we stimulate their passion when training?

54
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,051
How should we guide them to be self-disciplined?

55
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,980
When you are the bad cop and criticize them,

56
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,230
how should I vindicate your authority as the captain?

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,040
Meanwhile, pacify their emotions?

58
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,300
Isn't it important?

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,340
What are you doing?

60
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,531
To stop me from talking by asking me to drink water?

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,720
I mean... Let's make tea liquor...

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,062
Toast to our good boss of Xing Xin!

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,950
This compliment has come a bit early.

64
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,382
Then let's toast to our boss...

65
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,337
...who is not good enough but wants to be good enough...

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,830
and who is not sure whether she'd be great...

67
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:37,611
Toast to you!

68
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,580
Captain.

69
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,870
It's late. You still up?

70
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,068
I'm here to report to you.

71
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,205
Go ahead.

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,291
I've summed up what I didn't do well in today's interview.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,580
No. 1:

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,170
I didn't prepare enough.

75
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,668
So I almost screwed things up.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,860
No. 2:

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,948
My performance in the training match was poor.

78
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:16,628
Nearly missed a good Cleric for our team.

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,260
And...

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,900
Captain...

81
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,700
Do you think...

82
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,177
It's late.

83
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,308
Get some rest.

84
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,640
Do you think I'm qualified...

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,940
...to be the vice captain?

86
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,908
You're questioning yourself is because...

87
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,651
you haven't found your huge potential.

88

89
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,371
That's the brief about Kongzhi Forest.

90
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,622
If we follow the position we've planned,

91
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,600
two team players will get through for sure.

92

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,188
Why use this array?
= Xing Xin Team =

95
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,297
Why use this array?

96
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,660
I'll explain.

97
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,011
There are two Witches in Team Wei Cao.

98
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,140
So they have a big attack range.

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,617
We'll have to disperse our positions.

100
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,651
Otherwise, we'll not break through.

101
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,388
If we disperse our positions and they divide and conquer,

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,702
what should we do?

103
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,937
Bao Zi, wait a sec.

104
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,885
Let Yifan finish it.

105
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,820
Go on, Yifan.

106
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,090
So, let's make a plan first.

107
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,820
Deploy three team players to surround the two Witches.

108
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,240
Then other team players can reach the terminus.

109
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,420
But Gao Yingjie and Wang Jiexi are very flexible.

110
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,440
If we deploy three players to surround two Witches,

111
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,780
the rest of us will face a "two-against-three" battle.

112
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,497
It's much easier to collapse.

113
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,100
You asked me not to argue.

114
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,160
But you're arguing now.

115
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,600
Yifan, relax, go on.

116
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,700
So...

117
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:53,660
We'll have to protect the only Cleric of ours.

118
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,400
I have a plan.

119
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,354
Protect An Wenyi with two players working together.

120
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,022
What about the two Witches?

121
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,394
Were you really a former player in Wei Cao?

122
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,060
How did Wang Jiexi gain the title of Magician?

123
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,057
His tactics are very variable.

124
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,030
When Wei Cao vs. Xing Xin, would he use normal tactics?

125
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,480
Let's me put it this way.

126
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,930
Right now, Xing Xin is just a grass-root team.

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,160
As long as they kill the captain,

128
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,270
others will be defeated once and for all.

129
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,540
So in my opinion,

130
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,611
their first target should not be me.

131
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,100
It's...

132
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,140
... the captain.

133
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,620
Made sense.

134
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,890
Let's wait for the captain.

135
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Then hold the meeting, OK?

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,550
That's right.

137
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,680
Where is the captain?

138
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,542
Master.

139
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,660
I'd come to apologize as soon as I knew who you are.

140
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,340
But I was on a business trip.

141
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,497
Just came back today.

142
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:16,342
So I'm late for 28 days, 7 hours, 6 minutes and 5 secs.

143
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,600
I'd rather I was never late.

144
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,690
Mas....

145
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,737
Keep a low key.

146
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,000
OK, OK.

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,690
Don't worry, please.

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,457
I'll keep it secret even though I know you're the master.

149
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,320
Good business trip meals!

150
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:33,382
You've gained weight.

151
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,080
Have I?

152
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,268
It must be puffiness.

153
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,280
What I've been thinking is how I should apologize to you.

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
Can't even eat or sleep.

155
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,700
Master.

156
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,890
I was blind.

158
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,154
Not only didn't recognize you,

159
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,571
but also treated you as a network manager.

160
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,670
These are hyacinth flavored cookies.

161
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,074
You can view them as me.

162
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,220
Forcibly open the package.

163
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,510
Squeeze it violently.

164
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,810
Take the cookies out vigorously.

165
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,460
Then squeeze them.

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,890
Whatever you want.

167
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,630
Stop it.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,180
- What's more? - Here.

169
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,530
It's a phone shell I especially prepared for you.

170
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,040
Hope it'll be around you every day.

171
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,480
It's one way to protect the heart broken by me.

172
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,685
Sounds good?

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,977
It's pretty.

174
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,900
And...

175
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,594
Master, did you smell it?

176
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,420
Smell it!

177
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,710
You'll smell hyacinth in the air.

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,611
The smell will be surrounding you.

179
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:26,600
Listen!

180
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,740
They are all saying one thing...

181
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,342
...on my behalf:

182
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:31,588
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,620
Excuse me.

184
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm allergic to hyacinth.

185
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,820
Look at this.

186
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:46,500
And this.

187
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:47,820
And this.

188
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,548
Master...

189
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,365
Could you please have a look?

190
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,700
I prepared all these hyacinth gifts.

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,270
I don't want to hear you apologize anymore.

192
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,382
Cut the chase.

193
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,245
Why are you meeting me?

194
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,560
Master, look at this.

195
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,740
- What's this? - Someone wrote it for House of eSports.

196
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,450
The chief editor plans to publish it tomorrow.

197
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm worried it'd cause adverse impacts on Xing Xin.

198
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,100
So I'm here to ask you to read it through.

199
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,382
I heard when they were interviewing Wei Cao,

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,051
Wang Jiexi said a former player in Wei Cao would be in Tutor Selection.

201
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,860
What he did mean was Qiao Yifan could do well.

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,850
But the writer was interpreting out of context.

203
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,940
That was just for stunt.

204
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,150
= "Qiao Yifan, Burden of Xing Xin's Rising in Rank" =
Look at the title.

205
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,251
Look at the title.

206
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,060
= "Qiao Yifan, Burden of Xing Xin's Rising in Rank" =
Who wouldn't be mad when reading this?

207
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,354
= "Qiao Yifan, Burden of Xing Xin's Rising in Rank" =

208
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,630
It is provoking.

209
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,570
Exactly!

210
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,022
So I have an assumption.

211
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,460
Someone is targeting Xing Xin.

212
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,600
They aim at creating public pressure.

213
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,920
It's possible.

214
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,650
Am I right?

215
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,268
As a rookie, he'd be easily destroyed by the public voice.

216
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,410
So, if the essay came out,

217
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,542
it'd make influence on Qiao Yifan's performance.

218
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,700
It makes sense.

219
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,820
Thank you!

220
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,880
To be honest, I hate unfair competitions.

221
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,108
They should focus more on training instead of these tricks.

222
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,634
Right?

223
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,950
So, in your opinion...

224
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,460
What should we do?

225
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,980
Master.

226
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,990
Don't worry.

227
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,300
I've got a plan.

228
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,180
No matter what the director says,

229
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,540
if you want to cancel it, I'll make sure it won't be published!

230
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,005
Publish it.

231
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,920
But...

232
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,142
As a professional player,

233
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,302
learning to face questions...

234
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,420
...is something he must do.

235
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,940
Master! Wait!

236
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,114
= I'm sorry. =

237
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,308
You don't want to hear it.

238
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,988
= I'm sorry. =
How about just looking at it?

239
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,377
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

240
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,170
Captain.

241
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,980
I've thought about everything thoroughly.

242
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,582
An Wenyi is very important in the competition days later.

243
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,531
If we want Xiao An to do his best,

244
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,817
we should buy him a set of new equipment.

245
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,125
I'm afraid my salary is not enough for it.

246
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,950
If we can't...

247
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,885
Could we at least send Tang Rou to protect him?

248
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,914
Otherwise, Xiao An could be our technological weakness.

249
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,371
It's not the only weakness.

250
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,510
If we can't send Tang Rou, could we send Bao Zi?

251
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,540
Bao Zi is flexible.

252
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,990
He can back up anytime.

253
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,700
Captain.

254
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,640
If...

255
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,420
...nothing would work...

256
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:49,097
we may have to change our tactics.

257
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,100
I know what to do.

258
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,091
I'll instruct you.

259
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,188
You try to fix it.

260
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,140
Perfect.

261
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:01,020
Come on.

262
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,720
= Computer Assembly and Repair =

263
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,640
Captain.

264
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,617
Are you teaching me how to fix the computer?

265
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,068
I won't.

266
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,900
It will.

267
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,060
Captain.

268
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,830
I don't think so.

269
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,820
I might damage it.

270
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,337
If you think that way, bad thing will happen.

271
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,700
What's that law?

272
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,360
Murphy's law.

273
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,274
Start.

274
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,497
Here.

275
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,548
Pass me the book.

276
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,005
Start from cable winding displacement.

277
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,782
Read this page.

278
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,502
Cable winding displacement...

279
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,190
Captain.

280
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,220
Is it OK?

281
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,780
Something wrong with your routing.

282
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,662
It's not artistic.

283
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:07,942
Artistic?

284
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,420
On this page.

285
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:20,114
Captain.

286
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,060
Is it OK?

287
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,780
It's a mess.

288
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,170
It's... even worse...

289
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,070
Sit down.

290
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,868
You talked about everyone's problem.

291
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,640
But left yours out.

292
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,940
You adopted others' suggestions.

293
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,925
But never thought about your own feelings.

294
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,160
Your task is not that complicated.

295
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,845
What you need to do is fix the computer.

296
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,230
Captain.

297
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,440
I may know what to do.

298
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,891
What should you do?

299
00:15:59,660 --> 00:15:59,980
Hello.

300
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,268
Is it Technician Wang?

301
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,370
Yes.

302
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,577
We need you to fix the computer.

303
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,120
No. 11 on the King's Avenue.

304
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:05,860
Xing Xin Net Cafe.

305
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,982
It's an easier way.

306
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,954
And more effective.

307
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,480
= Computer Repair Bill =

308
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,520
Was it a waste?

How could you do it?

314
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,931
You wasted your training time fixing the computer.

315
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,508
Wasn't it a waste? Wasn't it extravagant?

316
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:26,651
Shouldn't you introspect yourselves?

317
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,860
Captain.

318
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,120
Did we spend too much?

319
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,777
- Don't talk about money with me. - The boss is mad.

320
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,710
I've told you many times.

321
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,590
Your time is way more important than money.

322
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,140
Let's me emphasize it again.

323
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,920
Training and competing is what you should do.

324
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,570
Making money is what I should do.

325
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,697
Why standing here?

326
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,680
Go training!

327
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:56,990
Yes.

328
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,205
Let's go training.

329
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,140
Captain.

330
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,245
Why didn't you mention buying new equipment for An Wenyi?

331
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,180
It costs money.

332
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,700
Yes...

333
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,022
But the boss said training was more important than money.

334
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,622
Remember this.

335
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,240
Many things mean opposite to what people say.

336
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,070
The boss has spent much money on wrong things.

337
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,737
We shouldn't rub salt into her wound.

338
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,060
Spending money on wrong things?

339
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,650
But spending money on fixing computers is normal.

340
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,970
Maybe...

341
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
It was not normal maintenance.

342
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,142
I broke this computer.

343
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,714
To get more equipment?

344
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,330
Yep.

345
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,540
To equip our new team player, An Wenyi.

346
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,160
But where should we get the equipment?

347
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,062
Today, I'll show you what is scrap-picking.

348
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
A great profession.

349
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,320
Three guilds are attacking Gunsmoke, the jungle boss.

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,860
What should we do?

351
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,780
We stay put.

352
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,870
Watch their show quietly.

353
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,540
What a mess!

354
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,742
The messier, the better for us to scrap-pick.

355
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,420
Captain.

356
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,870
What is scrap-picking?

357
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,460
It means in the flames of war,

358
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,708
tough guys pillage from others aboveboard.

359
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,340
Is it the so-called "tough guys pillaging from others aboveboard"?

360
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,940
Well.

361
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,380
The first profound meaning of scrap-picking is to win without fighting.

362
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,470
Go!

363
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,900
Run as soon as you've picked up the equipment!

364
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
To win without fighting?

365
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,610
Indeed!

366
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,520
Absolutely!

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,270
When did I lie?

368
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,310
Run faster!

369
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,510
Captain.

370
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,690
They caught up with us.

371
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,330
It's a dead end in front. What should we do?

372
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,548
Then comes the second profound meaning of it.

373
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,765
Remember.

374
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,030
Keep a way open for retreat anytime.

375
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,870
Worm in?

376
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,091
Go!

377
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,114
Stop looking for them.

378
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,257
Fight against the boss!

379
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,274
Captain.

380
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,270
The three guilds have lured the boss here.

381
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,930
Should we rob him?

382
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,390
We won't rob him this time.

383
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,365
Instead, we pick up equipment when it's a mess.

384
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,862
But players in the three guilds are in harmony.

385
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,691
Haven't seen an opportunity.

386
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,674
So now, comes the final profound meaning of scrap-picking.

387
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,868
If there is no chance,

388
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,660
we'll create one.

389
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,560
Watch me shoot them.

390
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
Then they'll start a scuffle.

391
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,300
Who shot us?

392
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,205
I knew you'd have an agenda!

393
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,180
You said we'd divide the equipment equally?

394
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,140
Bullshit!

395
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:46,605
Watch your mouth!

396
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,451
Make war!

397
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,070
Who cares?

398
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,930
Bros in Lanxi Pavilion, let's fight against Ambitions!

399
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,260
They shot us unexpectedly!

400
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,710
Don't let Praisage go!

401
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,125
They love dirty fighting!

402
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:09,874
Captain.

403
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,340
You're a prophet!

404
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,860
Now...

405
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,100
Comes the perfect timing.

406
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:22,285
Our first target is Cleric's top equipment, Frigid Defender.

407
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,834
We need to better unite in mess situations.

408
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,350
Even when scrap-picking, we need to team up.

409
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,091
If we use the right methods, battle field can be our stage.

410
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,714
I saw Frigid Defender!

411
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,580
Captain.

412
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:51,000
A guy named Deception took it away!

413
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,940
I'll go after him.

414
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:55,860
Yifan.

415
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,820
Take care of things here.

416
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,950
Underling.

417
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,140
What should we do next?

418
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,330
Continue scrap-picking.

419
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,690
Target the Cleric.

420
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,120
Collect everything Xiao An needs.

421
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,670
Wait. Look around.

422
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,840
Scrap-picking from us?

423
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,540
Walk over my dead body!

424
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,302
Tang Rou has found a weak spot.

425
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,731
We need to break through quickly!

426
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,182
Xiao An, come closer to us.

427
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,800
Xiao An.

428
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,500
No need.

429
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,260
Xiao An!

430
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,220
Watch out!

431
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,840
Bao Zi, I found Xiao An.

432
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,770
Come and back up.

433
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,520
Escort him out.

434
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,070
Coming!

435
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,748
I told you not to come! Why are you here?

436
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,680
Hi, friend.

437
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
You've got good skills.

438
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,680
But you've encountered me.

439
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,420
= Frigid Defender has been damaged. =

440
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,730
Now what?

441
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,160
You led us to ace. Happy?

442
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,085
It's fine.

443
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,260
Yifan did it to save you.

444
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,040
To save me?

445
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,860
I saw the Swordsman.

446
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,177
Why I didn't attack him?

447
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,337
I didn't want to alert the three guilds.

448
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,940
He didn't have much blood.

449
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,788
What would happen even if he raided me?

450
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,620
Could he kill me?

451
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,930
No way!

452
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,180
But you...

453
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,180
You took the plunge.

454
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,490
And got us all killed!

455
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,700
You didn't even make right judgment of Glory!

456
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,940
My fault. I didn't look around.

457
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,380
Yep.

458
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,400
Your fault.

459
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
You didn't look around.

460
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,260
And Bao zi.

461
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,382
Came too quickly to back up.

462
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,190
But who should we blame the most? Me?

463
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,660
I shouldn't have picked the equipment.

464
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,490
Right?

465
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:05,830
Guys.

466
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,750
The competition is coming.

467
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,060
We didn't get the equipment we need.

468
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,411
= Xing Xin Team =
What's worse, we lost the only Orange equipment!

469
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,070
So ridiculous!

470
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,062
Why did we do it?

471
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:16,900
Sorry.

472
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,942
With your poor judgment,

473
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,028
I'd suggest you should not be a professional player.

474
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,820
Captain.

475
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,260
Was I wrong?

476
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,540
What do you think?

477
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,300
Yifan.

478
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,550
I've valued your overall awareness.

479
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,970
But I don't want it to be...

480
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,457
...your burden.

481
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,580
Yifan showed his weakness here.

482
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,010
We can see clearly he reacted more slowly here.

483
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,497
He used one more second

484
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,102
when he could have reacted in subconsciousness.

485
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,780
The he missed the best timing... to react.

486
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,857
Didn't make adjustments in time after the mess.

487
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,070
Also, he made mistakes.

488
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,100
Yes.

489
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,960
His hit rate should have been 70%.

490
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,510
But now it's 30%.

491
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,710
But...

492
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,560
It' not the most fatal.

493
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,502
The most fatal thing is...

494
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,657
His overall awareness was limited.

495
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,131
Penny wise and pound foolish.

496
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,182
More harm than good.

497
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,940
Send him the report.

498
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,440
= House of eSports =

499
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,960
Should we hide this magazine from him?

500
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,942
I'm afraid Yifan would be stressed out after reading it.

501
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,091
There is no burden in our Xing Xin Team.

502
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,380
Actually...

503
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,565
Yifan's grown the fastest among all.

504
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,950
But I...

505
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
I'm afraid Yifan could not handle the questions.

506
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,950
Learning to face questions is something he must do.

507
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,337
He's a professional player.

508
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,302
Yifan's overall awareness has become his burden.

509
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,140
What he needs to do is let go and believe in himself.

510
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,257
But no one could ever instruct him.

511
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,171
Whether he'd make it or not... depends on himself.

512
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,620
What I can do now is...

513
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,450
...to push him hard.

514
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,125
But...

515
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,942
You've got great overall awareness.

516
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,660
But it can't help the team kill more rivals.

517
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,668
It could help the team win.

518
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,125
What you've got is precious.

519
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,620
Do you think I'm qualified...

520
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,628
...to be the vice captain?

521
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,714
= Tactics =

522
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,420
Yifan.

523
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,382
I've valued your overall awareness.

524
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,890
But I don't want it...

525
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,820
...to be your burden.

526
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,700
They had to scrap-pick to get equipment.

527
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,502
How impoverished! How could I join them at first?

528
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,982
I'd better get my money and leave.

529
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,217
I don't want act like them.

530
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,920
They've got a stupid dream of being professional players.

531
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,251
It makes them full of beans.

532
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,885
Money is the only dream, right?

533
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,790
Sure!

534
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,190
I've found another team.

535
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,220
I'll contact them later.

536
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,140
I'll tell them I can...

537
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,030
Call you back soon.

538
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,860
Could we talk?

539
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,900
Just for a moment.

540
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,180
Sit down.

541
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,060
Water?

542
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,460
Nope.

543
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,160
I want to make it clear.

544
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,850
The problems were serious when scrap-picking.

545
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,245
Bad command.

546
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,262
Disordered team work.

547
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,190
Let alone...

548
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,420
Let alone they didn't get any good equipment for you.

549
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,000
Though I don't know much about techniques,

550
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
I do know equipment is important for a professional player.

551
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,582
I need to keep up your pace.

552
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:28,900
So what?

553
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,840
Boss, are you going to persuade me?

554
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,380
Even if there's no money,

555
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,300
no equipment,

556
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,354
I should be day dreaming like you are, right?

557
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:39,960
Take this.

558
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,457
What do you mean?

559
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,100
My salary?

560
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,850
No.

561
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,942
I'm working on your contract.

562
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,730
If you have any request, talk to me.

563
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,594
We can work things out.

564
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,400
The money is for you to buy equipment.

565
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,620
Nothing to do with your contract or your work.

566
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,230
Got it.

567
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,860
So the money is...

568
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,780
...an extra gift you gave me.

569
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,834
The money is a welcome gift the whole team gives you.

570
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,462
I know that as a new talent, you may have a run-in period.

571
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,000
I experienced the same when I first opened the Net cafe.

572
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,070
I was stressed out every day.

573
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,140
Later I realized I needed to vent the stress and frustration.

574
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,620
Don't let the anger go through the night.

575
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,700
It's bad for your health.

576
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,820
So...

577
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,300
How much money did you give me to buy the equipment?

578
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,790
To be honest...

579
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,460
What I have got is this Net cafe.

580
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,460
I don't have enough money.

581
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,520
But I'm working on it.

582
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,000
Right now...

583
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,220
I can't give you the best things.

584
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,930
But I can give you all I have.

585
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,870
The money here...

586
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,622
...may just afford half of the equipment.

587
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,670
But I promise I'll get all equipment other teams have.

588
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,880
View it as...

589
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,080
...a promise I made as a "semi-professional boss".

590
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,610
Take it.

591
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,620
Log in Glory.

592
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,700
Buy it now.

593
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:28,990
I...

594
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,020
It's late.

595
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,460
I'll go to bed now.

596
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,340
Boss...

597
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,811
Thank you for being with Xing Xin!

598
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,180

606

How much will it cost in the market?

...for playing Gory with me.

Hello, bro!

611

Look...

612
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,685
Do I have a...

613
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,460
bad character?

614
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,702
You've finally figured that out!

615
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,754
If I didn't know you for so long or grow up with you...

616
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,257
How could I put up with you?

617
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,540
Do you have any other friend except for me?

618
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:01,740
Then...

619
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,510
What do friends mean?

620
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,714
They are people whom you hurt many times

621
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,640
but always return good for evil.

622
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,580

As long as you can stay, we'll work things out!

626
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,110
Let's wait for the captain.

627
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,360
Then hold the meeting.

628
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,725
With your poor judgment,

629
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:27,074
I'd suggest you should not be a professional player.

630
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,130
Sorry.

631
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,980
Could you... do me a favor?

632
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,350
Teach me how to debuff.

633
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,897
As long as I've learned it...

634
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,510
I'll gve you everything.

635
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:42,940
Yes.

I need to talk to you.

Captain!

644
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,940
Yifan is gone.

645
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,700
What?

646
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,810
Captain.

647
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,142
Didn't find him on the 2nd floor.

648
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,230
He's not on the roof, either.

649
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,750
He didn't answer my call.

650
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,270
Where did Yifan go?

651
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,840
I didn't see him last night.

652
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,485
Did he leave because he was stressed out?

653
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:29,940
No.

654
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,542
Yifan will not desert from the battle field.

655
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,210
It's 8:30.

657

You go first. Don't be late.

658
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,500
I'll go look for him.

659
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,748
What should we do with one absent?

660
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,090
Without Yifan, the rest of us...

661
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,171
...will share his duty.

663
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,840
Yifan sent an email.

664
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,850
Killing Every Ten Steps made a strategic error.

665
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,340
Wei Cao actively attacked.

666
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,530
With the debuff effect, they aced soon.

667

No one passed when against Yuxuan Pavilion.

668
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,260

Yes.

I'll go, too.

No need.
