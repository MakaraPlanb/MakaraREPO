3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,920
Keep us updated.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,680
Don't forget!

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
Stay in touch, okay?

6
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Don't worry. Bye.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,280
So you went to see the leader of Team Zhu Xian,

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
is to procure materials.

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes. We don't have enough silver equipment.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,560
I could have given you all a surprise.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,200
But why didn't you tell us at that point?

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
No matter what is the reason,

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
we must do what the Captain arranged.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,360
To keep the morale of our team

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
is more important than my attendance in the competition.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then where were you after the competition?

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,926
It's because of the a thousand-machine umbrella.

18
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:19,720
Competition is coming.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
But we don't have much more time.

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,040
So I visited a lot of teams and guilds,

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,480
and gathered a batch of basic materials,

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,640
hoping they'll be helpful to the Captain.

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
Will they come back?

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Boss, every professional player

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,800
has to face this fork of decision.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I already made my choice.

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
Now it's their time to choose.

28
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,960
What we can right now,

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
is to give them more space.

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Give more time to the Captain.

Professional E-sport player.

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Now I apply to be

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,640
the Captain of Team Xing Xin.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Hello, I am...

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,400
Manager of Team Xing Xin.

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,760
Nice to meet you.

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,520
We're a team.

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
If there's any difficulty,

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,440
why not handle it together?

45
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,680
What about a candy? Sweetmeat makes people happy.

46
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Or a lemon? Sourness would

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
drive away all your annoyance.

48
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
Take it easy.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,840
Keep steady and don't cut diamond with diamond.

50
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,440
I'll be at your side no matter what happened.

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
It's okay. Come on.

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,440
Tonight is the press conference of Night of Glory.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,320
In accordance with the tradition,

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,280
both the two teams who have promoted into the finals of Challenge

55
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,200
will be on the stage. However,

56
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,040
it's increasingly widespread that

57
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Team Xing Xin has dissolved.

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
Tonight, we'll know the truth.

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,400
Boss.

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
It's half past three.

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,160
Team Jia Shi across the street must have set out.

62
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,520
Will we go to the press conference of

63
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,640
Night of Glory tonight or not?

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,720
We will.

65
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,400
We have to go.

66
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
Even though I am the only one left,

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
I'll go.

68
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
Is Team Jia Shi

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
ready for the final?

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,360
We've already made enough preparation.

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,560
As for the champion, we're hell-bent on winning.

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
What about the condition of your team right now?

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
Every teammate enjoys a good condition.

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Look don't ask too many questions later. Okay?

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,520
How could that be possible?

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
I've got piles of questions to ask.

77
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Haven't we reached a consensus?

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
Hold on!

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,560
What's the real situation of Team Xing Xin right now?

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
If the public got deceived,

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
isn't it unfair?

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,200
Today, we're here

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,840
to apologize to you all.

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,640
We're disappointing at the last competition.

85
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
But it's not about the outcome.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,360
It's about our poor performance of facing the reality.

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,160
On behalf of the team, I apologize to you all.

88
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Cheer up, Team Xing Xin!

89
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,040
Besides,

90
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,400
thank you to our fans

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
who have been with Team Xing Xin all the ways.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,760
As a newly-established team,

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
we're immature in many spheres.

94
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Your company is highly cherished.

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
You're the tinder of Team Xing Xin.

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800

97
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Thank you.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,680

Tell us more!

102
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
That should be all.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
Where's Ye Qiu?

104
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,520

confident manifesto,

144
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
we'll going to release

145
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,440
the character information of another team.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,560
This is a team full of young blood.

147

But in the Challenge,

148
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,634
they have overcome all the difficulties in the way

149
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:43,840
and got into the final.

150
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,240
This team is Xing Xin.

151

This new team

152
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720

It seems Team Xing Xin is in trouble now.

156
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Or else there won't be just one player.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,280
With only one player, how could the competition continue?

158

Captain Sun just said that he got only one choice.

171

What I want to say is

172
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,040
that the result of a competition is win or lose.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
But life is not the same.

174
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,080
We can have lots of choices in our lives.

175
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,280
Someone can choose to be

176
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
a stunning pianist.

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,680
Or to be in the university,

178
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,200
as a teacher imparting knowledge and cultivating students.

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,280
Or a white-collar in finance with considerable income.

180
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,800
A more promising future

181
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,680
or an uncertain today?

182
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,120
There're countless possibilities.

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Each would lead to a wonderful life.

184
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,440
E-sport,

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
is just one possibility among them.

186
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,240
There's no big difference

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,800
between it and every other profession.

188
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
If there is,

189
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,120
then it might be

190
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,320
the misapprehension as indecent.

191
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,400
People might believe that we are addicted to internet.

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,280
Years ago,

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
I had to make such choice too.

194
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
But you'll find it out.

you would still be more choices to make.

200
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
No matter what choice have you made eventually,

201
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,032
it has nothing to do with right and wrong

202
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,520
only if you followed your heart.

203
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,440
And today,

204
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,800
just on behalf of me,

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,240
I made my choice.

206

211
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah.

212
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,200

We're gorgeous just now.

246
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,400
Just like the surprise scene of the press conference.

247
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
Good job!

248
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,440
The time is just good.

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
Without a second's error.

250
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,800
Have a seat.

251
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,320
I have something to tell you.

252
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
It's said that Senior Wei,

253
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
had sold his account.

254
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,920
Got a pretty penny.

255
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,640
Having money is good for sure.

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,680
But...

257
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,520
We'd better skimp on avoidable costs.

258
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,440
And a cup free from breaking a cup saved.

259
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,560
It's plastic. For you.

260
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,280
Who told you I sold my account?

261
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,920
Mr. Wei, wish a happy cooperation.

262
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,640
Mr. Wei, It's mine now.

263
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
You...

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,240
Let's go!

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
What about Captain Ye?

266
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Today only you two

267
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,000
go to attend this press conference?

268
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
Right, why are they not here?

269
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,160
It's been ten years

270
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,560
when I first got my account.

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,240
I can sell anything but it.

272
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,240
Tang.

273
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,160
This cup is suitable for you.

274
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,040
I heard that you came back to the band,

275
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,680
and started your new life.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Teacher.

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Can I play it again?

278
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,280
Now I won't be afraid of starting again at last.

279
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,360
Mistake is not horrible.

280
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,880
I completed that piano music I failed to perform at that year.

281
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,800
When the last note finished,

282
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,120
I thought I already made my decision.

283
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,400
I just passed by,

284
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,760
and watched a show.

285
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,000
What about you, Mo Fan?

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,480
I... I just stay at the crossing.

287
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,800
Xiao An, Luo Ji, what about you?

288
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,120
I didn't saw you come back.

289
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,600
I just...

290
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,982
come back to the campus and

291
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,400
took over a class for my university professor.

292
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
I just recalled that

293
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,040
the last digit of the decimal was wrong.

294
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,520
Xiao An, and you?

295
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I...

296
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,480
= Resume =

297
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,120

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,160
You should write here.

299
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,360
Here.

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,200
I was so busy with refusing all kinds of offers.

301
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Right. Yifan, what did you do?

302
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,480
I was staying with you all the time.

303
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,080
Yifan, quick. Give me that cup.

304
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
I have more things about Lao Wei to tell.

305
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Buddy!

306
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,880
- Here. - Here.

307
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,640
- Here you are. - He knows nothing.

308
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Nothing.

309
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,000
- He knows. - He must know a lot.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Here comes your presents.

311
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,400
What kind of presents?

312
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,120
Let me show you.

313
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,640
Let's have a look.

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,280
What is this for?

315
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,720
They're cups.

316
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,680
Specially customized. Antiskid, shatter-resistant and tiff-proof.

317
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,360
That's good. I like it.

318
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
All right. Now you've got the present.

319
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,600
Can I know what's your plan next?

320
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Repair a thousand-machine umbrella.

321
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,400
we must start from damaging it.

326
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,840
I gradually gathered those rare materials before,

327
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,320
for upgrade, but now

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Shall we continue dismantling?

346
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Now the umbrella has been dismantled

347
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,360
to its original level five.

348
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
If we go on dismantling,

349
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,920
nothing but the axle could be left.

350
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,120
But the axle means nothing.

351
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,840
Back to its original.

352
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
In fact, having been dismantling it for such a long time,

353
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
you're clear what is the problem.

354
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,080
# From adversity to glory. #

355
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,240
What a stupid mistake!

356
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,840
Even a genius can't avoid making mistakes.

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
So what do you think we should do now?

358
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,120
I tell you,

359
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,360
don't be too reluctant to tear it asunder.

360
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,840
No matter how it would change and what it would become,

361
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,600
as long as its name unchanged,

362
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,680
it's still my invention.

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,560
Isn't it?

364
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,600
# I am as always, #

365
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,600
# writing an ending for the story. #

366
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,160
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

367
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,320
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

368
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,880
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

369
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,840
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

370
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,160
# We go through deep and down. #

371
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,280
# We stand at the starry summit. #

372
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,600
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

373
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,760
It's the axle.

374
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,920
Whatever it is,

375
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
we'll solve it together.

376
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,280
A thousand-machine umbrella is not your own.

377
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,120
It belongs to all of us.

378
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,720
We'll divide into several groups and speed up the repair.

379
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm in charge of data modeling,

380
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
and offer new assemble templates.

381
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,600
Wu Chen, you're responsible for

382
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
sorting out the basic materials you brought.

383
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Mo Fan and Bao Zi, you two assist Wu Chen.

384
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
And Tang,

385
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Yifan and WeiChen.

386
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,760
You need to fight for new materials.

387
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,680
Everyone got tasks. What should I do?

388
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,680
Your job is...

389
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
To click "Yes" when the weapon is assembled.

390
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,680
- Let's go. - Go!

391
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,360
- Let's start! - Here we go.

392
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay!

393
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,080
Let's do it. Come on.

394
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,920
Well, from now on,

395
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
let's start again.

396
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
Today we have the latest news.

397
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,440

Today we have the latest news.

398
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,840
= Glory, Upgraded to Level 75, Fight for Dream =

399
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,240
Glory official has upgraded the system to level 75.
= Glory, Upgraded to Level 75, Fight for Dream =

400

= Glory, Upgraded to Level 75, Fight for Dream =

401
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
That means there would be new Dungeon materials.
= Glory, Upgraded to Level 75, Fight for Dream =

402
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,040
= Glory, Upgraded to Level 75, Fight for Dream =

403
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,520
So far, all the teams

404
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,440
including Wei Cao, Ambitions and Lan Yu,

405
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,120
plan to take this opportunity to renew and upgrade equipment.

406
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,760
Therefore, if we late for a while,

407
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,680
we'll lag behind in the competition.

408
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,240
So this time, we need to prepare for not only the final,

409
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,520
but the rate of progress in Dungeon.

410
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,120
Come in.

411
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
Let me introduce him to you all.

412
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
This is the new member of Team One, Qiu Fei.

413
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,360
Qiu has a good data in almost every sphere.

414
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,320
He's always the best in Team Two.

415
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
He has been exchanged overseas once representing Jia Shi.

416
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,200
His strength is not lower than you in Team One.

417
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,480
Have a seat there.

418
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,760
Your profession is Battlemage too.

419
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,000
You two can communicate more with each other.

420
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,720
Communicate?

421
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm afraid the word "teach" is more appropriate.

422
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Qiu, this is your seat.

423
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,360
No matter it's teaching or communicating,

424
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
it'll be convenient for you.

425

= Dungeon First Kill List, District 10, Details, Overall =

426
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:31,372

428
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,480
Team Xing Xin got so many first kills.

429
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,960
Did you take it serious?

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,760
Though I was serious, it's no use with you hindering me.

431
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,840
All right.

432
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Then let's not compete for that.

433
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,440
How about this?

434
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,240
He who gets the first kill in the new map is the winner.

435
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,560
Have I ever competed with you?

436
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,080
Naive.

437
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,600
Let's compete our output.

438
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,280
I'll let you attack for ten seconds first.

439
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
Are you sure about this arrangement?

440
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,640
His profession is the same with that of Sun Xiang.

441
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
And in terms of the character,

442
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,840
they can hardly get on with each other.

443
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,000
Mr. Tao.

444
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Have you ever seen Sun Xiang like this?

445
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
Though he's not convinced,

446
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,600
he is influenced unconsciously by his teammate,

447
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,440
both in reality and in his performance in Glory.

448
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,200
Playback with double speed.

449
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,440
Fourfold speed.

450
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
Sixfold speed.

451
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,440
Sixfold? How could we see it clearly?

452
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,280
I agree.

453
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,600
Eightfold.

454
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,640
This is menu. What would you like to order?

455
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,760
I'd like this. Just a little spicy.

456
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,880
All right.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,600
Waitress.

458
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,000
I'd like a super spicy!

= Team Xing Xin, Staff Only =

460
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,160
Taking the opportunity of upgrade in level 75,

461
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,600
we've already got much better equipment.

462
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,840
But now, the most important equipment that we need

463
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,800
is this Blue-white crystal.

464
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,160
This is the crux of  repairing a thousand-machine umbrella.

465
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Therefore,

466
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
please, everyone.

467
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,400
The drop rate of first kill in this Dungeon

468
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
is one hundred percent.

469
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
We must get it!

470
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,520
The First Kill List is empty now.

471
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,920
The Boss doesn't have enough blood.

472
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,080
Yifan, three o'clock.

473
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,720
Roger that.

474
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,800

Praisage.

479
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,240
Our award of first kill has gone.

480
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,080
Just late for a second.

481
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,160
Now every team is keeping attacking level 75

482
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,640
for equipment upgrade.

483
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
At a result, our first kill was robbed by those bastards.

484
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't want to buy it from Team Jia Shi.

485
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,800
Then we need to get other first kill.

486
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,520
This is the last Dungeon.

487
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,240
Actually apart from getting first kill,

488
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,680
we have another way.

489
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,840
Apart from getting first kill,

490
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,600
there is possibility to get the crystal in common Dungeons.

491
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,440
But the rate is not as high as first kill.

492
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
Even though all of us

493
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,200
keep attacking for 24 hours,

494
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,560
we can't get the crystal for sure before the final.

495
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,440
Who said you are the all?

496
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,680
Come here! Be quickly!

497
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,200
Come on! My dear brothers and sisters.

498
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,040
Let's have a seat!

499
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,280
Quick!

500
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,920
We're here with passion, right?

501
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,040
We have our mission, right?

502
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,680
Yes.

503
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,680
Mu Yunshen.

504
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,360
Go gather your team. Hurry up!

505
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,360
Teammates sit together according to our grouping.

506
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,560
That's right.

507
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,440
Xing Xin is not only us.

508
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Here, attention.

509
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,480
Now it's time for the guild to take action.

510
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,400
In every Dungeon where the Blue-white crystal is possible to appear,

511
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,760
we need to keep attacking!

512
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,600
- Okay! - Let's move!

513
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,920

Three times in the Dungeon. Come on!

520
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,560
For Blue-white crystal, come on!

521
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,680
Let's see what we have this time.

522
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
Come on, boss.

523
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,200
Other players attack three times within one hour

524
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
while your team attack once within three hours.

525
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
Considering this rate,

526
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,840
even though we attack till the end of the world,

527
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,280
we can't get the Blue-white crystal.

528
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
But I think it looks good now.

529
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,920
You see,

530
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,840
the whole cafe is busy.

531
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Just like the scene in the opening of District 10.

532
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,880
Boss, can I apply for playing in another team?

533
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
You see, I am the chosen one

534
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to get the Blue-white crystal for Master Ye.

535
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,360
Boss, you can't hinder me, right?

536
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,720
That's too...

537
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,160
= Cloud Chaser, Blue-white crystal =

538
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,840
Blue-white crystal!

539
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,040
We got it!

540
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,840
We got it! Finally!

541
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,760
That's awesome!

542
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,120
