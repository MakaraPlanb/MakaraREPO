00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,270
= Episode 9 =

3
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,280
Team 2, firearms and thermal missiles.

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,450
Team 2 roger that.

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,500
Battlemage in Team 1, flame strike.

6
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,350
Retreat to Kongji City.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,925
Another one coming to be beaten.

8
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:24,640
Missed it.

9
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,450
Watch out!

10
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,200
Be calm. Steady your hands.

11
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:36,200
Give up the array of ice. Ghost-chop first.

12
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,120
Then moon-slash. Attack immediately.

13
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,475
Don't panic even if you missed.

14
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:40,550
The more urgent the situation is,

15
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,480
the more you can improve your mindset and judgment.

16
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,450
Gotcha, my senior.

17
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,700
Assist with the array of knives.

18
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,675
Ghost array.

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,725
Wait for the perfect timing.

20
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,575
The same coordinate. Double the ghost array.

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Gotcha, my senior.

22
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,775
Boss, those who attack the same dungeon in Team 3 are back.

23
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,320
Do we need to back up?

24
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,225
Nope.

25
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:27,080
Just some preparation. Testing the water.

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,320
Made it!

27
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:39,400
Yifan,

28
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,150
your array ghost kicked ass!

29
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,720
We should compare notes sometime.

30
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,075
How should I do it?

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,725
= Glory =
# The road to the top is rough and long. #

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,725
# But walking with you, I will have infinite power. #

33
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:02,800
The test is over.

34
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:03,925
Let's go back.

35
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,100
- OK. - OK.

36
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:06,925
Let's go.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Talk later.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,975
Let's go.

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,520
# Youth is a forever indomitable growth. #

40
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,640
# We are accompanied by confidence and strength. #

41
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,850
# Even if we flinch and bruise all over our body, #

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,675
Just now,

43
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:29,840
I gained a complete victory.

44
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,650
I finished the most important test of my entire life.

45
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,000
# We must do our best to win a battle. #

46
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,760
You should improve all the skills of the array ghost.

47
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,440
You need to remember everything and practice.

48
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,275
Your reaction and judgment are not good enough.

49
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,275
More combat experience will help.

50
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:50,160
Your mentality is not professional enough.

51
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,880
Your emotion would control you.

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,400
When you missed, you'd panic.

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,960
When it comes to the situation,

54
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,750
thinking calmly and making supplement would avoid bigger mistakes.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,760
You are going to change your fate,

56
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,200
not to give it up.

57
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,100
No one should ever give up easily.

58
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,200
Thank you, my senior.

59
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,175
You help me find the true self I love

60
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,760
in the world of Glory.

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,360
My future path...

62
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,325
is coming soon.

63
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:21,000
# To fight for our dream, we should win beautifully enough. #

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,200
# We are hugging, cheering, and ecstatic with joy for our victory. #

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,150
# And we spent countless shining times. #

66
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,280
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:46,760
# We spent countless shining times. #

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,600
Bro, I don't beat about the bush.

69
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,240
Cut the chase.

70
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't make any dungeon record for any other guild

71
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,450
except for our Ambitions Guild.

72
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,350
You wanna buy out?

73
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,925
Then you should get your cash ready.

74
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:11,925
You want to overcharge me again?

75
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,825
Fine. How much?

76
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,300
The cup is empty.

77
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,975
- Need me to get more water for you? - I'll do it.

78
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,920
You go ahead. Continue.

79
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm done. I'll go get water.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,325
The bell of #56 in District B keeps ringing and going to blast.

81
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,475
Would you go check?

82
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,025
Is it blasting?

83
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,120
Or is it broken?

84
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,960
I didn't hear anything.

85
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,325
Let me check.

86
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,175
Boss, the light...

87
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:13,875
Stop pretending.

88
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:18,520
Go get water.

89
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:30,440
Tang, what are you doing?

90
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,350
Have you finished your homework?

91
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm on it. Still on it.

92
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,250
You should hurry up.

93
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,175
A bottle of water, please.

94
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:54,925
Thanks.

95
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,825
Everything is going down.

96
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,600
Our Yue Lun Guild is doomed.

97
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Moon, come up something to fix it!

98
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,400
What should I do?

99
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,080
A small guild like ours,

100
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,920
doesn't have any master-hand.

101
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,280
Going down is just the normalcy.

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840
Could you ask Master-hand to help us?

103
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,200
You have some personal friendship with him.

104
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,750
He might be willing to help.

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,475
You sure it's friendship, not grievance?

106
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,850
Moon,

107
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,760
it's about our guild, not about losing face.

108
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,850
You think about it.

109
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,150
Could you do me a favor?

110
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,600
Well... How have you been lately?

111
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,800
It's too fake.

112
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,300
Jun Moxiao,

113
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
have you ever heard about our Yue Lun Guild?

114
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,975
Actually...

115
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,525
I... am really embarrassed...

116
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,675
No... No...

117
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:45,125
Though my temperament is extraordinary,

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,675
you don't need to be so humble.

119
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,550
Big bro...

120
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,700
Say out loud.

121
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,650
What?

122
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,050
Big bro...

123
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,360
Go get water for me!

124
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,450
Stand up!

125
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,120
Go get water!

126
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,525
Big bro...

127
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Go that way.

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,950
Please do me a favor.

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm in Kongji City.

130
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,575
Come over.

131
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Little Moon, are you showing off?

132
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,100
I need to apologize to you first.

133
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:17,975
Apologize?

134
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,075
Actually... In Green Forest,

135
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,480
when we first randomly team up,

136
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,560
I had an agenda.

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,400
I wanted all of you to be my human shields,

138
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,200
being killed by Night Evil Cat.

139
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,120
Then I could possess all the materials.

140
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
But later...

141
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,275
My plan fell apart.

142
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,975
So I broadcast in the "world",

143
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,125
and framed you in the "world".

144
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,760
Now I feel I was so childish.

145
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,720
Later I led you into the Spider Cave,

146
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,680
all I wanted was to trap you.

147
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
But I overestimated myself.

148
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,975
You, all by yourself,

149
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,600
could easily defeat a number of us.

150
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:56,400
At last,

151
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,075
it was you who led us to defeat the hidden boss.

152
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,500
And you gave me the last sword.

153
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,560
Why are you confessing?

154
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,700
I don't get it.

155
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:08,925
So...

156
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,025
I want to apologize to you.

157
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,175
Forgive me, please.

158
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,240
Why don't you tell me what you're up to?

159
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,575
Actually I want to ask you a favor.

160
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:22,080
Could you make a dungeon for my Yue Lun Guild?

161
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,920
As what you did for Lanxi Pavilion and Ambitions.

162
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,680
Just one dungeon for us.

163
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,600
And go to the ranking list.

164
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,250
You're not done with the situation in Spider Cave?

165
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,725
What are your tricks this time?

166
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,675
It's not like what you think.

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Master, I'll be honest with you.

168
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,280
My guild is collapsing.

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,025
I... I know you make money from dungeons.

170
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,320
I know how much it will cost.

171
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,300
My guild can't afford it with all that we have got.

172
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:53,200
But don't worry.

173
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,840
We'll pay you back with everything we get every day,

174
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,720
until we pay off.

175
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,250
Is it ok?

176
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,275
Please.

177
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:07,440
It's really shabby.

178
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,925
All the equipments are not as valuable as the one you have.

179
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:24,800
I didn't see it clearly.

180
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,880
You've got the Lance of the Purple Moon?

181
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,375
I'll take it.

182
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,840
You'll... only take one lance?

183
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:43,375
Reading the strategy?

184
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,325
Tang has been busy with the strategy, working very hard.

185
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
Why are you asking?

186
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,350
= "Strategy Guide of the Place of Exile Dungeon" =
You reading dungeon strategy guide?

187
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:54,825
We're about to attack the Place of Exile Dungeon.

188
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
Grinding the spear just before a battle?

189
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,125
I'm just reading.

190
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,050
Just reading.

191
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,440
The living Glory master will be the captain.

192
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,750
You just need to know about other strategies.

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,025
The living Glory master is my idol, Ye Qiu.

194
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,250
Don't you just take the credit.

195
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,000
Tang, who wrote this strategy?

196
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,200
The writer is Meiguang. Why?

197
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,050
It's perfect.

198
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,050
It includes all the probability events.

199
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,375
It even calculates the time for each step.

200
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,050
- To millisecond. - Let me have a look.

201
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,440
Tang.

202
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,925
Look at this guy. Very strange.

203
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:48,360
He wrote so much for a low-grade dungeon.

204
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,700
Who would have the patience to read through?

205
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Reading it is hard for a loser.

206
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,000
Who is a loser?

207
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,560
Tang, he is bullying me.

208
00:14:58,925 --> 00:14:59,675
Who is a loser?

209
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:00,875
Boss.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
Keep going.

211
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:08,240
Boss.

212
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,200
When will you deliver my paper and pen?

213
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,550
Him again!

214
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,425
In all my business years,

215
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,750
I have never seen anyone who always order paper and pen.

216
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,100
Tang, is he making this place as his study room?

217
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:21,520
The same as you.

218
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,275
You don't have anything to do?

219
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,320
Go deliver for him!

220
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,150
Tang, send me a copy of the strategy, please.

221
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,160
Tang...

222
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,150
It's great you work in the internet café.

223
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,825
It's my honor that you can tutor me.

224
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:07,200
Tang, could you help me with this?

225
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,775
I can't figure it out. Could you help me?

226
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:10,750
Please?

227
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,125
Tang.

228
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,725
I should have a shot.

229
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,000
Tang...

230
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,700
What about this?

231
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:23,450
Leave it there and keep doing your homework.

232
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:25,840
This is some test "strategy".

233
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,375
Tang...

234
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,850
I can't do it by myself.

235
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,720
The pen is running out of ink. Where is the delivery?

236
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
From the storage rack on the first floor to my door,

237
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,075
it only takes five minutes with the average human speed.

238
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,120
But it took you...

239
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:26,550
six minutes and twelve seconds.

240
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,525
Your paper.

241
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,875
The paper weight is not right.

242
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,175
The brand I want weighs 4.09 grams.

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
But this one weighs 4.06 grams.

244
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,475
The friction that generates with my pen will slow down my calculation.

245
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,050
- My pen. - What?

246
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,275
My pen...

247
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:00,750
Sorry.

248
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:01,975
Your pen.

249
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,975
Wait a sec.

250
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:06,560
It's not what I want.

251
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,975
What I ordered was cartridge 0.48, not 0.45.

252
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,300
You were late for 72 seconds.

253
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,720
And it took me 48 seconds to explain to you.

254
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,300
You wasted two minutes.

255
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,475
I could have do more calculations in these two minutes...

256
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:19,125
Take your time.

257
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,150
I won't stop you from your numerous affairs.

258
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,625
Numerous affairs? That's what webmasters do.

259
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,175
You hurry up.

260
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,825
I need it in a short time.

261
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,775
OK.

262
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,900
There's still time to look for your expert.

263
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,775
What expert?

264
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:31,640
I'm going to a meeting.

265
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,600
Why are you having the meeting?

266
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:36,150
To find the expert who has turned the world upside down

267
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,650
and left everything in a mess.

268
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,300
Xizhou, you can't say that.

269
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,760
The expert really has helped our Lanxi Pavilion Guild a lot.

270
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,700
He did his best to help us with the Place of Bones.

271
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,225
You think too much.

272
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,450
He took the materials.

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,275
We were even.

274
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,125
It's just a scheme, OK?

275
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,640
OK, gotcha.

276
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,075
I'm going to the meeting, Talk to you later.

277
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,425
Talk about what? Everything is clear.

278
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,500
You just can't live without the expert.

279
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,520
Now the world is in a mess.

280
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,760
Everything is bloody.

281
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,375
All the guilds suffered a great loss.

282
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,750
It's time to call a truce.

283
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,150
Let's have a peace talk.

284
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
Now you want a peace talk?

285
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,880
It was you, Zhong Caotang Guild, who started the fight.

286
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,500
It was Lanxi Pavilion who asked Jun Moxiao to substitute first.

287
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,970
Who was the substitute?

288
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
He was an official member of Lanxi Pavilion.

289
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,920
He was making the dungeon record as one of us.

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,575
He then left our guild later.

291
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,250
- I... - Bullshit!

292
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,025
He was one of you whenever he was substituting.

293
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,040
Laoye, watch your mouth.

294
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,900
Lan He, you Lanxi Pavilion killed my elite brigade.

295
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,100
What would you do?

296
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:57,240
Stop it!

297
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,900
Could we just stop killing each other?

298
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,040
Can't we play it fairly?

299
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,320
Without fighting with each other?

300
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
You are such a pacifist.

301
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Congratulations to Players Jun Moxiao, Han Yanrou and

302
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,000

303

= System Annoucement =
belonging to Yue Lun guild have created

304
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,080
a new record for the Place of Exile Dungeon.

305
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Time used is 22''35.

306
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,920
Yue Lun guild?

307
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,440
Have any of you

308
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,800
heard of this guild?

309
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,920
How can this kind of shady guild

310
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
try to steal the thunder?

311
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
The Palce of Exile.

312
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
Oh, my!

313
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,400
They even broke

314
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
the record set by our guild.

315
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
Jun Moxiao.

316
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
You are certainly not a picky one.

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,320
Xi Zhou, how can he do that?

318
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,640
The only thing he wants is the materials.

319
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,840
As long as he gets what he wants, he can help anyone.

320
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,880
I thought he was one of us.

321
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
You never thought like that.

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,160
You only care about yourself.

323
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Jun Moxiao

324
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
is cruel, as blind as a bat and

325
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,280
disregards moral principles in pursuit of profits.

326
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,680
He is hypocritical.

327
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
He fails on every criterion. He is up to no good.

328
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
Everyone who plays Glory should despise him.

329
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
From now on,

330
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Jun Moxiao, you are officially

331
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
the arch-enemy of Lanxi Pavilion

332
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,880
Yeah, from now on,

333
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,400
he is our arch-enemy.

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Think about it, everyone.

335
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
Before the opening of the 10th district,

336
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,240
has this kind of thing ever happened?

337
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,680
Ever since Jun Moxiao appears,

338
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,800
he has been stringing us alone

339
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,000
from the first kill to the copy records,

340
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
from fighting against each other for the final Boss

341
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
to our infighting.

342
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
Who do you think

343
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,080
is the final winner?

344
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
It's that Jun Moxiao.

345
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,600
It seems that way.

In a shady guild like yours,

352
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,920
this is the only disguished weapon there is.

353
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Such a waste.

354

You are quite slow.

You only have a suite. Without the organe weapon,

you can't defeat me.

It's a trophy.

371
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,320
You played through the Place of Exile and

372
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
the only thing you want is this?

373
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
It matches the weapon

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
I bought you the last time.

375
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,840
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =

376
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,780
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =
Isn't it our record?

377
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,200
Isn't it our record?

378
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,320
Let me see.

379
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,600
It's so detailed.

380
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,880
The way to play pass each checkpoint is clearly marked.

381
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,200
The equipments of Bao Zi Invader with pictures.

382
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,120
It says all my equipments

383
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,200
are orange.

384
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,320
Underling, do you think we should

385
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,020
follow the steps posted

386
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,280
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =
follow the steps posted

387
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,880
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =

388
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,600
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =
and then we can create a record of

389
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,900
= Mysterious Record of 16''24 of the Place of Bones =
16''24?

390
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,760
16''24?

391
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,920
This guy is a genius.

392
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,360
Indeed.

393
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,720
He can reproduce the full method of passing a Dungeon

394
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,360
only according to the record time.

395
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
He is really good at this.

396
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
What a pity.

397
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,760
Why?

398
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
This method requires

399
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,400
players to have not only high-end equipments,

400
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
but also exquisite techniques.

401
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Normal player simple can't reach this level.

402
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,400
In other words,

403
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,720
this so-call "Strategy for the Inexperience"

404
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,640
is not what it claims to be.

405
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,440
It's only a theory.

406
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,120
Then why we are wasting time on this?

407
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,360
It's useless.

408
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,520
We can just go and play the dungeon directly.

409
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,840
It is not useless.

410
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,240
It's posted by someone named Mei Guang.

411
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
At least, he has a high spirit of learning.

412
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,240
If someone points him into the right direction,

413
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,320
maybe he can come up with

414
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,920
a really decent strategy guide.

415
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
Network manager, turn on a computure please.

416
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,240
Let's go.

417
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,160
Please show your I.D. card.

418
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,820
= Seats on First Floor Seats on Second Floor =
= Disctrict A  Disctrict C =

419
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,000
It's really crowded today here.

420
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,640
The business is thriving.

421
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,840
Here you go. No.46 in District B

422
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,320
Thanks.

423
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm sorry but

424
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
we need to split up today.

425
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,800
Yifan, you are No.42 in Disrtcit B

426
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,840
OK.

427
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,200
Bao Zi.

428
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
Go upstaires to District C.

429
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,800
OK.

430
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's go.

431
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,480
Why are you online now?

432
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,600
Didn't you mention there is a team event?

433
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,920
Are you going to

434
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,080
One Canyon Dungeon today?

435
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Bring me on.

436
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
You surely have a lot of time, lady.

437
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,760
You even play the Glory.

438
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
I am sick. I took a sick leave today.

439
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,000
What's wrong?

440
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Have you gone to see a doctor?

441
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,320
I have sever insomnia.

442
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,200
I can't sleep during daytime.

443
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
The doctor said,

444
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,440
the more I play the Glory, the better.

445
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,280
The most important thing is to

446
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,840
keep myself happy.

447
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
All right.

448
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:41,640

We are gathering in Kongzhi Forest.

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,160
We are gathering in Kongzhi Forest.

Roger.

452
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,200
We have gathered the elite member from

453
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,680
the seven largest guilds this time

454
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,040
in order to take down Jun Moxiao.

455
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,680
Zhong Caotang guild

456
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,760
wins the fifth place in the league match.

457
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
Wei Cao Team, champion of Season 7,

458
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,600
is strong and powerful.

459
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,160
The Ambitions carries on

460
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,400
the style developed by their captain, Han Wenqing.

461
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,840
They are tough and hard to defeat.

462
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Players tremble with fear on hearing of their name.

463
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,480
Not to mention Blossom Valley guild, Samsara guild,

464
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Howling Heights guild and Void Walk guild.

465
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,000
With the buff of each guild,

466
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,600
the strength will double in amount

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,440
Feng Liu Yan Mu is online.

468
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Position 375 690.

469
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,080
He is online now.

Bao Zi, the Invader is online.

471
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,760

We need to work together.

478
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,200
Now, Feng Shu Yan Mu, Yi Cunhui

479
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,480
and Bao Zi, the Invader are

480
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,720
in different areas in Kongzhi Forest.

481
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
They can't gather in such a such time.

482
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,840
We can defeat them one by one.

483
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,240
All teams are ready to besiege.

484
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,280
Move.

485
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Strangle them.

486
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Go.

487
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,320
An ambush.

488
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,840
Watch out the surroundings.

489
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,120
I also meet four enemies.

490
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
But those rookies...

491
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,120
they are so lame.

492
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,120
Tang,

493
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
are you ok?

494
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I am killed.

495
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,120
Tang, I already asked them to

496
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,560
assemble in the Kongzhi Forrest as planned.

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
you can go to the Congee City to respawn.

498
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,600
But hide for now,

499
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,680
save your strengthfor later.

500
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,600
Solemn has no one to use now.

501
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,000
Position (236, 985)

502
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
target, Solemn.

503
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,080
The game,

504
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,520
is not over.

505
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,080
Assemble in the Kongzhi Forrest.

506
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,920
Got it.

507
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,640
No problem.

508
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,640
Stop them from assembling.

509
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Wait till they are

510
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,200
kill them one by one.

511
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
Roger that.

512
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,400
Concentrate fire

513
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,240
on Yi Cun Hui.

514
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,120
What? So many enemy!

515
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,840
Come on! Come and get me!

516
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,160
Come here. Here. Here.

517
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,480
Oh my! Lose him again!

518
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,280
Go get him! Chop chop!

519
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,040
What are you waiting for?

520
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,560
Our ATT is not enough

521
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,480
to break through the encirclement.

522
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,480
Senior, what should we do?

523
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Hide.

524
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,840
Hit him hard!

525
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Don't let any of them survive!

526
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,520
Have you met up Yifan?

527
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,680
Yes.

528
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
But there are too many enemies.

529
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,720
We can't break through the encirclement at all.

530
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,840
Let him use Flame Boundaries

531
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,880
to give you a buff.

532
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,920
Baozi is kind of close to you.

533
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,240
I will let him support you.

534
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,200
Roger that.

535
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,840
Baozi, how about you?

536
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,120
Boss, so many people are chasing me.

537
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,120
What should I do?

538
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
Run! Run! Run!

539
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Find a way to escape.

540
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,200
Go.

541
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,600
What happened?

542
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,600
Where am I?

543
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,960
It's so dark.

544
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,960
Cap, we lost Bao Zi Invader.

545
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,280
He may find a blind spot to hide.

546
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,080
Let's scatter to search for him.

547
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,560
They can't see me.

548
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,360
Seems I found a good place.

549
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,600
Void Walk, remain on standby outside Congee City.

550
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,080
After respawning,

551
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,320
Han Yan Rou must head to the Congee City.

552
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Killing is not allowed in the city.

553
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,720
Once they step out of the city, kill them immediately.

554
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Roger that.

555
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,520
None of them can survive this time.

556
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,580
# Normal Spear #

557
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,420
# Congratulations on buying Normal Spear. It costs 70 coins. #

558
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,219
# Normal Spear equipped #

559
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,320
We lost Baozi.

560
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
Things get worse than we thought.

561
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
You stay at the Congee City now.

562
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
wait for the opportunity.

563
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,240
Praisage Dynasty,

564
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,320
get ready to encircle Solemn.

565
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,320
Why bother to be masked on the smurf?

566
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,960
To give you a surprse!

567
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,760
Are you happy? Are you happy?

568
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,360
Don't let any of them go.

569
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Kill them all.

570
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,440
Go.

571
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,800
Oh my!

572
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,760
So many enemy!

573
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,440
Ye, did you stir up a hornet's nest?

574
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,000
You noobs

575
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,000
are really brave.

576
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,160
Again? Why?

577
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,120
Want a lesson?

578
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,760
Alright, I will teach you a lesson.

579
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,160
You are freaking done.

580
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,720
Ye, you heartless,

581
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,920
run without me?

582
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,200
Wait for me! Wait!

583
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,800
Now nobody is here.

584
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,920
Come clean, Ye.

585
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,520
What have you done?

586
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,000
Rob their equipments,

587
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,160
or steal someone's girlfriend?

588
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Let me guess.

589
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,120
I guess Han got upset

590
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,000
about you retiring from Glory.

591
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,240
So he decided to come after you till you come back.

592
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,200
No?

593
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,000
Then don't tell me. don't.

594
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
Let me guess again.

595
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,240
Ah I see.

596
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,200
It must be like this!

597
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Your plot

598
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,000
are revealed.

599
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,520
That's why everyone are chasing you. Am I right?

600
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
We just break the dugeon record.

601
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,440
You deserve it, Ye.

602
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,680
What's your level?

603
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,720
Compete with these newbies for the dugeon?

604
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,400
You are more and more shameless.

605
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,840
Why shameful?

606
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,520
I am just a common player.

607
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
It's my job.

608
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,200
But you, haven't experienced

609
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,120
such a huge battle for a long time.

610
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,800
Scared?

611
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,000
Are you kidding me? I am scared?

612
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Who am I scared of?

613
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,400
Then why did you run?

614
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,920
I come here to PK you,

615
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
not for these noobs.

616
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,620
Alright, without further ado,

617
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,320
I am going to open the PK field.

618
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
I give you one minute,

619
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,520
to PK me. PK. PK. PK. PK.

620
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,920
Shh.

621
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,920
Under the tree, follow me.

622
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,640
Fire.

623
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,460
The road to the top is rough and long.

624
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:05,180
But walking with you, I will have infinite power.

625
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:09,460
Failure is like the dawn of victory.

626
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,580
So what if we start all over again?

627
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,700
Youth is a forever indomitable growth.

628
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,940
We are accompanied by confidence and strength.

629
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,259
Even if we flinch and bruise all over our body,

630
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,420
there will always be hope in despair.

631
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,779
This is the most glorious battlefield.

632
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,540
We must do our best to win a battle.

633
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,620
We laugh, we cry, we feel sad for failure.

634
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:54,540
We accompany each other to bloom in the transformation.

635
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:58,700
This is the most glorious battlefield.

636
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,460
To fight for our dream, we should win beautifully enough.

637
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,700
We are hugging, cheering, and ecstatic with joy for our victory.

638
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:14,540
We spent countless shining times.

639
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:18,580
This is the most glorious battlefield.

640
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,420
We must do our best to win a battle.

641
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,580
We laugh, we cry, we feel sad for failure.

642
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:34,460
We accompany each other to bloom in the transformation.

643
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,219
This is the most glorious battlefield.

644
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,379
To fight for our dream, we should win beautifully enough.

645
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,580
We are hugging, cheering, and ecstatic with joy for our victory.

646
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:54,460
And we spent countless shining times.

647
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:59,460
This is the most glorious battlefield.

648
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:10,420
We spent countless shining times.
