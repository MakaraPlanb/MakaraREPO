00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
= The King's Avatar =

2
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,090
= Episode 17 =

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
So they were playing a spy game

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
in our team!

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Who gave them the courage?

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
Thanks to their deliberate attack on the stone wall though,

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
we got to hit the mark by a fluke,

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
seckilled the guardian beast instead.

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,240
I think Master must have

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
thought up the play when we

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,160
failed in the first attack.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
So he deliberately let them

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,640
mess up the second attack.

14
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,640
Master, have I guessed right?

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,160
You are half right.

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,200
It was not me who came up with the play,

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,400
but Luo Ji.

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Excusing me for interrupting.

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
You just left out two digits

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
after the decimal point.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
It should be 103245.618.

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Stop talking. Shut up!

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
Whatever the master says is right.

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,680
Understand?

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,400
103245.618?

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,160
Correct.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
I'll keep it in mind.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
So you already had a plan in mind.

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
But you were letting Guoguo be that anxious.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Come on, cheers! To our boss!

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Wish her good luck... on her exam.

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,280
Better wish her...

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
a miracle.

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,520
Great!

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on!

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,320
Cheers!

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
The reason why they did better than you

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
was not that they were stronger than you,

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,360
better than you,

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,720
but that you showed yourself a red light

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,440
before you even got started.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
You wanted to build a team.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
I would not object to that.

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
But have you ever weighed

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
whether you are cut out for it?

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,400
Anyway, you've been known

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
to be a quitter.

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
If you don't want to do it,

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,960
don't push yourself too hard.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm sorry, Master,

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,840
for letting you go to the bother of seeing me off.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
After the Spring Festival,

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
will you come back to Hangzhou?

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
The captain wanted me to come back.

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
Your captain's got a good eye.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The captain said that

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,920
even though my assassin scored negative points,

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,920
it was quite unexpected that my array ghost scored zero points.

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
He wanted me to go back to the team and start fresh.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,480
He has set the starting point up for you.

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,040
You have to find by yourself

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
where you'd end up.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,600
Master, I was so happy that

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
I got to play Glory with you.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Go ahead.

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,920
Hop on the bus quick!

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,440
Master, I'll work extra hard!

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,920
And I will remember

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,800
every word you said!

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,000
Good luck, and happy new year!

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,320
Thank you. Happy new year!

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,160
As always,

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,600
you're calm and composed even when you're leaving.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,920
As always,

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm here writing the final chapter of the story.

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,960
The ordinary is anything but ordinary.

77
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,200
The peak does not mark the end.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Don't give up

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,760
under any circumstances.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Wind and rain sweeping across the gloomy sky, I'm drowning...

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,960
It's so nice that I have you guys.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Only then did I realize that

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,280
I had always been my own hero.

84
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,840
I have witnessed... legends.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Anyway, you've been known to be a quitter.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,520
If you don't want to do it,

87
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
just don't push yourself too hard!

88
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,040
But I have tried my best...

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,840
You didn't pass the qualification test.

90
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
And you collected the wrong guarding power.

91
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
You are not qualified to be a team boss at all.

92
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,880
Collecting... the wrong guarding power...

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
I didn't know...

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
So go talk to the master now!

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,880
The master is leaving?!

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,200
Ye Xiu!

98
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,200
So you're back.

99
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,480
I happened to have something to tell you.

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Hold up. Don't say anything.

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Listen to me first.

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
Alright, you go first.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I'd like to...

104
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,440
show you around here all over again.

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
What do you think of this place?

106
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,680
It can serve as a lounge for your team.

107
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
It's a bit noisy.

108
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Come with me.

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
This is a VIP room.

110
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,560
The door and windows are all soundproof.

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,800
It can serve as your tactics seminar room.

112
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
You would never be disturbed in any way.

113
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
It's pretty good.

114
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,880
Just a little too small.

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
What do you think of this room?

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
It has good lighting here.

117
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,600
We can make it the dormitory of your team.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Pretty cozy, right?

119
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
You can decorate it as you like.

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,320
It still needs to be decorated?

121
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
I can't wait that long.

122
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,880
Then check it out here.

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
It's perfect.

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
You guys can train here.

125
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,560
I will move

126
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,880
the two tables away.

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,720
Trust me.

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600
I can get it done all by myself in a day.

129
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,680
I hope your team will thrive.

130
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
Why is it...

131
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,640
"your team"?

132
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,040
When you are looking for a partner,

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
don't go for someone like me.

134
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,480
You should get someone reliable and experienced.

135
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Ye Xiu, you've got to return to the league.

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
I will root for you.

137
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,720
Even though I can't be your partner,

138
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
I am still your number one fan.

139
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
So this is what you call an effort?

140
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
I don't want you to leave here.

141
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,720
This place can serve as your base.

142
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
And they're all free, the rent and everything.

143
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,040
For real.

144
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,000
I won't take anything.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,760
I...

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
All I want...

147
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,000
All I want is that you guys stay here.

148
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
Is that okay?

149
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
All being said,

150
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,040
I found that you're really stupid.

151
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
You just offered a deal that would only make you lose money.

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I know that

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,360
I always screw up everything.

154
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,206
That's right.

155
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,036
You were the one to blame

156
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,440
when you collected the wrong guarding power.

157
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,923
And you were the one to blame

158
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,080
when you left without saying goodbye

159
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
and missed our victory.

160
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
But do you know

161
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
what's the most serious thing you should take the blame for?

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
The most serious thing you should take the blame for is that

163
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,840
you gave the guild a wrong name.

164
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,640
The Strong and Stunning  ?

165
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
The team should be named...

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Xing Xin.

167
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,040
What... What does that mean?

168
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
Let's do it all over again.

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm Ye Xiu, a professional esportsman.

170
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,640
I apply to be the captain of the Xing Xin Team.

171
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,320
Nice to meet you. I am...

172
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,800
the manager of the Xing Xin Team.

173
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
I look forward to working with you.

174
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,920
But I screwed up two things.

175
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,040
There is a third thing.

176
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
What is that?

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
If the above two things were screwed up,

178
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,600
we should do them again

179
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
together.

180
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Cheer up.

181
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,920
By the way,

182
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
how many more points do you need to pass today's test?

183
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
10 more points.

184
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,240
Next time you have to pass it.

185
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,040
It's too difficult!

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
For real!

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
I'll have to prepare for the exam

188
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,840
while managing the guild.

189
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
I... I simply can't do it.

190
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,640
You're lucky that I'll get someone to help you.

191
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,800
Just wait for it.

192
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Dad, I'm going to do something

193
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
earth-shattering.

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm going to build a team.

195
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,280
Am I making the impossible

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
possible?

197
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,520
No matter how faraway the target is,

198
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,680
as long as you focus on your chosen one

199
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,920
and don't give up, you'll be able to hit the target.

200
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,160
By the way,

201
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,760
The team is named after...

202
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,600
Xing Xin.

203
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,800
So it really is a net cafe.

204
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,480
No customer here?

205
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
So... Assign me a computer.

206
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
Sorry.

207
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,831
The net cafe's boss is preparing for a test.

208
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:49,200
We're closed for half a day.

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm going nuts.

210
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,240
I know every word in this book.

211
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,000
How come I don't understand anything

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,160
when the words are strung together?

213
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm talking to you.

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Show some respect, please?

215
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,600
If you don't assign me a computer,

216
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,400
I'll keep nagging you.

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,840
Just assign me one.

218
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,680
I'll leave in an hour.

219
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,280
Alright?

220
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,800
Alright, but can you promise that you'll be a quiet pretty boy

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,760
who won't even say a word?

222
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,600
Alright, District B, No. 25.

223
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Do you know me?

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,800
No, I don't.

225
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Are you the only person here

226
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,480
in the net cafe?

227
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Why did he ask me

228
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,480
if I was the only person here?

229
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,040
He wouldn't happen to be this bad guy, would he?

230
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
Holy cow!

231
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,640
It really is him!

232
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,400
Hello?

233
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,120
Bro, where are you?

234
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,360
The captain is looking for you.

235
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,120
Didn't I tell you yesterday that

236
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,080
I would go on a business trip today?

237
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
No way!

238
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
You really went to Xing Xin to meet Jun Moxiao?

239
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,960
You are the guild master of the Lanxi Pavilion.

240
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,480
How could you be so easily

241
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,560
lured into meeting him?

242
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,800
Xi Zhou, listen to me.

243
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,120
The thing is,

244
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
why did the spys

245
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,120
we sent to the Xing Xin Guild

246
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,000
get caught so easily?

247
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,640
Because you were so bad at disguising.

248
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,920
You... You guys did a terrible job disguising yourselves.

249
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
So I had no choice but to

250
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,160
personally penetrate into the enemy's rear area.

251
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,800
I came here to find out

252
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,120
about the Xing Xin Guild.

253
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
How many members do they have?

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How many coaches?

255
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,760
Who is the boss behind the curtain?

256
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Could you guys figure out these?

257
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,120
You guys couldn't figure out these!

258
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
So don't bother me if you don't have anything important to say.

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,480
If I find anything,

260
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,760
I will talk to the captain myself.

261
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,280
Alright, gotta go.

262
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
This won't do. I have to call the police.

263
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,560
That's right.

264
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
Call the police, call the police.

265
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
Why did this computer crash again?

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
So annoying!

267
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
I need another computer. Another computer.

268
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,720
What's this nonsense?

269
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,600
Hello?

270
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,520
Hello, I want to...

271
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,160
Didn't you hear me shouting?

272
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
The computer crashed.

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,040
Assign me another one, please.

274
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,360
I'll do it!

275
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,080
Hold on a second.

276
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
What are the rooms upstairs for?

277
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,600
Those are the private rooms.

278
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,040
Can I play in a private room?

279
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,120
Yes, you can.

280
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
So assign me one!

281
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,040
You can just go straight upstairs.

282
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,360
Alright.

283
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,200
Don't go up and bother me, okay?

284
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,520
No, no, no, don't do it!

285
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,520
Professional team manager?

286
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,720
Are you preparing for the test?

287
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,520
I've taken the test before!

288
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,600
It was so easy!

289
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm telling you,

290
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
you only need to memorize

291
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
all of the exam outlines,

292
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,880
and then read the industry analysis tables multiple times.

293
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Then you'll be able to pass it with your eyes closed!

294
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,960
Is the esports industry

295
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,880
really so hot these days

296
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,640
that even you, a net cafe attendant,

297
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
are joining our grand Glory?

298
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Good, good, good.

299
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,080
Alright, good luck!

300
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,400
You can do it!

301
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,120
No, no.

302
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,240
I have to talk to Ye Xiu.

303
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,120
I need to get Ye Xiu and Bao Zi back here.

304
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Hello, Ye Xiu?

305
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Listen to me,

306
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,760
We have a weird guy

307
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,960
in the net cafe now.

308
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,000
Hello, boss.

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,440
Master!

310
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,560
We just got out of the supermarket.

311
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,280
Let me help you.

312
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
It's alright. It's alright.

313
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
Pick them up.

314
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Okay.

315
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Boss,

316
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,520
please keep going.

317
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm telling you,

318
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
we have a extremely weird guy

319
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
in our net cafe.

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Boss?

321
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,120
Master!

322
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,080
The connection is bad.

323
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm telling you,

324
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I suspect that he may be a wanted criminal.

325
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
No, he is a wanted criminal.

326
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
But don't worry,

327
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,360
I behaved normally("ziran").

328
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,760
What? Cumin(also pronounced as "ziran")? Boss?

329
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,200
Cumin?

330
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,520
Is the boss preparing a barbeque?

331
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,720
Boss, please continue.

332
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,000
Come back as soon as possible, both of you.

333
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,720
I am worried that he will escape("tao").

334
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
Peach(also pronounced as "tao")?

335
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,840
Go, go, go!

336
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,040
Let's go!

337
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
I will come back later.

338
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
As expected, they're going to build a team.

339
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,080
The lineup,

340
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,960
time schedule,

341
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,120
the guarding power, dungeons,

342
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,200
3D maps, simulation diagrams.

343
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,280
I...

344
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,040
Alright, Jun Moxiao!

345
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,320
So you did know that

346
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,760
there were undercovers in the guild,

347
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,080
but you still had the audacity to use us as coolies.

348
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
I will take pictures of everything

349
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,600
and study them later.

350
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,280
Here we go!

351
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,640
There's a person in the room!

352
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Why are you locking the door?!

353
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,953
An excellent citizen

354
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:24,400
who uses her wisdom to trap the wanted criminal.

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Don't think that I wouldn't be able to recognize you

356
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,560
when you're wearing a wig.

357
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,816
This is an evil net cafe!

358
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:46,520
Who gave you the right to lock me in there?!

359
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
I'm telling you not to come over!

360
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,880
You... Don't come near me, you wanted criminal!

361
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,960
Who is a wanted criminal?

362
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm warning you!

363
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,000
Are you calling the police?

364
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,120
I should be the one to call the police!

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,080
You? Calling the police?

366
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You guys are having a jolly time, huh?

367
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,320
As a young, successful, handsome man

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
who has luxuriant hair,

369
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,840
do I look anything like this bald wanted criminal?

370
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
See for yourself. Any similarities?

371
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
Can't see it clearly?

372
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,400
Let's zoom in.

373
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,480
You'll be able to see it when we zoom in.

374
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,560
Hold on.

375
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,280
My name is Xu Boyuan.

376
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,160
Is his name Xu Boyuan?

377
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,720
I am a kind netizen.

378
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,993
First, I didn't break the law.

379
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,320
Second, I didn't default on the internet fee.

380
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,680
If you don't give me an explanation today,

381
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,732
I'll go to the Consumers Association to

382
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,640
file a complaint against you.

383
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,440
Speaking of the internet fee,

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,160
I'd like to check with Mr. Xu

385
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
about your bill.

386
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,840
Go ahead.

387
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
Two hours in the VIP room

388
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,080
on the second floor.

389
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,320
A total of 50 yuan. Is that right?

390
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,400
The two hours...

391
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,400
Alright.

392
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,200
I put a deposit of 100 yuan to the bar counter.

393
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,640
I didn't exceed the time limit. Nor did I overspend.

394
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Right?

395
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,900
You damaged a door lock on the second floor

396
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:58,560
during the consumption.

397
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,800
It's worth 130 yuan.

398
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,560
Alright, I'll pay for the damage caused by me.

399
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,600
In Xing Xin net cafe,

400
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,600
all the door locks were uniformly configured.

401
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
So we'll have to change all the door locks in the whole net cafe.

402
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,440
There're ten doors in total,

403
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,640
worth 1,300 yuan.

404
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
Why do you have to change all of them?

405
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,960
Oh, right.

406
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,040
You accidentally broke the vase here

407
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,960
when you went down the stairs with the boss.

408
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
This vase iteself is not expensive,

409
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,320
but the water inside

410
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,200
splashed onto the socket next to it.

411
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,560
Now the circuits downstairs all burned out.

412
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
Nonsense!

413
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,000
The...

414
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
Nothing burned out!

415
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
I'm telling you...

416
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,120
The power outage has caused us

417
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,240
to be unable to do our business as usual

418
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
and the loss is quite serious.

419
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,040
Don't lie to me on this.

420
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,120
Before I came in,

421
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,800
I saw at the door that

422
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
you are not open today.

423
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,200
Now,

424
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,120
we're open.

425
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,640
I...

426
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
In fact, our net cafe

427
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,720
usually is very busy.

428
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,080
The turnover in half a day is at least

429
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
20,000, 30,000, 40,000, or even 50,000 yuan.

430
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,360
I'll give you a discount.

431
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's make it 35,000 yuan.

432
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,720
After deducting the deposit...

433
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,920
The total is 36,550 yuan.

434
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,320
With the discount...

435
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,080
It's 35,000 yuan.

436
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Card or cash?

437
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,840
What... What is this nonsense?

438
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
Don't lie to me.

439
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,480
However,

440
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm okay if you are willing to pay the debt by labour.

441
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,200
I heard that you had worked as

442
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
a team manager for some time.

443
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,080
So you should know

444
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,920
how to pass the license test.

445
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,560
Lan He.

446
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,640
Why did...

447
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
You... How did you...

448
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,520
You... Are you Jun Moxiao?

449
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,800
Clever.

450
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,280
So it's you!

451
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,320
I've been looking for...

452
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,680
Oh, so it's... It's you...

453
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
You are Jun Moxiao!

454
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,640
But how did you know that I'm Lan He?

455
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,080
In Lan Yu, you're the second smartest guy

456
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,480
after Yu Wenzhou.

457
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,480
So I'll leave our boss in your hands.

458
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
Good luck, Lan He!

459
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
He's getting increasingly better at making deals.

460
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,960
No wonder he's the master I admire.

461
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,640
He's becoming more and more like me.

462
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,040
He's got such a refreshing character

463
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,040
that remains the same whether online or offline,

464
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,800
as expected of Lan He.

465
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,680
Master, the boss you're talking about is...

466
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,760
The boss is...

467
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,640
I fell into their trap instead.

468
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
I came here to spy.

469
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
How did I end up giving a lesson?

470
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,480
No way, no way.

471
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,760
Are you ready?

472
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,400
Mr. Lan, can we start the class now?

473
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Well, Ye Qiu.

474
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,720
Even though you are a master,

475
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,640
there are some things

476
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,600
I have to explain to you.

477
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,880
I came to this city

478
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
on a business trip.

479
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
It's just a coincidence that

480
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
I came to this net cafe.

481
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
It's an even bigger coincidence that I met you.

482
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,160
And, I still have a very

483
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,480
important job of my own to do.

484
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,640
I understand.

485
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,292
There's a meeting.

486
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:40,080
I have been preparing for it for quite some time.

487
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
It's very important.

488
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,080
I may have to leave right now.

489
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,240
For how long?

490
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,680
One hour.

491
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
Okay, good. Go ahead.

492
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,080
Drop the act. Just give the lesson, okay?

493
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,760
Go now, quick.

494
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
Esports is the best combination

495
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,520
of the internet and sports.

496
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
Esports competition has now become

497
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,480
a recognized

498
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
sports competition worldwide

499
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
and a formal event

500
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,280
of the Asian Games as well.

501
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Esports teams

502
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,600
are one of the pillars of the esports industry.

503
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,760
If we want to build a team that enjoys longevity,

504
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,640
a feasible and flawless

505
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,000
operation mechanism is essential.

506
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,200
So, a feasible and flawless operating mechanism

507
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,080
is first and foremost related to financing.

508
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,080
The guilds in Glory

509
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
provide essential support for the esports teams.

510
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
The teams can't thrive without the supplies the guilds provide.

511
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,400
Therefore,

512
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
the development of the guild

513
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,000
is an important foundation for a team.

514
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,280
For a newly established guild like yours,

515
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,600
the most important thing is that...

516
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,440
So well-behaved.

517
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,520
I have never seen her

518
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,880
studying so hard.

519
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,400
And I have never seen anyone

520
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,680
who likes to play tricks more than that guy.

521
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,331
You guys who are always thinking about

522
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,240
tricking others are really despicable.

523
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,640
And you guys who work as tutors are often too negligent.

524
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,080
Oh, right, you have to learn how to

525
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
recruit people in Glory.

526
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,640
Members of this type are the most loyal ones.

527
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,600
They are also the elite members

528
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,300
who will contribute most to

529
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:08,600
the later development and construction of the guild.

530
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
They are the guards of the guild.

531
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,920
The group admins will also play a critical role.

532
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
Instead of making the moodmakers

533
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,000
who are active in the group

534
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,960
the group admins,

535
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,320
we should choose those who love the guild,

536
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,360
have a strong sense of responsibility

537
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,480
and certain management skills,

538
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,720
especially those who are able to

539
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,520
coordinate the conflicts between the members of the guild,

540
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
who have become the traffic lights

541
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,160
and lubricants of the entire guild.

542
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,240
The most important thing is that

543
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,040
you have to learn how to set goals

544
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,120
and build membership systems...

545
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
So you're gonna leave without saying goodbye?

546
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Master, my bro,

547
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,640
I... I am in a hurry to attend the meeting.

548
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,280
I've got to go now.

549
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,560
Have you taught the boss anything?

550
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,560
Master, my bro, I've really tried my best.

551
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,880
I told her everything I should and shouldn't.

552
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,862
The only thing I didn't do was

553
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:33,920
giving her the Lanxi Pavilion as a gift.

554
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,480
So it seems that our boss is really not cut out for it.

555
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,560
She really isn't.

556
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,840
So it seems that the license test is a great challenge for her.

557
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
She definitely will not pass it.

558
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,680
So it seems that I can't leave the guild in her hands.

559
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
Of course you can't.

560
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
So it seems that you're the only one able to manage our guild.

561
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,400
Of course I'm...

562
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,880
No,

563
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,280
I didn't mean that.

564
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,360
Give the position back to her

565
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,480
when the boss passes the exam.

566
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,400
Master, my bro! I didn't mean that!

567
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,520
Want a salary?

568
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,720
No... No!

569
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,920
I knew it!

570
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
Lan He, you're the most loyal friend!

571
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,680
It's not about being loyal!

572
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,400
I have my own job to do!

573
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,040
Besides, later, I'll have to...

574
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,880
Later, I'm going to video call Yu Wenzhou.

575
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Join me and say hello to him?

576
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,720
No need, no need. I gotta go.

577
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,360
Have some breakfast before you leave?

578
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,400
I can't afford to have breakfast here. I can't afford.

579
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,920
So I'll leave the guild in your hands!

580
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,480
Good luck!

581
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,720
What are you doing?

582
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
What's going on?

583
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,520
A thief!

584
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,160
Stop!

585
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,520
Are you okay?

586
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,400
Get up.

587
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,560
I'm sorry.

588
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
No worries.

589
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,880
I have to go now.

590
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,720
Thank you!

591
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
No worries, no worries.

592
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Saying you don't need it, you deliberately left it to me...

593
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Your backpack!

594
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,640
Zoning out?

595
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,680
Tang, look at this ornament.

596
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,600
Do you still remember?

597
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,920
Are you trying to remind me of

598
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,240
how stupid a mistake I had made

599
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,320
that you missed the most

600
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,240
important test of your life?

601
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,840
Look! I rarely have a day to

602
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,000
tidy up the room!

603
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,920
Alright, stop hiding.

604
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,160
These are all just props

605
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
you have been preparing,

606
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,640
right?

607
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,880
To be honest, I never wanted to

608
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
take the test.

609
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
So helping you catch the thief

610
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,320
and grabbing the wrong backpack

611
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,287
became the perfect excuse for me to

612
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:23,120
lose the exam admission ticket.

613
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,880
After that, every year during my vacation,

614
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,280
I asked you to tutor me,

615
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,240
just so that you would spend more time with me.

616
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,040
I tried so hard to prepare for tests.

617
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
I tried so hard

618
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
to make myself worthy of being your friend,

619
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
despite the fact that I never passed the tests.

620
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,320
Look, these, and these.

621
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
I put all my IQ points into these.

622
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,760
Maybe taking the professional manager test

623
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,000
is a better choice for me.

624
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,560
Alright. Actually,

625
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,640
I've known all your ulterior motives

626
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,200
since the first time I tutored you.

627
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,400
I didn't know you were so sharp!

628
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,920
Coming here to tutor you has been,

629
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,720
actually, an excuse for myself as well.

630
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,440
I come to Xing Xin

631
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,800
looking to escape from something.

632
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,760
No matter what you're trying to escape from,

633
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,200
please come here more often.

634
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I probably won't be able to come here often.

635
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,960
Why?

636
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,600
The Berklee College of Music

637
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
sent me an invitation.

638
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,560
I'll have to leave after the Spring Festival.

639
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

640
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,400
To be honest, I had been struggling to make the decision.

641
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,680
But I didn't want to miss

642
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,640
such a good opportunity.

643
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,720
Shouldn't you be happy for me as well?

644
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Guoguo,

645
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,120
both of us should make a choice now.

646
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,880
Time flies.

647
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,440
In the blink of an eye, the Spring Festival comes.

648
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,680
People said goodbye and left for hometown one by one.

649
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,600
Only Ye Xiu didn't leave for unknown reasons.

650
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,440
Actually, I...

651
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,440
Looking forward to your next visit!

652
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Take care of yourself.

653
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
This is the first Spring Festival

654
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,200
I get to spend with

655
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,160
Ye Xiu and Mucheng.

656
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,960
I have to maintain a nice image.

657
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,480
The coat doesn't look so good, right?

658
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,280
Not good, not good, not good.

659
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
No more coats.

660
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,360
Maybe I should settle for this one.

661
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,920
The color looks pretty nice.

662
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,480
Still less than satisfactory though.

663
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,800
I am the manager

664
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,280
of the team now.

665
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,360
I should at least wear fancy outfits.

666
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,720
It's not enough if I only have

667
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,480
a scarf from a luxury brand.

668
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,720
Fashion taste highlights your character.

669
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,280
People will judge your value based on your character.

670
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,400
Piggies, I'm counting on you!

671
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,200
How is it going?

672
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,680
Oh my goodness.

673
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,080
It's covered with dust.

674
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,160
We've run out of rags.

675
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,920
Please go to my room and find an old piece of clothing.

676
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,320
Cut a few pieces from it and use them as rags.

677
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,760
What would count as an "old" piece of clothing?

678
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,880
A ragged or patched one.

679
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,560
One that you know

680
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,200
it should be recycled at first glance.

681
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,400
Good job!

682
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,480
Stop it!

683
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,480
What's that in your hand?

684
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,080
You're using my scarf as a rag?!

685
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,800
A ragged, patched one

686
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
that should be recycled.

687
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,960
Isn't that the right one?

688
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
You really pissed me off!

689
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,280
The scarf is very expensive!

690
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,280
Where's the other half?

691
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,120
What have you even done

692
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,960
for this net cafe?

693
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,480
You couldn't change the bulb!

694
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,920
You had to be taught how to be a cashier!

695
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,880
I'm so pissed off!

696
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
You are really use...

697
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,480
Less.

698
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,440
You must win a person's heart

699
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,320
to keep this person.

700
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
How to win the heart?

701
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,840
Two words.

702
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,400
Spoil him.

703
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,880
Use...ful!

704
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,720
Superman!

705
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,800
Master!

706
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,480
Master, having you in my Xing Xin net cafe

707
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,400
is a destined blessing

708
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,360
derived from my previous eight lives!

709
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,960
Sorry for my bad temper.

710
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,360
This scarf,

711
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,440
I don't need it anymore!

712
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I'll buy another one next time.

713
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,480
In Spring Festival

714
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,440
we shouldn't be fighting each other.

715
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,480
Right, Master?

716
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,920
So I'll continue.

717
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,960
What?

718
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,960
You shouldn't be doing this kind of

719
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
dirty work, menial work.

720
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
I'll do it!

721
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,680
Boss, leave the dirty work to me.

722
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,240
Let me do it!

723
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,120
Let me do it!

724
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,600
We shouldn't be fighting each other.

725
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,680
Just let me do it!

726
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,400
Alright, alright.

727
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,160
Take this bank card.

728
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,240
Go buy a new set of clothing.

729
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,360
Wearing new clothes

730
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,200
will bring you the best of luck in the new year!

731
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,400
It dropped.

732
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,320
Let me pick it up for you.

733
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,160
Take it. Go, go.
