Could you ever...

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,860
...compete with me for one more time?

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,560
This time...

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,020

- What... What are you doing? - Give it to me...

10
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,720
You did this?

11
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,420
Don't...

12
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
How could it be me?

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,580
It was me.

14
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,760
It had nothing to do with him.

15
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,630
I'll pay you for whatever it costs.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Cool.

17
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,410
You do it.

18
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,530
Give me the money.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,650
Fine.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,360
Now what?

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Your money was stolen?

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,960
Come here, you.

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,400
Come here!

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm overwhelmed.

25
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,180
It's the first time to see someone played arcade games

26
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,860
when having a fever of 39℃.

27
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,520
By the way...

28
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,010
I'll go buy medicine for him.

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,240
You take care of him.

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,650
Don't touch his favorite toy.

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,160
Brother!

32
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,140
The Transformer's arm was broken.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,430
It has nothing to do with me.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,660
We clowned around together...

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,520
We kept each other warm...

36
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,640
We went through the chaos of our adolescence...

37
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,920
I still remember what you said to me.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,370
"We shouldn't be too furious in early youth.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,080
Because life is still long."

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,730
Are these the ones we broke last time?

41
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,020
Yep.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,330
I bought both of them.

43
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,880
Why did you buy the broken ones?

44
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,800
# You cover your unwillingness with a smile. #

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,160
I bought them...

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,030
...to get your lucky coins back!

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,320
Anyways, you can fix anything.

48
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,740
So, fix these two machines!

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,480
Wait! Come back!

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,090
Where did you get the money?

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
Did you rob a bank?

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,690
What I did is much better than robbing a bank.

53
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,660
Look!

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,860

61
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,480
I was the first one to play the game.

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,770
No one can compete with me.

63
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,760
How brazen!

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,860
You even dare to boast before the national champion.

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
You won because I wasn't in the competition.

66
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,820

Even though my big brother was an NPC,

95
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,080
he wanted to stay with a big brother like this for longer...

Fine.

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,840
You won't eat anything?

101
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,720
I'll throw all food away.

102
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,890
We'll eat, OK?

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,320
It's just breakfast.

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,040
Everyone, start eating!

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,720
Start eating.

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,480
Pass me the bread, please.

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,520
If you could turn to others in competitions, it'd be great.

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Wait...

109
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,910
Where is Wu Chen?

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
Has anyone seen him?

111
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,800
Since the competition ended that day...

112
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,880
I have never seen him again.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,120
I knew it was him.

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
We were right not to let him compete.

115
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,950
He might manage to climb the social ladder in Zhu Xian.

116
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,380
Don't say that, Lao Wei.

117
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,040
How can we blame Wu Chen for being defeated by Zhu Xian?

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,840
What I said is all true.

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,670
I myself saw him with Zhu Xian players before the competition.

120
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,980
Who would know if it was him who ratted us out?

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,810
He told them Lao Ye was not there.

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
Are you sure it was Wu Chen?

123
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,400
Didn't someone blunder because the mouse slipped out of his hand?

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,530
Besides...

125
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,660
Let me ask you...

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,440
What's wrong with your hand?

127
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,460
Now what?

128
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't make that face.

129
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,870
Nobody owes you anything.

130
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,400
"Listen to my command and we'll win for sure"?

131
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,680
Listen!

132
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,710
What I hate most is someone gets above himself with his sciolism!

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,950
If you are really capable, win to prove yourself!

134
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,310
Xiao An!

135
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,000
Stop it!

136
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,080
The best commander needs a good cooperation.

137
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,600
Go practice and improve yourself!

138
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,580
Cooperation?

139
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
Who was the one that went to the front and disrupted the entire plan?

140
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,980
Was that me? Never!

141
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,260
Why did I go to the front?

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,040
There was no main attacker at all!

143
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,180
Don't look at me.

144
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,840
We need to adjust our paces when attacking!

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,240
You think you are the best and everyone else is holding you back?

146
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,000
But each time I do the post-game analysis,

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
I see you disrupt our paces by taking your own course.

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,840
Enough.

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,420
We are a team.

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,960
Could everyone just calm down?

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,710
Yifan.

152
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,360
When would you know your own mind?

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,640
He doesn't need to.

154
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,900
"Yes Man" never needs to take responsibilities for anyone!

155
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,800
Everyone should take responsibilities for the competition.

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,230
It doesn't make any sense to say all this when we are angry.

157
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,240
Why are you here validating your existence?

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Have you got any score?

159
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,980
Why don't you make a "Losers' Team" with Luo Ji? Perfect for you!

160
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,180
Are you done?

161
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,880
You won't let it go?

162
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,620
No!

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,960
We are not born to build a team together!

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,320
Fine.

165
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,620
Let's part our ways.

166
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,370
Do it!

167
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Now!

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Whatever.

169
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,860
I don't even like it here.

This time...

190
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,520
I won't...

191
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,120
...and I don't want to...

192
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
...make any decisions for you.

193
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,520
Tang.

194
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,200
Let's go.

195
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
Look at me!

196
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,800
See my APM?

197
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,390
As fast as before!

198
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,790
Look at my position.

199
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,120
As fancy as before!

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,670
See my reaction?

201
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,440
Lao Wei, any new word?

202
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,920
Stop it!

203
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,260
Look at you.

204
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Only can show off when doing PVE.

205
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,060
You'll absolutely be defeated by new talents in real competitions.

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,000
We retired 5 or 6 years ago.

207
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,840
You're not like us. You just made your reappearance.

208
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,520
We'd never be the ones they wanted to rival against.

209
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,560
Don't even mention real competitions.

210
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm afraid a boss would be a disaster for you.

211
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,040
Wait!

212
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,100
Are you provoking us?

213
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,930
Lao Wei, don't look down on us.

214
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,510
Let's show him.

215
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,240
I won't go home if I can't defeat several bosses.

216
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,120
Seriously?

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,260
Stay focused!

218
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,840
Good job!

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
Hello.

220
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,120
Honey...

221
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,060
Yes, I bought it.

222
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,090
I'm on my way home.

223
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,660
Met a traffic jam.

224
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,070
There is no keyboard sound.

225
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,150
You got it wrong.

226
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,040
No keyboard at all on the road.

227
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,540
OK, I see.

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,100
Seriously?

229
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,440
Come and fill!

230
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm coming. Let's continue.

231
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,940
Lao Wei.

232
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,520
Let's poke?

233
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,790
Hello.

234
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,920
What?

235
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,920
It didn't work by increasing 2%?

236
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,360
OK. Wait for me.

237
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,240
No need.

238
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,780
The driver is downstairs.

239
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,040
Lao Wei. Let's take a rain check.

240
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
Something came up in the company. I gotta go.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,380
See you.

242
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,740
What the heck?!

243
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,780
Next time I'll take all your phones away when you come!

244
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,250
Exactly!

245
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,710
Lao Wu, you are my good buddy.

246
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,300
Only you and I can also beat the boss.

247
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:57,960
Hello.

248
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll be right there. I promise.

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,180
Well...

250
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,220
Lao Wei.

251
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,260
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,700
My driving buddies are rushing me.

253
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,100
We'll make a self-driving tour to Tibet.

254
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,570
I thought I could play some games before leaving.

255
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,080
Next time.

256
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,640
I'll have a blast with you.

257
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,800
I give you my word.

258
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,990
Why is it so difficult to find someone to play Glory with?

259
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,880
Lao Wei.

260
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,760
You played Glory.

261
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
And you went through a lot.

262
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
It's time to let go.

263
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,090
Think about your future.

264
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
You are the same.

265
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,560
You can let anything go but Glory.

266
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,130
Or you wouldn't come back.

267
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,520
I...

268
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,500
I came back for the baby diapers I bought for my kid.

269
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,970
Bye!

270
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,160
Driver, stop here, please.

271
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,120
Pay attention to the rhythms when you play this part.

272
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,000
OK.

273
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,780
Stop.

274
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Tang Rou.

275
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
Let me introduce her.

276
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
This is your senior.

277
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,480
She is my most excellent student.

278
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,420
Come here.

279
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,280
Long time no see.

280
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,960
Long time no see.

281
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,520
I chose to escape from here before.

282
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,680
But I won't do it again.

283
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,360
If you decide not to escape again,

284
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,680
would you come back?

285
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,350
Think about it.

286
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Because of a mistake I made in the competition,

287
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,060
I have never played the piano again.

288
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,720
The old me...

289
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
...thought winning the competition...

290
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
...was my entire life.

291
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
But the new me...

292
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,010
...is not afraid of losing anymore.

293
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,920
I won't escape, either.

294
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,080
Because my passion...

295
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
...triumphs over winning or losing.

296
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,770
What makes me understand all this...

297
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,800
...is Glory.

298
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,560
The price...

299
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,280
...is listed very clearly.

300
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,070
If you make up your mind...

301
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,490
...sign here.

302
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,470
= Payment for Purchasing the Game Account =

303
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,040
Boss Wei!

304
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
You forgot to take the medicine for your hand injury.

305
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,320
I've brought it here.

306
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,040
= Signature =

307
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,480
You're selling your account?

308
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,530
Wand of Death is even more precious than your life.

309
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,560
Are you really selling it?

310
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,820
I don't want it anymore.

311
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,030
Don't sign it!

312
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,520
Get out!

313
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Go!

314
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:35,920
Go!

315
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
Are you really leaving Glory?

316
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,520
Or what?

317
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,320
I couldn't even call up my friends together.

318
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,560
Where could I play Glory?

319
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,700
Return to Xing Xin with me.

320
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,610
Like our old days.

321
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,710
We screwed things up when rivaling against Zhu Xian.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,760
Do you think we...

323
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,120
No...

324
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,720
Do you think I...

325
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,720
...should continue working on it?

326
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,510
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

327
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,970
Moreover, it was not your own responsibility in that competition.

328
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm not like any of you.

329
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,660
I should live like others who are in my age.

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,450
What's your age?

331
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,560
In my eyes...

332
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,290
You are in the exact age when you should strive, hang out,

333
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,380
and play Glory with us all!

334
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Look at it!

335
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,370
It is the injury that decides I need to leave now.

336
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,720
Our captain has said...

337
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Only you can make the decision...

338
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,000
...when you should leave the competition.

339
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,710
No matter if you are at your peak,

340
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,290
or in your trough,

341
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,160
or you're kicked out...

342
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,980
As long as you love Glory,

343
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,960
as long as you want to be in this arena,

344
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,440
you'll find a way to handle all your setbacks and failures.

345
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,000
It's a choice that we eSports players must face!

346
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,900
No matter how many times we start over...

347
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,440
...we'll never change.

348
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,070
Sign it.

349
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,560
Wait a sec.

350
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
I've got another pen here.

351
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
Hurry up and sign it.

352
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,040

Sir, we're about to close.

355
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Sorry. I...

356
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,950
Thank you.

357
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,740
Why have you been sitting here?

358
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I like this intersection.

359
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,320
What about the intersection?

360
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,330
Anything special?

361
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,550
If any of them comes back, I can see them from here.

362
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,760
So?

363
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
So I can hear the captain say:

364
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,940
"All team players of Xing Xin are here!"

365
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,760
What if...

366
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,190
...they would never come back?

367
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,220
They will.

368
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm afraid we have to...

369
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,080
...wait for the red light to go off for too long...

370
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,000
...and the green light just flashes away.

371
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,550
The red light will be on for a long time.

372
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,200
But it's OK.

373
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,730
I'll wait longer.

374
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,020
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

375
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
I've fixed the umbrella.

376
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,920
But...

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,280
I feel something is still wrong.

378
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
New rubber bands.

379
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,320
New hair pins.

380
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,560
New cloth.

381
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,760
The material is updated.

382
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,950
The quality is much better.

383
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,970
I think the umbrella is pretty good.

384
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,640
No matter how good it is...

385
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,620
It's not the one I used to have.

386
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,060
I thought...

387
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,360
I'd get to the end with a thousand-machine umbrella by being Jun Moxiao.

388
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,080
But I didn't make it.

389
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
Remember this coin?

390
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,470
If it had not been for it,

391
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,370
Your big brother would have never taken me in.

392
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,570
If it had not been for it,

393
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,520
you would have never met me.

394
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,480
Back then, my parents were gone.

395
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
My relatives living abroad wanted to adopt me.

396
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,000
Should we still stick together like before?

397
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,400
Or should he let me leave for a promising future?

398
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,270
My big brother hesitated.

399
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,990
Head, let her go.

400
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,460
Tail, let her stay.

401
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,880
# Your old coat... #

402
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,560
Because of you...

403
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,480
our fate has been changed.

404
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,510
You always say you were lucky to meet us.

405
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,020
But your appearance...

406
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,640
...was the best luck the lucky coin brought to us.

407
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,440
Your big brother never wanted to let you go.

408
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,000
I was just passing by inadvertently.

409
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,720
And then inadvertently...

410
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,230
...helped him make a decision that had been in his mind.

411
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,780
But you always inadvertently helped us...

412
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
...to have the best choices.

413
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,960
# But you try your best not leaving regrets for me. #

414
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,160
Why are you quitting the part-time job here?

415
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
I'm looking for a full-time job...

416
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,470
...which will help me make money...

417
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,400
...and feed my family.

418
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,740
But...

419
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,680
What about the senior seminar of programming?

420
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,920
I quit.

421
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,560
Su Muqiu.

422
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
Are you really doing this?

423
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,920
To be a miserable brother quitting school for his little sister?

424
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,270
Since I've decided to stick with Mucheng,

425
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,490
I'll try whatever I can to give her a better life.

426
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,240
What is "better life"?

427
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,340
Mucheng's birthday wish was to go to the Sea World.

428
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,700
But what I can afford now is three golden fishes.

429
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,520
# I will care about you forever. #

430
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,340
Who said three little golden fishes...

431
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,140
...would never have their own Sea World?

432
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,160
The three of us...

433
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,330
...were like these three golden fishes.

434
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,880
We didn't have a big house.

435
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,080
We didn't have fancy decorations.

436
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,240
But we were still happy.

437
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,880
This was "better life".

438
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,960
Thank you.

439
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,150
You gave me the best birthday gift ever.

440
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,320
Thank you.

441
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,960
For being the best birthday gift ever...

442
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,680
...in my and my brother's life.

443
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:35,480
# You are like my private investigator. #

444
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,360
We'll have many crossings in life.

445
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,200
If we were not careful enough...

446
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,040
...we'd derail.

447
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,690
What I only did was to tell your brother...

448
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,120
...to go along one road.

449
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,340
There's nothing wrong with going along one road.

450
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,910
That was how exactly...

451
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,740
...I met all of you.

452
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,400
And my brother could go back to school.

453
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,800
In the end...

454
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,130
A thousand-machine umbrella was born.

455
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,660
I got it! I got it!

456
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,200
Look!

457
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,160
How about this design?

458
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,560
Awesome!

459
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,280
We made it!

460
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,960
But it belongs to me now.

461
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,180
It's mine!

462
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,760
Come back!

463
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,800
I said "it's mine"!

464
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,580
I said it!

465
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,160
Everyone said...

466
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,110
A thousand-machine umbrella was an unpractical fantasy.

467
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,000
And it was a mission that would never be accomplished.

468
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,800
But you said...

469
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,570
The difference between fantasy and reality was whether you believe it.

470
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,940
And the way to make the impossible possible was never give up.

471
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
So, a thousand-machine umbrella...

472
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,000
...has never only belonged to my brother.

473
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,320
You used to help him a lot.

474
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,960
So now...

475
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,880
Let him help you make a decision.

476
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,160
Tell us...

477
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
...what we should do.

478
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,910
No need to look.

479
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,880
I know what Muqiu would say.

480
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,560
"No big deal.

481
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
Start over."

482
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,400
Ta Yun and Xing Xin have equal points.

483
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,960
= Xing Xin Team =
Ta Yun and Xing Xin have equal points.

= Xing Xin Team =

485
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,130
But with the win-lose situation, Xing Xin has made their way to the final.
= Xing Xin Team =

486
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
- Manager Chen, what's your opinion? - Talk to us.

487
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,340
Could we have the conversation upstairs?

488
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,440
OK, OK.

489
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,840
Share details with us later, please.

490
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,200
OK.

491
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,620
Come in, please.

492
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,460
We all know when rivaling against Zhu Xian,

493
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,430
there was something wrong with Captain Ye's ultimate weapon.

494
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,390
Will he show up in the final and compete?

495
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,690
All players are trying to fix it now.

496
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,240
Moreover, you care about competitions more than equipment displays.

497
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,130
Has your players been affected by the failure from last time?

498
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,880
Captain Ye has said:

499
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,900
"Some battles you win, some battles you lose."

500
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,840
Everyone is very active now.

501
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,310
We are actively preparing for the competition.

502
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,000
But according to our informant,

503
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,760
Wei Chen has sold his account and his silver equipment "Wand of Death".

504
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,600
How would you explain it?

505
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,260
We heard Tang Rou returned to her band and Wu Chen was in Zhu Xian.

506
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,930
And your other players are not with Xing Xin.

507
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,610
So, with everyone's leaving,

508
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,000
will Xing Xin be dissolved?

509
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,480
I've told you.

510
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,160
Everyone is trying to fix a thousand-machine umbrella actively.

511
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,350
Captain Ye has sent them to buy materials.

512
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,660
That's why they are not with Xing Xin now.

513
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,760
Could we call them from here?

514
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,480
We care about what's really going on.

515
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,560
Yes, call them.

516
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,920
Prove it by calling them.

517
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,440
Seems Xing Xin is just an empty shell. No one is here.

518
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Who said that?

519
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,710
Boss.

520
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,620
I've got all the materials you and Captain Ye needed.

521
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,560
Things are going well with Yifan and others.

522
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,240
They'll be back soon.

523
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,060
It's the contract of purchasing materials.

524
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,440
All data are in here.

525
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,120
You wanna prove something?

526
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,520
Go ahead.

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,930
Remember it.

531
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,940
Keep in touch with us.

532
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,780
We will.

533
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,440
- Bye! - Bye!

534
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,920
So you met with Zhu Xian players to buy materials?

535
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,500
Yes.

536
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,620
Xing Xin didn't have enough silver equipment.

537
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,640
I wanted to surprise all of you.

538
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,400
Why didn't you tell us back then?

539
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,940
We'll listen to the chief commander no matter what happens.

540
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,470
Keeping you all on an even keel...

541
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,900
...is more important than whether I was in the competition.

542
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,290
Where did you go after the competition?

543
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,220
To save a thousand-machine umbrella.

544
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,900
The final was coming. Time was running out.

545
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,220
I visited many teams and guilds in a short time.

546
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
And I've got a batch of basic materials.

547
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,870
Hope they will help the captain.

548
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,040
Do you think if they would come back?

549
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,090
Boss.

550
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,150
All professional players will face the life crossing of choices.

551
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,920
I've made my choice.

552
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,380
It's their turn now.

553
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,530
What we can do now...

554
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,460
...is to give them more space...

555
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,420
...and give the captain more time.
