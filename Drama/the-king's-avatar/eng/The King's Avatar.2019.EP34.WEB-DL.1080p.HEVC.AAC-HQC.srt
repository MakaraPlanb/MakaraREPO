= Episode 34 =

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,160
Our competition result being like that,

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
we shouldn't blame Lao Wei on his command,

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
or blame your performance.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,240
It's only

7
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,080
because that all we knew is drinking,

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,320
and forgot the tactic

9
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,920
arranged by our captain.

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,080
Let Wu Chen play or not.

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
As usual,

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
let's vote.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
Now, three to three.

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,040
It's a tie.

15
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,840
Yifan, what about you?

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
I abstain.

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
As our team manager,

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,200
I'll make the decision.

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Wei Chen's decision is mine.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,171
= Qiao Yifan. Wu Chen =

21
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,000

23
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,280
Hello.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
Xing Xin Team only got two points

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
in the first half of the game.

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,720
Is your so-called the best novice beauty

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
in unbalanced mental condition?

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,080
And,

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,440
although Wei Chen

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
is a seasoned veteran,

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,080
his physical strength has reached the limit.

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,160
The most terrible thing is that

33
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,600
even your boss joins the game in person.

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,840
How do you continue this game?

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
The game is not over yet.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
But time is running out for them.

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,120
Ye Xiu.

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
Face the truth.

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,840
Without you, Xing Xin Team doesn't have the soul.

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,880
Our chairman is coming back soon.

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,600
You will hear the official verdict in no time.

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,600
This is the end of your game career.

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
Everyone is coming to hear the results.

44
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
The league's punishment for Ye Xiu is

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,640
to ban him from The Glory.

46
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
You give ban to Lao Ye.

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
What's the meaning for us to play the game?

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,760
Well, if you do this,

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
why don't you ban us all.

50
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,160
Shaotian.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
We know that you are Ye Xiu's friends.

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,840
But the problem can't be solved if you are so impulsive.

53
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
If you don't agree,

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,800
you must give league

55
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,120
a convincing reason.

56
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Ok. We have too many reasons. Such as...

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Most of tactics and methods using in the League

58
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,480
were created by Ye Xiu.

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,320
If we lose him, the text book,

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,160
so many fantastic playing methods

61
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,400
will become mediocre.

62
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
And tactics will not have new creation.

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,680
Yes. Tactics of this game will cease to update.

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
Training of newcomers will also have a break.

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
There are too many novices

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,520
who watch Ye Xiu's contest video over and over again,

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,080
and fight against him round by round,

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,560
so that they can grow up.

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Now, Ye Xiu should completely retreat

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
with his proud results.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
But he chose to stay

72
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
side by side with the grass-roots team.

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
Why?

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,440
Because these new players he cultivated

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
are the future of Glory.

76
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
In addition to the newcomers,

77
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,560
there are also veterans in the league like us.

78
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,480
As long as Ye Xiu holds on for one more day,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,440
we will not leave the game in a sloppy way.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,080
For me, personally...

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,800
No, for many of us,

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,680
Ye Xiu is our best opponent.

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,640
As long as Ye Xiu is in this game,

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,240
we will never stop practicing.

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
We will constantly look for new methods

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,040
to beat him.

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
I am very glad that

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,720
there is such a peak like Ye Xiu in Glory,

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,600
so that we can always keep

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,520
the enthusiasm for climbing.

91
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,720
Well said.

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
Now, do you understand?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
There are too many reasons.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Shaotian, go on.

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,360
Chairman Feng, how much Ye Xiu contributed to Glory?

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
I believe that you know better than us.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
But what's more important than contribution is

98
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,640
to accompany.

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
I don't know how to describe

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
this feeling of companionship.

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,800
The Glory occupies our time and youth,

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,920
while we make the game full of life.

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
We dedicate our youth to it

104
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,080
while it gives us glory.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,720
So,

106
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,600
we just hope that

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,960
league could decide cautiously.

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
After all, not only Lao Ye

109
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,040
has fought for ten years,

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,800
but also thousands of players

111
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,520
have fought for ten years together

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,480
In what role do you come here?

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
We are professional players of Glory.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,320
Shaotian, have a seat.

115
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,400
I understand your feelings.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
On behalf of my own opinion,

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,840
Ye Xiu is a great player.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,920
He brought Glory many surprises.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Personally, I want him to stay in this game.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
However,

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,760
it is true that he broke the rules.

122
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,800
You are professional players.

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,640
I hope you respect the decision of the League.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
Now it's time

125
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
for Team Competition between Xing Xin Team

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,800
and Zhu Xian Team.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's welcome

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
two teams into game rooms. Welcome.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,280
Come on, come on, everyone.

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,920
Fighting.

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Lao Ye, I bet you will come.

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,640
I am counting on you.

133
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,360
Ok, the next is

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
Team Competition.

135
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
In the previous Individual Event and Arena Contest

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
the Xing Xin Team only scored two points.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Their situation is quite unfavorable.

138
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,160
Even in this case,

139
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,240
Xing Xin Team did not let Master Ye Qiu play first,

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,200
but makes him

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
as a substitute.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
What is this tactic? Ruo Feng.

143
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,760
I noticed that in Individual Event and Arena Contest

144
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
their leader Ye Qiu didn't appear.

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,680
I don't know if it's something goes wrong,

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,160
or it's just a special tactic.

147
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,040
Whether it is a special tactic

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,120
or any unknown situation,

149
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,400
let us find it out in the game.

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
Team Competition between Xing Xin Team and Zhu Xian Team.

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
The game starts now.

152
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,280
We can see that in the beginning,

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,240
these five Xing Xin's players are clinging to each other.

154
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
But, unusually,

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
instead of

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,280
moving towards their rival's position,

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
they make a detour,

158
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes. The five member of Xing Xin...

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
Remember to follow our plan.

160
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
We should stall for time as far as possible to wait for Lao Ye.

161
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
Windward Formation is in the middle

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
Han Yanrou pretects

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,320
their Cleric Cold Hands well.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,040
Pay attention to the environment around. Watch out.

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
Xing Xin goes very carefully.

166
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
They cling together,

167
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,640
whenever anything goes wrong,

168
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,240
Move on.

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
they would stop to check out.

170
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
This is not like the style of Xing Xin Team.

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,440
Master Ye Qiu, their core of tactics, is not present,

172
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
their playing methods become a little passive.

173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Consume their energy and stall time.

174
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
Shui Youhan is pestering

175
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,760
Han Yanrou and Cold Hands.

176
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
The Assassin is very flexible.

177
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,480
He can use narrow terrain to keep dodging.

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,720
So Han Yanrou can't reach him.

179
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,400
Hey, beauty. Don't be angry.

180
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
You said that you will not fall twice

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
in the same place.

182
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,240
Now that I am here,

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
how are you going to take revenge?

184
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
Xiao An, it's dangerous.

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Now Han Yanrou has to fight against two persons.

186
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,600
What's the hurry? Didn't we say

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
we'd play together?

188
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,480
It's more interesting for Assassin to play with two people.

189
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,280
Isn't it?

190
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
We all want to see

191
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,240
will you fall twice in the same place?

192
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Yes. The double Assassins of Zhu Xian are very confident.

193
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
They ignore the Cleric directly and storm Han Yanrou.

194
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Let's look at the other side. Three to three.

195
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
Windward Formation, Yi Cunhui and Bao Zi, The Invader

196
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,200
fight against Ten Thousand Swords,

197
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Hua Nongying and Freezing Desert of Zhu Xian Team.

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Although two persons in Zhu Xian is carrying,

199
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
they have Cleric as a support.

200
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
And they cooperate very well.

201
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,040
Their HP is controlled in a healthy state.

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,360
Meanwhile, let's look at Xing Xin.

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,760
Their cooperation is a little rusty.

204
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,040
There are some problems with the cooperation.

205
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,520
Yeah. Comparing with Zhu Xian's protection for Cleric,

206
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,200
Xing Xin did not give enough space for Windward Formation

207
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,440
to cast his skills.

208
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
His skills are frequently interrupted

209
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,880
And there's no chance for Yi Cunhui to release The Ghost Array.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,280
Without Jun Moxiao,

211
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,200
Xing Xin's ability declines too much.

212
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,600
Although Zhu Xian is lack of an attacker,

213
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
their rhythm is much better.

214
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Xin Xin has been playing passive defense since begining.

215
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
It shouldn't be.

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
Windward Formation is jumping to the high point.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,960
He wants to sort out the scattered formation.

218
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Is he going to arrange a new tactic?

219
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Tang , how can you leave the Cleric alone?

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,240
I must kill these two persons first.

221
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
Xiao An get back. I'll cover you.

222
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Tang, let's go!

223
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
It's not worthy to fight against two Assassins.

224
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,840
You go first. Leave me along.

225
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,520
Cold Hands moves finally.

226
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,960
He is assembling with others

227
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
But Han Yanrou doesn't retreat.

228
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,880
She's still fighting with two assassins by force.

229
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,240
It's a little bit over.

230
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,080
Why didn't he hit the target?

231
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
What a pity!

232
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,880
He wasted such a good chance.

233
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,160
That's a big mistake.

234
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,440
He could have broken the impasse.

235
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Now, he has to wait for another chance.

236
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
It seems that he was a little burned out

237
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,080
in the previous Arena Contest.

238
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,480
Catch their Cleric.

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,120
Catch him!

240
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,640
Pay attention to your HP.

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,120
Xing Xin Team's aim is very clear.

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,520
They are restricting rival's Cleric.

243
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
But unfortunately, the effect is not obvious

244
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
Find a place to hide.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,520
Understand.

246
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Zhu Xian Team makes the same decision,

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,560
to lay siege to Cleric.

248
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
Cold Hands makes good movement.

249
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,680
He keeps covering himself by the buildings,

250
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
to make his rivals can't see him.

251
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Howerver, the Sharpshooter of Zhu Xian is right after him.

252
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,760
Cold Hands

253
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,200
can't get chances to add blood.

254
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,960
His is still dodging.

255
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,760
He is too passive.

256
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,160
In this way, it is possible that Cleric of Xing Xin

257
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,080
will be killed first.

258
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
Windward Formation arrives.

259
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,520
What? He missed the target.

260
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,520
He hits a stone wall.

261
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,720
This is really a big mistake.

262
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
Cold Hands is indirectly injured by his teammate.

263
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,800
He is killed by Zhu Xian's attacker with the help of his teammate.

264
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,920
Xing Xin's performance is really bad today.

265
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,880
Ruo Feng,

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,280
do you think if Xing Xin still has a chance to turn over?

267
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,640
Sorry. I missed the target.

268
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
I was killed by my own teammate. How can I play this game?

269
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,240
It's Assassin Heaven and Earth Get Same Destination.

270
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,600
Well done. It seems that she has learned the lesson,

271
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,760
she perfectly avoided their attack this time.

272
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,920
I told you

273
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,720
I won't fall twice in the same place.

274
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,960
Why she is so careless? She forgot to retreat

275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,600
They complete a sneak-raid. Han Yanrou is out.

276
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,840
But I didn't say that

277
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,720
we will use the same skill

278
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
Zhu Xian Team killed one more player.

279
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,560
Now the score is two to zero.

280
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
It's likely that Zhu Xian Team would win the game.

281
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,120
If Ye Xiu doesn't come back sooner,

282
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
the match will end

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,680
before we have the chance to see their substitute.

284
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,160
After internal discussions,

285
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,000
the league will punish Ye Xiu

286
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
for using false name in the competition.

287
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
We decided to cancel all the achievement he obtained

288
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
in the name of Ye Qiu.

289
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
In other words,

290
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,280
in the past eight years,

291
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,880
all of his achievements in Jia Shi don't count.

292
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,120
He must start from scratch as Ye Xiu.

293
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,920
Chairman, it's not the ruling that you just stated.

294
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,160
May I ask

295
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,120
why the league made this decision?

296
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,280
At present,

297
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Xing Xin's score is less than Zhu Xian, as well as HP.

298
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,240
I am afraid that the only chance to reverse this situation

299
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,760
Driver.

300
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
is waiting for the substitute, Master Ye Qiu

301
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
to create a miracle.

302
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,760
Driver. Stop.

303
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,720
Hold on, you two guys.

304
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Copy that.

305
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
Hey. Stop.

306
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
We can see that the magic power of Wand of Death has been condensed

307
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
and he will cast this skill in no time.

308
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
Now Zhu Xian has three more players.

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,520
Their point is five to two now.

310
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,840
The situation of Xing Xin is getting more and more difficult.

311
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,400
It's very hard to reverse the game trend.

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
Yes, in such a bad situation,

313
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,200
even though Jun Moxiao can arrive here in time,

314
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,880
I'm not sure that he can turn it all around.

315
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Well, can we

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
congratulate Zhu Xian Team in advance?

317
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,000
No, no. The game doesn't come to the end.

318
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,960
We don't know what will happen.

319
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,440
If we follow our Captain's tactics,

320
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,520
let Wu Chen play.

321
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,120
We wouldn't be in this bad situation now.

322
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
It already happened.

323
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,440
Don't say it any more.

324
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,320
It already happened. What do you mean? What do you mean?

325
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,440
Do you mean we alredy lose the game?

326
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,960
What I mean is that

327
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,680
there is no need to go on.

328
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
Five to two.

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Yifan's HP is almost running out.

330
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,000
It will only be more shameful

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
if we continue to fight in this way.

332
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
It's Jun Moxiao!

333
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,280
It's the captain, the Master of Xing Xin!

334
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
He finally got here.

335
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,280
Master! Master!

336
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,480
I've promised

337
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
to bring him back.

338
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,920
It's so great!

339
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Finally, Xing Xin can fight back!

340
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
It's time to beat back!

341
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,240
Yifan, ahead on your left, the array of ice.

342
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,720
Control the Sharpshooter and the Swordsman.

343
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,720
Bao Zi! Use brick to knock the Cleric in the back.

344
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,280
Then find a place to hide quickly.

345
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,280
Yes, sir.

346
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,800
What shall we do?

347
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,720
Don't be freaked out.

348
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
No matter how good Ye Qiu is,

349
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,600
can he defeat six of us?

350
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
What we have to concentrate on is

351
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
to find them out soon.

352
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
We can see that Zhu Xian become very careful.

353
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Even we still have six people alive,

354
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,160
we should keep in line and don't stay too far from each other.

355
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
We only have three people left.

356
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,040
They still have six counting the substitute in.

357
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,440
Their Cleric is still alive.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,920
Normally,

359
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
we can't win anyway.

360
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,520
We could only wait a chance to surprise them.

361
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,680
Captain, what kind of surprise?

362
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Jun Moxiao appears.

363
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,840
Lead them to the cliff.

364
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,280
Where can you run to this time?

365
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Give up, Master Ye Qiu.

366
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,720
Jun Moxiao is ringed by the five members of Zhu Xian near the edge.

367
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
Is it Ye Qiu's tactic?

368
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,120
Not necessarily. Bao Zi.

369
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,520
A remarkable turnaround!

370
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
At the last moment of the match,

371
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
there is a remarkable turnaround!

372
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,640
Xing Xin uses the terrain

373
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
for a remarkable turnaround!

374
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,440
Nobody has thought of that

375
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
the cliff can be broken in that way. Beautiful!

376
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,720
Everyone falls off except Yi Cunhui!

377
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,040
If they really fall off, they will die immediately.

378
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,520
It's so surprising.

379
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,960
I can't believe this is how Xing Xin makes it!

380
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,680
They do even the odds.

381
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,000
Sure enough, Ruo Feng.

382
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,360
No one can predict the result

383
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
until the last second.

384
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,040
In such a great disadvantage,

385
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,360
Xing Xin's tactic is really a big surprise.

386
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,160
It's impossible.

387
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Someone goes directly out now.

388
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,680
But we can see that Ten Thousand Swords

389
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
saved himself by using skills.

390
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,000
Zhu Xian's two assassin also stop their falling

391
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,760
by using thier shinobigatana.

392
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
Zhu Xian's members are very tough.

393
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
We won't lose.

394
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,040
Bao Zi, the Invader! Well played!

395
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,360
He sacrifices his own life to kill the two assassins.

396
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,440
One life for two assassins. Bravo.

397
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,440
Ten Thousand Swords and Jun Moxiao

398
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
are still holding on.

399
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,280
Victory is still ours.

400
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,440
It's too early to say.

401
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
Again, Master Ye Qiu shows us

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
how strong a Freelancer is.

403
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Jun Moxiao is using

404
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Mechanical Rotor to ascend.

405
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,360
Freelancer can use too many skills make movements.

406
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,560
Don't be too proud.

407
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Even if I lose, I will kill you first.

408
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Oh, no! Ten Thousand Swords jumps up

409
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
to catch Jun Moxiao.

410
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,600
If he goes on like this,

411
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,680
Mechanical Rotor can't hold the weight of two people.

412
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,320
The stamina of the weapon will decrease quickly.

413
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,485
= Warning: The stamina of a thousand-machine umbrella is decreasing. =

414
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,200
Jun Moxiao is still holding on,

415
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,560
but the thousand-machine umbrella's stamina is decreasing too fast.

416
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,520
Does Ten Thousand Swords want to die with his opponent together?

417
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,120
He interrupts the skill Mechanical Rotor.

418
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:24,648
= Warning: A thousand-machine umbrella is broken. =

419
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:25,640
Yi Cunhui's HP is low.

420
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,280
The substitute of Zhu Xian, the Berserker

421
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,440
comes in with excellent condition just now.

422
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,800
If Jun Moxiao is out,

423
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,440
there is no chance for them to turn on a dime.

424
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,880
It seems that the match will come to an end.

425
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,680
Captain, my shoulder.

426
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,160
Yi Cunhui stands up at such a pivotal moment.

427
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,040
He chooses to die together with Ten Thousand Swords.

428
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,800
It's a brilliant rescue.

429
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,680
Jun Moxiao uses Eagle Stamp to go back to the edge of cliff.

430
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,760
Captain, we are all counting on you.

431
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,160
By this time, the replacement, Berserker, is here.

432
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
The final duel.

433
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I think everyone knows the strength of both sides.

434
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,680
I'm afraid Xing Xin will be the winner.

435
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,480
Facing the assault from master Ye Qiu,

436
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,000
Zhang Jian has no chance to fight back.

437
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,560
Master Ye Qiu will win!

438
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,320
Make the Blood Boil

439
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
Berserker rushes forward. Landslide.

440
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
At this break point,

441
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,440
the thousand-machine umbrella is worn out.

442
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
It's really a tremendous surprise!

443
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,800
The downward trend goes into reverse again.

444
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,440
A thousand-machine umbrella

445
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,560
may be the first broken silver equipment in Glory's history.

446
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,960
It's broken. How can it be broken?

447
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Well, let's congratulate Zhu Xian

448
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,760
on their winning in Team Competition.

449
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,440
The winner of this match is Zhu Xian.

450
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Although master Ye Qiu

451
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,640
recovers the disadvantage on his own.

452
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
They lose the game at last

453
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,840
because of the broken weapon.

454
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
The thousand-machine umbrella

455
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,920
is made through the efforts of the whole team.

456
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Even if it can be repaired,

457
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,160
it won't be easy.

458
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
It's going to be a long and hard process.

459
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
It's a tragedy for a Freelancer.

460
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,960
It's also a tragedy disaster for Ye Qiu and Xing Xin.

461
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm designing a weapon like this.

462
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,400
I called it a thousand-machine umbrella.

463
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,720
When I finished the design,

464
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
you can crush the game

465
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,400
and surprise all the players.

466
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
Great. I'll wait for the day

467
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
when your umbrella is formed.

468
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,913
= The weapon is broken; do you want to reclaim it? =

469
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,257
= A thousand-machine umbrella is reset to level 1 =

470
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:19,771
= Are you sure to exist the game? =

471
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,000
Challenge produces an unexpected winner.

472
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,240
Jun Moxiao cracked in the game.

473
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,280
The favorite team to win, Xing Xin, was heavily defeated.

474
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
Another favorite team to win, Jia Shi,

475
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,920
won with a commanding lead.

476
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,560
Sun Xiang fought against three.

477
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,960
He cooperated well with Xiao Shiqin.

478
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,320
They also excelled in the Team Competition.

479
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,080
In addition to the excellent performance of Su Mucheng,

480
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,320
they successfully ranked first in the standings.

481
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,120
Tao, the favorite team to win, Xing Xin,

482
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
may lose the chance to meet Jia Shi

483
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,200
in the Finals.

484
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,680
What do you think about it?

485
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
Can you say something about Xing Xin's failure?

486
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Can you say something

487
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,920
about the former hero of Jia Shi, Ye Qiu,

488
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,680
and his performance in the match with Zhu Xian?

489
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,240
Listen everyone, Xing Xin has made so many impossible things possible

490
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,480
since the Challenge started,

491
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
but everything

492
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,080
has its own end.

493
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
So does Xing Xin.

494
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,480
If we describe Xing Xin as a black horse,

495
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,600
it comes to its end now.

496
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,320
Let's eat first.

497
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,160
We don't know who will be the winner at last.

498
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,760
Where are they?

499
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,200
I've told them.

500
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,920
They said they have no appetite.

501
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,760
They have to eat something.

502
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
It's not the end of the world.

503
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,120
How can they eat nothing?

504
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
I'll go and ask them to eat something.

505
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
No. I'll go.

506
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,720
You can divide the tableware for them.

507
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,520
Bao Zi, it's time for dinner.

508
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
Okay, boss. I'm not hungry.

509
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Account card is a medal of each member.

510
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,400
But it looks like my card is mocking myself now.

511
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
Practicing tirelessly

512
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,080
is the daily life of every member.

513
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,640
But the practicing

514
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,560
becomes a way to throw criticism of us into ourselves.

515
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,400
The cruel fact that we are unqualified

516
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,240
stimulates every one of us.

517
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
This is the only consequence we got

518
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
because of our badly cooperation and shifting responsibility.

519
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,520
Aging is something we have to face.

520
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,160
It's an avoidable fate.

521
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,480
Is my insistence a kind of help or holding back?

522
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,240
All the crisis covered by our victory

523
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,320
is exposed through the failure this time.

524
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
Each one of us

525
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,160
gets into our own trouble.

526
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,920
Can we rise in rank? Can we get into the Final?

527
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,480
Can we get back to the League?

528
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,040
It's not that important now.

529
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,440
We are disappointed

530
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,680
with ourselves.

531
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,400
# Your old coat feels like an umbrella #

532
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,480
I'm always afraid of coming back to this place.

533
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,120
This place reminds me of all the stories

534
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,680
about a thousand-machine umbrella

535
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,480
about me and Muqiu.

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,120
# You'll share with me #

537
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,120
# a bowl of instant noodles #

538
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,640
# You left it to me while saying you are not hungry. #

539
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,960
# You cover your unwillingness with a smile. #

540
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,400
# But you try your best not leaving regrets for me #

541
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,200
# You looks like my, #

542
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,080
# private detective, #

543
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,920
Ye Xiu!

544
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,680
You broke it again! You should pay for it!

545
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,240
# You see through every action and expression, #

546
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,520
# you are the best in my heart #

547
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,040
# Time sometimes flies so fast when we are together #

548
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,440
Can you fight with me again?

549
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,480
This time, I'll also let you win.

550
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,960
# you are the best in my heart #

551
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,760
# You will always be my support #

552
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,200
# I will care about you forever #

553
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,200
# I think about you every moment #

554
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,120
What's wrong?

555
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,400
You! You! You!

556
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,360
Don't you want to win by going through the back door?

557
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,560
What do you want?

558
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,640
No, no, no. It's not...

559
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,080
Why are you so careless?

560
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520
It's... You are the one who broke it!

561
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,080
Now you sues your victim before me!

562
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,800
What are you talking about?

563
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,200
It's because that you want to beat me.

564
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
You! It's you. It's you.

565
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,240
You should take it!

566
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
You did it on purpose, because you want to beat me.

567
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,960
You did it on purpose.

568
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,040
You were dealing in bad faith.

569
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,560
# But you try your best not leaving regrets for me #

570
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
Did you break it?

571
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
No! How could it be me?

572
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,699
It's me. It's none of his business.

573
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,610
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

574
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,760
Alright. Pay for it. Give me the money.

575
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,040
Of course.

576
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,880
What's wrong? Are you being stolen?

577
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,960
Don't play such tricks on me.

578
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,040
Come here. Come with me.

579
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Come here.

580
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,240
# You make every idle moment #

581
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,280
# interesting again #

582
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,600
# You are my dearest #

583
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,480
I'm really surprised.

584
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,600
I saw someone who had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius

585
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,560
play video game with full of interest for the first time.

586
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,680
# You are the pride of my heart #

587
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
I'll buy medicine for him.

588
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Take good care of him.

589
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,720
Don't tough his treasure.

590
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,640
Brother.

591
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,040
The arm of that Transformer has already broken.

592
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,120
It's none of my business.

593
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,040
# Let us stay together #
