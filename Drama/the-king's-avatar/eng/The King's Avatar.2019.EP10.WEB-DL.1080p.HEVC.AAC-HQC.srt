= Episode 10 =

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Brothers of Jia Shi,

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
get ready to encircle and suppress Jun Moxiao.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,360
Don't let go of any of them.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,520
Get rid of them all.

7
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Go ahead.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh, my!

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,520
How come so many people!

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,160
Lao Ye, you've stabbed the ant nest.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Lao Ye, you rats!

12
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,960
You go back on me.

13
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
Wait, wait for me!

14
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,480
Nobody here.

15
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,840
Be honest with me, Lao Ye.

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
Have you done something bad?

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,840
Did you blow up his equipments,

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
or steal his girlfriend?

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
Let me see.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Is it because

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Lao Han knows you download Glory,

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,040
and he's incapabe of beat you,

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
so he had to do this.

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,080
No?

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,040
Shh, shh.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Give me one more time.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,120
I got it.

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,080
It must be that

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
you are brewing a great conspiracy,

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,960
and it was discovered by them,

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
so everyone was hunting you.

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,440
Right?

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Shh.

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
That tree. Follow me down there.

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
Captain, nothing.

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,480
Captain, nothing here, either.

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Let's go there.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,800
Team one go left, team two go right.

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Copy that.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Rarely to see you grow up.

41
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,640
You've learned to restrain.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
Jun Moxiao is mean and having no sense of shame.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I'm ready to PK with you,

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
then it turned out to be a fight.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,440
Text bubble.

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,120
It's here.

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
Follow me, follow me closely.

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Can you let your teammates down

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
in a more direct way?

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,280
Don't blame on me.

51
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560
You don't let me talk, I have no other way.

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,840
I have cooperated with you very well.

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,720
Don't you know who's there target?

54
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm the rubbish one, and you are the trouble maker.

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
Fine, now I have to stay away from you.

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm gonna dump you.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
They want to run away.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,520
Outflank them separately.

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Who are you?

60
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,880
How did you find this place?

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,080
Mei Guang.

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,240
I appear to have seen this account somewhere.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,600
Mei Guang.

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,480
How can you be here.

65
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Don't bother me.

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
This is the perfect blind spot I found

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
after many times of data analysis.

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,600
In theory, it will never be discovered by anyone else.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,400
Oh yeah, can you tell me that

70
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,240
how to get to the leveling area of central Kongzhi Forest?

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
First tell me

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
how you found it here.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me tell you.

74
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't be scared,

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,960
but I'm avoiding

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,600
a mysterious hunt.

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
A psycho.

78
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
Bao Zi, the Invader...

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,520
Are you the Bao Zi, the Invader of

80
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Jun Moxiao team?

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
Bingo.

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Why?

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,040
Am I so famous in 10th District now?

84
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
It's really you.

85
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Are you my fan?

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
Come here, I'll show you around.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Have a look at my equipments.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,560
Are they awesome?

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
Are they cool?

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
How about the claws?

91
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Orange weapon draw blood claws.

92
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,280
Equipment.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Purple equipment.

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
How come a purple equipment?

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,880
The attack point is three hundred.

96
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,680
Three hundred is too low.

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,080
Are you not wearing your

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,320
full set of orange suit today?

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Why do I need a full set of orange suit?

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,880
My boss and I depend on our technique,

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,240
flatten the enemy with bare hands,

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,240
It's no use equipping anything.

103
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Your boss.

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,000
Jun Moxiao.

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,960
Is your boss Jun Moxiao?

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
Ok, leave me alone.

107
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm heading to my boss.

108
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,200
Bye.

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,080
Jun Moxiao.

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Wait for me.

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
Can you do it?

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,880
One more time.

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
Such a rookie.

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,320
I'll give you a hand.

115
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on.

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
Thanks a lot.

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,120
Bao Zi, the Invader comes out.

118
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,040
Beside the dry well.

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Guys,

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,520
You are really everywhere.

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,840
Litttle brother,ready?

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Run.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,920
Are they nuts?

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why are they chasing me?

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,280
Fine.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,680
Chase if you like.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,240
Want to chase me, no way.

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,920
Little friends,

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
You didn't know where the boot button was

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,240
when Daddy started to play Glory.

131
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Didn't you check almanac before hunting?

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait.

133
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
Liu Mu is only level 27.

134
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
No need to chase on

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
a useless swordsman.

136
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,440
It's a waste of time,

137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
ignore that shit.

138
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Let's hunt Jun Moxiao.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
What? Shit?

140
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,480
Stop!

141
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Which one just said I was shit?

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
Step forward,

143
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll let you know how to spell "shit"!

144
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,120
One, two, three, four.

145
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Four piece of shit.

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
Well arranged.

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you intending?

148
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Lining up for recycling?

149
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm sorry,

150
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,200
but you are all non-recyclable!

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,800
So be a lamb,

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,720
dig a hole and bury yourself,

153
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,000
stop polluting the environment!

154
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,240
You said those word just now, right?

155
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,880
Yeah, it's me.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,720
Good.

157
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,440
It seems like you're looking for a fight.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,280
Are you the legendary

159
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:09,320
Cheap man, cheap man, cheap man.

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
Have at you, have at you, have at you!

161
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,360
At you, at you, at you.

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
What happened?

163
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
Cheap man,

164
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
let's have a talk.

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,000
Stop!

166
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Enough.

167
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
Cheap man.

168
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Are you happy to repeat my words?

169
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,120
You have to explain

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
yourself for me,

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,920
what did you call me again?

172
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,400
Come here and meet up.

173
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,720
Wait, I'm short of a sword.

174
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
Let me find a sword.

175
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,000
Cheap man finds swords, so cheap.

176
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,760
The cheap man ahead,

177
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,520
don't run away.

178
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,960
Would you like to use a weapon instead?

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Don't run away.

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
You'll be caught up with me

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,440
even if you blow up all your equipments.

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,480
Why is this man so rude?

183
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,360
But,

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
If you lend me your sword,

185
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,000
I can forgive you.

186
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
How would you like to borrow it?

187
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,240
Guess.

188
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,760
This way.

189
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,415
= You've got a weapon, Lightsaber. =

190
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,000
So lucky.

191
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,880
I can get an orange weapon by beating a random person.

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
It's different not to login Glory so long.

193
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm so lucky.

194
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
This fella,

195
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't worry too much,

196
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm just borrowing it,

197
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
I'll give it back to you soon.

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,880
Bye.

199
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,240
So happy.

200
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
They're here. Keep low.

201
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,880
They come out.

202
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,440
They come out. Attack.

203
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,560
Ok. Go.

204
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,600
Feng Liu Yan Mu disappeared,

205
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,520
Everyone stores cannons' force,

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,880
Pursue individually.

207
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Everyone keeps a close watch.

208
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,720
Get the Green guns ready.

209
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Hit her hard as soon as she appeared.

210
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,240
Copy.

211
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,160
Yifan, inflammation array cooperate with heavy artillery.

212
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,040
Ok.

213
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,320
Three, two, one.

214
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,920
Fire. Fight hard!

215
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
Senior, sorry.

216
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,840
I was slow just now.

217
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Don't worry.

218
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
See when they can hold out.

219
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,440
Feng Liu Yan Mu and Yi Cunhui

220
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,120
have no way out.

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,440
Bao Zi, the Invader is under control.

222
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,280
There's a passer-by.

223
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,440
Han Yanrou is also besieged in Kongji City.

224
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,720
She's dying.

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,400
Jun Moxiao is nothing.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,360
He's already a salted fish on the chopping board.

227
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Comrades, time to finish up.

228
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,080
Copy.

229
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,640
How are you doing, Yifan?

230
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,920
How about you, Tang?

231
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,240
Bao Zi?

232
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,640
Lao Ye, I got it, I got it!

233
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,440
See this.

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,520
A swords of orange weapon,

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,560
Look at my luck,

236
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,320
Am I good?

237
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,600
Yes, go ahead, my hero.

238
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,040
What are you talking about?

239
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,320
Don't you want to PK?

240
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
Typical wilderness PK,

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
Those who kill more people win.

242
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm stuck with you again, right?

243
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
Fine, I'll go.

244
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm not afraid.

245
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,120
Today, daddy will show you

246
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
what it's called "Three-knife flow".

247
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,960
Cut three with one knife,

248
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,520
One, two, three-knife flow.

249
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
Chop, chop, chop.

250
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,600
Why is it a little hypoxic?

251
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,240
Talk too much to be hypoxic,

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,800
What a idiot!

253
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,920
Don't laugh at me,

254
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm just out of HP.

255
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,280
Don't be too complacent,

256
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,400
I guess you're out of MP, too.

257
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,280
Are there any rookies to bully now?

258
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,560
Wait till I'm full of MP.

259
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll fight you to the end.

260
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's go and replenish it.

261
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,720
There are children

262
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,240
waiting for us to save.

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Want to trick me again?

264
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,840
Well,

265
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,240
For the sake of children,

266
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,560
I'll go with you.

267
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,640
Let's go.

268
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
Nice.

269
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,520
No doubt you're a master.

270
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
You can hold it till now.

271
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,480
It's a pity that you are still so self-righteous.

272
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,680
Do you know

273
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
many people hated you so much?

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,240
Now you've offended everyone.

275
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,960
You aren't aware that a great calamity is at hand.

276
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,000
It seems like he knows you.

277
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Little fella, if you lose to me today,

278
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,080
you have to blame yousef for making friends carelessly.

279
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,880
You've all fallen into the trap.

280
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,000
Ye Qiu, do you know

281
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
why I let you escape many times?

282
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm just wasting your HP.

283
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,040
You like to fight, come on.

284
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,680
Now you have no MP,

285
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,360
you can't release one unique skill,

286
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,640
you are now a level zero player.

287
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,440
Fine, I'll fight with you,

288
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,920
then these unimportant followers.

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,520
OK.

290
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,560
You may try it first.

291
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,280
No, no, no.

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,400
I haven't won you yet,

293
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,800
This kind of garbage is not worth fighting,

294
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
and your umbrella

295
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,320
is too precious to give away.

296
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,080
Do you want me to kill him for you?

297
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Boss, we are here.

298
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
Senior, are you all right?

299
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
Did the cannon work?

300
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,800
What are you doing?

301
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,640
Why are you standing there?

302
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
Replenish MP for boss.

303
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,600
Bao zi, how did ou come here?

304
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,000
Not in a normal way.

305
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,360
How about it, boss?

306
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,080
Am I good? Praise me.

307
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,840
Very clever.

308
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
How about you guys? Violent breakthrough?

309
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,360
No, it was a pleasant cooperation.

310
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,760
Senior, I want to try again.

311
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
Very good.

312
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,560
I told you to wait in the city.

313
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,160
I don't know how to wait.

314
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,320
I only know how to fight.

315
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,680
Your 180-degree sweep is still working well.

316
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Master,

317
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,120
20 position units at two o'clock,

318
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,040
there's a blind spot to go offline.

319
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,440
All right, everyone retreats.

320
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,080
They're escaping.

321
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
Deploy troops for defence at two o'clock.

322
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,920
Guild master,

323
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,520
two o'clock is our blind spot.

324
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
Tang, don't stick with it.

325
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,680
My lance...

326
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm gonna take it back myself.

327
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,160
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

328
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,440
Guys, do you wanna help Tang

329
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,920
take her lance back?

330
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,440
Sure thing.

331
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,360
C'mon.

332
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:22,440
Let's go.

333
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,160
Alright.

334
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,080
# We will regain our glory #

335
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,400
# Push the clouds aside and shine the light #

336
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,240
# Break the ice and cross the mountains #

337
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,800
# At this peak moment #

338
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,840
# The past overlaps the present #

339
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,840
# The glory we've missed #

340
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,640
# The pride in the future #

341
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,280
# Intertwined between the fingers #

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,040
# Composing the great song of battlefield #

343
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,080
# The only light during the long night #

344
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,040
# Is us from the ordinary #

345
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,880
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

346
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,160
# We are the brightest fireflies #

347
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,760
Disperse.

348
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,520
# I came from the past and will write the furture #

349
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,320
# The rising wave of our ten years' effort #

350
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,120
# This fight, we will it memorable #

351
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,040
# The glorious moment of coronation #

352
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,320
# The only light during the long night #

353
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,920
# Is us from the ordinary life #

354
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,840
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

355
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,640
# We are the brightest fireflies #

356
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,400
# We are the brightest fireflies #

357
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,560
You guys did a great job.

358
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:46,880
This is the end of our adventure.

359
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm exhausted.

360
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Such a gap between capacities.

361
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
Who the heck is that Jun Moxiao?

362
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,960
- Our strategy's wrong. - Yeah.

363
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:01,665
= Message: all team members are out. =

364
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,040
Chen Yehui, was that your brilliant plan?

365
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
You gathered people from all over the place,

366
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,280
and brothers from seven guilds were all under your control.

367
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
Before, you swore to god

368
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,560
that nothing would go wrong.

369
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,240
But what now?

370
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,160
How do you explain it?

371
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
Chen Yehui, how do you want to take the responsibility...

372
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,480
of the sacrifice of our brothers?

373
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
Guild leaders, please calm down.

374
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,546
It was a mistake, really.

375
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,880
I admit it.

376
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,640
My plan tonight was not thorough enough.

377
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
But I would never know that

378
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,840
Liu Mu and Mei Guang would appear so randomly.

379
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Or, he would never be able

380
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
to break the first layer of encirclement.

381
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
If he had escaped,

382
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
he would not have the chance to boost his points.

383
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,160
Damn, you're not thorough enough?

384
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
It seems to me that you have thought about everything.

385
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,600
Our players from Ambitions were dead.

386
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,240
But look at you,

387
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
you didn't lose anything important.

388
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,320
Chen Yehui,

389
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,960
you made the rest of us

390
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,680
the vanguard units in this game.

391
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,760
But Praisage only participated in the suppress at last.

392
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Were you just...

393
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,880
making use of us?

394
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,880
You're right.

395
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
I feel the same.

396
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
You must explain everything to us.

397
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,640
People from the six guilds...

398
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,600
are all here.

399
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
Just paying the hotels and flights for us

400
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,400
will not cover you scheme.

401
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,040
Right, also,

402
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,080
I already told Captain Jiexi

403
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,560
that we could win.

404
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,320
And I have to give the report of the 10th District to him tomorrow.

405
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,640
The levels of our guild elites

406
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,520
had decreased because of today's encirclement.

407
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,600
How should I explain it to Captain Jiexi?

408
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Guys, it was just a mistake.

409
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
How could I have any selfish scheme?

410
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,040
We lost a lot, too. Can't you see?

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,480
Never mind.

412
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,120
I knew Chen was not reliable.

413
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,680
Let's go.

414
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,080
We have a common goal

415
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,120
that is to defeat Jun Moxiao and his team.

416
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,680
As long as the league exists...

417
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Damned league!

418
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,480
We are the league,

419
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,040
and you are damned.

420
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,400
Ye Qiu.

421
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,725
What have you done after you joined the guild?

422
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,840
How many records of the dundegon did you break?

423
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:03,268
How much did the size of the guild grow?

424
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,320
You are just bad at management.

425
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,400
There's no use of it even if you ask

426
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,000
the whole team to play Glory with you.

427
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,360
What the hell are you thinking about,

428
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,920
asking profession team to raid for you?

429
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,720
If you lose the competition, can you be responsible for that?

430
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,920
Mr. Tao, I confess,

431
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
I am selfish sometimes.

432
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
But I swear

433
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,760
that I will never do anything to hurt Jia Shi.

434
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,120
You are indeed on the decline.

435
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,200
Only the top ones can decline,

436
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,920
The ones in low,

437
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,479
they have nowhere to go.

I'm the guest from VIP Room 214.

441
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,040
I want a pen and a pile of paper.

442
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
Don't mess up this time.

443
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
For the pen, the point width must be 0.45 millimeter.

444
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,360
The weight of the paper must be 4.39 grams.

445
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,080
Got it.

446
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,800
Please hold on.

447
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
Is this guy a paper shredder?

448
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:23,760
Why does he need so much paper?

449
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,160
Here's your pen and paper.

450
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,320
Come in, the door's unlocked.

451
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,360
I'll leave the things here.

452
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,320
It's the last one.

If you want more,

454
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,080
I'll have to go to the store.

455
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,400
We don't have these in the net cafe.

456
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,336
Jun Moxiao must lied to me.

457
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:48,856
It must be.

It matches my result perfectly.

460
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,800
My strategy can't be wrong.

461
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,680

00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,436
You know me?

465
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,360
I've read your strategies.

466
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,520
So you have a great interest in Jun Moxiao, huh?

467
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
He's my research topic.

468
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,722
Can't believe I met himself today.

469
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But to my surprise,

470
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,920
His team is totally unprofessional.

471
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,960
One is terrible with directions, another is a newbie girl.

472
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,239
The whole team...

473
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
They are equipped poorly and crazy.

474
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:41,628
What's more, I don't think

475
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:44,811
that guy is a decent man.

476
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,320
Is that so?

477
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,240
It must be.

478
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,360
Or how could so many players want to kill him?

479
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,240
Also, there was only 0.01% of HP left

480
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,400
of him.

481
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
0.01%.

482
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,430
That's not what an expert will do.

483
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,148
So...

484
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,320
why did you help that guy boost his HP?

485
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,840
He's so unreliable and has an awful character.

486
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,308
How did you know?

487
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,720
Because...

488
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,640
I am "that guy".

489
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,400
Wish you a happy life.

490
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,160
Don't use too much.

491
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Look, you are my underling

492
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,600
He's my boss.

493
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,240
What should I call...

494
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,560
my boss's boss?

495
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Superboss?

496
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,920
Does it sound weird?

497
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:04,640
Then how about the big chief?

498
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:06,680
Why does it sound so rustic?

499
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,754
I got one. I got one.

500
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,160
Chief, how about boss?

501
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:12,440
Boss is cool.

502
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,920
Do we have to turn our relations like this?

503
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Right.

504
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,480
I never say I want to be your little brother.

505
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:18,920
Don't try to run away.

506
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,120
I saved your life.

507
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:20,680
According to my level,

508
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
I would only lose 875 EXP,

509
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,560
if I lost.

510
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,520
Not a big deal.

511
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,160
I don't care.

512
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,120
In the future, you are

513
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,360
my little brother Mei Guang online,

514
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,120
And little brother Luo Ji offline.

515
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,040
Wait.

516
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:50,960
Here you are.

517
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,120

Nice to meet you, senior.

523

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
Chief, I am so hungry.

528
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,760
Can we eat now?

529
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,600
Of course.

530
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,840
It's on her.

531
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,840
Help yourselves.

532
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,480
Great.

533
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,240
Let's eat.

534
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,040
Cheers.

535
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,040
I can see the master finally.

536
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,280
What will the retired life of the master be?

537
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,120
I never thought that the first time I see the master

538
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,600
is on his retirement ceremony.

Jia Shi lost the game again last night.

548
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,754

And then? three losses in a row.

550
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
Do you know how these journalists

551
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,840
wrote about it?

552
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
You are so bully.

553
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,080

you are so nostalgic.

557
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,360
Due to the three-game losing streak,

558
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
it is necessary to

559
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,040
hold an activity like this.

560
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,280
Just like you said,

561
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
sometimes, being nostalgic

562
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,560
is not a bad thing.

563
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,720
All right. I hope,

564
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,160
you can still be so confident

565
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,080
when the fans angily question you

566
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,160
why you changed Ye Qiu.

567
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Things like fury,

568
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,480
had better be released.

569
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
It's better than repressing it in mind.

570
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,480
The era of Ye Qiu

571
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,320
has passed.

572
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,560
If someone still wants to recall him,

573
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,880
it will be the last time tonight.

574
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
I want to tell people,

575
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,560
they have to move forward.

576
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,840
So do Jia Shi.

577
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,240
Manager Tao, it is ready.

578
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,520
OK.

579
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,680
By the way, I will not let you down.

580
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:52,960
Ye Qiu, Master.

581
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:08,720
Ye Qiu, Master.

582
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,560
I am angry for real.

583
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
And we will not make it up.

584
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,120
Then l make a promise.

585
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Wherever you want to go,

586
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,960
whatever you want to eat,

587
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
I promise I will be on call at all times.

588
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,800
I want to drink mike tea.

589
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,480
No problem.

590
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,240
I will queue up and buy it for you.

591
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,520
I want to eat cakes.

592
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,480
I will make it for myself.

593
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,480
I want to eat hot pot.

594
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,160
We can have it

595
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,280
whenever you want.

596
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,560
Don't be angry.

597
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:29,960
OK?

598
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,440
Then you have to spend more time with me.

599
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
You can't always play dungeon.

600
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,800
Will you keep the promise?

601
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,640
Of course.

602
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,400
You broke it after all.

603
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,000
Ye Qiu, Master.

604
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,680
Tang Rou, here.

605
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:55,720
When it comes to eating meat,

606
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,760
I prefer doing it myself.

607
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Resist all the attacks from you foodies,

608
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,560
on my own.

609
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,880
Tang Rou, you are so gorgeous

610
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,440
in Kongzhi Forest today,

611
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,760
when you resisted so many people on your own.

612
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,800
Thank you.

613
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,760
Eat the meat, senior.

614
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,600
Eating meat,

615
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,360
relies on seizing.

616
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,600
As for courage,

617
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,680
it relies on your heart.

618
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,000
It's better to find out the shortcut keys,

619
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:23,880
rather than envying others.

620
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:28,920
The meat has been cooked now.

621
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,720
Time for full output.

622
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,800
Output. Output.

623
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,200
I still don't understand

624
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:40,520
how could you create

625
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,348
the highest record in the Place of Bones

626
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,360
without orange weapons.

627
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,440
It is the most extreme strategy

628
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
that I could calculate.

629
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,280
There will be no other ways.

630
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,200
Little brother, don't nag.

631
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,320
Here, have some meat.

632
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,840
The last meatball that was put in three minutes ago.

633
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,400
According to Archimedes theory,

634
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,520
the meatball will float,

635
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
when the buoyancy is greater than the gravity.

636
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Then it shows it's OK.

637
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,720
When we were snatching

638
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,680
the meat just now,

639
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
The pot rotated

640
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
273 degrees clockwise.

641
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,800
Therefore,

642
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,120
one second later,

643
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,800
the meatball will float on three o'clock.

644
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,000
Sometimes, math is really...

645
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,280
Delicious.

646
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,280
Correct anticipation and exquisite timing.

647
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:09,794
See,

648
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:12,000
this is someone with the big picture and anticipation.

649
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:12,531
See,

650
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,160
this is someone having the theory but no capacity to practice it.

651
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,680
See, this is the master who doesn't eat the meatball.

652
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
See, there is still kindness in the world.

653
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,720
share the meat with me. True friends.

654
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,000
By the way, senior,

655
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,520
I finished the TV series

656
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,440
that you asked me to watch.

657
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,760
You should recommend TV series.

658
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:37,765
Which one?

659
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:42,400
"Evasion is useful, but shameful".

660
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,400
It's called

661
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,720
"Evasion is shameful, but useful".

662
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,360
Senior, is it shameful?

663
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,000
Or useful?

664
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:57,737
Yes.

665
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:01,440
You guys have a tacit mutual understanding.

666
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,360
Next time, please go on.

667
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:07,840
Cheers

668
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,520
Cheers.

669
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,120
Eat that one.

670
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,360
The mushroom is also OK.

671
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:16,857
This one is good.

672
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:17,491
So is this.

673
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,108
Hello, Ye?

674
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:19,800
The sword I borrowed

675
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
has given it to you.

676
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,645
Remember to give it back.

677
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,680
As Blade Master, I always keep my words.

678
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,280
You can't ruin my reputation.

679
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,520
Where are you now?

680
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,720
Why is so noisy?

681
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:29,520
Show up online now.

682
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's have a battle. Battle. Battle.

683
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:33,120
I'm eating hot pot.

684
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,440
Hot pot?

685
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,320
You are so ungrateful.

686
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,480
Leave your hero and go to eat the hot pot.

687
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,440
Who do you eat with?

688
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,480
Where do you eat?

689
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:42,440
Why don't you invite me?

690
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:44,034
Invite you? Can you come here?

691
00:38:44,251 --> 00:38:45,520
If you can reimburse me for travel expenses,

692
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
I will go.

693
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:49,160
I finally know

694
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,680
what you are planning for.

695
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,840
No wonder that the captain said

696
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
you will come back sooner or later.

697
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,960
Have you already planned to

698
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,320
form a team with the people around,

699
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
so that you can come back to the league

700
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,360
with a new team.

701
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,280
Tell me honestly.

702
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,840
Haven't it?

703
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,720
Hello?

704
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,400
Hello? Hello? Hello?

705
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,760
# you, as always, #

706
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
Su Mucheng,

707
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
The tender girl

708
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,880
who need protection.

709
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
After I left Jia Shi,

710
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,920
She hold fast to her position in the Glory

711
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,160
on her own.

712
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:29,977
Tang Rou,

713
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,400
who has been a winner since she was born,

714
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,240
But doesn't dare to face the failure.

715
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
Coming across the Glory,

716
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,600
She learns to accept the setbacks

717
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,760
And embrace the imperfect self.

718
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,760
Bao Zi,

719
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,040
An ordinary person.

720
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:50,800
Glory is not used

721
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,920
for wasting his time.

722
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,640
Because in Glory,

723
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,760
He finds a new starting point in his life.

724
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,240
Qiao Yifan,

725
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
A bench warmer who never played.

726
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
But still sticks to his belief of being a professional player.

727
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,000
He changed his role with no hesitation.

728
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,240
Due to the passion for Glory, he dares to deny his past,

729
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,400
and meet the challenge.

730
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,320
Luo Ji,

731
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,440
having endless formulas in his life.

732
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,360
Due to Glory, he met us.

733
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,120
Then he feels another warmth

734
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,720
apart from numbers.

735
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,320
Come. Cheers.

736
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,640
Cheers.

737
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,800
Shall I form

738
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,080
a new team?
