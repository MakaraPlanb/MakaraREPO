00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:32,587
= Episode 30 =

3
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,963
The last hit.

4
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:53,621
Ye Qiu's continuous attacking has eliminated Flames.

5
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,843
The winner is Ye Qiu.

6
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,700
This is a historical moment.

7
00:01:57,724 --> 00:02:00,173
Master Ye has returned to Glory as a Freelancer.

8
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,840
Both the Umbrella and Freelancer have opened a new era of Glory.

9
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:07,490
This is the real Master Ye and the King's Avatar.

10
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,537
Congratulations. Ye and Xing Xin has scored one.

11
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:22,175
On September 5,

12
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,238
Guang...

13
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,039
won the game.

14
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,714
After the Individual Game,

15
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,507
Xing Xin only lags behind Miracle by 1:2 now.

16
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,951
Come on. we've won. Why are you sitting here?

17
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,362
Although there is only you and me,

18
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,615
we can cover the people of all ages.

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,378
Come on. Let's cheer and let the Master hear it.

20
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,004
Don't think you're too old to be passionate?

21
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:55,471
Glory is your time machine that will send you back to the past.

22
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,144
Just a game. Don't be so excited.

23
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:02,502
But it's the game that can bridge our age gap,

24
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,192
awaken our heroic dream in the boring life,

25
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,564
and let a boy as him become a public idol.

26
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,430
-  A public idol? - Yes.

27
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,334
He has been telling us:

28
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,444
there is nothing impossible in life.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,102
Even if you were expelled, retired, challenged,

30
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:22,315
or you lost Leaf of Autumn.

31
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,044
He's still standing on the stage.

32
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:28,678
Are you ready?

33
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,654
I'll bring you something.

34
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,604
Here you are.

35
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,628
= Master, I love you. =

36
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:42,350
Master. Master...

37
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:44,961
Captain, you're so amazing in the game.

38
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,919
That guy was no match for you at all.

39
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:51,047
Did the atmosphere of game make you play better?

40
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:52,379
No.

41
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:56,299
Or did you want to strengthen our weak fan base.

42
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,371
No.

43
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:02,783
Don't look at me. Ask him.

44
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,227
Captain,

45
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,044
we just want to know why you took off your mask suddenly.

46
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,147
Do you know how hot inside the room?

47
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,931
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Arena Contest.

48
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:27,939
The first game is Miracle's Li Xiang vs Xing Xin's Wei Chen.

49
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,502
Let me introduce the players from both teams.

50
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,867
Mr. Wei Chen, please.

51
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,310
The continuous attacking was awesome indeed,

52
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,382
but you can't win all the honors along.

53
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,317
In the Arena Contest,

54
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:44,675
I'm sure I'll defeat two opponents, maybe three.

55
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,046
I believe you can break the record.

56
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,538
What record do you mean,

57
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,537
the shortest winning time or the highest damage?

58
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,275
The oldest comeback player.

59
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,505
Put on your mask.

60
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,068
- Now, we'll... - Defeat them!

61
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,925
... Mr. Li Xiang from Miracle.

62
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,328
Wei Chen is an experienced player. Be careful.

63
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,059
Never talk to him.

64
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,081
Just fight silently.

65
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,001
You're no match for him at swearing.

66
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:17,850
Defeat him with a hand-to-hand fight, got it?

67
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:19,117
Got it.

68
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,872
We're both warlocks. How could I hand-to-hand fight him?

69
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,896
The first Contest between Xing Xin and Miracle:

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,007
Windward Formation of Xing Xin vs Memory in Eyes of Miracle.

71
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,372
A fight between warlocks is about to begin.

72
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,561
The game begins.

73
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:34,862
In the fight between warlocks,

74
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:37,680
predicting and controlling the distance are the key elements.

75
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,846
As the class of Long-range attack and various control abilities,

76
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,497
the one who hit the other first will have a greater advantage.

77
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:48,797
What the hell is it?

78
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,821
Is he really the founder of Containment?

79
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,145
Why is he standing at the center of Arena?

80
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,391
Kid, are you coming?

81
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:01,175
Why are young guys now so lazy and moving so slowly?

82
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:03,944
If you are not coming, I'll come to you.

83
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:08,284
As the earliest Master of Glory and player of Swoksaar

84
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,561
Wei's understanding on warlocks must have been very profound.

85
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,354
Now Windward is moving to Memory.

86
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,322
He's coming to Memory's attack range.

87
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:17,782
Suddenly, he stops.

88
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,488
The veteran is indeed experienced,

89
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,329
He knows accurately the casting range of his opponent.

90
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:27,551
Windward starts backing to distance himself from his opponent.

91
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,343
It makes Miracle's warlock a little confused.

92
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,120
What the hell is it now?

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,072
Memory in Eyes is moving forward.

94
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:37,603
Here you are.

95
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:45,666
Impossible.

96
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,309
Warlocks' attack ranges are all same.

97
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,833
- You're not inside my range. - Memory is hit.

98
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:49,983
How could you hit me?

99
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,062
Kids these days are so simple.

100
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:56,388
If I have no trump card, how can I fight you hand to hand?

101
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,601
Yes, I'm not inside your range, but you're inside mine.

102
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:09,390
Magic bomb. Memory is down without any chance to fight back.

103
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,048
OK, let's see the Data Analysis of the game.

104
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:15,517
I think the range of the weapon, Wand of Death,

105
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,834
was increased during its forging process.

106
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,277
From the picture,

107
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:24,912
We can see Windward's range is two grids farther than Memory's.

108
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:30,348
How could I be the founder of Containment without a best weapon?

109
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,482
I'm not retired yet.

110
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,692
Windward's Gate of Death.

111
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:43,445
He would be erased if he's hit by it.

112
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,310
Memory's hit. He is being dragged slowly into the Gate of Death.

113
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,560
Gate of Death has exploded and he's been erased.

114
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,466
Congratulations to Windward Formation on his win...

115
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,299
Well done.

116
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,553
He scored one for Xing Xin and lost only 30% HP.

117
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:02,442
Now the Arena defender is Wei Chen,

118
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:06,711
who will be challenged by Deng Yinan of Miracle.

119
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,782
Everyone, Mr. Deng Yinan.

120
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,836
The second Arena Game: Deng Yinan vs Wei Chen...

121
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,868
Kid, Miracle's performance is terrible.

122
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,193
If everyone in Miracle is like the boy I erased,

123
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,756
then don't waste my time and get out of here.

124
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,613
Let's start to fight, sir.

125
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,525
Both characters have entered the Arena. The game begins.

126
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,422
Though being good at hand-to-hand fight,

127
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,914
a Swordsman's speeds of attacking and moving is outstanding.

128
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:32,174
So, to fight a long-range attacking warlock,

129
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,508
he may not be in a bad position.

130
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,809
Besides, he can do much damage with a heavy strike.

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,784
If the opportunity is right, it's very likely to erase...

132
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,720
Kid, I give you three minutes.

133
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:44,466
If you can find me within the time, I'll fight against you.

134
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,251
Sir, aren't you standing at the center of Arena this time?

135
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,203
It's ridiculous. I'm the founder of Containment.

136
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,782
I said I would hide myself this time.

137
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:57,139
Keeping promise is my motto.

138
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,439
It looks like he's waiting for Windy Nightside to move forward,

139
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:02,066
then give him a surprise attack.

140
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,499
However, Nightside seems to see through Windward's intention.

141
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,593
Instead of moving to his adversary's hiding area.

142
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,030
he's sneaking to his back.

143
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:17,999
He's close to him.

144
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,213
Nightside is watching the terrain to judge Windward's position.

145
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,703
Why don't you come yet? Want to give me a sneak attack?

146
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,296
You'll never have a chance to do that.

147
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,049
Fire!

148
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:47,509
Windward is shooting magic missile, then Arrow of Curse.

149
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,009
But the Swordsman has dodged them and is approaching him.

150
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,922
Damn it, he's approaching.

151
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,263
Poor Wei.

152
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,156
Windward has been chopped down.

153
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,751
Windy Nightside's attack is very lethal,

154
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,116
With his remaining little HP, the warlock is killed immediately.

155
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:13,083
With his 70% HP, Windward has reduced Nightside's HP to 50%.

156
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:16,074
Even so, Xing Xin has still one more challengers than its rival.

157
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:19,583
Miracle has scored one. The scores are now tied at 1:1.

158
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:20,597
Though...

159
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,082
You said you'd defeat two opponents.

160
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,160
You said you were sure to win.

161
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:27,525
And you said keeping promise was your motto.

162
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,241
You don't get it.

163
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:35,022
I've just given Luo Ji a chance to show himself.

164
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:38,379
Now...

165
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,689
The opponent has only half HP.

166
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,498
Decrease his HP and defeat him.

167
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,950
... Luo Ji of Xing Xin is gonna challenge him.

168
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:46,815
Everybody, Mr. Luo Ji.

169
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,426
In the third game,

170
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,719
Summoner Mei Guang will fight Swordsman Windy Nightside.

171
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,489
Luo Ji, the second player of Xing Xin,

172
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,838
has never emerged in the games of Glory.

173
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,186
So we haven't any records about him.

174
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,908
Will he become an outstanding newcomer?

175
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,074
Let's wait and see.

176
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,922
Though he defeated Windward, Nightside has only 50% HP left.

177
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:11,025
With full HP, Mei Guang has a bigger chance to win.

178
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:14,491
After practicing with me for a long time?

179
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,285
has Luo made any progress?

180
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,952
Take it easy. That guy has only half HP.

181
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,403
He's sure to beat him.

182
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,117
The game begins.

183
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,323
Ice Wolf. Mei Guang is summoning Four Beasts.

184
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,593
But Nightside is close to him now,

185
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,664
so maybe the summoning will be interrupted.

186
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,600
As expected, dodging the Wolf, Nightside is rushing to Luo.

187
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:38,242
It's dangerous if a Summoner is approached by a Swordsman.

188
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,404
Too close.

189
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,648
Nightside has chopped down his opponent without losing any HP.

190
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:51,203
So the defender is still Mr. Deng Yinan of Miracle.

191
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:54,012
The challenger from Xing Xin is Miss Tang Rou.

192
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,964
Everybody, Miss Tang Rou.

193
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,448
The fourth game:

194
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,464
Han Yanrou, a Battlemage, vs Windy Nightside, a Swordman.

195
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:04,170
Nightside has already defeated two adversaries...

196
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,852
Are you here to let me chop you off?

197
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,946
- I'm afraid you can't chop again. - Let me try it.

198
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,185
As the last player of Xing Xin,

199
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,177
Tang has to defeat two adversaries to win the Arena Contest.

200
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:18,183
Tang is launching a fierce attack. Nightside is fighting back.

201
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,968
Keeping launching attack for a while,

202
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,199
Nightside's HP has been reduced to 30%.

203
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,088
But Tang's own HP is decreasing quickly.

204
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:42,683
Flying Sword.

205
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,175
Without dodging, Tang is shooting back with icy Chaser.

206
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:48,634
When Nightside becomes stiff, Tang erases him immediately.

207
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:50,499
Tang Rou has won. Congratulations.

208
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,332
She's scored one for Xing Xin.

209
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,688
Though she has won,

210
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:56,743
her HP is very low.

211
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:58,989
It's difficult for her.

212
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:00,862
This is Tang Rou's style.

213
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:04,345
Without bravery, she might not know how to fight.

214
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,622
If she can fight like this,

215
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,145
it's likely she'll win.

216
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:13,145
- Thank you for your sacrifice. - Don't mock me.

217
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,851
Look at your HP.

218
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:18,104
You haven't won yet. We've got one more challenger.

219
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,596
You can't beat my vice-captain with such low HP.

220
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,182
Tang, take it easy.

221
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,681
Just fight without worry.

222
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:29,577
Sure, I can beat one and half.

223
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,156
I'll erase the first one with the least HP,

224
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:34,497
then deal with the second at full stretch.

225
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,388
Now the defender is Xing Xin,
= The 9th Challenge of Glory =

226
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:47,189
and the challenger from Miracle is Wang Xing.
= The 9th Challenge of Glory =

227
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,776
Mr. Wang Xing.

228
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,260
Come on, buddy.

229
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,466
The last contest:

230
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,885
Han Yanrou, a Battlemage, vs Street Fighter.

231
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,298
The game begins.

232
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,774
Though she won the previous game, Tang lost many HP.

233
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,647
The game will be very difficult for her.

234
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,131
Now Street Fighter is looking for Tang's location.

235
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,552
Hiding at the high point and watching Fighter's movement,

236
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,821
Tang doesn't hurry to attack.

237
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,122
Tang is attacking with Dragon's Pressure

238
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,964
Fighter dodges it and tosses Gas Bottle. It hits Tang.

239
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,416
Fighter is approaching and attacking Tang who is defending.

240
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,208
Miss Tang is not strong as in the previous game.

241
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,382
She chooses to defend.

242
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:35,159
But, with lower HP, she wouldn't win the game only with defense.

243
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,185
What's the matter with Tang?

244
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,708
With lower HP, Tang chooses to fight conservatively.

245
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,335
Is it a wise decision?

246
00:14:57,922 --> 00:14:58,842
In this way,

247
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,619
she'll lose.

248
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:02,405
Why?

249
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:05,571
She would lose faster if she chooses to attack.

250
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:08,420
She's avoiding the fight. Is this the Tang you have known?

251
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,499
She's hit by Sand Ball again.

252
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,237
Tang is blind. It's dangerous now.

253
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:16,648
Fighter is approaching and punching.

254
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,497
Tang can't dodge and her HP becomes zero.

255
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,987
Street Fighter has won the game. Congratulations.

256
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,696
Either attacking recklessly,

257
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,720
or dodging inexperiencedly,

258
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,624
so your price is to be completely crushed.

259
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,060
Keep practicing.

260
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,988
Miss Tang hasn't defeated two adversaries,

261
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,654
so Miracle has won the Arena Game and scored three points.

262
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,328
Miracle is now ahead with the score of 5:1

263
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:41,074
Xing Xin is in trouble.

264
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,820
They have to do excellently in the Team Game,

265
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,931
if they want to turn the tide.

266
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:47,216
Alright,

267
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:51,105
Let's give it up for the winner, Mr. Wang Xing from Miracle.

268
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,755
After Miss Tang lost the game,

269
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,755
Xing Xin has lagged behind Miracle by a big gap of 1:5.

270
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:59,683
Xing Xin has to come up with solutions during the interval,

271
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,413
because they are now in a very dangerous situation.

272
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:21,820
What did you think about it?

273
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,630
I haven't drunk it yet.

274
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,367
I mean the game.

275
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,192
It's your first competition.

276
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,168
I'll win it back.

277
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:38,986
How?

278
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,099
Another question.

279
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:49,177
Why did you lose the game?

280
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:52,819
My weakness is too obvious

281
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:54,937
What is it?

282
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:59,143
I lost too many HP in my first game,

283
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,659
so I've got no advantage in the second.

284
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,984
Besides, I'm inexperienced.

285
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,134
I can't counter-attack in defense.

286
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:08,902
So my weakness is...

287
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,927
I'm not powerful enough.

288
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,212
You're not.

289
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,425
But that's not the reason.

290
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:18,766
You lost to him...

291
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,487
because you changed your fighting tactic.

292
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,519
But my HP was lower.

293
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:27,002
If I didn't change my tactic...

294
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,922
No tactic is perfect.

295
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,303
The key to winning...

296
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,588
is not what tactic you choose,

297
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,779
but to find one that suits you.

298
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:44,032
Having too many choices is not as good as having no choice.

299
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,024
Anytime,

300
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,507
You shouldn't easily doubt yourself.

301
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,534
I think sometimes we need to doubt ourselves...

302
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,644
at least on such trifles.

303
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,364
I think Ye Qiu is messing up this time.

304
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:45,538
It has turned out the mockery they were subjected to is accurate.

305
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:49,189
They are very weak and vulnerable.

306
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:49,911
Captain,

307
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,943
you're the only one who lost to them badly.

308
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:53,967
Nonsense.

309
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,045
I was just proving with my failure...

310
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:58,957
that we can't underestimate Xing Xin too much...

311
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,298
even if it's a weak team.

312
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,266
Got it?

313
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,694
The Team Game will be more difficult for us.

314
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,646
Miracle is good at the tactic "One Defended by Four".

315
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:10,328
Its achievements over the years depend on its perfect defense.

316
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,423
Sir, What is the "One Defended by Four"?

317
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:17,002
All players are fighting to protect their core member.

318
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,437
Then what shall we do?

319
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,493
Kill their captain at all costs.

320
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,714
I agree with it.

321
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,864
But it would be hard to do without a Cleric.

322
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:28,753
We must fight steadily in Team Game.

323
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,212
No Cleric.

324
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:32,600
What...

325
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,063
Ye, this is not the fight in Dungeon.

326
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,229
Our endurance will be affected without a Cleric.

327
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:41,372
They're all experienced players.

328
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,768
It's difficult to beat them.

329
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm not propagating for the opponent,

330
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:47,648
but in terms of team strength,

331
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:49,686
we still lag far behind Miracle.

332
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,344
A protracted fight would make our disadvantage more obvious.

333
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:56,082
Their perfect defensive system is at the Alliance level.

334
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,248
A common tactic can't break it.

335
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,513
We have to use an all-or-nothing tactic.

336
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,457
I count on Mo Fan's surprise attack to tear a breach for us.

337
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:11,218
OK. Let's take the risk under your leadership.

338
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,750
Now it's your turn.

339
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:20,743
Because of Ye Qiu,

340
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,616
the game Xing Xin vs Miracle has attracted much interest.

341
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,409
Ye's first appearance has also aroused heated comments.

342
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,265
But in the Individual Game, Xing Xin lagged much behind.

343
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,202
So it would be very hard to fight in the Team Game.

344
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,472
Now, the Team Game is kicking off.

345
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:39,678
The players of both teams are going to the game room.

346
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:46,118
Where's Mo Fan?

347
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,562
He's very obedient.

348
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:54,402
Damn it.

349
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,688
Let's see the lineups of both sides.

350
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,735
Miracle's lineup is same as usual.

351
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,148
But there's no Cleric in Xing Xin.

352
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,417
This is really a desperate lineup.

353
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:06,193
And all the ten players in the room are all output-oriented,

354
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:09,337
except Xing Xin's substitute is Warlock Windward Formation,

355
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:12,201
and Miracle's substitute is Cleric Sincerity.

356
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:15,288
Now the characters of both sides are entering the map.

357
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,351
The Team Game between Xing Xin and Miracle is beginning.

358
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,232
In the Individual and Arena games,

359
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,327
Miracle was more excellent.

360
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,581
But in the Team Game,

361
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,517
because both teams have no Cleric on the field,

362
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,509
the team that cooperates better will take control of the game.

363
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,405
Back off. Don't let them get close.

364
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,063
The longer the fight lasts, the better for us.

365
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,975
Both sides are exchanging fire fiercely at the beginning.

366
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:41,784
Xing Xin is obviously at a disadvantage in attacking range.

367
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:45,022
Because Xing Xin has no Cleric, they can't fight like this.

368
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:48,973
Miracle plays well at the beginning...

369
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,219
What is that?

370
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,519
This is teamwork. It's very good.

371
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:55,693
... the situation will be good for Miracle, if Xing Xin can't...

372
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,408
Good. Control our HP.

373
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,740
It's very easy to beat them.

374
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,930
Yes, if the front attack fails...

375
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,049
They're dispersing.

376
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,073
Then, it's your funeral.

377
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:06,160
They've got hooked.

378
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,500
Find your target. Destroy them one by one.

379
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,944
Qiao Yifan is targeting at the Knight

380
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,539
Is this Xing Xin 's man-to-man tactics?

381
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:15,777
Now it seems to be an individual game.

382
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,689
Tang Rou is targeting at the Ranger.

383
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:23,076
I'm looking for their Elemental Mage.

384
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,526
- Got him. - Damn it.

385
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,749
Xing Xin's fighting formation is widely stretched now.

386
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,312
Do they want to beat Miracle by individual strength?

387
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:31,993
But according to the previous games,

388
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,788
it's hard for them to gain an advantage in one-on-one fight,

389
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,335
especially Bao Zi', his movement is clumsy.

390
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,904
Qiao is at a disadvantage now.

391
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:51,365
The HPs of both sides are nearly same.

392
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:52,936
It's not good for Xing Xin.

393
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,982
Dragging on like this, once Miracle's Cleric comes on,

394
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,872
it's unlikely for Xing Xin to turn the tables.

395
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,439
Tang's counterattack was very impressive.

396
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,822
Bao Zi seems to have not found a way to beat the mage yet.

397
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:29,274
He's very tired.

398
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:34,114
Jun Moxiao is fighting Miracle's Warlock and Sharpshooter.

399
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:37,431
Though it's two-to-one, Miracle is not at an advantage.

400
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:38,883
The Master is indeed outstanding.

401
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:42,073
He's reducing effortlessly his two adversaries' HP.

402
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:43,826
Making a comeback,

403
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,500
you should have joined Miracle directly.

404
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,166
Really?

405
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,174
But I want Xing Xin to win.

406
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,392
All your teammates are useless,

407
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,599
In Xing Xin, I think only you deserve to fight against me.

408
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:57,551
Thank you.

409
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,908
But you don't deserve.

410
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:10,907
= Raging Flames =

411
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,136
Look! See? = Master, I love you.
= Master, I love you. =

412
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:17,279
Wait, who has seen their Ninja?

413
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,374
No.

414
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:19,636
Damn it!

415
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,389
Now!

416
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:44,123
Xing Xin has first killed an adversary,

417
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,773
so Miracle's substitute is coming on.

418
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:49,867
Fighting individually,

419
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,866
the other three Xing Xin players are moving closer.

420
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,430
Qiao, Tang and Bao Zi protect each other.

421
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,152
This is teamwork.

422
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:10,632
Good job.

423
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,560
- Qiao has successfully erased the Mage. - Awesome.

424
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,067
Look at Master's fight.

425
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:31,560
Fighting in rotation, Xing Xin players keep attacking.

426
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,442
Miracle players is completely overwhelmed.

427
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:49,129
Dragon's Pressure. Miracle's Knight has also been erased.

428
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:06,044
This is a wonderful team game.

429
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:09,155
- Xing Xin is telling us what teamwork is. - Awesome.

430
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,743
Awesome.

431
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,393
The ultimate winner is Xing Xin which has done marvels.

432
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,575
Scoring only one point in Individual and Arena games,

433
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,606
and in Miracle's home field, they're underestimated...

434
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,209
- Very good. - I said you're awesome.

435
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,134
Xing Xin has won the first Challenge by 6:5. Congratulations.

436
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,102
Come on, cheer!

437
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,482
Master, I love you.

438
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:44,966
Your performance today is very close to mine.

439
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:46,639
You're awesome.

440
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,131
A Ninjas doesn't need a hug,

441
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:52,082
except today.

442
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:57,193
Don't put on airs and make me embarrassed again.

443
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:00,018
Brat, never put on airs again.

444
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,470
Where's captain Ye?

445
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,559
Master.

446
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:14,130
Master, you're so wonderful and too awesome today.

447
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:16,248
- Listen... - Do you know, Master?

448
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:18,732
you also gave me an unprecedented power,

449
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:21,463
with which I beat their huge cheering team by myself.

450
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:25,647
No, by myself and him.

451
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,790
I've got an old fan today.

452
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,083
Though he is too old to jump and cheer,

453
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,424
he adores you very much.

454
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:34,598
Where's he?

455
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,113
he's gone away.

456
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:42,160
= Master, I love you. =

457
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:12,546
# You covered your unwillingness with a smile. #

458
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:18,318
Master. Master...

459
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:19,539
Master.

460
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,165
he wanted me to give it to you.

461
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:32,903
# You are like my exclusive detective, #

462
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:41,324
# who understands my every move and expression. #

463
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:49,678
# You are the best in my heart. #

464
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,764
This is the key to our house.

465
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,827
Come home anytime if you want.

466
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:00,554
Bye.

467
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:07,197
# You, my dearest one in my heart, #

468
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,180
# are the person who always supports me,#

469
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:17,338
# whom I care about forever,#

470
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:22,726
# and whom I miss every moment. #

471
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,464
In the just-concluded first Challenge of Glory,

472
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,313
Xing Xin has turned the tables to beat Miracle...
= News on Glory =

473
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:30,622
and won their first victory.
= News on Glory =

474
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,931
However, the fans are paying more attention to Ye Qiu,

475
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:35,637
known as the Master of Glory and the former captain of Jia Shi.

476
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:38,977
They're asking why he's joined an insignificant team.

477
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,771
When Ye left Jia Shi, he was criticized by its fans.

478
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:45,652
Now, leading a new team on the journey of Glory,

479
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,136
He has attracted more heated comments from fans.

480
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:52,603
= Traitor, get out of the game room! =

481
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:53,911
= Never let the traitor speak here. =

482
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:55,784
= I'll never watch his game. =

483
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:57,403
= He's a big traitor. =

484
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:03,242
Winning the first game,

485
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,789
we'll be on the front pages of newspapers.

486
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,781
The number of our fans will increase romantically.

487
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:11,813
Dude, "increase dramatically".

488
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,510
Whatever.

489
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:16,446
It's our captain's first public appearance today.

490
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,605
We won't have to take the bus in the future,

491
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:21,335
we'll have our own shuttle.

492
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:24,652
Yes, but you have to pay,  12 yuan per kilometer.

493
00:30:24,676 --> 00:30:28,064
Finally, maybe charge you additional 1 yuan for gas.

494
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,532
Why do you think we won't have a lot of fans?

495
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:33,134
Because of...

496
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:34,951
this.

497
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:58,075
= Ye Qiu, the traitor. =

498
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,264
= Team Xing Xin =

499
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,057
3 seconds before the fifth attack coming.

500
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,668
Luo Ji, lock the source of attack. Others strike.

501
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,769
New messages per second is exceeding 15.

502
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,872
Tieba will be crashed if messages keep increasing.

503
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:27,149
Contain it by correcting opinion direction.

504
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:30,941
Everyone of us must proudly speak for Ye Qiu.

505
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,075
Damn! Hacker.

506
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:34,201
Asshole.

507
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:38,128
Someday I'm going to find you and kick your ass.

508
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:39,675
Whose ass will you kick?

509
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:42,499
Kick the ass of...

510
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,357
every team in Challenge.

511
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:48,872
Today's training course is...

512
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,162
relaxing.

513
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:01,654
Not bad?

514
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:07,796
Captain.

515
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:15,050
Are you using football to let us know something philosophical?

516
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:17,900
I see.

517
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,613
Precision...

518
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:25,026
Our captain wants us to focus on the Challenge Game.

519
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,065
And calmness...

520
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:30,557
means never be confused by online comments.

521
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:33,866
Then, concentration...

522
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,318
It means we have to concentrate on our training,

523
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,524
and can't be distracted.

524
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,508
It's boring here.

525
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,341
Let's go back to training, OK?

526
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,102
Captain.

527
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:54,013
We have already understood your good intention, right?

528
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:02,164
The cake vouchers given by Ye Qiu will expire tomorrow.

529
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,060
They are free. Don't waste them. Take whatever you want.

530
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:07,416
I want another one.

531
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:10,154
However,

532
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,654
who will pay the fare when we go back?

533
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:21,762
Never mind. I want to stay here.

534
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:24,665
Swearing everywhere on internet,

535
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,722
Jia Shi's fans seem crazy these days.

536
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,911
What were you talking about? Say it again.

537
00:33:31,935 --> 00:33:32,784
Stop it!

538
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,736
OK, everybody,

539
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,386
I'll show you something,

540
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:40,131
These guys are from Xing Xin.

541
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:42,179
Look at these ugly faces.

542
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,472
What? Don't touch me!

543
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:45,964
Come on, talk, talk to the camera.

544
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,694
- Excuse me, stop shooting. - Leave me alone.

545
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,104
You're the vice-captain.

546
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,057
Don't let your guys bully us here.

547
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,927
Come on, talk to the camera what you just said.

548
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:02,045
- Dude... - Come on, cut the crap

549
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,449
You just said...

550
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,608
Jia Shi's fans seem crazy.

551
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:14,219
Our captain we used to support is fighting for another team now.

552
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:16,536
He's fighting desperately against his former team.

553
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:19,607
Do you understand how Jia Shi's fans are feeling?

554
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,829
No.

555
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:30,907
You don't care about Jia Shi's fans, do you?

556
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,914
My game is not played for fans.

557
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:39,263
Then for whom?

558
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:41,238
Frankly,

559
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,666
we are just fighting for...

560
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:46,190
our personal ideals.

561
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:49,522
Nobody would fight for pleasing others.

562
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,292
So, don't get it wrong.

563
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:55,927
We're moved by, and appreciate your support and encouragement.

564
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,584
But...

565
00:34:58,378 --> 00:34:59,814
I have to tell you,

566
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:03,433
it's not true that we're playing for fans.

567
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:05,933
At least...

568
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,241
I'm not.

569
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,065
But, without our support,

570
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,762
there would be no pro games, and of course no pro players either,

571
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:18,786
You're right.

572
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:21,714
That's why I appreciate it.

573
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:23,642
I'm also moved by your support,

574
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,015
sincerely.

575
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:27,950
But my game...

576
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:31,238
is not played for fans.
