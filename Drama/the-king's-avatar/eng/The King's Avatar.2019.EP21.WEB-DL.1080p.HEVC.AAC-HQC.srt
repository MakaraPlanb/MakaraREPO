00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:27,550
= The King's Avatar =

2
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:32,320
= Episode 21 =

3
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,480
Thanks.

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,240
No problem.

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,600
Give me that.

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,040
OK.

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
No alcohol during the match,

8
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
this is the rule.

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,840
But since we started,

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
then enjoy ourselves.

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,720
One more shot.

12
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Same as him.

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,880
With spherical ice.

14
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,560
Here.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,040
Dilute with ice?

16
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,480
Too low.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,840
Ice cubes suppress light taste elements in wine,

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
which prominent the strong elements

19
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
of heavy taste more.

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
One plus one

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
is more than two somtimes.

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
I am the only one.

23
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't need to add up with anyone.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Sure.

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
Add up with talented players like you

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,400
is accomplishing others.

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Unfair.

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
You're so prominent,

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
so everyone thinks that

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,880
you should win.

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
If you lose, it's a shame.

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
They'll say you're a unprofessional captain.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
But we all know that

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,160
it was the Team Jia Shi that had problems.

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
I don't care.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,360
If really so,

37
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
why are you sitting here

38
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
instead of Tactical Room.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't think you can educate me

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
after you won me once.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,880
One day I'll knock you down hard.

42
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,400
It's supposed that

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,760
both of us will someday

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,440
knock the rest of the league down hard.

45
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
Our hardware has been upgraded.

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,520
But our enemy has also been upgraded.

47
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Judging from the team members,

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,280
Except for the captain,

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
we're all new players

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
who haven't even played on the field.

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,720
As for weapon,

52
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,440
our orange equipment versus their sliver equipment,

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,320
the DPS is less than half of theirs.

54
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,960
Luo Ji,

55
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,680
How's the calculation going?

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,600
What is our winning rate against Jia Shi?

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Eighty-eight.

58
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Underling,

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
That's too unreliable.

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
It's 0.88.

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Based on all the data above,

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,760
we have nothing to compare with Jia Shi.

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,840
Very wise.

64
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,820
It's true that

65
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,500
we have nothing to compare with Jia Shi.

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,920
Because there's no need to compare.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,200
As a Captain,

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
I only consider the possibility of winning.

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
there are only two cases in my opinion.

70
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,960
Win,

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,280
or lose.

72
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
Our winning rate

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
is the same as that of Jia Shi.

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
Well... that's not scientific.

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
If we based on the data,

76
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,080
that should be all of us...

77
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,560
ESports Competition is not just about the data,

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
It's the person behind the account

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
that is the biggest variable.

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
Sounds like a trick,

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,080
but I have to say that

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
he really has a good point.

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,240
Captain,

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,600
let's begin the training now.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,360
Fighting, fighting,

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,240
beat Jia Shi.

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,920
Oh, right.

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,360
The boss wants to tell you something.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Take good care of your appearance while signing up tomorrow.

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
H... How?

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,320
In her opinion, I suppose...

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,240
Just dress up to fit your professional status.

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Professional status...

94
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,240
Do your business.

95
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,480
OK.

96
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
- Let's go. - Let's go.

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,000
How do I look?

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Am I very professional

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
in this suit?

100
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,600
Am I look like a ranger?

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Who are you?

102
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,360
Wait.

103
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
One more thing.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,960
Where are you guys going?

105
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,920
Wait for me.

106
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,280
He's yours.

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,800
Bao Zi.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,960
Tang Rou said he is more handsome than you.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,320
Is he your friend?

110
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,320
I don't know him.

111
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,760
Boss,

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
am I not professional?

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
The eighth Glory Professional Alliance

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
has all finished.

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,480
Samsara guild won the championship.

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,240
It was ordinary,

117
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
but there were regrets.

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
Compared with my left from Jiashi,

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
The degradation of Jiashi

120
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
made me more grieved.

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
That's where I fought, after all.

122
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,760
But now,

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
I just focus on Xing Xin.

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,560
Xing Xin is a new team.

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
First, we must pass the selection of the Tutor Selection

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
to qualify for the Challenge,

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
and win the championship,

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,880
Only then can we get tickets to the

129
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
tenth Glory Professional Alliance.

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
This is a new start.

131
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,560
It means new hope.

132
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,880
Come on,

133
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
Xing Xin.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,360
I have something else to do.

135
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,320
You guys sign up first.

136
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
So many people.

137
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
You say we're going to

138
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,520
take part in the best,

139
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
the most powerful audition?

140
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,560
Bao "know nothing" Rongxing,

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
Since it's a Tutor Selection,

142
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,600
It must be the most elementary competition.

143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Many teams come to sign up every year.

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Only the top twenty teams

145
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,160
selected by the tutors are qualified

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,080
to participate in the Formal Selection Challenge.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,600
So there's tutors.

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,760
Tutor team is not normal team,

149
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,320
Ambitions, Lan Yu, Wei Cao and Samsara guild,

150
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
Teams from the League

151
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,400
serve tutors every year.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
It's not easy to score from them and get promoted.

153
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,560
It can be said that the audition is a high wall.

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
Sounds so complicated,

155
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,760
but actually so easy.

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Ignore the tutor,

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,400
just focus on the rank.

158
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,760
Twenty teams were eventually

159
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,920
selected from these teams,

160
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
we are in absolutely.

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's go.

162
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,000
Assassin from Zhu Xian,

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
APM master.

164
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,920
APM 410.

165
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,160
He used to play three combo attacks

166
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,280
in one second in a game.

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,240
People called him "Hurricane Hand".

168
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,760
APM 410.

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,520
Impressive.

170
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,200
This way.

171
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't be nervous during the game.

172
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,000
Line up.

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Competition is about participation.

174
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
I recall someone had

175
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
hands tremble last time.

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,840
Don't you dare say that again.

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
I'll spray you.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
So quick.

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,240
What're you doing?

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,880
I'll be damned.

181
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,400
The first operator of Sharpshooter,

182
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
Cloud Piercer,

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,720
had a extremely fast reaction speed.

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,880
The reaction speed of ordinary people

185
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
is usually about 0.2 seconds.

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
He only needs 0.09 seconds.

187
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Well,

188
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,800
let's fill out the form.

189
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,480
I just saw a place over there.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,680
Let's go.

191
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,440
Let's go.

192
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
Hey, watch out.

193
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,720
It's lucky for you to run into me.

194
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,440
You'll be blackmailed

195
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,240
if you run into others.

196
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
Sorry.

197
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,640
So sorry.

199
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,520
Such a silly dude,

200
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
with a dull brain,

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll beat him easily.

202
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,760
That man seemed to be Wu Chen,

203
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,640
the captain of Team Everlasting.

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,840
Wu Chen.

205
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Captain of at Team Everlasting.

206
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,520
He led the team to the game from the fifth season.

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,520
He has plenty of practical experience

208
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,480
and excellent management ability.

209
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
He's good at controlling the strong by weakness.

210
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
Leading Team Everlasting to win fifteen games

211
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
with a zero winning rate determined.

212
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
Many call him the Reversal God.

213
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,720
Seriously?

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,640
The strength of each of these teams

215
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,600
should not be underestimated.

216
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,640
If we want to get the only twenty chances from these teams,

217
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
then our chances of winning are probably...

218
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
Fine, fine, fine.

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
You always praise others,

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
enhance their spirit,

221
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
take ourselves down.

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Tell you what, our boss is more talented,

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,840
he's resposible for the name "Textbook of Glory".

224
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Tutor Selection?

225
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
It's not sure who guide whom.

226
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,640
You only mention your boss while comparing.

227
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,280
Well... where's boss?

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,640
Same venue, same people.

229
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,080
This scene is really

230
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
a recurrence of yesterday.

231
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
Same venue is true.

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
The people are not.

233
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,280
Sure.

234
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,720
You're not the captain of Thunderbolt

235
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,600
who lost the game and throw everything away.

236
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
You're not the captain of Jia Shi

237
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,400
who won the game and give a speech to me.

238
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,840
This page is very clever about the tactics on Ambitons.

239
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,040
I'll take it for reference.

240
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Its tactical analysis of Lan Yu is also in place.

241
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,400
It's a pity that your Thunderbolt

242
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
can't achieve your idea at all.

243
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Looks like you dirty guys did work hard

244
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
on these dirty tactics.

245
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Work hard?

246
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,280
Doing my best?

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,760
I might consider that a compliment

248
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
If I heard such words a few years ago.

249
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,120
Now it's also a compliment.

250
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,200
Talent is a necessity

251
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,640
if you want to go down the eSports road.

252
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,600
But there is also a gap between talent and talent.

253
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,480
and maybe this gap

254
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,560
can't be bridged by hard work.

255
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,240
So,

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,400
"Hard work" now sounds a little ironic.

257
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,600
For most people, working hard is the only option.

258
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,560
It has nothing to do with talent.

259
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,360
It's too arrogant of you geniuses to say that.

260
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
There are not so many geniuses,

261
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
Those extraordinary people are just

262
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
work hard in an ordinary way

263
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
in places that you can't see.

264
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,480
Quantitative changes to qualitative changes.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Maybe it's just the last insistence.

266
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,520
It looks like I have to beat you

267
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,720
next time I meet you.

268
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,480
Or I'm unworthy of not only my own efforts,

269
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
but aslo your intentionally coming here

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
and said that to me.

271
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,000
Just finish the last pages first.

272
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,400
It seems that the tactics book has been written full.

273
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,800
Good results.

274
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,680
You've fulfilled your promise.

275
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
You beat Jia Shi with Thunderbolt.

276
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,080
But I haven't beaten you.

277
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,760
I heard you've made a big news recently.

278
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,000
Just transfered a team.

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
The most common news in the league.

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm afraid your transfer

281
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,800
is unusual this time.

282
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
This so-called unusual

283
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
depends on who it is for.

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,520
Here.

285
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,240
OK.

286
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,960
Mu Cheng.

287
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,440
Mu Cheng, Mu Cheng.

288
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,120
Is she?

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,240
What are you doing here?

290
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm asking you.

291
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
Haven't you heard?

292
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Are you deaf?

293
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,560
Are you doing cosplay?

294
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,640
Xing Xin team can just play out here

295
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,080
during the auditions.

296
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
So don't hold any hope.

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,160
Any team in this hall can knock you down.

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Who's that guy?

299
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,240
He talks so much.

300
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,200
So annoying.

301
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,240
Team member of Jia Shi Team one, Shen Jian.

302
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,040
What again?

303
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,240
Shen Jian.

304
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,920
So bitchy.

305
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,640
What did you say?

306
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,480
Shen Jian.

307
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,600
One of the main players in Jia Shi Team one.

308
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,440
He had joined Jiashi since the fifth season,

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,760
participated in seventy-eight games.

310
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,120
The highest DPS once

311
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,600
was 32% of the whole team.

312
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
He's the top three striker in the league.

313
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,680
What... What now?

314
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Me,

315
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,680
the famous Glory newcomer Bao Rongxing,

316
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
have broken 1800 bricks,

317
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
have thrown more sands

318
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,600
than in the Sahara Desert.

319
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
If you want to compare data,

320
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm not afraid of you.

321
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
Young man,

322
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,960
you know nothing.

323
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Our captain, Jia Shi,

324
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,280
Best Newcomer, Sun Xiang,

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Top Launcher of the League, Su Mucheng.

326
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Who do you have?

327
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
You even don't have enough people.

328
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,760
Underling,

329
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,200
teach them a lesson.

330
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,920
Hello,

331
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
my name is Luo Ji.

332
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,800
My operations and skills are the worst in our team.

333
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,840
But I'm familiar with

334
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,240
everything about all of you here.

335
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,160
And if there's no accident,

336
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,080
My analysis of you

337
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,160
should be more thorough than yourselves.

338
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,040
Nice.

339
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,840
Very good.

340
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,520
Anyone?

341
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Anyone else do you have?

342
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,360
Yes.

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,880
Newcomer Tang Rou,

344
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
163 days of contact with Glory,

345
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,000
20 days after the account has reached the full level.

346
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,520
68 games battle with Team Wei Cao in the arena,

347
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
the winning rate is zero.

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Went to Glory Professional Alliance first time two days ago.

349
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,320
So what?

350
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,080
You are all standing at this

351
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,240
starting point like me.

352
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
Well said.

353
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,680
Anyone else?

354
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,280
Anyone?

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,720
Me.

356
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
You don't have to introduce yourself.

357
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,600
Former Wei Cao professional manager

358
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,640
who was beaten up cruelly

359
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
in the last All-Star Game.

360
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,640
Manager?

361
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Manager of water.

362
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,120
Boss.

363
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
Vice Captain of Jia Shi,

364
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,560
Xiao Shiqin.

365
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,960
Vice Captain of Xing XIn,

366
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,160
Qiao Yifan.

367
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
Xing Xin and Jia Shi may meet again.

368
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,440
Let's talk on the arena.

369
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,400
Yifan,

370
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
the result of the Tutor Selection

371
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,920
is still half an hour away.

372
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
You've dragged us to look at

373
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,000
the empty screen for an hour.

374
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,040
Exactly, Yifan.

375
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,640
Isn't it fun to attack Dungeon?

376
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,040
Isn't it excited to battle others?

377
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
Isn't it enerfetic to throw the bricks?

378
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
Why waste time here?

379
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,560
Let's go.

380
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,160
Let's go back.

381
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,320
Move.

382
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Unnormal behaviour,

383
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
there's only one explaination.

384
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,000
Fear.

385
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
Yifan.

386
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,320
Are you afraid?

387
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,480
Instead of waiting for Murphy's Law,

388
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,080
it's better for us to take the first lead.

389
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,280
What's Murphy's Law?

390
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,640
The fourth law of Murphy's Law is that

391
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,400
if you're worried about something happening,

392
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
it's more likely to happen.

393
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,560
How to take the first lead?

394
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Normally speaking,

395
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
if we are not afraid anything,

396
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
there will be relatively good results.

397
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,080
Can I be afraid?

398
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
Do I need to be afraid?

399
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,320
Am...

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,520
Am I supposed to be afraid?

401
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,040
Yes.

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,880
Since we are all not afraid,

403
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,160
then the result doesn't matter,

404
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,440
right?

405
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,920
Then,

406
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,080
let's go back and have a rest,

407
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,480
let's go.

408
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
Go.

409
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
Finally.

410
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,040
What?

411
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
Such a coincidence.

412
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,020
=Nothing to worry about, right, Yifan?
Aren't you not scared, Tangrou? Luo Ji, didn't you tell us not to be afraid? =

413
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:57,475
= Shut up. =

414
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,980
= I second what Tangrou said.  =

415
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,020
= Me too. =

416
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,635
= Look. The Captain is offline.
He is the one who isn't afraid. He won't be affected by the opponents at all. =

417
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,550
= Admire the captain. =

418
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
Team Wei Cao.

419
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,478
= @Qiao Yifan =

420
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,720
All the star tutors in the Tutor Selection are familiar.

421
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,560
Sure.

422
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,760
It's much less difficult than the Alliance.

423
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,440
There will be no problem.

424
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,560
That's the reason that

425
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,760
there is no need

426
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,400
for three All-Stars to be present

427
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,320
at this level.

428
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,080
You were saying that

429
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
Sun Xiang and I don't have to play at the same time.

430
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Exactly.

431
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
When Sun Xiang is impulsive,

432
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,400
I'll let him go back,

433
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
and he'll sit on the bench

434
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
and calm down.

435
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,720
Then it's time

436
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,760
for tacticians like you to play,

437
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
take over the control.

438
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Sun Xiang and I are different types of players.

439
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Jia Shi needs me and him at the same time.

440
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
You are new here.

441
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,440
You don't know much about our newcomer yet.

442
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,760
Young and aggressive,

443
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
doesn't know how to obey,

444
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,160
only know how to attack.

445
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,320
It's not wise to talk about compatibility

446
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,920
with such an impulsive person.

447
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,720
Impulse can also be an advantage.

448
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
Passing-line players rarely make mistakes,

449
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,880
meanwhile they rarely create miracles.

450
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,240
I have designed a set of tactics

451
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,640
with Sun Xiang as the core

452
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,080
for the Tutor Selection.

453
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
I certainly believe in your tactics.

454
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,600
It's just that

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
Sun Xiang will not make any changes

456
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,600
because of your joining.

457
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
He's bound to be the leak in your tactics.

458
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,560
What's wrong?

459
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,800
I want to know your next tactical arrangement.

460
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Leaf of Autumn is the tactics.

461
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Fine.

462
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,200
Then let's work together

463
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,960
to knock down the rest of the league.

464
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,200
Any leak can be remedied,

465
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,400
cause we are professional players.

466
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Victory is our common goal.

467
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Tutor Selection is different from Regular Season.

468
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,400
There's no Individual Event,

469
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
Arena Contest or Team Competition.

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
There was only one contest.

471
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,200
The tutor team will intercept on this map.

472
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,360
We need to break through their barriers,

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
running from one end of the map to the other.

474
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,480
One point for each player who crosses the line.

475
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,160
That's the rules.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
Next, you'll talk about

477
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
how we should deal with it.

478
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,600
Team Wei Cao is led by Witch,

479
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,200
he is best at debuff,

480
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,880
which will greatly reduce our combat effectiveness.

481
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,080
Therefore,

482
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,640
I think we need a Cleric.

483
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,680
Are we that frightened?

484
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Why do we need a Cleric to heal?

485
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,560
The Cleric's main project is indeedly heal,

486
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,600
but this time,

487
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,360
We need his ability to clear the debuff.

488
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
I have a video here.

489
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Let's take a look at

490
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
how the Cleric clears the debuff.

491
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,000
Wang Jiexi and Gao Yingjie

492
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,280
can both release debuff,

493
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,400
giving us all kinds of reduced effect,

494
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,440
making our combat effectiveness drop sharply.

495
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,200
We really need a special person to disperse them.

496
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,920
Yifan,

497
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,240
Facing Weicao,

498
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
aren't you afraid?

499
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,480
Weicao...

500
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,360
is fine.

501
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,400
At least I'm familiar with them.

502
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Why are you guys here?

503
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Never judge people by their appearance.

504
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,720
Yifan looks dull.

505
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,720
But deep inside,

506
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,920
he's evil-minded.

507
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
I... didn't.

508
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,240
I'd like to see how bad you can be.

509
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,200
Bao Zi.

510
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,240
Tang, here.

511
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,320
Tang Rou.

512
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,160
Tang Rou.

513
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,880
Underling.

514
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,400
Luo Ji.

515
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Give it back to me.

516
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,760
Team Wei Cao,

517
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,680
Some offensive skills can be used

518
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
to debuff enemy characters.

519
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,520
Debuff is a state of diminution

520
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
imposed on the enemy's role,

521
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
It can temporarily reduce the enemy's

522
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,160
role attributes, skills, etc.,

523
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,360
causing their decline in combat effectiveness.

524
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
Tang Rou,

525
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,160
Secret weapons are ready.

526
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,680
Yifan.

527
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,560
Good job.

528
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,880
Captain,

529
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,600
this is the ranking of

530
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,920
the whole network Cleric.

531
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,200
I'll do it myself.

532
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,000
Captain,

533
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,080
how about this one?

534
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,600
Although he's not at the top of the list,

535
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,200
but his power of clear the debuff is the strongest.

536
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,480
I think he should be very suitable for our team.

537
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,880
Choose not the best,

538
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
but the right.

539
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,360
The train of thought is clear.

540
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
Have you found him?

541
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,880
His name is An Wenyi.

542
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,960
He is a fresh graduate.

543
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,560
I'm thinking that he plays Cleric,

544
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,520
he might be easygoing,

545
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
and very likely to fit in with us.

546
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,680
His ID number is "Cold Hands".

547
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,960
Then let's take a shot.

548
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,720
Warm his cool hands

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,080
with our passion.

550
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,480
Yes, captain.

551
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,880
Oh right,

552
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,720
captain,

553
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,920
This is the personal data of An Wenyi.

554
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,840
I've highlighted all the key points.

555
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,040
Moreover,

556
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,320
this is the latest recruiting of the all teams.

557
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,800
Captain,

558
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,400
This is some interview skills

559
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
I searched yesterday,

560
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,320
I hope it helps.

561
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Well prepared,

562
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,160
how about you go and interview?

563
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Me?

564
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,640
Can I?

565
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,000
Sure,

566
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,040
you are the vice captain.

567
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,640
Are you really want to go to Team Xing Xin?

568
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,280
What else?

569
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,680
Well,

570
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,280
only two months, you can't stay long.

571
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
Then use two months to make a quick buck.

572
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,560
Isn't that great?

573
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,200
Let me tell you.

574
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
ESports is not just attacking Dungeon.

575
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,040
It is real.

576
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,560
I'm feeling that....

577
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,960
Are you

578
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,280
doubting me?

579
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
It's not that I doubt you,

580
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
You know your strengths and weaknesses, right?

581
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,560
Otherwise,

582
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,240
You won't ask me to play for you.

583
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,760
Thanks.

584
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,360
As a golden Game Leveling,

585
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,960
you are not that good.

586
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Didn't we agree

587
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,160
you would give me five books in return?

588
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,160
Junior brother,

589
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,920
we agreed with the premise that

590
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,800
you have to help me reach No.1,

591
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,720
now I'm only No.10.

592
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,440
You deserves

593
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,560
only three books.

594
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,280
Although the results were not as good as expected,

595
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,240
it's also blessed by misfortune.

596
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,920
Right?

597
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,760
Now there's a team coming to you.

598
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
Please give me the whole set.

599
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,040
Sure.

600
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,200
Thanks a lot.

601
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,280
Don't you count your coffee as a book?

602
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,200
Then I still have one more.

603
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,560
This one counts on my coffee.

604
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,120
Hey,

605
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,240
These books are

606
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,600
no longer of any value to you.

607
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
See this as our friendship.

608
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,880
Let me ask you,

609
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,040
how much is our friendship?

610
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,880
You are so mean.

611
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,600
Why do I have a friend like you?

612
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,080
I want to break up with you.

613
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,960
Bye.

614
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,600
I...

615
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,720
Fine.

616
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,880
I can't believe you can be in a team.

617
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,680
That's none of your business.

618
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,120
Not only can I join the team,

619
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,920
but I can also raise my status.

620
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
We'll see.

621
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,400
These property and turnover,

622
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,760
just fine.

623
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,240
Hello.

624
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,120
Are you An Wenyi?

625
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,640
Yes, I am.

626
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,560
Go and tell your interviewer I'm here.

627
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,600
Hi.

628
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,160
I am...

629
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,080
the interviewer.

630
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,240
Is he

631
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,040
the one you are looking for?

632
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,160
Cold Hands.

633
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,400
He is An Wenyi.

634
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Why did you let Yifan interview him?

635
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,560
Such an excellent vice captain,

636
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,880
It's such a pity that

637
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,960
I didn't give his the opportunity

638
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,640
and make him take charge of it.

639
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,840
Watch out.

640
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,040
Careful.

641
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,400
Interview skills No. 1,

642
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
start with greetings,

643
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
relieve the tension.

644
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,800
Your resume says that

645
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,160
your undergraduate major is

646
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,800
Finance.

647
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,840
Yes.

648
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,160
But it doesn't affect me

649
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,160
to become an excellent Cleric.

650
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,960
It's more than enough

651
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,880
to be your player with my abilities.

652
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,880
Not only that,

653
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,960
I can be your team investment advisor.

654
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,960
and of course,

655
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
personal finance.

656
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,360
Interview skills No. 2,

657
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520
don't rush to the point.

658
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,080
Leave the problem to him,

659
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200
respond quickly according to the situation.

660
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
What advantages do you think

661
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,520
you have as a Cleric?

662
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Talent is not something else.

663
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,680
It can't be seen with one seconds.

664
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,040
But if you're a person of good sense,

665
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,520
you can see if I'm suitable or not.

666
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,200
Interview skills No. 3,

667
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,080
Go to the point directly.

668
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,080
So tell me about your records of Glory.

669
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,000
I'll be stronger

670
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,200
while meeting the strong one.

671
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,120
The records depend on whether

672
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,000
the team can make me play at a high level.

673
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Your team have to rely on

674
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
a Net Cafe to support.

675
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,560
I'd better...

676
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Although our team has a small scale,

677
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,240
but we are professional.

678
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,840
Let me show you our training room.

679
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
Do you have any other requirements?

680
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,080
Look,

681
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,640
Why are you so insincere?

682
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
At this juncture,

683
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Shouldn't you talk about

684
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,800
the salary or something?

685
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,160
Never mind.

686
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,120
Time is money.

687
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,000
You...

688
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
You can request anything

689
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,440
as long as you can stay.

690
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,120
You mean that

691
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,320
as long as my performance is good,

692
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
the salary can be increased.

693
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Right?

694
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,960
No problem.

695
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,800
I can grant your request.

696
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,880
But whether you can get the contract

697
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,600
depends on your performance.

698
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,480
Fine.

699
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,400
I'll play

700
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,880
according to your rules.

701
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,800
Our rules are the rules of the Tutor Selection,

702
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
which is running through the map.

703
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,800
You win

704
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,600
if you cross the finish line.

705
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,280
You run and

706
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm in charge of interception.

707
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,760
I'll lose if one player crosses the line.

708
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Let me see

709
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,840
what on earth your abilities are.

710
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,280
Boss,

711
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,160
you played a trick.

712
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm not ready.

713
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,480
The opponent does not care

714
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,120
whether you are ready or not on the arena.

715
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,480
Tang Rou go forward,

716
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,120
suppressing captain,

717
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,160
I'll support you.

718
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,360
Bao Zi, An Wenyi,

719
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,280
look for opportunities to move forward.

720
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,120
No problem.

721
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,640
Got it.

722
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,880
It's not so easy to walk away.

723
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,880
An Wenyi,

724
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,800
Silent all captain's skills

725
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,040
with Sacred Fire.

726
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,640
Thanks.

727
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,920
Don't be.

728
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,840
Just gave you such a little.

729
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,640
So mean.

730
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,120
It's lucky that you're still alive.

731
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,000
Nice timing.

732
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,920
Of course.

733
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
Why don't you cancel my debuff?

734
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,840
You are too weak.

735
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,200
It's such a waste

736
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
cancelling your debuff.

737
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,480
What did you say?

738
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,520
Bao Zi,

739
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
more talking

740
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,800
and you'll lose.

741
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,320
Bao Zi,

742
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,520
use Inject Poison to break captain's Super Armor.

743
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,760
Tang Rou,

744
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,600
limit captain's range of activities

745
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,800
Sorry,

746
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,880
my bad.

747
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,440
It's OK, Yifan.

748
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
An Wenyi, cancel the debuff.

749
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,360
We're all going to die

750
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,160
under your command.

751
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,880
Why these nonsense?

752
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,400
There's no need cancelling the debuff.

753
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,320
Cause he has

754
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
unilaterally declared that game is over.

755
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,960
You spoke fast,

756
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,600
the command was right,

757
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
but you are just like reading a textbook.

758
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,840
You don't know how to be flexible.

759
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
You can pass if you're

760
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,800
dealing with an ordinary people.

761
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,600
But he is the "Textbook of Glory".

762
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
It's ridiculous.

763
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Besides, captain Ye knows

764
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,640
so much about everybody.

765
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,400
There's no chance to overturn.

766
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
My teammate is weak,

767
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,640
bad luck for me.

768
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,160
Admit defeat for bet,

769
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,840
I have no face to ask for the contract.

770
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,480
Goodbye.

771
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,080
An Wenyi.

772
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,640
Please wait.

773
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,560
An Wenyi.

774
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,400
Wait.

775
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,480
Captain,

776
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,360
it's my bad.

777
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,080
I didn't...

778
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,640
Stay.

779
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,640
I can grant your extra request.

780
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,480
Happy to cooperate.

781
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,480
For the long-term development of our team,

782
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
we have to consciously train

783
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,520
new people for the second echelon.

784
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
Do you have any plans

785
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,000
for future development?

786
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,760
It seems a little early

787
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,760
to talk about things far away.

788
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,240
Let's talk about the present.

789
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,800
Have you thought about

790
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,000
An Wenyi's treatment?

791
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
I have to check the cost of the parties quickly,

792
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,080
and sign a contract with him as soon as possible.

793
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,600
I...

794
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,800
haven't considered it yet.

795
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,320
Haven't considered?

796
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,840
These questions

797
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,160
should be thought out

798
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,080
before the interview.

799
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,160
See this.

800
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,040
An Wenyi's Exclusive Plan.
