3
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,840
Dad,

4
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,040
I was sitting here

5
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,640
the day I left home,

6
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,800
you told me that

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
You don't want me to have

8
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
no way back while I regret.

9
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,120
Dad,

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
I always want to tell you these years that

11
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't need the way back at all.

12
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
Cause I never regret.

13
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
Noodles don't taste good after a long time.

14
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
I built a new team.

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,440
We're going to play the first National Challenge soon.

16
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,880
I hope

17
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,160
you can come and see my game.

18
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Go back after eating.

19
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
April 2nd.

20
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,520
Remember to ask Guang

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,960
if he had found a place to live.

22
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,160
May 8th.

23
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,160
I can't pass a single level

24
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,160
after Guang left.

25
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,920
Next he called, remember to tell Guang,

26
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,360
the master needs Guang's guidance,

27
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,080
then he can remain a master.

28
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
Right,

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,720
did I ask Guang that

30
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
if he found a place to live?

31
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,760
I must remember to ask next time.

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,400
July 16th.

33
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Remember to ask Guang,

34
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,640
Which channel will broadcast the eSports competition?

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,080
After Guang becomes a professional player,

36
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,760
I can see him on TV

37
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,920
when I miss him.

38
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
Today,

39
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,080
I have nothing to tell Guang,

40
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
but to tell myself,

41
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
do remember that

42
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm the master,

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,040
He is Guang.

44
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,400
Our Glory account is Golden Partner.

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,230
Guang,

= Ticket of the 9th Chanllenge of Glory =

52
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Ten minutes to go to the stadium.

53
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,880
You still have time for the last round of inspection.

54
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,040
Timing begins.

55
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,680
Over.

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,040
If the speed of Mofan's brain circuits

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
is one-tenth of his movement,

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
he'll be the captain.

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,320
Just waiting for you.

60
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,160
Let's go.

61
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
Although I've said it many times,

62
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,680
I'd like to

63
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,080
emphasize again befor game starts.

64
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
Today our opponent Miracle Team

65
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,560
is a veteran team that

66
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,120
has been fighting in the League for years.

67
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
As a veteran team,

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
we are all skilled hands.

69
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
It's so easy for us Miracle Team

70
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,080
to defeat Xing xin.

71
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,360
But even so,

72
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,240
we can't let down our guards.

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
Individual Event needs stable operation

74
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,680
and strong output players.

75
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,760
Wei Chen, Mo Fan and Tang Rou are suitable.

76
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,640
However, Mo Fan as a sneak attack soldier of the team,

77
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,880
should not be exposed prematurely.

78
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
You'll be replaced by Luo Ji.

79
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,840
Did you hear that, underling?

80
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
Don't let me down.

81
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,240
Arena Contest is wheel war.

82
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,600
The Ghosts of Yifan as a support character,

83
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
is suitable for the first appearance.

84
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Yifan, it's all right.

85
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
I'll kick the asses

86
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
that you can't kick.

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,640
You play unsteadily,

88
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,240
so you'll be the second one.

89
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,080
Why?

90
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,600
Anyway, boss is the last one.

91
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,800
He can defeat them all

92
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
if we don't succeed.

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,200
Right, boss?

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,200
I can turn off the monitor and play with them.

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Did you hear that?

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
Absolute crush them.

97
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
Terminate the war ahead of time.

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,040
Right.

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,640
What if there are variables?

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you saying that?

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
There won't be.

102
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,200
If so,

103
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Let's just play it by ear.

104
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll hand in the registration form first.

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,480
By the way,

106
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
You have a pre-match interview.

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,840
Hurry up.

108
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,560
Master Ye Qiu.

109
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,200
Microphone.

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,840
Master.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
Did you build your team this time

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
to retaliate against Jiashi?

113
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,640
Is Jiashi's introduction of Xiao Shiqin

114
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
a response to your plan?

115
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,600
Fighting Miracle,

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,080
is your first game after your comeback...

117
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
How can such a confidential matter be exposed casually?

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,480
Tell me about it.

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,920
Win,

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
is the only tactic.

121
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,400
As the captain of Miracle,

122
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
What do you think of Xing Xin Team?

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
They are a very special team.

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
I think the summary from the outside world is very incisive.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
Weakness and disability.

126
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720
They just need us to give them a lesson.

127
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,720
A retired pacifier,

128
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
with six or seven worthless babies,

129
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,160
everyone is pity for them.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,080
Even the boss is a green hand,

131
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,800
Maybe she didn't even know where to

132
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,480
hand in the registration form.

133
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,720
All in all, the game will be a bonus

134
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,400
to us Miracle Team.

135
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Turn the corner,

136
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,880
and there's a new world.

137
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,040
Is everyone ready?

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Are you ready to accept the cheers of our fans?

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,840
My fame is beyond description.

140
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,600
There will be huge crowds of my fans

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
that shout for us with babies.

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,200
You'll just wait to benefit from me.

143
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
You still haven't learned to be calm

144
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
at the age.

145
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm setting an example for you.

146
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,120
If you're all like me

147
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
who had the achievements,

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
will there be fewer fans?

149
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,040
Wei,

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
You should go on a stage play.

151
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,960
I've got a bunch of fans for everything.

152
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,320
The cheers before the game are all credit lines.

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
Don't be too superstitious.

154
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,760
The cheer after the game

155
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
is our real strength.

156
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,880
That's what I mean.

157
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
Let's go.

158
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,759
= Xing Xin Team =

159
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,991
= The 9th Chanllenge of Glory =

160
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:23,012
= Miracle =

161
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

162
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
Have you been intimidated by my fans?

163
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,680
So many fans here today.

164
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,200
We are major competition arena, we'll win today.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,440
Hello,

166
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
Where is the registration place, please?

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,600
Thanks.

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,720
No wonder I haven't heard of it.

169
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
How can I get in?

170
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Go to the end and turn left.

171
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Thanks.

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,160
No problem.

173
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,160
Miss, here is the registration place.

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Wait, wait.

175
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,880
Here is the Team Competition.

176
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,480
It's no big deal.

177
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,640
there was no one there when my Net Cafe

178
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
started business on the first day.

179
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,640
We should take a long-term view of the problem.

180
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,720
Captain Ye Xiu,

181
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,320
you are surely not nervous.

182
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
I'm very nervous.

183
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
The captain means

184
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
not to underestimate any opponent.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
So it's normal to be nervous.

186
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,400
The captain also said

187
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
We should be awed of the stage,

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
take every time of

189
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,840
going up on the stage as the first time.

190
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not saying that.

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
I call it strategic nervous.

192
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,320
Just posturing.

193
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
Hello, friends of the audience at the scene,

194
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,720
and guys who are watching our live broadcasts.

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,280
Hello everyone.

196
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,600
This is the first round

197
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,560
of the 9th Glory Challenge.

198
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm the host Luo.

199
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,440
This match is divided into three rounds,

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Individual Event, Arena Contest and Team Competition.

201
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Three Individual Events,

202
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,040
The winner of each game gets one point.

203
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,480
The winner of Arena Contest gets three points.

204
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,960
The winner of Team Competition will get five points.

205
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,320
Today's game is

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,640
full of interesting.

207
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,400
Mster Ye's first show after resurrection,

208
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,040
Xingxin Team's first game.

209
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Whether the God of Fights who challenged the alliance

210
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
can create brilliance again?

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
It's expected.

212
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,760
It's time for me to show my skills.

213
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,880
Make a good start.

214
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Not only a good start,

215
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll crush your opponent with absolute advantage.

216
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,440
Good luck.

217
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
See ya.

218
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,360
Go, go, go.

219
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
Qiao Yifan.

220
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
My god.

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,120
Sorry.

222
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
I mixed the form of

223
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Individual Event and Arena Contest.

224
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,600
Isn't that a complete disruption of the captain's

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
strategic deployment?

226
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,280
We could have been strategically scored.

227
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,280
Now we're giving them points.

228
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
What should we do now?

229
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,000
There must be a remedy.

230
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,240
I'll go now.

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,840
Excuse me.

233
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,800
Xing Xin's fan.

234
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
He's Xing Xin's fan.

235
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,680
Beat him, Beat him, Beat him.

236
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,800
As a former Wei Cao's player,

237
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,320
Qiao Yifan hasn't played a professional game yet.

238
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,600
This is his first real appearance.

239
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
This stage is brand new

240
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,400
and unfamiliar to him.

241
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Qiao Yifan, come on!

242
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
Qiao Yifan, come on!

243
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,880
Qiao Yifan.

244
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
Next let's invite Fang Daxu

245
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
of Miracle Team.

246
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Remember to frighten the kid a bit

247
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
when going on the stage.

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,400
Don't worry.

249
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
I know what to do.

250
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,200
Since you are so nervous,

251
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll see you off earlier.

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
I've tried everything.

253
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,480
I almost set a cannon in front of them.

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
But they still won't change.

255
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,600
Our first game,

256
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,000
such an important game,

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,240
and I screwed it up.

258
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,520
We can lose.

259
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
We can lose because of inexperience.

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,000
We can lose because of tactical error.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
But not because of my fault

262
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,800
on a primary mistake.

263
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,400
So how do you want me to answer you?

264
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
If I'm Qiao Yifan,

265
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,840
he'll tell you it's okay.

266
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,960
If I'm Baozi,

267
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,440
he'll say

268
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,600
it's no big deal.

269
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,640
If I'm Lao Wei,

270
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,600
he must say it's nothing.

271
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,240
But it's me that chased you out.

272
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
I can only tell you the truth.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,480
Guoguo,

274
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,600
you really did wrong this time.

275
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,320
Do you think I'm not good enough

276
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
to be a team manager?

277
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
I can't help anything

278
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,880
while you were training.

279
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,880
I can't handle a form

280
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,080
in such an important game.

281
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,240
I feel like I'm a real failure.

282
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,240
I can do nothing and change nothing.

283
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,360
Then don't.

284
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,880
Rather than hoping to change the rules,

285
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,080
why not choose to trust your teammates?

286
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
We are a team.

287
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
Why can't we solve it together

288
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
when we face difficulties?

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
I'll be waiting for you.

290
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,520
Individual Event round one,

291
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,400
Xing Xin's Ghostblade,

292
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,080
Yi Cunhui, versus Miracle's Knight.

293
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
The nonexistent knight.

294
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,920
Placeing Ghostblade on the first round of Individual Event,

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,120
which is weak at one on one,

296
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,040
it seems like Xing Xin is very confident.

297
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,440
OK. Let's see

298
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,560
how Qiao Yifan will behave.

299
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,720
Both characters have entered the game map.

300
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
The game will begin soon.

301
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,360
Miracle's Knight

302
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,240
starts very proactively.

303
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,280
He wants to get close to Ghostblade quickly,

304
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,880
limits Ghostblade's skill,

305
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,480
Another assault.

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,240
Keep pressuring.

307
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,400
Falling Star Hammer. Shield Counter.

308
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Miracle's Knight well played at the beginning.

309
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
Yi Cunhui is consumed continuously.

310
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
He has no rhythm completely.

311
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Captain Ye, how did you teach Yifan?

312
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,520
Saw the knight and still don't run.

313
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,800
Waiting to be killed?

314
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,840
You are still so anxious

315
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,000
at this age.

316
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,200
...avoid consuming too much blood.

317
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,640
It seems that Qiao Yifan can't relaxed himself

318
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
while going on stage for the first time.

319
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,800
Although the knight got close to you,

320
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,080
if you adjusted the rhythm in time,

321
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,960
keep the distance,

322
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
it's still possible to fight back.

323
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
However, Miracle's Knight fights actively.

324
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,040
He pushes Qiao Yifan to the limit.

325
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
I always regard Yifan as a good boy,

326
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,000
he has a fragile heart.

327
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
He was beaten like that at the beginning.

328
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,280
He'll lose.

329
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
Kid,

330
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,040
your basic skills are fine.

331
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,760
but you are lack of practical experience.

332
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,760
I heard you were from Wei Cao originally.

333
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,360
I don't think you operate like

334
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
a student of Wang Jiexi's.

335
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,200
Matter of time.

336
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
Keep the distance with Ghost Step.

337
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,560
After that,

338
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,440
increase opponent's weight by using Ash Boundary,

339
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,960
in order to slow him down.

340
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,520
Then block him completely with the array of ice.

341
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
Now it's your show time.

342
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Nice.

343
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,760
Nice hit back.

344
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
Yi Cunhui grabs the opportunity and pulls away the distance with Ghost Step.

345
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,040
Ghost Step and Ash Boundary and the array of ice.

346
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,240
Restrain specially on Knight.

347
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,280
Which genius taught him this?

348
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,480
Guess.

349
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,160
Wanna win me? Nice try.

350
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,640
The timing is very good.

351
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,760
Combos of connecting skills in time

352
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,120
at the end of control.

353
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,320
Keep a good attack rhythm,

354
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
Yi Cunhui may have a chance to win.

355
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,160
Ultimate.

356
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,040
Crusader's Trial rush to Yi Cunhui directly and all in,

357
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
Yi Cunhui was consumed a lot.

358
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,960
Such a pity.

359
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,200
Yi Cunhui fell down at the last moment.

360
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
Although he loses the game,

361
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,440
Qiao Yifan did a wonderful job in the second half.

362
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,160
Well, finally let's congratulate

363
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,600
Fang Xuda from Miracle Team

364
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
gets the first point.

365
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:31,855
However,

366
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,360
Fang Xuda's fight back was brilliant.

367
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,160
The Crusader's Trial

368
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
was too violent.

369
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,480
Perfect.

370
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,520
Congratulations on Fang Xuda.

371
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,480
Captain,

372
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,880
Ghostblade can't confront Knight directly.

373
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
We normally choose to dodge.

374
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
You can't dodge sucessfully

375
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,520
if you meet a true master.

376
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,120
You'll be suppressed like this.

377
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,000
Yifan,

378
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,880
Calm yourself down

379
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
while meeting a tough opponent.

380
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
Think about possible breakthroughs.

381
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,360
Knights are strong,

382
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,960
but their skills are limited.

383
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
You have to learn to conserve your strength.

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,000
Sorry, captain.

385
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,360
I'll win back next time.

386
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,120
This kid is really tough.

387
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
I almost lose.

388
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,600
Good.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,680
Good game.

390
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,000
Captain.

391
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,240
I should keep the distance earlier,

392
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,600
and find the breakthrough,

393
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,040
so that I won't be beaten so badly afterwards.

394
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,320
Yifan,

395
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,600
how did it feel to stand on the official court

396
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,200
for the first time?

397
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,440
Very nervous.

398
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,960
I was watched by so many people.

399
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
But I like this court.

400
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,520
There is still a long way to go

401
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,840
to be a good professional player.

402
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,080
= Let's welcome to Indicidual Event's =

403
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,560
Remember today's feeling.

404
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:18,866
= Let's welcome to Indicidual Event's =

405
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:19,960
second round player.

406
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
Xing Xin Team's Bao Rongxing.

407
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,360
Everybody,

408
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
wait to my triumphant return.

409
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,560
= And his opponent, Miricles' Luo Tian. =

410
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,520
He's really relaxed.
= And his opponent, Miricles' Luo Tian. =

411
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,146
= And his opponent, Miricles' Luo Tian. =
He has no idea what tension is.

412
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:29,000
He has no idea what tension is.

413
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,360
What?

414
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,880
Are you nervous?

415
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,720
How is that possible?

416
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
I can only make other people nervous.

417
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,733
They must be nervous

418
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,600
= The second round of Individual Event =
They must be nervous

419
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,880

427
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:41,040
to kill them in one fell swoop.

428
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,280
Xing Xin's Bao Zi, the Invader versus Miricles' Baraka.

429
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,600
Ranger versus Elemental mage.

430
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,360
Both characters enters the map and game begins.

431
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,880
Stonehenge Map. Close combat.

432
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,000
If Ranger can replicate

433
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,560
the beginning of Knight,

434
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
move near the Elemental Mage,

435
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,240
there will be great advantages.

436
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,000
But Baraka's Elemental Mage won't

437
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,040
let the enemy get close to him easily.

438
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,240
We see Baraka's moving slowly.

439
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
Find a high spot.

440
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
He's spotted.

441
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,640
Bao Zi, the Invader is spotted.

442
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,720
Baraka's gonna attack.

443
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,000
Nice move. Bao Zi, the Invader reacts very quickly.

444
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,280
Magic missile missed him.

445
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,240
Change the route immediately.

446
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,120
Baraka's attacking continuously.

447
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,320
He's consuming Bao Zi, the Invader's HP.

448
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
Now the Ranger is a little passive.

449
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,960
Very experienced.

450
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,120
To avoid attack,

451
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
Bao Zi, the Invader run straight into the Stonehenge.

452
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,840
In this way, the Elemental Mage

453
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,400
will find it very difficult to find his place again.

454
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
Bao Zi, the Invader continues his strategy.

455
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,800
High-speed movement using his characteristic of occupation.

456
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,360
He doesn't give Baraka a chance to locate himself.

457
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
Such a strategy can temporarily

458
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,160
guarantee the safety of HP himself.

459
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,320
But if he wants to win the game,

460
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,400
he still needs to find an oppirtunity to get close.

461
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Such a good prejudge.

462
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,040
He's not a newcomer at all.

463
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,600
I was fooled.

464
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,760
Baraka adjusted the position.

465
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,480
Baraka is very cautious.

466
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,960
He chooses to stay outside Stonehenge.

467
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,960
It seems that he will not rush out.

468
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Bao Zi, the Invader keeps moving.

469
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,480
Baraka found another high spot.

470
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
This position is very good for him.

471
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,120
He uses the skills.

472
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,840
What is Baozi doing? The Mage has jumped up.

473
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,680
Hit him.

474
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Bao Zi, the Invader lost lots of HP.

475
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,600
The HP of ranger is only 40%.

476
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
Elemental Mage's damage is considerable.

477
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,720
Baraka uses the skills continuously.

478
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
Bao Zi, the Invader is very passive.

479
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,760
Why is here all stone walls?

480
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,240
Bao Zi, the Invader's dodging is very strange.

481
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,840
It's not like a well planned route.

482
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Baraka starts his attaking rhythm.

483
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Bao Zi, the Invader will lose

484
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,760
if he can't find the opportunity to get close to him.

485
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,800
Good. Another attack.

486
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Bao Zi, the Invader has been suppressed compeltely.

487
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,200
Baraka has no pressure at all.

488
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,920
He's like shooting a moving stake.

489
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,520
We can see that Baozi has some difficulties.

490
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,000
If he can't

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,080
find a way out now

492
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,200
It's very likely to be consumed to death like this.

493
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,120
God.

494
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,440
Did he get lost on the map?

495
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,840
I told him to

496
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
make use of the geography carefully

497
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,400
to avoid ranged attack.

498
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,520
Stone wall, for example, is a good choice.

499
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
A good choice?

500
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,840
This guy has no sense of direction.

501
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
Why is the road so hard to find?

502
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
Bao Zi, the Invader hasn't found the chance

503
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,320
to get close to the Elemental Mage yet?

504
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,960
I observed his position carefully.

505
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,280
He seems to be circling around

506
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
the same area of the map.

507
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
Is he lost?

508
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Flame Explosion.

509
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,240
Hit him again.

510
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Bao Zi, the Invader

511
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,680
is acting amateur.

512
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,800
You turned out to be a rookie.

513
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,040
Bao Zi, the Invader is in danger.

514
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,600
HP is empty.

515
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,360
Miricle Team's Elemental Mage,

516
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,480
Baraka won.

517
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
Luo Tian is the winner.

518
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
That's a bit unexpected.

519
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

520
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,760
As a professional player,

521
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
Bao Rongxing still has a long way to go.

522
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,320
At least get familiar with the map first.

523
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
Sorry, boss.

524
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,880
It's too hard to find a way out there.

525
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,800
I got lost.

526
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,440
Sit.

527
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,360
The score is now two to zero.

528
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,800
Xingxin Team lost two games.

529
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
If they lose another game,

530
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,920
they'll probably be eliminated.

531
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,920
It's all right.

532
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Let's just do our best.

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
You can leave it to the team.

534
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,920
Welcome Ye Qiu fron Xing Xin Team.

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Don't worry.

536
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,920
We'll win.

537
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,040
And welcome Zhang Yiwei

538
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,760
from Miracle Team.

539
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:31,280
Miracle, Miracle, Miracle.

540
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,400
Come on!

541
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Boss is the best.

542
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,320
# I am as always #

543
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,480
It's two to zero.

544
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
They must have broken down.

545
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,240
Let's go and take them down.

546
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
Good. Go for it, captain.

547
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,240
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

548
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,240
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

549
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,080
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

550
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

551
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,200
# We go through deep and down. #

552
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,400
# We stand at the starry summit. #

553
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,480
It's been half a year, the master returns to the stage.

554
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,920
Whether he can become stronger

555
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,840
is a topic of great concern to the public.

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,760
Whether he's getting stronger remains to be seen.

557
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,960
But one thing hasn't changed

558
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,040
in nine years.

559
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,000
The master hasn't shown his face so far.

560
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah.

561
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:35,960
Dad.

562
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,040
The game starts at three o'clock.

563
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,600
Are you coming?

564
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,280
After you get off the plane,

565
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,320
Take a taxi to the gate two of the venue.

566
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,080
Come in and turn left.

567
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,720
Take the first entrance into the auditorium.

568
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,240
Third row in the middle, second seat to the left.

569
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,360
That's for you.

570
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,200
# Let me have a short break #

571
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,160
# The snow is heavy #

572
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,040
# I believe after frustration #

573
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,600
# One day my courage will create miracle #

574
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,480
He finally starts

575
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,520
to be himself.

576
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
He finally started to be himself.

577
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,560
# We will go together and shake the world #

578
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,680
# We will go together to the legend #

579
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Such a wasting of time.

580
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,560
When will you guys grow up?

581
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,480
We agreed to become

582
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,960
professional players together.

583
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,000
You want to  be a professional player by playing computer?

584
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,760
Haven't you recognize reality?

585
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,600
I don't know if I'll regret it in the future.

586
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,440
But now

587
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I want to try my best.

588
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Stay as my son,

589
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,800
or never come back.

590
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,960
From now on, you have nothing to do with this family.

591
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,400
I hope you can come and see my game.

592
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,200
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

593
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,280
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

594
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,160
# We go through deep and down. #

595
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,600
# We stand at the starry summit. #

596
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,960
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

597
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,400
# I have always been my own hero. #

598
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,120
Xing Xin versus Miracle.

599
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,400
The third round of Individual Event.

600
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,840
The game will begin soon.

601
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,360
OK. We are now looking at

602
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,880
the captain of Miracle Team,

603
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
ace player Zhang Yiwei.

604
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,840
Zhang Yiwei is well known as

605
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,240
the first operator of Sharpshooter, Cloud Piercer.

606
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,040
He has always been known for his quick response.

607
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,360
But today he is fighting to God of Fights.

608
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
And Ye Qiu uses Freelancer.

609
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,440
As the first time in a formal competition,

610
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,400
Freelancer includes twenty-four

611
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,600
full professional skills in one of Glory.

612
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
The skills are complicated.

613
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,680
The operator needs to know

614
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,560
every occupation very well.

615
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,160
And skills need to be switched to

616
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
the corresponding occupational weapons,

617
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,840
hence the speed requirement is also very high.

618
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,240
OK.

619
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,760
Let's take a look at what surprises

620
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Master Ye Qiu can bring to us.

621
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,280
Slide and Scoop. Jun Moxiao jumped and dodged.

622
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,400
Random Firing.

623
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
Freelancer has a fatal flaw.

624
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,560
Freelancer doesn't have high injury ultimate.

625
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,160
DPS is no match

626
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,800
for a regular career.

627
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
It's easy to deal with you.

628
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,240
I ignore your DPS of small skills,

629
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,040
and then hit back with high DPS skills,

630
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,800
It won't be long before the difference

631
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
of our HP becomes apparent.

632
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,480
See? you're really fragile.

633
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,320
Jun Moxiao vanished

634
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,760
in Raging Flames' field of vision.

635
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,720
Where is he?

636
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,520
I hit him.

637
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,400
Is this a free fight?

638
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,320
Freelancer has twenty four occupations,

639
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
totally 120 basic skills.

640
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,320
Jun Moxiao integrates all skills across all occupations perfectly

641
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,960
relies on a thousand-machine umbrella.

642
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,800
In other words,

643
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Jun Moxiao's skill

644
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,440
will never stop.

645
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,960
That's amazing.

646
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,480
Last hit.

647
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,760
Freelancer Jun Moxiao's infinite combos

648
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,920
killed Raging Flames.

649
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,160
The winner is Ye Qiu.

650
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,080
He won.

651
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,440
Master Ye Qiu returned to the Glory stage with Freelancer.

652
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,560
A thousand-machine umbrella and Freelancer

653
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,760
also opens up a new era of Glory.

654
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
This is the real Master Ye Qiu.

655
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,360
A real King's Avatar.

656
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Congratulations to Ye Qiu.

657
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,600
Congratulations to Xing Xin

658
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
with one point.

659
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,400
The Individual Event is over.

660
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,160
The points of Xing Xin and Miracle is one to two.

661
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Let's cheer together.

662
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,960
We won. What are you doing?

663
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,120
Come on, come on.

664
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
Don't think that we're the only two people,

665
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,840
and we don't have the momentum.

666
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,080
Together, we can cover the whole age group.

667
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,200
Come on! Let's cheer together.

668
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Let the master hear us.

669
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
Don't think you're too old

670
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,200
to be passionate.

671
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,800
Glory is your time machine.

672
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,880
Go back to your youth,

673
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,960
uncle.

674
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,520
September 5th.

675
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,440
Guang won the game.
