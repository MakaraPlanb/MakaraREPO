3
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,210
You're using my scarf as a rag?!

4
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,130
A ragged, patched one

5
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,210
that should be recycled.

6
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,410
Isn't that the right one?

7
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,210
You really pissed me off!

8
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,770
The scarf is very expensive!

9
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,610
Where's the other half?

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,490
What have you even done

11
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,850
for this net cafe?

12
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,970
You couldn't change the bulb!

13
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,330
You had to be taught how to be a cashier!

14
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm so pissed off!

15
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,250
You are really use...

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,410
Less.

17
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,770
You must win a person's heart

18
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,690
to keep this person.

19
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,690
How to win the heart?

20
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,090
Two words.

21
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,930
spoil him.

22
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,650
Use...ful!

23
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,970
Superman!

24
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,890
Master!

25
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,730
Master, having you in my Xing Xin net cafe

26
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,850
is a destined blessing derived from my previous eight lives!

27
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,610
Sorry for my bad temper. This scarf,

28
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,530
I don't need it anymore!

29
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,730
I'll buy another one next time.

30
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,930
In Spring Festival,

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,570
we shouldn't be fighting each other.

32
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,130
Right, Master?

33
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,010
- Are you comfortable? - So I'll continue.

34
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,050
What?

35
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,250
You shouldn't be doing this kind of

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,890
dirty work, menial work.

37
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,810
I'll do it!

38
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,610
Boss, leave the dirty work to me.

39
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,050
Let me do it!

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,530
We shouldn't be fighting each other.

41
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,410
Just let me do it!

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,370
Alright, alright.

43
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,210
Take this bank card.

44
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,570
Go buy a new set of clothing.

45
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,530
Wearing new clothes

46
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,610
will bring you the best of luck in the new year!

47
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,450
It dropped. Let me pick it up for you.

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,450
Take it. Go, go.

49
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,050
I'm not short of clothes.

50
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,330
Please use it to buy a scarf.

51
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,290
Stop there!

52
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,090
Go buy a new set, please.

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,930
You always switch back and forth between a few sets.

54
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,810
I'm so sick of it.

55
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,330
Take it!

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,570
This is an order.

57
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,730
Just go, go, go.

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,090
Shh, shh.

59
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,490
Just go, go, go.

60
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,650
Go, move!

61
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,090
Guoguo, happy New Year!

62
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,530
Tang, happy New Year!

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,490
You don't look happy though. What happened?

64
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,050
Did Ye Xiu piss you off again?

65
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,770
So you've found out.

66
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,010
I couldn't hold back

67
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,130
my temper a moment ago

68
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,650
and said some hurtful things to him.

69
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,970
As a result, up to now he has not come back.

70
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,290
Tang, do you think that

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,490
he would leave for good?

72
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,290
Normal people would probably do that.

73
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,050
But when it comes to him...

74
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't think so.

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,290
Masters are always so unpredictable.

76
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,456
The more out of line his behavior is,

77
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:55,170
the more like a master he seems.

78
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,290
So don't get mad under any circumstances

79
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,650
and tolerate his every action.

80
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,090
So you're back?

81
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,490
You even got your hair done!

82
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,650
Don't be shy.

83
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,450
There's no one else here.

84
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,250
Ye Xiu!

85
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,250
What brand of suit

86
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,810
are you wearing?

87
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,890
This wouldn't be

88
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,770
from the Italian handmade clothing brand by any chance?

89
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,210
I've only had the courage

90
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,330
to go window shopping there.

91
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,330
But now you just bought them and wore them home?

92
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,130
Considering my net worth,

93
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,690
wasn't it only fair that I spent so much money?

94
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,810
You are really driving me nuts!

95
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,570
Don't get mad under any circumstances

96
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,090
and tolerate his every action.

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,650
Never mind.

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,250
You should wear this style more often.

99
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,370
It makes you look really dignified.

100
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,090
Uh, well... The light bulb went out!

101
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,450
Please fix it!

102
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,530
Master...

103
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,130
I'm sorry, Master.

104
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,610
Do you want to change clothes?

105
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,236
Such expensive clothes are really difficult to clean

106
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:38,850
when they get dirty.

107
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,210
These are mere worldly possessions!

108
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,210
Please continue. Please continue.

109
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,210
It doesn't matter.

110
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,850
Awesome! Awesome!

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,890
Sure enough, changing clothes

112
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,770
makes you a different person.

113
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,130
Totally different from who you used to be!

114
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,210
Who I used to be?

115
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,850
Yep!

116
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,210
When you first came here,

117
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,130
you couldn't do anything.

118
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,050
You had to look up a guide

119
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,370
for changing a light bulb.

120
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,730
Customers made complaints against you three times day,

121
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,210
more punctual than the way I had three meals a day.

122
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,610
Master,

123
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,250
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

124
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,810
I was actually complimenting you!

125
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,330
It seems that I got too many things.

126
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,090
Maybe I should ask for help.

127
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,130
Miss,

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,570
our store provides home delivery

129
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,490
service within five kilometers.

130
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,970
Really?

131
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,690
Of course!

132
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,890
Please help me!

133
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,290
Okay!

134
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,050
Thank you!

135
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,650
Mucheng! We're in big trouble!

136
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,010
What happened?

137
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,970
Why are you in such a rush?

138
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,410
There's something wrong with Ye Xiu.

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,250
What's wrong with him?

140
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,690
He went out

141
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,930
and bought a suit in the morning.

142
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,010
When he came back,

143
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,170
he became a different person,

144
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,450
dressed like a rich guy

145
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,930
and speaking in a pretentious manner.

146
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,010
Do you think...

147
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,330
he has a second personality?

148
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,370
I didn't know that!

149
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,690
Then what happened?

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,610
Then...

151
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,930
Then he started to drop things!

152
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,650
He just kept...

153
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,970
breaking all kinds of things.

154
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,930
He kept breaking things!

155
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,410
Could he be thinking about flying away

156
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,490
now that he's full-fledged?

157
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,570
Boss, which of the two packs of chocolates

158
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,090
do you think is better?

159
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,450
They look the same!

160
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,890
How could there be any difference?

161
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,130
Even though the packagings look the same,

162
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,770
how do you know which one is liqueur chocolate

163
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,290
and which one is nut chocolate?

164
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,050
Forget it. When we go home and remove the packagings,

165
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,170
we will be able to know.

166
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,690
Boss, let's go!

167
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,330
Check, please.

168
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,450
Okay.

169
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,330
Maybe I should buy a watermelon for him to drop.

170
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,170
Boss, please help me grab another coffee.

171
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,770
I don't drink coffee.

172
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,690
Even if you don't drink it, someone else would drink it.

173
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,730
Alright, let's go!

174
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,170
Still unwilling to give up?

175
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,410
Did you bring

176
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,090
what I wanted?

177
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,570
You probably didn't bring

178
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,810
what I wanted, either.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
=Citizen Identity Card=

180
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,530
You should thank me for letting you borrow my stuff.

181
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,850
You didn't abuse Little Dot, did you?

182
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,050
He eats better than you,

183
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,850
sleeps more than you.

184
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,199
When it's time to take him to exercise,

185
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,850
rain or shine, I never slack off.

186
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,520
When it's time for him to making friends,

187
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,330
I post on every platform for him.

188
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,810
Comparing the lives of you two,

189
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,570
he's been living in heaven

190
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,770
while you've been

191
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,730
living in hell.

192
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,010
The same examples every time.

193
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,570
Can you at least be a bit more creative?

194
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,770
In a word,

195
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,210
when will you come back home?

196
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:34,970
It depends.

197
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,850
I'll see you again when I have time.

198
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,490
And exactly when will that be?

199
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,970
At least,

200
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,970
give me three years.

201
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,090
There you go again.

202
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,490
It's been 10 years since you last came back home.

203
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,690
Why don't you try being a little bit nicer to me?

204
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,650
I'm your older brother, for god's sake.

205
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,770
You're only my brother when we're at home.

206
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,330
Here,

207
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,650
you are just a loser who looks

208
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,730
a lot like me.

209
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,890
Boss, so you were with Mucheng.

210
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,290
He smiled at me!

211
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,570
Look at him!

212
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,930
He even changed his clothes!

213
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,130
Do you think it means that he has decided not to leave?

214
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,810
Are you having a fever?

215
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,130
You are having a fever!

216
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,130
I'm not having a fever.

217
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,410
Please talk some sense into him for me.

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,490
Look at what he's like now.

219
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,050
He wouldn't survive going out in the world alone!

220
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,090
If he stayed at Xing Xin net cafe,

221
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,290
at least I would take care of him.

222
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,810
Come on, give it to me.

223
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,370
Go talk to him! Now!

224
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,450
The guy's moods are really erratic.

225
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,983
One second he's showing a poker face,

226
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:26,970
the next second he's smiling.

227
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,490
He's a grown-up man.

228
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,730
But he still needs me to indulge him.

229
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,890
The man has no conscience!

230
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,770
Were you just bad-mouthing me?

231
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,370
I wasn't!

232
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,770
I really wasn't bad-mouthing you!

233
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,530
I have this problem, I've got a stinky mouth.

234
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,930
But my heart is still very kind.

235
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,170
For real.

236
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,176
I liked it when you were bad-mouthing me!

237
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,210
Do you have more vulgar words?

238
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,810
Boss.

239
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,810
What are you doing?

240
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,330
Boss?

241
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,250
Holy cow!

242
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,330
What is happening here?

243
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,490
It wouldn't be the Shadow...

244
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,050
Clone Jutsu?

245
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,250
Ye Qiu.

246
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,970
As I told you,

247
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,610
someone else would drink this cup of coffee.

248
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,210
Isn't the setting of twin brothers

249
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,410
a bit too much?

250
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,810
I mean, are you really...

251
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,810
Are you really Ye Xiu?

252
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,610
I've always been.

253
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,050
So the one in a suit...

254
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,730
is Ye Qiu?

255
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,490
He stole my name to swindle and bluff.

256
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,170
It was outrageous!

257
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,890
I used to imagine that you must be

258
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,370
a kind-hearted girl.

259
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,730
But only when I met you

260
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,930
did I realize that

261
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,010
beauty and kindness coexist in you.

262
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,290
Tell me, did you come here

263
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,130
in another attempt to take him home?

264
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,090
No!

265
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,450
I came here to see if my brother needs my help.

266
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,570
Alright.

267
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,650
Even if he went on to use the 18 kinds of wushu weapons,

268
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,370
trying to tie or bind you up,

269
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,970
you would never leave,

270
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,090
right?

271
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,450
If he was really that powerful,

272
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,370
he wouldn't have needed to wait this long.

273
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,650
I knew that

274
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,650
he must have caused a lot of trouble out here.

275
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,210
So I came here to help him deal with it.

276
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,490
Confident as he sounds,

277
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,250
he'll be the one who gets dealt with in the end.

278
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,090
My brother must have suffered a lot out here.

279
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,810
I've been worried about him.

280
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,370
My brother hates to stay at home.

281
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,170
So he wants me to take his place.

282
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,450
I've been taking care of my brother since our childhood.

283
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,450
I've been playing tricks on my brother since our childhood.

284
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,570
He tried to ask a girl out in junior high school.

285
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,050
But a few days after the girl agreed to date him,

286
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,250
he broke up with her.

287
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,850
Then, you know what,

288
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,890
I was the one who saved the day!

289
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,730
What's with that smirk?

290
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,330
But the way I remember it,

291
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,170
it was you who tried to ask the girl out.

292
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,010
I pretended to be him to break up with his girlfriend.

293
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,250
His girlfriend couldn't tell me and my brother apart

294
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,530
and agreed in the end.

295
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,090
Just for that, my dad

296
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,010
rewarded me with a game console.

297
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,250
What else could I do?

298
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,130
I could only choose to forgive him!

299
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,690
What else could he do other than reconciling with me?

300
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,410
He was not as good an actor as me,

301
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,290
not as good a fighter as me.

302
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,010
Now I just hope that my brother

303
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,090
can live a better life.

304
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,810
That way I'll be relieved.

305
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,850
Your brother is doing very well now.

306
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,050
Even though he has retired,

307
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,130
the net cafe owner

308
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,010
has been helping your brother to build a new team.

309
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,370
A new team?

310
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,250
No wonder he didn't want to go home.

311
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,690
I mean, I need to go thank her.

312
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,650
Boss, what's most needed for our team?

313
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,050
Of course it's this(money).

314
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,130
So prepare to welcome the god of wealth.

315
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,570
Hold on.

316
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,290
So you're saying that you'd like to inves...

317
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,890
inves... what?

318
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,010
Invest in your net cafe.

319
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,170
Either acquisition or shareholding.

320
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,970
Choose a way you like.

321
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,170
Stop kidding me, President Ye!

322
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,210
This is just a tiny, shabby bar counter.

323
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,650
Not a negotiating table!

324
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,650
Miss,

325
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,090
I'm very serious about partnering with you.

326
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,490
Look at you!

327
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,410
Your president vibes are leaking out again!

328
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,330
You... Can't you just contain your vibes

329
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,330
and try to fit in with the lives of us common people?

330
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,610
President Ye, what's the point of an acquisition?

331
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,410
I don't even have valuable stuff here.

332
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,130
Only more than 100 shabby computers.

333
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,690
Come on, please drink some water.

334
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,610
The intangible assets

335
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,890
are of great value though.

336
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,970
Intangible assets?

337
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,450
Are... Are you talking about me?

338
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,699
As a president,

339
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,810
you really have a special way of complimenting people,

340
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,130
using all those technical terms.

341
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,730
I was talking about your team!

342
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,570
When you succeed,

343
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,610
the name of Xing Xin

344
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,570
will be of immeasurable value.

345
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,211
I decided to invest

346
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,330
because of the bright future of your net cafe,

347
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,610
not because of the 100 computers!

348
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,290
Miss Chen.

349
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,130
Are you really going to invest?

350
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,730
Of course.

351
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,410
But before we make the deal,

352
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,330
you have to promise me one small thing.

353
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,850
You are about to be my shareholder,

354
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,650
there's nothing we can't talk about.

355
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,570
Please go ahead.

356
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,410
It's about my brother.

357
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,570
Can you let go?

358
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,370
Let go?

359
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,530
Are you asking me to fire your brother?

360
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,570
This... This is a bit too much...

361
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,490
I'll see what I can do to give you

362
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,130
any compensation you want.

363
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,370
I don't want a huge amount of compensation.

364
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,770
It's just that you know your brother has stinky hands

365
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,210
that would break everything they touch.

366
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,130
I'm telling you,

367
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,130
in the few months since he came in here,

368
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,490
the value of the things he broke

369
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,159
could almost catch up with

370
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,250
the profits of the net cafe for half a year.

371
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,770
Okay, give me a price.

372
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,410
I'll pay exactly the amount.

373
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,650
I can't let you do that!

374
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,330
Is this amount enough?

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
=One million yuan=

376
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,610
Enough. More than enough!

377
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,610
You're being too generous.

378
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,850
Are you really that desperate to take your brother home?

379
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,490
I was acting

380
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,130
under my dad's order coming here.

381
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,290
So I really can't go home empty-handed.

382
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,090
I understand how you've been feeling.

383
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,650
But there is something

384
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,250
you may not know very well.

385
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,810
Your brother has become

386
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,730
kinda like a legend in Glory.

387
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,490
To say that he's able to rally multitudes with one call

388
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,330
would not be an overstatement.

389
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,250
Every one in the guild is his fan,

390
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,210
including the several super rich guys

391
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,970
who have been fighting to hire him.

392
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,210
So, President Ye,

393
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,610
it's not enough just to win me over.

394
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,130
You need to find a way to disband the guild.

395
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,970
Forget it, forget it.

396
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,850
It's not really my place to tell you these things.

397
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,370
I'm already your boss now.

398
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,890
Just tell me.

399
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,130
Alright! So I'm telling you,

400
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,890
the account card of our guild is kept in his room.

401
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,610
Hey...

402
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,850
What are you doing here?

403
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,650
What's up?

404
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,890
If you are interested in Glory,

405
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,130
I can help you sign up for an account.

406
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,370
But

407
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,730
that book is too difficult for you.

408
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,490
I have a better introductory textbook.

409
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,130
No need.

410
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,810
Alright.

411
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,290
After all, you've got to learn how to play Glory by yourself.

412
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,650
Do you know that Glory implements a one-person-one-card policy?

413
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,570
So,

414
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,370
the account card is the player's lifeline.

415
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,410
Some day when you really get an account,

416
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,570
do remember to put the account card in a safe place,

417
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,450
preferably a place that no one else can reach.

418
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,610
Gotta go.

419
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,050
A place that no one else can reach?

420
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,410
A place...

421
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,290
A place...

422
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,370
President Ye, what are you doing up there?

423
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,970
I've got nothing else to do.

424
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,450
So I'm checking the hygiene here.

425
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,970
Too dirty.

426
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,450
Alright.

427
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,530
There is a box of drinks under the bed.

428
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,570
Could you please carry it downstairs?

429
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,490
It's so heavy that I couldn't move it myself.

430
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,890
Drinks?

431
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,450
But I didn't see any drinks under the bed?

432
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,130
Just take another look, take another look.

433
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,610
Thank you!

434
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,170
There're no drinks?

435
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,770
Got it!

436
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,170
It hurts.

437
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,890
I didn't expect him to be so popular.

438
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,810
Master, you went online at last!

439
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,850
I have something to talk to you about.

440
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,090
Recently, the guild has recruited too many people.

441
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,970
The old members are constantly at odds with the newcomers.

442
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,330
So should we take some countermeasures

443
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,210
to reassure everyone?

444
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,450
The question is exactly what I needed!

445
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,890
Great timing!

446
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,050
Surely it's necessary!

447
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,610
From the perspective of management,

448
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,610
the biggest problem facing the Xing Xin Guild

449
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,050
is the uneven distribution of skill points among members

450
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,530
resulting in a tilt in the final distribution.

451
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,770
Master,

452
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,410
why are you suddenly speaking in a serious tone?

453
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,210
Seems that I have to use a cuter tone.

454
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,490
To solve this problem, you'll have to start with the root cause~

455
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,290
So... uh...

456
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,010
What do you mean exactly?

457
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,130
Disband the guild first.

458
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,690
When the opportunity comes,

459
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,741
recruit another batch of members

460
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:49,850
whose abilities are relatively more stable.

461
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,330
But...

462
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,970
If we disband the guild that has just been created,

463
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,250
we won't able to gain a foothold in the 10th District again!

464
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,610
I'll take responsibility for the consequences.

465
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,810
Anyway, disband first.

466
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,050
Don't keep any one.

467
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,970
If you have any doubt, we'll talk about it later.

468
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,330
But... But at least we should give out some red packets?

469
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,170
Otherwise, the group chat will be a mess!

470
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,210
Alright, give me an amount.

471
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,690
I will transfer the money to you now.

472
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,210
Okay! I'm disbanding right now!

473
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,810
The den has been destroyed.

474
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,690
You can no longer be the thief-in-chief in Glory!

475
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,490
=The Xing Xin Guild you were in has been disbanded.=

476
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,330
This time, I will definitely take you home.

477
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,290
From this moment on,

478
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,530
everything will come to an end.

479
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,490
What?

480
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,450
Have you given up?

481
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,610
You know I'm not that kind of person.

482
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,130
Who do you think will

483
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,370
appear on a poster here in the future?

484
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,210
It's really hard to say.

485
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,330
But I'm sure that

486
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,010
this would be the last time you came here.

487
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,690
You're right.

488
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,330
Even if I want to come here,

489
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,610
I'm afraid I won't even be able to get the opportunity.

490
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,130
Opportunities are always available,

491
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,130
as long as you are willing to contribute.

492
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,610
Why aren't you carrying a box?

493
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,770
Judging from your alcohol tolerance,

494
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,650
these are already enough.

495
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,436
This is the first time

496
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:41,930
I get to spend the New Year's Eve with others.

497
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,090
Cheers!

498
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,810
Cheers!

499
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,730
Big fortune and great profit!

500
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,530
Happy Spring Festival!

501
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,650
Peace all year round!

502
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,530
Go home soon!

503
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,850
Happy New Year!

504
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,610
Come on, here's to you!

505
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,250
Thank you for being so generous,

506
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,050
enabling our team to enjoy a fantastic Spring Festival!

507
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,650
What do you mean?

508
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,930
You were telling me to welcome the god of wealth.

509
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,850
What exactly should I do?

510
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,210
The easiest way to trick a rich heir

511
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,810
is to talk to them about money.

512
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,570
Your brother is really bad at finding stuff.

513
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,050
Didn't you tell us he's smart?

514
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,170
I may need to go in to drop a hint.

515
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,490
Okay.

516
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,450
Take it.

517
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:35,930
How is it going?

518
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,050
President Ye, there is a box of drinks under the bed.

519
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,330
Could you please carry it downstairs?

520
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,930
Got it!

521
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,850
So,

522
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,490
you guys have been playing me from the beginning.

523
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,810
You had delivered yourself to our doorsteps.

524
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,130
How could we turn you down?

525
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,210
You were the mastermind behind it all, right?

526
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,250
Ye Xiu... Ye Xiu.

527
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,930
You're really...

528
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,970
So he's...

529
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,170
drunk?

530
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,970
It would only take one glass.

531
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,770
He was like this ten years ago.

532
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,330
Still the same ten years after.

533
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,330
Are you okay?

534
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,930
Everyone's exhausted

535
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,130
after a day's work.

536
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,290
Let me carry... carry this guy away.

537
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,610
- You two, please rest early. - The coat!

538
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,010
They sure have the same genes!

539
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,530
Turns out he's as weak as his brother.

540
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,530
Happy New Year!

541
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,650
Childish!

542
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,370
You need to keep your innocence

543
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,450
to be happy every day!

544
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,930
Lunar New Year's Day! Big fortune and great profit!

545
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,330
Come on, ask for some good luck!

546
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,370
Here, a red packet for you!

547
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,650
Childish.

548
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,570
I've always been the one to give red packets to others.

549
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,610
That's your rule!

550
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,730
Now you're at my place.

551
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm the one to call the shots.

552
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,890
There is a world of difference between you and your brother.

553
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,290
Your brother never hesitated to grab a red packet!

554
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,450
Here you are, Mucheng! This one is for you!

555
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,850
Thank you, Boss!

556
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,290
Boss, may a river of gold flow into your pocket.

557
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,170
Good luck with your business!

558
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,290
Seems that this place...

559
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,410
May you have today's glory forever!

560
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,890
...is not as bad as I thought.

561
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,250
What's that?

562
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,570
It's from your brother.

563
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,730
Another trick?

564
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,130
It's a gift that he deliberately prepared for you.

565
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,410
Since when has he become so cheesy?

566
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,130
Do you think you're the only person that has changed?

567
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,970
Over the years, he's changed a lot as well.

568
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,050
Except for his alcohol tolerance.

569
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,210
You were not drunk last night.

570
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,250
Right?

571
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,610
He has been away from home for so long.

572
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,250
Still thinking that it would only take

573
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,610
one glass for me to get drunk?

574
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,490
So you pretended to be drunk

575
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,970
to save him from the embarrassment

576
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,050
so that everybody could enjoy a happy New Year's Eve.

577
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,970
I'm not as noble as you thought.

578
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,610
You guys outnumbered me.

579
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,490
Those who suit their actions to the time are wise.

580
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,556
You're just being stubborn and reluctant to

581
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:14,890
admit you care about him!

582
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,210
Where is he?

583
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,930
Not even going to see me off?

584
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,162
Your brother...

585
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:24,690
is fixing the water pipes on the rooftop right now.

586
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,290
Are you sure you're not

587
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,570
making everything worse?

588
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,130
What the hell are you doing?

589
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,370
Making everything worse.

590
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,330
Do you need me to do more, just to "make sure"?

591
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,290
Alright.

592
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,850
An eye for eye,

593
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,250
a tooth for tooth.

594
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,730
Let's put an end to all the resentment in the past ten years.

595
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,530
Brat, do you think I would be afraid of you?

596
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,010
You threw away your comfortable life at home

597
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,130
and ended up here doing all the hard work.

598
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,650
You're really a man of integrity.

599
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,650
I did all that to leave Father to you.

600
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,450
Don't make my efforts go to waste.

601
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,610
Your efforts to trick me?

602
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,490
Thank you, you've worked hard!

603
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,410
I'd also like to thank you

604
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,050
for working so hard to fall into my tricks!

605
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,930
If it hadn't been for your tricks,

606
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,810
I wouldn't have ended up like this!

607
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,650
Like what? I only got your clothes wet.

608
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,570
There is a dryer in our net cafe.

609
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,330
Stop playing dumb. I was talking about that time when

610
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,850
you stole my opportunity to go to the summer camp!

611
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,250
You? Save it!

612
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,338
A person who decided to go to the summer camp

613
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,050
because of a Transformer toy

614
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:37,730
would only let the opportunity go to waste anyway.

615
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,290
Just stay at home and be a president.

616
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,730
I can't take it anymore!

617
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,410
If you don't let me play with the Transformer toy,

618
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,210
I'm not staying here any longer.

619
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,290
I am going to the summer camp!

620
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,050
What are you doing here?

621
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,170
Are you packing things up?

622
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,250
Where are you going?

623
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,450
To attend a school event?

624
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,570
Our teacher just informed us to go to the training.

625
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,530
Mr. Wang informed you, right?

626
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,050
That's right! Mr. Wang!

627
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,730
That doesn't make sense though.

628
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,090
Mr. Wang who had already resigned

629
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,370
informed you to go to the training?

630
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,730
Brother, these are all your favorite things,

631
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,930
and the money you saved up.

632
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,730
Are you really giving them to me?

633
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,130
Of course!

634
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,810
You're my only brother.

635
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,650
If not you, who else?

636
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,490
Ye Qiu, please come downstairs.

637
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,610
Go ahead.

638
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,450
I'll help you with it.

639
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,650
Son, come here.

640
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,250
Dad.

641
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,010
Stop being upset.

642
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,930
Forget about the broken Transformer toy.

643
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,170
Dad got you a new gift.

644
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,130
Thank you, Dad.

645
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,890
You like watching foreign movies, right?

646
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,730
So you've got to learn English well,

647
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,450
right?

648
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,130
That's right.

649
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,410
Brother?

650
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
=So you have prepared a lot of things. =
=I will go to the training for you. =
=Don't try to catch up with me. Don't miss me.=
= by Your Brother=

651
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,650
Oh, no.

652
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,650
Damn it, give my luggage back to me!

653
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,650
If I wanted to leave home because of the Transformer toy,

654
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,810
you were no better than me!

655
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,770
You left because you wanted to play Glory.

656
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,810
I'm not your average gamer.

657
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,890
I'm a professional. Understand?

658
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:00,970
I don't understand.

659
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,610
So, all a president does is count money.

660
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,650
You don't study at all?

661
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,410
But you have already retired

662
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,250
Retirement doesn't mean anything.

663
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,690
Just that I need to start all over again.

664
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,090
The sportsman's mentality. Understand?

665
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,194
But how are you going to start all over again?

666
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:21,690
By building a team?

667
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:24,810
Yes.

668
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,490
It's not that easy to build a team!

669
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,330
Is it easy to be a president?

670
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,090
You know what I mean.

671
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,130
It's not like the old days anymore.

672
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,290
The esports industry has been completely commercialized.

673
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,090
If you want to build a team,

674
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,330
the funds, resources, and contacts

675
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,810
are all indispensable.

676
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,010
Are you really prepared for what's coming?

677
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,530
Plus,

678
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,290
it's not only about you.

679
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,130
Like it or not,

680
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,170
it's going to impact many other people's lives.

681
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,450
You can't just hold onto your own dream.

682
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,850
You'll also have to consider a lot of problems in the real world!

683
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,770
I know.

684
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,170
For you. Remember to wear them.

685
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,770
Alright.

686
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,490
I've said all there is to be said about it.

687
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,930
I'll keep this from our family for now.

688
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,770
But I have no control

689
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,290
over the future.

690
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,490
Having played it for so many years,

691
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,170
who can still be so passionate about a game?

692
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,610
Aren't you tired of it?

693
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,810
Glory,

694
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:11,958
I won't ever get tired of it

695
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:12,770
even if I play it for another ten years.

696
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,890
Gotta go.

697
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,010
Bye bye!

698
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,610
Drive.

699
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,450
Okay.

700
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,730
Finally, he's gone.

701
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,250
He's even more high maintenance than you.

702
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,970
Is my brother really high maintenance?

703
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,490
Hold on!

704
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,250
Are you Ye Qiu or Ye Xiu?

705
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,210
Qiuqiu.

706
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,930
Qiuqiu?

707
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,370
If you were Ye Qiu, I'd be Xiuxiu.

708
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,370
Are you trying to fool me?

709
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,410
Your IQ just went online.

710
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,930
Just buy me a new one, for god's sake.

711
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,850
What was the point of fixing this old shabby one?

712
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,570
=Come back to invest more next year=

713
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,250
Ye Xiu, you're still trying to play a trick on me?
