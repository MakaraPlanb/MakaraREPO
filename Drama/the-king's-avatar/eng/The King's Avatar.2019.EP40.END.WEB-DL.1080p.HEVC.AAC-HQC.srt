It's time for the decisive battle.

Kill Combat Form first.

6
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,587
Cheer up, Tang.

7
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:27,427
Come on, Xing Xin. Come on.

8
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:28,227
Hold on.

9
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:28,947
Hold on.

10
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:29,587
Leave them to me.

11
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:30,267
No need to hold on.

12
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:31,507
Fight immediately.

13
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,947
Do you know what you are talking about?

14
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:35,307
Our goal is to win this Challenge.

15
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,427
Instead of just winning this competition.

16
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:36,987
Do you know that?

17
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:39,627
Tang,

18
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:40,187
Run.

19
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,387
Now Han Yanrou only has

20
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,227
ten percent of HP.

21
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,387
Cold Hands only has

22
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:48,747
thirty percent of HP.

23
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:03,427
He hit them.

24
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,307
But Combat Form releases Destroying the World

25
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:06,347
at the very end.

26
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:07,507
Its DPS is too high.

27
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:13,947
Jun Moxiao wants to go to support them.

28
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:14,747
But it's too late.

29
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,347
The HP of Han Yanrou, Cold Hands and Combat Form

30
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,347
run out at the same time.

31
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:23,107
The two teams drew in the Team Competition.

32
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,067
Great. Well done.

33
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,027
But the total integral of Xing Xin

34
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:26,667
is still five-point lower than Jia Shi.

35
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,187
Even if Xing Xin gains the extra point by Ace,

36
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:31,307
They will still lose the game by one point.

37
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,307
That means

38
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,547
Jia Shi has secured the champion in advance.

39
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:40,907
The champion of this challenge has belonged to Jia Shi.

40
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:43,067
Are you sure you want to keep on?

41
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:43,747
Of course.

42
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:45,627
The competition isn't over.

43
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:48,907
But I think,

44
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,467
Ye Qiu won't give up in advance.

45
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:53,107
It has been more than the competition.

46
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,987
This battle is about glory.

47
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,067
Entertain the competition.

48
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:57,827
Even if...

49
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:00,867
This is the last one.

50
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:05,587
Now, Leaf of Autumn

51
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:06,947
And Jun Moxiao rush towards each other.

52
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,187
It is the battle between two God of fights

53
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,907
and also between two captains of Jia Shi of two generations.

54
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,507
Who can win the competition in the end?

55
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,227
Fight, boss.

56
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:37,787
Fight, boss.

57
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:38,867
Wipe them out. Kill them.

58
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,067
Fight, captain.

59
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:40,547
Wipe them out.

60
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,067
Fight.

61
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,027
Well done.

62
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:18,627
Great.

63
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:20,147
Jun Moxiao kills Leaf of Autumn.

64
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,707
Xiang Xin creates the miracle.

65
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,627
With the huge disadvantage in the team competition,

66
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,267
They score Ace over Jia Shi,

67
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:26,427
and win the competition

68
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,667
by fourteen to ten.

69
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,227
Xing Xin is the best,

70
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:29,907
Lao Ye is the best.

71
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:33,587
Xiang Xin, the best. Xiang Xin, the best.

72
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:34,587
What a pity.

73
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,147
Xiang Xin still fails in terms of the total integral.

74
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,787
Actually, when Han Yanrou lost the game,

75
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,587
Everyone in Xiang Xin clearly knows that

76
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,467
It is impossible to win the champion.

77
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:46,427
But they still,

78
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:47,987
show a brilliant ace.

87
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,827
although they score ace over Jia Shi,

88
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:39,627
they still lose to Jia Shi

89
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:40,587
by one point,

00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:41,507
Sharing the joy if we win.

Sharing the pain if we lose.

92
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,747
At the worst, we will accompany Xiang Xin to restart everything,

93
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:47,867
and wait one extra year.

94
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:50,787
Little Moon,

95
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,707
This is the best slogan you come up with tonight.

96
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:55,067
Xing Xin,

00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:56,147

112

How could that be?

113
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,347
Does he break the record?

114
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,427
The damage of Master Ye

115
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,987
breaks the four-year record of the league.

116
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,587
So they gain extra two points.

117
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:29,627
It overturns the result of the competition.

118
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,187
It is too incredible.

119
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:35,187

120
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,507

You chose the wrong name of the team.

140
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:47,827
It should be called Xing Xin.

141
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,787

143
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:08,427
I spent a pretty penny to introduce you into Jia Shi.

144
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:10,907
I let you use the account of the Master.

145
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,747
I gave you all the sources of the team.

146
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:15,587
And you just rewarded me in this way?

147
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,427
This is not a competition.

148
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,667
This is your last chance.

149
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,547
It's also the last chance of Jia Shi.

150
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,627
Nobody would invest money in Jia Shi

151
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,827
who even can't come back to the league.

152
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,747
The eight-year-old Jia Shi,

153
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,427
The eight-year-old Jia Shi,

154
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:33,427
It is ruined by you.

155
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,347
Glory is not a single-player game.

156
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,547
Everyone is responsible for the failure.

157
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:44,587
Including you, Mr. Tao.

158
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,227
Let's welcome Xing Xin Team.

159
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,107
Lao Ye, you are the best. The best.

160
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:11,627
Xing Xin is the best.

161
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:12,747
The best.

162
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,827
Please lift your championship trophy.

163
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,747
Ye Xiu and Jun Moxiao will always be with Xingxin.

164
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:33,747
Tang Rou, Han Yanrou will always be with Xingxin.

165
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,987
Bao Zi, the Invader will always be with Xingxin.

166
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,307
Qiao Yifan, Yi Cunhui will always be with Xingxin.

167
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,067
Xing Xin is bound to win.

168
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:39,987
Glory will never die out.

169
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,387
Challenge,

170
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,707
we are coming!

171
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,347
Do you regret to come to Jia Shi?

172
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:14,267
Do you regret?

173
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:17,827
As long as I can keep joining the competition,

174
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:18,867
There is nothing to regret.

175
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,187
Then see you in the competition of next year.

176
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,227
The damage of Master Ye

177
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:28,627
breaks the four-year record of the league.

178
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,667
The previous record holder is

179
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:32,627
Captain Han, right?

180
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,947
Someone breaks you record.

181
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:35,947
Anything you want to say?

182
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,987
Records are there to be broken.

183
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:40,827
That's why Glory

184
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,987
could create so many miracles.

185
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:44,187
Now to announce

186
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,802
the winner of this Challenge is

187
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:48,985
Xing Xin Team.

188
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,867
Please welcome Mr. Feng Xianjun

189
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,307
to award the registration certificate of the League

190
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,707
to Xing Xin Team.

191
00:11:58,187 --> 00:11:59,067
Welcome back.

192
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,587
The name in the certificate is right, isn't it?

193
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:03,867
How could it be wrong?

194
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:05,587
It is you that should be careful.

195
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,187
Don't write the wrong name afterwards.

196
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:10,867
Thank you.

197
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,574

# I am as always, #

199
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,637
=  Xing Xin Team, welcome to join the league. =

200
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:21,067
# Remain true to original aspiration #

201
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:23,747
At this moment,

202
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,627
I would like to ask you,

203
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,547
Master Ye,

204
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,227
Is there anything you want to say to everyone?

205
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,587
# Keep calm even though I have to leave #

206
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:39,267
# I am as always, #

207
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,227
Since today,

208
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,227
Sun Xiang will succeed you as captain.

209
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:44,907
The account of Leaf of Autumn

210
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,307
will also be handed over to him.

211
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:50,467
I choose to retire.

212
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:52,227
At the worst,

213
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:53,747
I will start from the beginning.

214
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:56,107
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

215
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:59,427
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

216
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,587
# We go through deep and down. #

217
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,707
# We stand at the starry summit. #

218
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:09,187
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

219
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,747
# I have always been my own hero. #

220
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:17,627
# I have seen the legend before. #

221
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:18,987
I am here to apply for a job.

222
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,987
Then why did you choose to retire?

223
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,507
Although I am a little old,

224
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:34,827
I don't want to give up.

225
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,387
Turn the glass into a vase.

226
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:37,787
Employ another way.

227
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:38,987
Start again.

228
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:40,387
Glory,

229
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,547
I can play it for another ten years without getting bored.

230
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,187
Xing Xin Team.

231
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:47,387
All the members are here.

232
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:50,227
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

233
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,187
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

234
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:53,587
Every unwilling departure

235
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,707
is for

236
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,387
the final return

237
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:00,987
I am back.

238
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,187
Let's congratulate Xing Xin Team

239
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,467
# I have always been my own hero. #

240
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:20,307
# I have seen the legend before. #

241
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:29,987
# I have seen the legend before. #

242
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,107
Don't stay here. Go dancing.

243
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,507
Go.

244
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,867
You don't stand here as well. Move.

245
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,027
Come. Have a drink.

246
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:09,587
Bye.

247
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,347
Living in the world,

248
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,987
Impossible to have no enemies.

249
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,427
Make you pass out with one bottle.

250
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,907
Make you pass out with two bottles.

251
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,547
Make you pass out with three bottles.

252
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,067
Make you pass out with one bottle.

253
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,587
Drink now.

254
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,827
Who says I will pass out with only one bottle of booze?

255
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,147
Can you do it?

256
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:30,987
Don't force yourself.

257
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,387
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

258
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:48,267
Are you alright? Amazing.

259
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:51,027
Three. Two. One.

260
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:54,187
This is not passing out with only one bottle of booze.

261
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,947
This is not passing out within three seconds.

262
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,707
Enjoy yourself to the full today.

263
00:15:58,227 --> 00:15:59,187
I come to drink with you.

264
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,187
Come. Have a drink.

265
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,107
Mo Fan.

266
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:06,227
Come.

267
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,467
It is not silence that chooses you.

268
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,027
It is you who choose silence.

269
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:11,987
No more words.

270
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:13,107
Here.

271
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:13,707
Cheers.

272
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:23,467
I should

273
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:24,947
have a drink with you.

274
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:37,347
There is something that

275
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:38,027
I always want to tell you.

276
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:43,547
Listen to me.

277
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:45,267
I only say it once.

278
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,947
He can't drink much too.

279
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,547
All the professional players get drunk easily.

280
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:00,587
No.

281
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:01,387
No.

282
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,147
Master once said before,

283
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,907
It is not that their capacity for liquor is poor.

284
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:07,107
In fact, they never dare to learn drinking.

285
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,667
Because under the influence of alcohol for long,

286
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,587
It will slow down their reaction speed.

287
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,707
It also affects the stability of the hands.

288
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:16,667
This is the real professional player.

289
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,667
This is so fake.

290
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:47,987
At this moment, I understand something all of a sudden.

291
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:49,827
About winning.

292
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,347
About champion.

293
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:53,187
About us.

294
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,027
I guess,

295
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,867
Everyone will

296
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,307
Meet such a group of lovable people in their life.

297
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,307
Our union is not to change each other.

298
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,547
But to become better

299
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,147
for each other.

300
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,507
The combination of you and me

301
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:14,307
creates us.

302
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:19,147
This is the thing to be proudest of.

303
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:22,267
Come here. Since the Night of Glory

304
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,307
when Master Ye declared to come back to the league,

305
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:24,907
every team feels that the pressure is on.

306
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,187
We are now going to interview

307
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,547
the preparations of every team.

308
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:30,867
Captain Jiexi, Captain Jiexi,

309
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,187
Do you have any pressure

310
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:33,187
after Master Ye comes back?

311
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,507
In terms of pressure,

312
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,907
Wei Cao doesn't feel anything.

313
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,187
I suggest you to interview

314
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,187
Lan Yu who was knocked out in the quarterfinals this summer.

315
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,067
Thank you.

316
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,067
Can you say anything else?

317
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,427
Yes. Please say something more.

318
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:45,627
Please say something more.

319
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:47,027
How about interviewing me?

320
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:47,667
I really cooperate with your interview.

321
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,307
I can tell you more than excepted.

322
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,067
Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

323
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:50,707
I just want to ask,

324
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:51,747
With the return of Master Ye,

325
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:52,947
Lan Ye doesn't adopt any

326
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:54,067
special solution, right?

327
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,307
We don't need any special training.

328
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,307
So definitely no.

329
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:56,827
Don't worry. Don't worry.

330
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:57,187
Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

331
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:57,827
Shaotian,

332
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:58,707
Have you prepared

333
00:18:58,707 --> 00:18:59,667
the featured videos for teaching?

334
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:02,827
I will send you

335
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:03,907
the secret address where Ambitions has their training.

336
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:11,467
Well, well,

337
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,067
Well,

338
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,227
I take the wrong road.

339
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:15,287
At last, let's pay attention to Jia Shi.

340
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,147
= Jia Shi is about to put itself up for sale. =
At last, let's pay attention to Jia Shi.

341
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,427
= Jia Shi is about to put itself up for sale. =
Since the failure of the Challenge,

342
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:20,477
= Jia Shi is about to put itself up for sale. =
Jia Shi has been keeping silent.

343
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:20,707
Jia Shi has been keeping silent.

344
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,427
Just now,

345
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,707
Jia shi posts a message on its homepage.

346
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:24,387
Since today,

347
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,227
Jia Shi has put itself up for sale.

348
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,147
Tao Xuan said,

349
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,707
Years of managing Jia Shi has worn him down.

350
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:30,827
He hopes that the successor

351
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,547
can lead Jia Shi to create glory again.

352
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,947
And he will always be the fan of Jia Shi.

353
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,187
Jia Shi is too big.

354
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:38,427
Other teams can't buy it on its own.

355
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,187
It may adopt divestiture.

356
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:41,467
The team,

357
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:42,067
The team members,

358
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:42,827
The roles,

359
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,827
All the team sources will

360
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,027
go into liquidation gradually.

361
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,267
So,

362
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:48,907
Jia Shi will disband.

363
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,147
I think only the weak team will come to this end.

364
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,227
I never thought that Jia Shi, the strong team in the past

365
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,267
should be reduced to this state.

366
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,227
E-sports teams are just like e-sports players.

367
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,307
It has it own golden period.

368
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,027
It will get old and out of date.

369
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,947
Many people only see

370
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,507
The glamour of those e-sports players.

371
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,707
But they ignore the cruelty behind the glory.

372
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,427
So,

373
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,427
There is no more Jia Shi afterwards?

374
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,427
Will Jia Shi really end like this?

375
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:14,507
The name of Jia Shi

376
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:15,987
Will disappear forever?

377
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,267
Jia Shi will not disappear.

378
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:18,787
Because I believe,

379
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,467
People who can inherit this spirit

380
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,587
Will definitely occur.

381
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:07,147
Mucheng,

382
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,267
Do you still remember that we were here

383
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,947
the day when I left Jia Shi?

384
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,267
That was when we came back

385
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,427
after finishing the last competition.

386
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,547
Your well-known quotes.

387
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:18,347
Only by releasing the proper skill at a proper moment

388
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,827
can you win the game.

389
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,147
But,

390
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:23,947
You don't say

391
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:24,827
What I should do after winning.

392
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:29,827
What can you do after winning?

393
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:32,587
Boasting.

394
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:33,787
Saying some harsh words.

395
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,707
Silly girl.

396
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:42,267
First,

397
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,347
don't scold anyone when reflecting on the competition tomorrow.

398
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:45,507
Second,

399
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:47,827
don't scold me if you have to.

400
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:48,907
Third,

401
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:50,747
even if you want to scold me,

402
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:51,747
no more than three sentences.

403
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:55,827
What about the forth one?

404
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,227
Forth,

405
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:01,907
I can't attend it tomorrow.

406
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,427
So even if you scold me,

407
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,307
I can't hear it.

408
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:05,507
Saying so many words,

409
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:06,707
Aren't you thirsty?

410
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:14,987
Thank you.

411
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:16,027
You are responsible for

412
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:17,507
pulling the ring for me.

413
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:23,547
Every time I passed the corridor in the past,

414
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,827
I could hear the sounds of mouses and keyboards.

415
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:30,587
It is so quiet right now.

416
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:34,987
I am a bit unaccustomed to it.

417
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:43,187
In fact, the life of the e-sports players is quite simple.

418
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,787
They spend most time on training.

419
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:48,467
And have few entertainment.

420
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,987
Aside from playing the game,

421
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:55,427
they spend almost

422
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,587
All the time and energy here in their life.

423
00:22:58,827 --> 00:22:59,987
We also spent

424
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,467
these years in this way.

425
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,027
So apart from the world of Glory,

426
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,147
this building

427
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:15,787
is the most familiar place to me.

428
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:23,507
In the past year, I have known that

429
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,027
at the end of this path,

430
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,187
I will leave Jia Shi.

431
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,027
But I never thought that

432
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,827
Jia Shi would be reduced into this situation,

433
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,227
when I am leaving.

434
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:48,267
It's so quiet.

435
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:01,387
Someone is playing Glory right now.

436
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:03,747
According to this speed of playing,

437
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:05,547
He is a little weak.

438
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,067
I am going to pack my stuff first.

439
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,267
Wait for me.

440
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,067
You are still so bad at playing Glory.

441
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,947
When did you begin to smoke cigar?

442
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,867
I always stayed with people smoking cigar.

443
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:05,347
After a long time,

444
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:08,307
I learn it naturally.

445
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,027
How about your selling?

446
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,067
The club is too big.

447
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,147
And we didn't achieve the qualification for the league.

448
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,387
It is the worst time

449
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,227
to sell this club.

450
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:31,787
But anyway,

451
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:33,467
someone has bought it.

452
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,267
He promises me that,

453
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:39,147
He would continue to use the name of Jia Shi.

454
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:42,707
So I've been very content.

455
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,067
After I sell this place,

456
00:25:46,507 --> 00:25:47,667
I am about to become a poor merchant

457
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,787
who has nothing but money.

458
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,387
Things I left in Glory are

459
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,667
only some failures.

460
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,267
Nobody can erase the honor

461
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:15,027
that are possessed by Jia Shi.

462
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,067
When I just played Glory,

463
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:22,707
I thought of our past all of a sudden.

464
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:27,227
Then I realized that I have been wrong all the time.

465
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:28,827
Glory,

466
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,587
Is indeed not a single-player game.

467
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:35,107
And Jia Shi,

468
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,307
Never belongs only to me.

469
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:42,667
We can also create

470
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,107
a new age.

471
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,027
Turn the Glory we know

472
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:47,787
into the real sports.

473
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,427
We should make this thing

474
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:52,067
become the glory of our life.

475
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,427
Glory,

476
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:09,827
I can never play it as well as

477
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,427
You and Muqiu do.

478
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,147
So at the time i thought,

479
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:16,267
Although I could not

480
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,347
Participate in the competition like you guys,

481
00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:19,707
I could be

482
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,507
A great manager of the team.

483
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:23,267
When you exerted your energy

484
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:23,987
Competed in the game,

485
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,747
I could provide a solid backing for you.

486
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:32,507
I always thought that

487
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:34,867
we three would be

488
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:38,827
the best partners.

489
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:46,267
Do you know that

490
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,107
I have had a thought for these years,

491
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:50,827
And it became increasingly stronger.

492
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:55,387
And you? You just competed in the game.

493
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,027
And never kept pace with me.

494
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:00,307
You refused to commercialization.

495
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:02,467
You didn't want to show in public.

496
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:05,067
So I was wondering

497
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:09,067
If you didn't hold me back,

498
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:14,507
What Jia Shi would be?

499
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:18,827
It must be better.

500
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:23,827
Maybe.

501
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:31,947
You are here to pick up Mucheng, right?

502
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,467
There is something.

503
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:40,907
Please help me give it to her.

504
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,427
Sun Xiang transfers the club

505
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:47,067
along with the account card of Leaf of Autumn.

506
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,387
It can't be gotten back.

507
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,307
I still keep the card of Dancing Rain.

508
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:55,027
Let Mucheng take it away.

509
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:13,827
If it is too expensive,

510
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:15,707
Xiang Xin can't afford it.

511
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,187
Senior,

512
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,067
What are you doing here?

513
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:24,067
Why not going to the reception room?

514
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:26,387
I go training first.

515
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:27,227
OK.

516
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:33,307
It's time for evening training.

517
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:35,387
Very punctual.

518
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:36,747
By the way,

519
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:39,867
No smoking in the training room.

520
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,507
OK. OK.

521
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:43,907
I see. I see.

522
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,147
Jia Shi,

523
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,107
does never only belongs to us.

524
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:22,547
Put it down. Move.

525
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:24,827
Put it a little down.

526
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,147
Move it to the right side a little bit.

527
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,067
I was once standing here,

528
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,667
watching the maple leaf rising high.

529
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:38,987
After another years,

530
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:41,547
maybe this place

531
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,027
will have a new beginning.

532
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:46,987
Right.

533
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,787
Luckily, somebody has prepared to take over Jia Shi.

534
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,347
So...

535
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,547
The glory of Jia Shi will not end.

536
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,867
# Walking to the glory from the adversity. #

537
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,867
Why did you want to establish the Glory league?

538
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:12,267
I knew nothing about e-sports nor Glory at that time.

539
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:16,147
But it didn't matter.

540
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:19,027
Because what touched me most was

541
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,467
never the Glory itself,

542
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,067
but young people like you

543
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,067
who always keep pursuing the glory.

544
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:34,067
# You are as always #

545
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,147
Glory,

546
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:38,787
is not that simple as you think.

547
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:45,067
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

548
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,047
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

549
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,107
= Xing Xin Team =
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

550
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,257
= Xing Xin Team =
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

551
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,387
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

552
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:54,307
# We are stronger when we used to be. #

553
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:56,147
Samsara, the champion of the ninth league,

554
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:56,947
is about to announce that

555
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,907
They will bring in Sun Xiang, the former ace member of Jia Shi,

556
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:01,067
and the role of Leaf of Autumn

557
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,587
at the cost of 12 million.

558
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,027
You all see that, right?

559
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,307
How powerful our future rivals could be.

560
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:13,667
Yes.

561
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,107
It has been hard enough to

562
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:16,427
take care of Zhou Zekai in Samsara.

563
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:17,627
Now they have Sun Xiang.

564
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:19,067
What should we do?

565
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:20,187
Enhance the training.

566
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:21,147
Simulate competitions.

567
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:23,707
Strengthen the team in the shortest time.

568
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,427
But before that,

569
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,107
there is still an important thing.

570
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:28,467
What?

571
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,347
The prize of the challenge is issued.

572
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:32,147
Boss,

573
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,547
Shall we share the money first?

574
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:39,747
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

575
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:43,747
# sailing with the wind and converge into the Milky Way #

576
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:45,307
Hey, Dad.

577
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,067
I am recruiting new members.

578
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,787
The dungeon of the Frost Forest?

579
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:50,987
I will send you later.

580
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,947
I can't form the team with you.

581
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:55,827
You are in the eleventh district,

582
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:56,987
while I'm in the tenth district.

583
00:32:58,387 --> 00:32:59,907
It's not about distance.

584
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,147
Different district means different times.

585
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:03,987
Come on.

586
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:08,187
Don't come here.

587
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:09,147
Mr. Ye,

588
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,387
Why not directly joining in Xing Xin

589
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:11,587
when we are recruiting new members?

590
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:13,547
Our slogan is don't worry that you can't learn it.

591
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:15,427
Don't worry about meals and accommodation.
