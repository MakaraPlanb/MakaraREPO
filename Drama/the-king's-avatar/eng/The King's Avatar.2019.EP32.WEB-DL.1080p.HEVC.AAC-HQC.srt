Sorry.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,040
I cheated.

Pulling out the cable,

and having phone calls with someone else.

These were all my fault.

9

You don't need to apologize to me.

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
We'd better have a talk rather than

11
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,480
waste time on apologizing and forgiving.

As for this cross of Cleric,

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,731
it can buff health point.

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
And this shinobigatana,

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,760
it has no special attribute,

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
but it was self-made by our team.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,560
If it's possible,

25
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,560
I hope it can be free from dismantling.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,640
Now our silver equipment belongs to you.

27
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:39,920
Using Everlasting's equipment

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
to promote Team Xing Xin's strength

29
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
makes me happy indeed.

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,280
But what about you?

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,800
The day before yesterday I sold the furniture of our team,

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,800
tabels and chairs were inclusive.

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,040
Yesterday I liquidated all the money in our bank accounts.

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
And today, I'm here.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,582
Selling all the weapons that had been fighting

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,040
with us all the time to you.

37
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,080
And then?

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll try to find ways to continue to stay in Glory.

39
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,000
How?

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,868
Given your current condition,

41
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,320
I can't say it'll be hopeful for you to get into another team.

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,880
You're right.

43
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:19,382
When it comes to physical strength,

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
I have no chance to win compared with younger players.

45
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,960
Also, my skills don't allow me to defeat the experienced players.

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,320
I know it's impossible for me to promote,

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
but I would never give up.

48
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,120
It seems you determine to stick it out in Glory.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,680
This is the only thing I can do.

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Whether I can do it well or not,

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I'll do it.

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,600
Hi.

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Please give me another glass of water.

55
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:57,794
I've thought about it.

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,954
It's difficult for senior players like you to adapt,

57
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:03,440
after joining a new team and using new weapons.

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,080
You'll lose more badly.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,445
Join Team Xing Xin.

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
You don't need a loser,

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,240
and a ratfink who played dirty tricks.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,440
That's right.

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
I need you to be a negative example in our team.

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,320
There're a lot of kids in our team.

65
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:34,720
When they're lazy,

66
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
I can tell them,

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640
a young idler,

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360

69
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:46,777
Don't you reconsider it?

70
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,017
Why would you do that?

71
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:56,765
Because we're the same kind of people.

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,531
Even though we're the only one left,

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720

I remember at the beginning of Everlasting's establishment,

104
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,297
we didn't get enough money.

105
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,120

and a worker here at night.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,800

184
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
when you appeared on the scene,

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
you were a boss of a top team!

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,880
What do you think?

187
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Tha's right.

188
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,422
You're awesome, Tang.

189
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:47,462
Without you,

190
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,794
we can't win the seventh consecutive victory.

191
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,422
Right?

192
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,440
- Yes. - That owes to all of us.

193
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,857
If Xiao An didn't protect me in the rear,

194
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,160
how could I fight in the front?

195
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,760
Without Yifan's protection,

196
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
I can't survive to the end.

197
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,640
Am I right, Yifan?

198
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,605
I can't fight smoothly

199
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
if Senior Wei didn't blaze a trail for me.

200
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,040
That's right!

201
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,760
That we've got such a good performance today

202
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,040
owes to the joint efforts made by all of us.

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,131
Come on.

204
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,194
Let me take the lead.

205
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,782
You guys follow up.

206
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,120
- Here. - Here.

207
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,800
Here.

208
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,720
Cheers!

209
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,400
Excuse me.

210
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,360
Drinking is prohibited during competition.

211
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Right.

212
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,680
That's right.

213
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,280
Then we'd better stop here.

214
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,720
Beer is not liquor.

215
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,760
Cocktail is not liquor.

216
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,520
Sparkling wine is not liquor.

217
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
Red wine is not liquor too!

218
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,040
Cheers!

219
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,400
= Xing Xin Net Café =

220
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:53,040
Come on!

221
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,280
Come on! We're late.

222
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:58,520
Quick, quick!

223
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,954
Be quickly!

224
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Come on!

225
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
Can you two be quickly?

226
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,520
Here we are.

227
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:16,685
Are you tired?

228
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:17,880
Yes.

229
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,320
If so,

230
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,200
forty more push-ups,

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,960
and three groups of sit-ups.

232
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,840
Are you serious? Captain. I can't do it.

233
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:25,840
Go.

234
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,400
Don't watch me like that.

235
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
What did you do last night?

236
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,514
All of you were late this morning.

237
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,120
Being late should be punished.

238
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,200
That's the rule.

239
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:53,428
Lao Ye,

240
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,394
it's not like the time when we were young.

241
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,200
They are all as thin as a shadow.

242
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,720
Even I can't bear to punish them.

243
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Being late and plead for them.

244
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
twenty more push-ups.

245
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,720
Captain.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,320
That's too many.

247
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,400
Welcome to Team Xing Xin.

248
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,565
What is he doing here?

249
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,348
To install monitors,

250
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,200
monitor units,

251
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
and signal jammers.

252
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:36,811
Do you know why Captain would

253
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,554
recruit him into our team?

254
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,640
I just searched.

255
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,160
The win rate of Everlasting under the leadership of Wu Chen is 100%.

256
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,880
Teams like Zhu Xian in the middle of Challenge

257
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
don't fear outflanking tactics, but suppressing tactics.

258
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Wu Chen's profession can help us intensify our ranged DPS,

259
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,800
which can repress Team Zhu Xian.

260
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
So that is what it is.

261
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,680
Captain is forethoughtful.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,160
Then we'll tolerate him now.

263
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,080
If he dares to hatch any sinister plot,

264
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,160
Mo Fan.

265
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,440
You mean you won't take part in any competition.

266
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,040
You want to manage Xing Xin guild.

267
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,360

Here are all the accumulations on guilds of Everlasting these years.

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
They can be used for the good of Team Xing Xin.

279
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,160
From now on Team Xing Xin's supply of materials can count on me.

280
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,120
All I want is to keep staying in Glory with these accounts.

281
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
But I want you to be a member of Team Xing Xin,

282
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,085
to stand on the competition terrain with us.

283
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,680
Think about it.

284
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,331
Wait a sec.

285
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Listen to me.

286
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,480
I've had a lot of dreams like

287
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
returning to competition.

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,680
But at this age,

289
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,960
I know myself well enough.

290
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Speaking of age,

291
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,085
Lao Wei has been playing well even now.

292
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,480
What?

293
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
It's your business.

294
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Don't drag me in.

295
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
I know my limitations.

296
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,480
For me, the ceiling of professional E-sports is low itself.

297
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,760
It's not necessarily so.

298
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,400
Lao Wei has hit the ceiling years ago.

299
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,000
Although he has become a person with bad character,

300
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,371
he's also shameless,

301
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:36,720
and dark-minded.

302
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,400
This is growth.

303
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,142
Fuck that growth.

304
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,160
I don't have the energy to diss you.

305
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:44,114
Lao Wei.

306
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,360
Keep growing.

307
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,720
Go on.

308
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,320
You told me before that it's impossible for you to promote,

309
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:07,760
but you would never give up,

310
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
and you'll stick it out in Glory.

311
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:11,880
So,

312
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,240
these excuses of refusing to come back to competitions

313
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,840
are what you really want to say?

317
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
He's so heartless in the competition,

318
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,040
let alone in the daily life.

319
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,520
Playing hard is what he does best.

320
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,280
The key is he know how to stir up our emotions.

321
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,920
He'll lose no chance.

322
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,205
We can't even dodge.

323
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,560
It's time to readjust the industrial mode.

324
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,840
We must stick to resist.

325
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,480
Resist!

326
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,560
What are you two doing?

327
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,400
Aren't we a team?

328
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,400
Hey, bro! Resist!

329
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,800
That's bullshit.

330
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,560
- Yifan. - Shit.

331
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,600
I have no idea.

332
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:08,834
Stop!

333
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,360
What did you say? Say it again!

334
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:11,560
Don't you hit Yifan.

335
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:12,937
Get up.

336
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,160
Senior.

337
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,120
Help me!

338
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:16,868
Stop!

339
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,165
What are you doing?

340
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:22,685
All right!

341
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:25,771
Captain.

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Just now,

343
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:28,491
who spoke ill of me?

344
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
Do you think when I was in the room,

345
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,320
I can't hear what you said?

346
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,474
What the ears he has!

347
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
Playing hard is what I do best?

348
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,360
We were late.

349
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,240
The push-up was punishment we deserved.

350
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
It's not playing hard.

351
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,880
It's... It's because we didn't live up to your expectations.

352
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,280
Right.

353
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,400
It's an encouragement!

354
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
What I did is bad for the industrial mode?

355
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,520
No, no, no.

356
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
You asked us to have two more hours training.

357
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,680
It's not bad for the industrial mode.

358
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,600
It's the way you care us!

359
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,800
You care us a lot!

360
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,680
And you want to resist?

361
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
- Uphold! - Uphold!

362
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,811
Uphold!

363
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,000
What do you uphold?

364
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,114
- We uphold... - Captain.

365
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,640
Every decision made by Captain.

366
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,320
Yes.

367
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,600
Very well.

368
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,960
Then you three,

369
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
thirty pull-ups.

370
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:32,160
Luo Ji and Yifan should be punished too

371
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,200
for the failure to report the facts.

372
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Ten pull-ups.

373
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,400
You can't be free from this.

374
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
But considering you're the victim,

375
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,240
I want you to supervise them until they finish their tasks.

376
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,640
Thirty pull-ups.

377
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
We'll be dead tired.

378
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
Yeah.

379
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,320
Why is the Captain not here?

380
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:07,485
That's right.

381
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,240
Chen.

382
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,668
What are you doing?

383
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,320
Chen.

384
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,160
It's too difficult for us to do thirty pull-ups.

385
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,280
Could you let it go this time?

386
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
But we must complete what Captain required.

387
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,080
Chen, Captain's not here now.

388
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
What about...

389
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Can you let us off?

390
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,440
You're putting me in an awkward situation.

391
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,280
You see, we're a team now.

392
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
You're a part of us now after all.

393
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
From now on, we'll have a lot of chances to be punished together.

394
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,880
Why don't you make it a gift for our first collective punishment?

395
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,880
What does that mean?

396
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,274
Eighty-four.

397
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,668
Eighty-five.

398
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:05,280
Eighty-six.

399
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,200
Eighty-seven.

400
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Actually, Senior Wu Chen is a good person.

401
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,028
I think so.

402
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,280
Ninety-one. Come on!  Ninety-two.

403
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,000
How about our ten pull-ups?

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,280
Ninety-three.

405
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
How many did we do?

406
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,080
Cut the crap!

407
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:39,240
How do you feel doing mischief with them?

408
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
Clear division of work.

409
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,720
Good teamwork.

410
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,045
You look quite happy.

411
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:50,240
I am.

412
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,280
Exercise can produce dopamine,

413
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
which makes people feel happy.

414
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,920
What is your dopamine?

415
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Glory for sure.

416
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,440
Except Glory?

417
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:08,080
Friends who play Glory with me.

418
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,880
I thought after the competition with Everlasting,

419
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,560
you'll never admit me.

420
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,280
Pass it to me.

421
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,800
Rather than failing to integrate in the team,

422
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,680
why not to manage the guild?

423
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
As a continuation of my life in Glory.

424
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,080
A way to continue my Glory dream.

425
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,760
So what do you think now?

426
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Now?

427
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:35,320
I feel like returning to my youth in Everlasting.

429
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,400
Captain.

430
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,960
The first player in Individual Event hasn't been arranged yet.

431
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,480
I already made my decision.

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,760
Sorry. I'm late.

433
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,240
Make Team Xing Xin stronger.

434
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:17,960
You should say "Let's make Team Xing Xin stronger."

435
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,874
- Welcome join us, Senior Wu Chen. - Welcome.

436
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,880
Let's do it together!

Ye Xiu?

440
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Shouldn't it be Ye Qiu?

441
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,880
Both of them mean our Captain.

442
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,160
Okay. Let's go.

443
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:37,965
Let's go.

444
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:38,720
Something happened!

445
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,434
Something serious!

446
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:42,937
We've been taken pictures.

453

Isn't that you, Tang Rou?

454
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:50,902
There're more in the magazine.

455
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,262
- A lot of pictures. - Is there more?

456
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,200
Awesome. We've been on the magazine.

457
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,960
Not a big deal.

458
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,680
Just took a horn.

459
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Being on the magazine means we're popular now.

460
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,171
That's a good thing.

461
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,520
So, you didn't drill the new tactic at all that night?

462
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,160
Without your instruction, there's no help to drill.

463
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,811
Team Xing Xin can thrive without anyone but you.

464
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,960
No tactic is unnecessary.

465
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,320
In competition,

466
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,840
one more tactic,

467
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,480
is one more possibility of organization.

468
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,537
At that night, we just want to relax.

469
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
To adjust our states.

470
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
Professional players are banned to drink alcohol.

471
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,068
This is our consensus.

472
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,234
Delay training for the sake of relaxation.

473
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,000
This is slack not relaxation.

474
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Respect your competition and your rivals.

475
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,017
Don't really regard yourself as a black horse or the Best Newcomer.

476
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Without a good performance,

477
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,000
without excellent strength,

478
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,840
we're nothing at all.

479
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:08,240
This is not Tang's fault.

480
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,502
We went there together.

481
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:14,285
As for the Best Newcomer, this is not a title gave by herself.

482
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:17,560
Can you ensure she wasn't complacent after seeing this report?

483
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,800
- Of course not. - No, she wasn't.

484
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,600
For sure.

485
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:21,474
Yes, I was.

486
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
I don't see there's anything wrong.

487
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,920
We got the strength,

488
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,720
and a good grade,

489
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,880
why shouldn't we be this black horse?

490
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,314
So you're satisfied

491
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,720
only after eight consecutive victories?

492
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
We can get it even though it's ten consecutive victories.

493
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,320
And the Best Newcomer, I'll get it.

494
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,520
You are confident.

495
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,120
Tang...

496
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
With our current strength,

497
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,840
I have good reason to be confident.

498
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
So what kind of strength do you think you have?

499
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,720
Tang...

500
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,400
I'll show it to you.

501
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,880
Tang!

502
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:15,840
Today's competition is the last round of the Challenge.

503
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Being a new team,

504
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,440
Team Xing Xin is a real black horse.

505
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
It ranks first on the league table of group B now.

506
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,112
But the gap between them and the second place

507
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:26,360
Team Ta Yun is not huge.

508
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,251
Team Xing Xin will go first this round.

509
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:30,320
If they successfully got seven points,

510
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,760
then no matter what grade Team Ta Yun got,

511
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,291
Team Xing Xin will get in the Final.

512
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,582
So this round is very important.

513
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,320
Tang Rou,

514
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:38,192
someone took pictures of you

515
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:39,702
drinking in the bar after eight consecutive victories.

516
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Do you think your teammates' mentalities have changed

517
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,600
after winning consecutive victories?

518
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,280
Tang Rou,

519
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,285
Do you think what's Team Xing Xin's overall strength level?

520
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,222
Victory has proven everything.

521
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,800
So do you think what's your strength level?

522
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,000
I will prove my strength and value in the competition.

523
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,800
How to prove?

524
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
One-against-three is a masterpiece of Captain Ye.

525
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,520
Have you ever thought of reproducing it to prove your strength?

526
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,400
Sure.

527
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,640
I will complete it in the competition.

528
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,017
What if you failed? Tang Rou?

529
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,560
If I failed,

530
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
I'll retire from the professional circle.

531
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,680
Are you serious?

532
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
That's a long shot!

533
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
Isn't this bet too heavy?

534
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,360
Come on!

535
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,800
Captain Ye.

536
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,965
What do you think of Tang Rou's promise

537
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:18,880
of achieving one-against three?

538
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
She's bold and resolute.

539
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Tang Rou,

540
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
I heard you promised to complete one-against-three.

541
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,880
I admire your courage.

542
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:26,548
Come on!

543
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,960
I believe in your strength.

544
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,960
It's better to keep yourself in low key.

545
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,320
Sorry.

546
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
It's caused by my neglect of duty.

547
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,480
After this competition,

548
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
I'll make a self-criticism.

549
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
It must be profound and touching.

550
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,080
At least 3,000 words, and there's no cap on the number of words.

551
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,320
I think eight words would be enough.

552
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,760
I'll take the lead,

553
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,560
and just this once.

554
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,200
By the way,

555
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
what about changing Tang's order in Arena Contest?

556
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
Don't let her play the first.

557
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,823
Don't you want to give her a chance

558
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:19,520
to accomplish one-against-three?

559
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,942
It's obvious that she was getting in a rage.

560
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't you know it?

561
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,480
I just said,

562
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
that she is resolute and bold.

563
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,240
But if Tang couldn't...

564
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,400
It's not that serious.

565
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,240
Sometimes,

566
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,800
we need to return the competition to players themselves.

567
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:42,571
Isn't that Lin Yi, the Captain of Zhu Xian?

568
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:43,920
Hey...

569
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
The price we set last time...

570
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,760
No problem.

571
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,229
If you did it well,

572
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,480
we can sign a contract as soon as the competition's over.

573
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,720
It's a deal.

574
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Deal.

575
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:05,051
Lao Ye. Come here.

576
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:06,000

Right now?

584
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,828
Captain Ye. This is our work.

585
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:24,834
Please cooperate us.

586
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,120
Besides, we need your ID card.

587
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
We'll keep it for you temporarily.

588
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,240
Please, Captain Ye.

589
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,120
Wait a moment.

590
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,840
Can you let my teammate attend the competition first?

591
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,899
After the competition,

592
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll accompany him to the League and receive investigation.

593
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,720
This is our first time in the Challenge.

594
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:58,520
Perhaps we're not quite familiar with many procedures here.

595
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,200
But every procedure was done by me. It's none of their business.

596
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,360
How about this?

597
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll go to the headquarters with you.

598
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,160
For E-sports players,

599
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,120
every round of competition is critical.

600
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,800
But for the League,

601
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,280
truth and fairness are more important.

602
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,480
Please follow us, Captain Ye.

603
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,760

I won't be able to stay here.

Captain's not here.

651

We need to follow We Chen's instruction.

It's all right.

653
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:06,800
I'll wait for Captain.

654
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,680
In the first round, Team Xing Xin appointed player Qiao Yifan.

655
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,845
As for Team Zhu Xian, we got player Zheng Shengchao.

656

Let's invite them to prepare on the stage.

657

Qiao Yifan again for the first round.

668
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:51,360
Let's looking forward to the growth of this newcomer.

669
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,480
The player from Team Zhu Xian is also a Ghost.

670
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,200
It's a combat between two players from the same profession.

671
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:57,720
Let's expect!

672
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,377
Last round of the Glory Challenge.

673
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,600
Team Xing Xin vs. Team Zhu Xian.

674
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,320
Individual Event starts!

675
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:04,708
The map is the Arena in the Place of Exile.

676
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,040
We can see at the very beginning, Yi Cunhui moves first.

677
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,000
He's scouting the Arena during moving.

678
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,045
Good. Yi Cunhui has detoured to the rear of Anxious Ghost.

679
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:13,800
His move and choice look more like an assassin,

680
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:14,720
rather than a Ghostblade.

681
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,610
Now if Yi Cunhui sang the ghost array,

682
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,560
Anxious Ghost would be thrown into passivity.

683
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,735
The Ghostblade of Team Zhu Xian hasn't found that

684
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:28,840
his rival has already been in his rear.

685
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
It's a bit reckless.

686
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,800
Yi Cunhui is going to attack.

687
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,508
It seems that he's not going to sing the ghost array.

688
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
Move!

689
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,400
Yi Cunhui gave up the chance of singing the ghost array.

690
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,954
He made a melee attack using ghost array and ghost-chop.

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,935
But it appears that flaw

692
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,920
was exposed to Yi Cunhui on purpose by Anxious Ghost.

693
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:50,440
What a pity!

694
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,640
It's a bit early for Yifan to make a sneak attack.

695
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,920
If he could wait a moment,

696
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
his rival might lose his balance.

697
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,342
Go for wool and come home shorn.

698
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,400
He's the first one. It must be stressful under such circumstance.

699
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,232
Yi Cunhui is very familiar with this arena,

700
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:13,160
so he escaped successfully.

701
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,811
Anxious Ghost lost his goal.

702
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:38,840
Look, right now Yi Cunhui is still hiding on the top of the wall.

703
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,600
It appears that he's still observing the surroundings.

704
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,891
It isn't a long distance between Anxious Ghost and Yi Cunhui.

705
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:44,240
And the former is moving toward the latter.

706
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:45,800
That's a good chance!

707
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,040
But I don't understand what is he waiting for?

708
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
Anxious Ghost is quite near him.

709
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,777
He can make a sneak attack at any time.

710
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,600
Oh, no!

711
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,040
Yi Cunhui's location is exposed by his shadow.

712
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,000
Anxious Ghost has discovered!

713
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,480
What?

714
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,600
Anxious Ghost didn't dodge.

715
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,440
He got hit!

716
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,200
What happened?
