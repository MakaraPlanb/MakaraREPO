= Episode 20 =

3
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,790
Planning to

4
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,990
give a hard blow.

5
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:45,630
That's good.

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,750
Get separated,

7
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,830
and go back to their own position.

8
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:53,858
Whether is good or not.

9
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:55,230
it depends on your view.

10
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:58,947
Try again.

11
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,350
Hit here.

12
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,390
Actually, whether there exists a ball

13
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,495
which can push you,

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,310
It's not important.

15
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,030
Focus on the present,

16
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:15,430
and then the direction of the future

17
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,470
will be more clear.

18
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:18,830
You

19
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,830
What's your future direction?

20
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:23,716
Me

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,507
I just want to play billiards.

22
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:35,550
I also just want to

23
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,221
play billiards.

24
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:41,510
Why do you

25
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,950
bother to work in such a small net cafe?

26
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,230
If you want to restart,

27
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,110
you can choose whatever team you want.

28
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,560
Because there is a group of people who like Glory.

29
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,415
Glory is their world.

30
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:57,323
What does it have to do with you?

31
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,984
In fact, I'm just one of them.

32
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:04,947
Great.

33
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,190
That's hard. Let's play again.

34
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:08,470
Don't forget.

35
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,427
You were one of them too.

36
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:14,381
Yes.

37
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,150
At that time, we just once

38
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,630
played billiards happily.

39
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,575
That's good.

40
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,640
Why did I listen to your words at that time?

41
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,895
Now I can only see the bastard occupy the position.

42
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,190
Rather than spending the time on

43
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,267
finding the evidence to prove that he framed you,

44
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:36,763
It's better to focus on the training,

45
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,498
and keep your own ranking.

46
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,083
One day

47
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:43,741
you will encounter him on your way.

48
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:45,532
Dammit.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,350
If I encounter him,

50
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,766
only I could be the winner.

51
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:55,643
Excellent.

52
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,230
We have made the deal.

53
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,676
After I win,

54
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:03,390
You will own me an equipment.

55
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:06,310
Talk about it after you have won.

56
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,230
You haven't answered

57
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,609
my question.

58
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:21,950
UCI offer a chance

59
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,990
of one -year professional E-sports training.

60
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,384
Will you go?

61
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,470
Why is me?

62
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,550
Members of Team One need to participate in the competition.

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,975
Such a long-term exchange program

64
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,310
is best for players like you

65
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,000
who never enter the competition before.

66
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:39,815
When I come back,

67
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,027
can I come into Team One?

68
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,150
That's rascally.

69
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,830
You have owned me one equipment.

70
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,550
When do you give it to me ?

71
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:50,381
After you come back from abroad?

72
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,310
I haven't said I will go abroad.

73
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:55,649
After you come back,

74
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:57,895
I will give you a silver equipment.

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,467
Silver equipment?

76
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,873
You mean the silver equipment that

77
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,030
only the members of Team One could have?

78
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,470
Write down the IOU.

79
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:14,892
Write it down clearly.

80
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,403
Don't try to escape.

81
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,956
You don't trust me?

82
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,341
I trust you.

83
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,043
But you still write IOU.

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Write that you own Qiu Fei a silver equipment.

85
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,590
Wait. Write that,

86
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,390
You own Qiu Fei, the regular of Jia Shi, a silver equipment.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,150
OK?

88
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:44,024
I own you this.

89
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,070
= I own you a glory. =

90
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:56,710
Debts that you own me,

91
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,113
When do you plan to pay?

92
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,630
You own me a glory.

93
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,590
You will fight the glory back on your own.

94
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,950
What? Want to go back on your words?

95
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:14,873
Right.

96
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,790
So that I have reasons to entangle you.

97
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,190
I will give you.

98
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,107
You saw him?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,944
I guess he must

100
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,830
lesson you brashly.

101
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,110
Just like he changed PK into a competition for guidance.

102
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,440
Always insulting others.

103
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,292
Qiu Fei, amazing.

104
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,870
You still want to improve yourself at this moment.

105
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,310
Pitifully, the things you copied are useless.

106
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,030
The tactics of Ye Qiu are out of date.

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,870
I am very happy that

108
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,870
you come back from abroad.

109
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:08,910
With you joining in, it's just like adding wings to a tiger.

110
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,870
We are both the victims of Ye Qiu.

111
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,150
Why not working together?

112
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,830
His vulnerable team

113
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,270
can't last for a few days.

114
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:38,350
Jia Shi has changed the captain.

115
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,590
You don't deserve mentioning Ye Qiu.

116
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,590
This is for giving you a lesson.

117
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:53,790
Later, if I hear it again,

118
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,138
I will beat you again.

119
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:09,030
Tang, Yi Fan, Bao Zi, they are all not here.

120
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,190
I feel a little lonely.

121
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,372
Kinda miss them.

122
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:15,550
To them,

123
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,427
this is an important choice for their life.

124
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,055
They should be prudent.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,230
Yi Fan, good news.

126
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,667
You don't have to go to the training camp.

127
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,790
The captain says he wants to tell you something.

128
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,710
Keep your training in the team.

129
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,190
I wan to go somewhere else.

130
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,510
Practicing The Array Ghost.

131
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,070
Manager, what are you saying?

132
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,910
The company plans to give you promotion.

133
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,270
You are in charge of this area.

134
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,390
Please let me calm down.

135
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,870
This is the last day of the invitation.

136
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,990
Have you decided yet?

137
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,270
Yes.

138
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,470
I have made the decision.

139
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,064
Let me do it.

140
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,870
The little devil just came, right?

141
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:27,587
Jia Shi

142
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,350
plans to how to arrange him?

143
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:30,590
In terms of his temper,

144
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,390
whatever the arrangement of the team is,

145
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,910
he can achieve anything

146
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,430
as long as it is what he wants.

147
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,990
Actually, no matter Qiu Fei,

148
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,910
or other people,

149
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,809
They want to follow you.

150
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,910
It doesn't mean you have to be responsible for their life.

151
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:48,510
They just want to

152
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,421
Play Glory with you.

153
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,310
Since they have made the choice,

154
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,590
each of them

155
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,870
has to be responsible for his own life

156
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:55,778
Right?

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,384
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

158
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:00,670
= the wind spear =
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

159
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:00,870
= the wind spear =

160
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,940
# sailing with the wind and converge into the Milky Way #
= the wind spear =

161
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,590
# sailing with the wind and converge into the Milky Way #

162
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,510
# standing on the top and claiming that #

163
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,550
# We will regain our glory #

164
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,750
If you love Glory,

165
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,790
Please love everything it brings to you.

166
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:19,550
No matter it is pain, setback, or tears.

167
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,190
I can't be responsible for your life.

168
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,830
But I'm willing to become your choice.

169
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,950
Because where the sword points,

170
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,670
Is our glory.

171
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,550
# The glory we've missed #

172
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,390
# The pride in the future #

173
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,710
Boss,

174
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,350
# Composing the great song of battlefield #

175
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,203
Senior,

176
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,190
We are back.

177
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,590
# Is us from the ordinary life #

178
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,470
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

179
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,270
# We are the brightest fireflies #

180
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,110
# I came from the past and will write the furture #

181
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,950
# The rising wave of our ten years' effort #

182
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,830
# This fight, we will make it memorable #

183
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,790
# The glorious moment of coronation #

184
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,830
# We are the brightest fireflies #

185
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,310
Yes.

186
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,510
I have to say,

187
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,030
the weight in my mind,

188
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,230
is finally unloaded.

189
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
You have no confidence of me?

190
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,350
As for things about the team,

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,796
I can definitely take care of them. Handle them.

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,110
Won't cause any trouble at the critical moment.

193
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,870
It's for encouragement. Keep on.

194
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,750
Isn't it something cheap bought in the street?

195
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,110
And use it to fool me, right?

196
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,670
It seems so worn and old.

197
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,110
It's indeed second-handed.

198
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,870
When it is given to you,

199
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,430
It will be third-handed.

200
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,732
Master, can you be a little sincere

201
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,350
when you send gifts.

202
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,190
The badge of the first league.

203
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,750
Awesome.

204
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,910
This can be regarded as an antique.

205
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,070
Ordinary players

206
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,350
can hardly collect it.

207
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,710
Am I an ordinary player?

208
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,430
Why not saying it earlier?

209
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,470
I almost miss the priceless gift.

210
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,830
Thank you.

211
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,510
I like this second-handed gift very much.

212
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,510
By the way,

213
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,510
I also prepare a gift for you.

214
00:12:58,824 --> 00:12:59,990
What is it?

215
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,510
New beginning.

216
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,750
What is it?

217
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,110
New beginning.

218
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:24,870
The gift has been sent.

219
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,630
The people upstairs are also here.

220
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,750
Since tomorrow, the mission of the new year will also begin.

221
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,070
Your order.

222
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:35,421
Give me the gizzards.

223
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,510
Now. Now.

224
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,990
Here. Take it.

225
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,390
We met each other in Glory and got together in Xing Xin.

226
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,790
In the long future, please render your help.

227
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:51,852
Cheers.

228
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:52,769
Wait.

229
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,830
I almost forget an important thing.

230
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:55,830
Important?

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,950
Important thing?

232
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:59,070
Boss, since today,

233
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,110
Ye Xiu and Jun Moxiao will always be with Xing Xin.

234
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,150
After the team is formed,

235
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,270
it needs to unify the management of the account cards.

236
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,030
But you don't need to be so urgent.

237
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:17,027
Tang Rou, Han Yanrou will always be with Xing Xin.

238
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,630
Bao Zi, the Invader will always be with Xing Xin.

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,870
Qiao Yifan, Yi Cunhui will always be with Xing Xin.

240
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,030
# It's a long and bumpy road towards the top #

241
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,390
Can he find a boss?

242
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,590
He can.

243
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,350
Who?

244
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,043
Me.

245
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,950
# even if I am beat black and blue #

246
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,310
# there is always hope rising from desperation #

247
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,230
since this is what you thought,

248
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:44,910
and so did they,

249
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,990
then I'm out.

250
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,990
You always give up halfway anyway.

251
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,590
Since you are unwilling to do it,

252
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,070
then don't force yourself.

253
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,630
I am

254
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,532
the manager of Team Xing Xin.

255
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,430
I am the manager of Team Xing Xin.

256
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,190
I am willing to fight with you to the end.

257
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,750
Thank you.

258
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,750
I will not fail

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,950
your expectation.

260
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,630
Thank you.

261
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,190
Xing Xin are bound to win.

262
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,320
Glory will never die out.

263
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:19,218
Challenge,

264
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,070
we are coming!

265
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,510
Since the establishment of the League,

266
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,510
there is only one ultimate goal of all players.

267
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,310
That is the championship trophy of Glory.

268
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,550
The ultimate throne of all players,

269
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,950
will have a new owner today.

270
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,710
We take the crown. Long life Xing Xin.

271
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,670
Next,

272
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,830
please welcome my dear teammates.

273
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,390
Please welcome Qiao Yifan.

274
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,710
Thank you to the league for giving us this trophy.

275
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,230
We will make persistent efforts.

276
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,030
That is too official.

277
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,110
Come. Next one.

278
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:00,830
I'd better not.

279
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,101
Next one. Next one.

280
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:03,760
Come here now.

281
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,670
Actually, I have so much to say.

282
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,950
But the one I want to thank most

283
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,347
is our boss.

284
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,150
I think it's not an end,

285
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,916
but a beginning.

286
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,993
Next champion, next champion of the next,

287
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,698
will all belong to Xing Xin.

288
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,393
Great.

289
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:22,055
Yes.

290
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
How about this shooting?

291
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:25,030
Is it good?

292
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,870
Have a look.

293
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,710
Have a look.

294
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,630
Perfect.

295
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,640
Underling, what are you doing, underling?

296
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,544
Does it a little joggle?

297
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,630
Remember this feeling.

298
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,132
Try again, OK?

299
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:38,080
OK. Let's go.

300
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,350
You are so annoying.

301
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,910
Isn't it tiring to act so many times?

302
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,470
The Academy Award owns you an Oscar.

303
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:44,676
Don't be so dramatic.

304
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,910
Not anyone can have the championship trophy.

305
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,390
Right.

306
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:47,913
That trophy,

307
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,670
I had it three times.

308
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,510
Apart from the fact that it's too heavy,

309
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,830
it's just so-so.

310
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:58,886
Really?

311
00:16:59,187 --> 00:16:59,827
I don't know.

312
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:03,870
How about joining us in the shooting?

313
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,486
Yes.

314
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,018
Come and join us.

315
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:07,650
Join us.

316
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,790
Come.

317
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,830
When we take the crown,

318
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,790
Let's lift the pure gold championship trophy.

319
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,615
Hello, everybody.

320
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:17,255
I'm Xiao Lu.

321
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,510
This is the twelfth game of this regular season

322
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,073
in the eighth season of Glory.

323
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,470
Jia Shi vs. Thunderbolt.

324
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,350
This is an epic battle.

325
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,590
Why?

326
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,790
You will know later.

327
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:28,535
When it comes to Thunderbolt,

328
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:29,360
its captain, Xiao Shiqin,

329
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,790
is one of the four tacticians.

330
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,430
Always leads his team to overcame the stronger one.

331
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,550
His role, the mechanic Sheng Lingmie.

332
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,190
is also a S-level role in Glory.

333
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,790
It's the core of tactics of Thunderbolt.

334
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,790
As for Team Jia Shi,

335
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,110
it is led by Sun Xiang, the Rookie.

336
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,809
His role Leaf of Autumn

337
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,430
is called God of Fights.

338
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,313
The contest starts now!

339
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,963
The players enter into the map.

340
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:52,310
The team tournament and relegation battle

341
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,452
between Jia Shi and Thunderbolt begins right now.

342
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,270
Although Thunderbolt has

343
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,920
Xiao Shiqin, one of the four tacticians,

344
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,227
members of Thunderbolt don't have enough personal ability.

345
00:17:58,227 --> 00:17:59,910
They also enter into the relegation zone pitifully.

346
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,956
Jia Shi changed its captain,

347
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:02,966
but didn't make any progress.

348
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,233
It also could be relegated.

349
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,246
Why not being afraid of the relegation?

350
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,710
Come back again by killing monsters and leveling.

351
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,230
You think it's like playing the dungeon, don't you?

352
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,390
killing monsters and leveling? Shame on you.

353
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,030
Only twenty teams will be left in this season.

354
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,230
If the team is at the bottom, he can't even keep his seat.

355
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,384
How could they lift the level?

356
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,070
So...

357
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,030
Tonight, either Jia Shi or Thunderbolt

358
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,670
will be relegated.

359
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,830
Yes. The relegated team

360
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,070
will naturally

361
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,790
participate in the challenge of the next season.

362
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,390
Challenge. That is what we are going to participate.

363
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,978
Achieve the champion of the challenge is the only way

364
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,950
for the relegated team to come back to the league.

365
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,458
So...

366
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,030
The team which will be relegated tonight

367
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,990
will become our rival.

368
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,910
It's just a matter of time.

369
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,070
Even if we don't meet in the challenge,

370
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,070
we will still encounter each other in the league.

371
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,990
No matter which of them,

372
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,630
It will become our future rival.

373
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,061
He is indeed worth of being called Rookie.

374
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:03,163
Take away HOP of Thunderbolt.

375
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:04,744
Thunderbolt will lose if this continues.

376
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,092
Thunderbolt is in danger.

377
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,790
Jia Shi has had the game under control.

378
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,830
At this critical point, Sun Xiang stands out.

379
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,270
It's time to end.

380
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,230
I still can't tolerate

381
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,449
Sun Xiang's arrogance.

382
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,230
It's not good for us if Jia Shi loses the game.

383
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,350
Nonsense.

384
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,750
I hope Jia Shi will lose.

385
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,750
And go bankrupt right now.

386
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,070
According to the data,

387
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,027
Thunderbolt's capacity is far lower than Jia Shi's.

388
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:26,590
It's not surprising that they will lose.

389
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,883
If we can choose a team

390
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,150
as our rival,

391
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,910
I prefer Thunderbolt.

392
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,040
Thunderbolt is retreating.

393
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,418
Jia Shi is still chasing them. They don't want the substitution

394
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,307
To join the main strength of Thunderbolt.

395
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,990
Hi Fan, if you are Thunderbolt,

396
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,366
What will you do in such an unfavorable situation?

397
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,713
I will conserve my strength.

398
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,196
Wait for the chance.

399
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,110
Thunderbolt is running out of the time.

400
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,883
You have to create the chances for yourself.

401
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,006
Captain, you mean taking the initiative,

402
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,520
Containing their main force.

403
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,390
But that's too risky.

404
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,169
You are coming out yourself.

405
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:06,590
Then I don't need to chase you.

406
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,215
Sheng Lingmie.

407
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,876
He is

408
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,920
Xiao Shiqin, the captain of Thunderbolt.

409
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,870
He leads Thunderbolt, a weak team

410
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,987
gradually into the league.

411
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,086
He is the core of all the tactics of Thunderbolt.

412
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,886
Apart from the tactics,

413
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,707
even in the mental aspect,

414
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,350
he is absolutely the leader of Thunderbolt.

415
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,898
Dragon soaring. Does Sun Xiang want to expand his advantage?

416
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:40,713
Wonderful.

417
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,830
That's the end.

418
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,510
Dragon soaring begins the bonus.

419
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,670
It seems he will use Dragon Head Rising.

420
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,923
You mean Sun Xiang will use Dragon Heads Rising?

421
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,110
Dragon Head Rising.

422
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,710
Sun Xiang should use the unique skill of Ye Qiu.

423
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,630
Dragon Head Rising.

424
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,510
What's going on?

425
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
He should escape the Dragon Head Rising.

426
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,443
Sheng Lingmie uses the step-back of the mechanical punch,

427
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,150
Escaping the damage of

428
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,310
Dragon soaring immediately.

429
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,784
What the hell is that?

430
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:02,710
Just now, we saw that

431
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,110
Sun Xiang used Dragon Head Rising.

432
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,390
But it's also the first time we saw that

433
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,070
Someone could break the Dragon Head Rising.

434
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,310
The captain of Thunderbolt.

435
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,470
He should break Dragon Head Rising.

436
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,600
How could that be possible?

437
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,947
Nothing is impossible.

438
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,390
Dragon Head Rising is not unbreakable.

439
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,790
You have known the solution.

440
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,870
This skill from the beginning to the end

441
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,910
constitutes seventy eight frames.

442
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,230
The only flaw

443
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,070
Is hidden in the forty-second frame.

444
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,510
This is unavoidable when the player uses it.

445
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,003
It's hard to find it.

446
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,630
I guess he watched the playback

447
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,270
for thousands of times.

448
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,390
And finally found this solution.

449
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,550
This is really his style.

450
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,070
Leaf of Autumn is in danger.

451
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,070
It takes too long to end Dragon Soaring.

452
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,310
Find one in about seventy frames.

453
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,830
His sight is too good.

454
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,550
It's his effort, not his sight.

455
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,870
This guy is too frightening.

456
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,550
Any skill

457
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,070
is meaningful only when it is used at the right time.

458
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,150
Otherwise,

459
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,550
it will become the flaw.

460
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,910
This time, Sun Xiang

461
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,470
suffers from showing his virtuosity.

462
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,163
Lumbricus Tactic.

463
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,230
From now on, fight back with all forces.

464
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,830
We see that Thunderbolt begins to fight back at once.

465
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,049
Lay siege to Leaf of Autumn.

466
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,267
Xiao Shiqin of Thunderbolt

467
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,929
Is famous for overcoming the stronger rivals.

468
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,781
Once he finds the flaw,

469
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,830
he won't let it go.

470
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,950
If Sun Xiang didn't use Dragon Head Rising just now,

471
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,830
maybe Thunderbolt would have lost the game.

472
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,630
Pitifully, there is no "if" in the competition.

473
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,790
The result has come out.

474
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,049
Jia Shi is in danger.

475
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,950
The time is running out.

476
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,110
Make it.

477
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,030
Thunderbolt successfully takes Leaf of Autumn away.

478
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,430
Meanwhile, team HP of Thunderbolt is higher than that of Jia Shi.

479
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,070
Time is up. Game over.

480
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,941
Thunderbolt keeps its seat.

481
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:01,830
That's splendid.

482
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,270
We have witnessed the history again.

483
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,110
Thunderbolt achieved its comeback in the desperate situation.

484
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,750
At the last moment, they won the game.

485
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,790
It's Thunderbolt that keeps its seat in the league.

486
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,030
Jia Shi is relegated.

487
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,350
So we will...

488
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,861
Congratulations to Thunderbolt again.

489
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:20,430
They achieve the final victory.

490
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,510
We also feel very pitiful to

491
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,812
Jia Shi, the great team in the past.

492
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:25,710
We won.

493
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,150
They are relegated from the league.

494
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,990
They will begin from the challenge

495
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,270
in the next season.

496
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,950
We also thank our audience

497
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,636
for your support.

498
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,566
We will see you again at the ninth pro-league.

499
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,236
Bye bye.

500
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,181
We won. We won.

501
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:50,110
The cooperation was great just now.

502
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,950
Great.

503
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:52,375
Not bad. Not bad.

504
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:54,080
Come and have a rest.

505
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,430
Well done.

506
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,910
Captain, where do we go to celebrate tonight?

507
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,150
I won't go tonight.

508
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,550
I know, among all the teams in the league,

509
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,710
as for which is the most diligent,

510
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,181
if Thunderbolt ranks second,

511
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:04,147
then there will be no team ranking first.

512
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,083
Tonight,

513
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,495
we must open a summing-up meeting,

514
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:08,664
celebrating it later.

515
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:20,350
What's going on?

516
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,390
The...

517
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,630
Since today,

518
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,230
I won't be your captain.

519
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,178
What?

520
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:34,750
What?

521
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,950
Captain, this joke is not funny.

522
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,830
What's going on?

523
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,830
This is the tactics of all teams in the league

524
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,470
and coping strategies

525
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,230
that I have summarized for years.

526
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,710
You will use them in the future.

527
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,350
I also add notes to

528
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,270
all the tactics

529
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,910
You can refer to it.

530
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,572
After I leave,

531
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,070
the new captain will appear among you.

532
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,750
Please work hard, everyone.

533
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,670
Captain, captain.

534
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,350
What do you mean?

535
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,541
You want to transfer and leave Thunderbolt.

536
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,270
Captain. Captain.

537
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,790
Come out, Sun Xiang.

538
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,310
Members of Jia Shi,

539
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,123
pleas leave the competition room as soon as possible.

540
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,470
Come out. Come out.

541
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,470
Come out. Come out.

542
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,030
What are you doing? They are fans.

543
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,190
You will be scolded to death.

544
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,849
We lost the game.

545
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,901
Someone has to account for this.

546
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,590
Then who?

547
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,710
It's not that simple that

548
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,267
we just lost the game today.

549
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,658
It's relegation.

550
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,750
Then who should be blamed?

551
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,030
We just followed the tactics

552
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,390
that has been arranged.

553
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,910
Now, Jia Shi believes in individualism.

554
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,470
Powerless people like us,

555
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,070
can't deicide the game

556
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,910
no matter we played well or not.

557
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,575
Today,

558
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,030
someone insisted on using Dragon Head Rising.

559
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,310
Is he ashamed ?

560
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,750
Enough. If you continue to

561
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,070
pass the buck,

562
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,790
suit yourself. I won't join you.

563
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,110
My Cheng, we don't mean that.

564
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,021
We just don't want to lose the game with no clear reasons.

565
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:43,710
Shut up.

566
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,430
Come out. Come out.

567
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:50,630
I am the captain.

568
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,790
I will be held accountable for this.

569
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,190
You think you bear all the responsibility and that's enough?

570
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,781
Jia Shi is relegated.

571
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,363
No one is innocent.

572
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,950
We lost the game.

573
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,910
We all have our own responsibility.

574
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,950
Including myself .

575
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:14,492
Come out. Come out.

576
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:15,470
Please calm down.

577
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,024
How did you play?

578
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:16,640
Su Mucheng,

579
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,436
The record of Jia Shi was always very stable before.

580
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,723
Why could it be relegated this time?

581
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,901
What does it have to do with the captain, Sun Xiang?

582
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,870
Can you explain this?

583
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,116
Can you explain, Su Mucheng?

584
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:25,600
Whether there is some problems?

585
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,861
Does the retirement of Ye Qiu

586
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,390
have a great influence on Jia Shi?

587
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,510
Order, please.

588
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,710
Please calm down guys.

589
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,550
Please calm down, guys.

590
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,030
This is not your fault.

591
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,870
You are not the captain.

592
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,950
Su Mucheng, don't leave.

593
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,310
Su Mucheng, why?

594
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,910
Mu Cheng. Mu Cheng. Su Mucheng.

595
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,507
Don't.

596
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:53,270
We don't blame you. Su Mucheng.

597
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,710
Mu Cheng, don't leave.

598
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,830
Don't leave, Mu Cheng.

599
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:22,470
Mu Cheng.

600
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:27,507
Today's performance was so good. Yes.

601
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:28,950
Jia Shi was too terrible today.

602
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:29,830
Yes.

603
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,870
Great.

604
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,606
I take you to a familiar place.

605
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,150
What do you want?

606
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,630
A cup of coffee.

607
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,150
OK.

608
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,670
Thank you.

609
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,630
This is the familiar place?

610
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,910
But we never come here before.

611
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:56,504
Really?

612
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,301
You think I don't have enough of the game today?

613
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,190
You don't dare to come?

614
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,790
Let me clarify,

615
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,741
I am furious right now.

616
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:07,040
I won't be softhearted.

617
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,830
This map?

618
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,590
You do remember it.

619
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,252
Of course. How could I forget it?

620
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,310
I don't lie to you. This is the familiar place.

621
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,150
I still remember

622
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,830
my brother created this map.

623
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,310
And here, I played Glory for the first time.

624
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:56,750
# You'll share with me a bowl of instant noodles #

625
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,009
Right. Move.

626
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:02,390
Yes. Yes. Yes.

627
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,172
Now use the cannonball of flotation.

628
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:06,270
Throw the grenade and meanwhile change your gun.
Now use the cannonball of flotation.

629
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,175
Throw the grenade and meanwhile change your gun.

630
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,390
This way. This way.

631
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,790
He is hiding here. OK.

632
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:14,301
That's so cruel, Ye Xiu.

633
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,550
You such a despicable person.

634
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,550
Don't misguide my little sister.

635
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,670
Su Muqiu,

636
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,830
really?

637
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,550
You design this map,

638
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,600
and now have stayed there for a while.

639
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,190
Shoot him. Shoot him.

640
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,710
You will pay for it.

641
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,464
I am telling you.

642
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:25,778
OK.

643
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,830
Send that bomb back.

644
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,590
# the private detective, #

645
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,870
# You see through every action and expression, #

646
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,870
Why I can't move?

647
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:40,529
I am asking you, why she can't move?

648
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,510
Is there any bug here?

649
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:44,344
Dammit. I have revised this map several times.

650
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,670
Why there is still bugs?

651
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,910
Entrap your own sister.

652
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,230
Right, Mu Cheng?

653
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,150
Every programmer makes progress

654
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,033
by fixing his bugs.

655
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,713
Failure is the ladder upwards success.

656
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:55,190
Right?

657
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,670
What ladder? Look at it yourself.

658
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,270
It should be called the desperate black hole.

659
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,190
# it's the eternal support in my heart. #

660
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,750
It should be here.

661
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,366
It has been so many years.

662
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,390
That bug is the only flaw

663
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,110
of my brother.

664
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,230
Now, it should have been fixed, right?

665
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,153
Who knows? Let's have a contest?

666
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,430
OK. My force is quite strong right now.

667
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,858
Be careful.

668
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,550
Do you still remember how I taught you

669
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,529
to handle your brother?

670
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,360
How dare you talk about it!

671
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,990
After that game,

672
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,116
my brother forbade me from playing Glory.

673
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,446
He was afraid that you would mislead me.

674
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,572
I misled you?

675
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,910
You have been self-taught.

676
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:41,190
I am stuck. The bug is still here.

677
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,070
Let me have a look.

678
00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:50,676
Where is this?

679
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,390
Go down there and we'll find out.

680
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,169
In the past six months,

681
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,390
I have never given up,

682
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,310
although many things have happened.

683
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,510
Even without you by my side,

684
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,750
I realize that I need to rely on myself.

685
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,190
So I work harder than before.

686
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,950
But Jia Shi is

687
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,470
still relegated.

688
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,910
More desperately,

689
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,230
It's not the relegation itself.

690
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,630
Instead, no matter how harder I tried,

691
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,710
Jia Shi nowadays made me

692
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,470
feel powerless.

693
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,990
How to choose the future path of the following year,

694
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,190
I am quite confused.

695
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,790
We are going downhill.

696
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,230
As for the future path,

697
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,830
I don't know where to go.

698
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,230
Then focus on the path you're walking on right now.

699
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,590
Ain't I going downhill?

700
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,141
Actually, at many moments of life,

701
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,270
It's like this stairs.

702
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,058
You think you are going downhill.

703
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,950
As long as you keep going,

704
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,230
when you turn around,

705
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,830
you will find that you've stood in a higher place.

706
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,310
There is no absolute boundary between winning and losing.

707
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,070
As long as you keep going forward,

708
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,070
the nadir could be a high spot.

709
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,830
Our world is never a straight path.

710
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,830
There are ups and downs,

711
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,790
winning and losing,

712
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,830
and no end.

713
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,790
The bug at that time

714
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,750
has been fix by Mu Qiu.

715
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,670
And he left a bonus.

716
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,070
It is what you are seeing now.

717
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,030
Penrose stairs.

718
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,750
It still doesn't have a name.

719
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,190
You pick a name for it?

720
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,390
Then the name is

721
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,830
Path of Glory.

722
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,150
Your taste of naming has improved.

723
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,963
At least, it's better than Leaf of Autumn.

724
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,230
Your ice cream.

725
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,350
Thank you.

726
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,790
Xing Xin and Jia Shi.

727
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,710
They will definitely meet in the Challenge.

728
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,350
Then

729
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,750
Welcome to become my rival.

730
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,190
Almost all the top players live in this floor.

731
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,427
This is Shen Jian's room.

732
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,033
Next lives Zhang Jiaxing.

733
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,101
Sun Xiang lives there.

734
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,310
This is Ye Qiu's room.

735
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,150
One two three four.

736
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,018
I set the password.

737
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,206
It's very simple.

738
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,680
In case that he will sleep in the hallway at night.

739
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:46,492
Come in.

740
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,390
His room

741
00:36:55,993 --> 00:36:57,316
belongs to me now.

742
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,292
Welcome our old friend to live here.

743
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,070
I never think we will be in one team.

744
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,150
By the way, this board

745
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,710
maybe a little loose.

746
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,190
The table leg is not stable.

747
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,470
Especially this curtain.

748
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,670
Don't pull it.

749
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,590
Otherwise, it will be worse.

750
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,870
Why not

751
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,236
fixing them?

752
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,070
Maybe don't know how to fix them.

753
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,390
It was a good place.

754
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,144
But with time going by,

755
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:44,950
some small problems gradually occur.

756
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,836
Just like this room.

757
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:48,129
After it is empty for long,

758
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,387
it becomes a hollow room with nobody living here.

759
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:52,461
Right?

760
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,830
So here I come.

761
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,483
The Jia Shi that remains to be fixed needs me.

762
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:01,390
You're right.

763
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,070
Actually, the curtain only needs to change a hook.

764
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:06,836
The table legs need to screw it up.

765
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,070
But the board has been totally broken.

766
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,230
I don't know how to fix it.

767
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,135
Fix it if possible.

768
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,741
Otherwise, replace it with a new one.

769
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,390
Replace?

770
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,110
Qiao Shiqin, you are such

771
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,470
a cruel guy.

772
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,046
You just came here.

773
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,307
And have thought about cleaning up.

774
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,830
Don't misunderstand me.

775
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,353
I don't misunderstand you.

776
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,347
But as the old saying goes,

777
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,350
one nation can't have two queens.

778
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,150
Say away. Whether you are here to

779
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,590
help Mr. Tao transfer the power of Sun Xiang?

780
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,470
Enough. Don't try to pull it out of me.

781
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,932
I'm not here to transfer anyone's power.

782
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,670
I'm here to change the broken Jia Shi

783
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,630
into a new look.

784
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,030
How to change it ?

785
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,870
Just like you said,

786
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,935
change a screw.

787
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,430
OK. Thank you.

788
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,092
It's all right.

789
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,510
Give it to me.

790
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,470
No drinking during the competition.

791
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,510
This is the regulation.

792
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,350
Since you have taken a horn,

793
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,950
why not enjoying yourself to the full?

794
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,083
Have another drink.

795
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,110
The same with his. With spherical ice.

796
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,310
Here.

797
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,790
Add ice to dilute it. Crowd.

798
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,230
The ice represses the light element in the alcohol,

799
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,030
while the wild and strong element

800
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:13,710
will stand out.

801
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,150
Sometimes,

802
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,910
it can reach the result that one plus one is more than two.

803
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,670
I'm the unique one.

804
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,030
I don't need to cooperate with anyone.

805
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,070
Of course not.

806
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,470
When genius players like you cooperate with others,

807
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,870
It's more favorable for others.

808
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,830
It's not fair.
