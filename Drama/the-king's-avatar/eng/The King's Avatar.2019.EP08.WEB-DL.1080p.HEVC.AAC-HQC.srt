=Episode 8

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
By the way, Yingjie

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I heard about the restaurant we always go to

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,680
is renovated recently.

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,360
It may take a long time.

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,000
before we can eat its takeout

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,160
So you have to help me eat more.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,040
Why this face

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm just going to train for a few days.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
I will come back

12
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,800
Come back early.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,880
Of course, when I come back

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
I must defeat the Jun Moxiao

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
I heard them say

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
The captain intends to train you to be a successor?

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Yingjie, come on

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
You too

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm leaving

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
In fact, I think

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
it would be nice for Yifan to go to glory training camp.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
Stay in our team

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,480
It is even worse to be a server forever.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
Okay, thank you.

25
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Did you see the man operating yesterday

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,200
This is ridiculous

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah, that's funny

28
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Can also appear that kind of mistake

29
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Yeah

30
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Yifan, your report card

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
We see that you have been working very hard.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
And is also making continuous progress.

33
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,280
But the team competition is too intense and the quota is limited.

34
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Go back to Wei Cao with your current results.

35
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
There was no chance to play either.

36
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
It is suggested that you continue your study here.

37
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,920
Waiting for the right time to go back

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
Then I'll go first

39
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
You have a lot of ideas, but unfortunately

40
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
You didn't find your problem

41
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Master, I want to play again

42
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,120
To beat me

43
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
No, to lose

44
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,040
To lose again in the hands of your Master

45
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,800
I want to know what my problem is

46
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
Why I work so hard with few progresses

47
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
Meet me at the arena.

48
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
The combo just now

49
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
I should have escaped within ten seconds.

50
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
But I still got it

51
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Master deliberately exposed three flaws

52
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
I couldn't catch it

53
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,160
Hesitated time missed the best time.

54
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
Cutting throat is not hard enough, arc flash is not fast enough.

55
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,680
All my skills have become chicken ribs in my hands.

56
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,760
I really have too many problems

57
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
Thanks for your time

58
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,280
But you have a good overall awareness

59
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Overall awareness

60
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,120
It's a pity that overall awareness can't let me

61
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
help team kill one more person

62
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,320
But can let you help the team win

63
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
This is a very rare trait.

64
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
Master, can I learn from you in person

65
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
Find me here

66
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
I hope the guidance of you

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,920
can let me see the future clearly

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
Where to go

69
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
I know it

70
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
the last time that group of people is your Wei Cao Team

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,520
The professional lineup has sold you out

72
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,080
I didn't think you were still playing Glory

73
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
What’s on your mind

74
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,080
Retired person also are allowed to play glory

75
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Anyway, you are also idle

76
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Let's fight in the arena. I can pay for the materials.

77
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Don't cry when you lose

78
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't have to

79
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
I have many players who can accompany you to practice

80
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Don't play games with me

81
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
It seems that I will not be a trainer

82
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,200
for Wei Cao

83
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
Haven't given up yet.

84
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,080
Run inside this map for a few more days.

85
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
It is estimated that novice players

86
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,680
will consider you as a non-player character.

87
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Tang is angry here.

88
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
She is waiting that guy

89
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
to avenge

90
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
The loss was really a bit miserable.

91
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
But this is not necessarily a bad thing

92
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
The world of glory is big

93
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
She had to see the gap before she knew how to catch up.

94
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
What do you mean

95
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,840
Who let her start

96
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,880
to meet the peak of Glory

97
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,400
If you don't understand this

98
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
after losing more she would be crazy

99
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Don't talk unless you can speak good words

100
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
Write homework

101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,520
You

102
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
What if I lose

103
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
It is good to win or not

104
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Xiao Tang is foolhardy.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
which can be her advantage

106
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Looks like Wang Dayan's material

107
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,080
I have to take it

108
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,920
It's not impossible to practice with others.

109
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
But on one condition

110
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
I have a sister on my side

111
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,920
If you want to fight me, you have to go through her level first.

112
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,080
Good

113
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
This is the cake I bought for Xiao Tang.

114
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Why did you eat it

115
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
You spit it out for me

116
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
Boss

117
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Xiao Tang is too busy to eat

118
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
Still fighting

119
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,080
It's been almost two hours.

120
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,760
Then why don't you persuade her

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,160
Don't go to

122
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
I said your wings are hard now

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,200
Dare to talk back to the boss, don't you

124
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,120
To persuade her to come and eat a cake

125
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay, if you don't go

126
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
I will fire you

127
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,280
Okay, I'll go

128
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
It's you who wants she play Glory every day.

129
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
It is also you who do not want it.

130
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
The timing of this transition is really difficult to handle.

131
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,960
What are you whispering about

132
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
What do you want to say?

133
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,320
Isn't this very good

134
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
Go and have a rest and drink some water.

135
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
The pause is for a better victory

136
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
You are mocking me

137
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,080
What's good about losing ten games

138
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
Lose ten times

139
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
In the first set, you fought with the Magician

140
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,760
In 19 seconds, defeated by three traps in a row.

141
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
The second round is Battlemage

142
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,680
Twenty-two seconds

143
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,840
With a counterattack

144
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
In the third set, the deceitful sword lost after 26 seconds.

145
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,240
Lose in not seeing the situation clearly

146
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
But wear off half of the other side's blood.

147
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,080
The fourth set was 33 seconds.

148
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,200
41 seconds in the fifth set

149
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
And the 10th set just now

150
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
You persevered for a whole minute and a half.

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
You are improving though you are losing.

152
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
You won't eat twice for the same loss.

153
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,480
Do you feel this

154
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
My goal is to defeat my opponent.

155
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
Not to count the seconds

156
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,520
This is difficult

157
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,560
What do you mean?

158
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,160
In the last round, we will fight against the Magician

159
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,040
Although you supported an unprecedented one and a half minutes

160
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
But was trapped three times in succession.

161
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,600
The other party cheated you out of all the tricks at the beginning.

162
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,080
At the back of the Dragon Teeth and Sky Hit also played too early

163
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
Half blocked by the opponent

164
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Has anyone ever told you

165
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
Chuan-style eyebrow can cause arrhythmia

166
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,480
What nonsense

167
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,440
In addition to the glory of the PK technology

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
Most of the time it is psychological warfare.

169
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Strong play is your advantage.

170
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
If being led by the nose

171
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,600
Then you will become your soft rib

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,840
There's another showdown. Come on, champ

173
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,400
Xiao Tang, you have been playing for more than two hours.

174
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Take a break and have a cake.

175
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Xiao Tang,

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Let me fight him

177
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
I especially want to fight now.

178
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,600
Let me fight

179
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,560
Just leave it to me.

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
Eat cake

181
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,560
If you have been working so hard recently

182
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
I authorize you not to study for one day, okay

183
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
Good good study day day up

184
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
I love learning.

185
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,280
Then

186
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
The weapon you saw last time in Kongji City

187
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll buy it for you

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
Don't

189
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,520
Can I make a cake for you myself?

190
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Don't want to eat.

191
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,520
Guoguo

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm really angry.

193
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,400
And you can’t make me happy

194
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
Can’t

195
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,760
Then I will leave you alone

196
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,920
It seems to accompany you to go out to play

197
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,000
would not interest you either

198
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
This works

199
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
Finally, there is a way

200
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,920
That's a deal this time

201
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
No matter where you want to go, what do you want to eat

202
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,640
I promise you I will be on call when you call me.

203
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,560
I want milk tea

204
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,040
No problem. I'll line up to buy it for you

205
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I want to eat cake.

206
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll make it for you myself.

207
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,480
I want to eat hot pot

208
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,240
Then whenever we like

209
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,160
We can go to eat

210
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't be angry, okay

211
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
Then you have to accompany me more in the future.

212
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
You can't keep brushing copies.

213
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
Keep your words

214
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,520
Sure

215
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Then I have to think about which to eat first

216
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
Thirty-five

217
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Thirty-six

218
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,400
You go left

219
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,680
I said, are you stupid?

220
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,640
If I let you go left, you go left.

221
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Why go right?

222
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,040
Do you have any reaction speed?

223
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm telling you, it's good that you met me.

224
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,280
You must be in trouble when you meet someone else.

225
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,320
Do you know it

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,840
Sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

227
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,640
Mechanical keyboard you also play electronic competition

228
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Playing Glory? Which District and What profession

229
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
Have you ever taken a copy of the record

230
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm telling you, I'm a great Ranger.

231
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,640
When you are free, , I will take you to brush a copy.

232
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
How about?

233
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
By the way, where are you going

234
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,080
I'll-I'll find an Internet cafe

235
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,920
All right, let's go. I'll give you a ride

236
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,800
I told you.

237
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,560
The master said that my reaction speed can be fast

238
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
Clever and savvy

239
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
It is very suitable to be a professional player.

240
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,800
The way I look at you

241
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,240
should play Glory very bad

242
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,440
But don't lose heart

243
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
I did the same when I first started playing.

244
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,320
After a period of time

245
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
The master taught me a lot

246
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,280
Thank you. I'll just get off at the front.

247
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
What do you take me for

248
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
Am I the kind of person who gives up halfway

249
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,840
I will do what I promised

250
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Sit down

251
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,760
What's the name of your account? I'll add you.

252
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
Or you add me

253
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,440
I tell you in Glory

254
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I am the super fierce Ranger

255
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
My account number is

256
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,120
Stop, stop, stop, stop

257
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,320
Why are you in such a hurry

258
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,640
This is Xingxin Internet Cafe

259
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,240
I am using actual actions

260
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
to teach you another trick

261
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
Too much equals less

262
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,360
Be careful in the future.

263
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,000
Good

264
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Let's see each other

265
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
Some other day

266
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,720
Thank you

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,360
Hello

268
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,600
Excuse me, is Jun Moxiao here?

269
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
He's in there

270
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,840
Thank you

271
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,160
Jun Moxiao

272
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Jun Moxiao

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
Jun Moxiao

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you Jun Moxiao

275
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,160
Jun Moxiao, Jun Moxiao

276
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,080
You are the Jun Moxiao

277
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,920
It's me.

278
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,560
I am Steamed Bun.

279
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,320
Boss, this is called predestination

280
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,200
For you

281
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,640
This may be just a small chance encounter

282
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
But for me,

283
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,240
But a bitter waiting for a long time of encounter

284
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,640
Hello, my name is Qiao Yifan

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
What predecessors

286
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
This is my boss

287
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,520
The sky can only be ranked second.

288
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
Do you understand this relationship

289
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
Ah, what, thanks you

290
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
Hello, my name is Qiao Yifan

291
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
I am the Assassin, Grey Moon

292
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,080
I want to follow

293
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
You want to brush a copy with him, don't you

294
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,520
No, I don't think so

295
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,160
Do you want to see the true face of a Smart umbrella?

296
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
No

297
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
Last time you told me

298
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
What was the last time

299
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,840
This is not the first time you have seen each other.

300
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,360
When?

301
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,000
Which year, which month, which day, which hour, which minute, which second

302
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,160
Before or after knowing me

303
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Boss

304
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,280
Did you admit it or not

305
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,680
I am your big disciple

306
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,600
Of course

307
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
Later, every morning to open the door

308
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,080
Give it to you.

309
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Then you admit it

310
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
I am your big disciple

311
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,080
I just admit you to do job for me.

312
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,600
My big disciple Han Yanrou

313
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
Is there

314
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Han Yanrou

315
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,600
No wonder you are so spirited in Glory.

316
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Brilliant, fresh and free from vulgarity

317
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Han Yanrou I knew it

318
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,440
You must be a man

319
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,440
You play heartbeat with a female number.

320
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,480
Is it right?

321
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Who are you

322
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,520
I’m Steamed Bun

323
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Steamed Bun

324
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,480
Steamed Bun?

325
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
Let's change places.

326
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,160
Master has been here since your retirement.

327
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Yes, to be a network manager here

328
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,120
Why do you do network manager work

329
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,160
This is the closest profession to Glory

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,840
If I can't get back to Wei Cao this time

331
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
I think I don't even have the courage to log in to Glory.

332
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
Then watch the play

333
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,120
Relax mood

334
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,000
There is a very good play recently.

335
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
Have you seen it?

336
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
Escape is useful but shameful

337
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,080
Elder, I actually don't have much time to watch the play.

338
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Because ..

339
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,200
Even if I spend all my time training

340
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,760
There is still a big gap between them

341
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,640
I am always the one who drags

342
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,160
So until now

343
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,000
I have never been to a real match before.

344
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,000
But I still want to play

345
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,160
You sure

346
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,960
I don't want to give up like this.

347
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,480
Then change your career and practice

348
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,840
Trickster

349
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Find the right direction

350
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
It is much more important than working hard.

351
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
But Master

352
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't even know how to be an Assassin.

353
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,160
And at my current level

354
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,200
If I practice a career from scratch, I will

355
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Then change your career and practice

356
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,440
Our team has a Trickster already

357
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,320
There will be no need for a second one.

358
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
Find the right direction

359
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
It is much more important than working hard.

360
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
You are going to change your fate

361
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
Not to give up fate.

362
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
What do you think

363
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,480
Actually let the professional team to help you to brush a copy

364
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
Can you afford to lose the match?

365
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Boss Tao, I admit it

366
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I, Chen Yehui, am sometimes selfish.

367
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,240
But I swear

368
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,320
I have never thought of harming Jiashi.

369
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
You said such a Jiashi

370
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,600
Even now no one gives way to the captain.

371
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,200
It seems that you are really going downhill

372
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,720
Only those on high can go downhill.

373
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
People who have always been low

374
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
That's desperate

375
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,680
On my first day in Jiashi

376
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
You look down on me

377
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,280
Who is the boss here

378
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,600
Where is the boss

379
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,080
Where is the boss

380
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
Thank you

381
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,160
Our network manager is getting more and more handsome.

382
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,120
What are you doing here

383
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,800
Be a network manager

384
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah

385
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,880
How about?

386
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,720
Accustomed to the days when others wait on you.

387
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Are you used to serving others in turn now?

388
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Thank you for thinking. I'm used to it

389
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
What if you are not used to it?

390
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,680
Who made you so low-key

391
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,400
Without Leaf of Autumn

392
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
no one seems to know you anymore

393
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,840
Yeah, unlike you

394
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,800
So high profile publicity

395
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,120
But still no one knows

396
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,320
Our captain

397
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,840
Now they have all become network manager of Internet cafes.

398
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,000
How can you speak so harshly?

399
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
But it doesn't matter

400
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,280
Those of us who are presidents

401
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,880
Contact with many people every day.

402
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Top to the boss

403
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,600
Down to these network managers in internet cafe

404
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
We all have to take care of it

405
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Be president

406
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,080
It is not enough just to deal with people.

407
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,920
It depends on strength.

408
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
You used to be a team member

409
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,480
Is too much effort to win the hearts of the people

410
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,920
But not good thinking to improve their own strength

411
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680
To be eliminated by the team

412
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
I didn't expect you come to the guild.

413
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,040
still in these crooked brains

414
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
What makes you judge me

415
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
What have you done since you came to the guild?

416
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
How many copies of the records do you take

417
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
What is the increase in membership

418
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,080
You are not good at management.

419
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
Then drew the whole team to fight

420
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
It's no use

421
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,760
How do you know?

422
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
If glory is not regarded as love

423
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,160
I advise you to leave as early as possible.

424
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,800
Who do you still think you are?

425
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,800
You are a broken network manager

426
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,400
What qualifications do you have to teach me?

427
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Turn on a machine for me.

428
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Network management, Ye

429
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,960
The hospitality taught by our boss

431
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
may not be suitable for drunkards.

432
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,920
Please wake up and come again

433
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,840
Okay, then we'll see you soon

434
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,400
looking forward to your next visit

435
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Okay, I'm almost there.

436
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,160
Nothing

437
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
Brothers from the First Canyon

438
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,520
was basically wiped out.

439
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Can you brush the copy well?

440
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
For the sake of that disturbing material

441
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
is it worthy

442
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,440
Can you keep some order

443
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,200
Jun Moxiao is not asking for a little material

444
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,720
A lot

445
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
To invite Jun Moxiao to brush a copy

446
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,720
Almost sent out the elite team

447
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,200
And rob each boss they saw

448
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
Not just Line of Canyon

449
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,840
Take a trip to any copy these days.

450
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
All the same

451
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,720
It is shura battlefield

452
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
The Jianghu is chaotic

453
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Xi Zhou.

454
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Look for yourself

455
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Copy of Record Brush by Master Brother

456
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,480
It really helped us a lot.

457
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,320
The growth of our membership

458
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
is obvious to all

459
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,760
But don't forget

460
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,800
The amount of tasks assigned by the top team

461
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,960
But also follow to improve

462
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
Look at this killing every day

463
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,520
The rhythm of being crushed

464
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,200
This month's results are worrying again.

465
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,520
This is the so-called Ju Moxiao

466
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
Brings both win and lose

467
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,840
Don't tell me those stupid words.

468
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,040
How is the feedbacks from agents

469
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,160
we arranged in other guilds.

470
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,560
It's not easy either.

471
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,280
All scratching their heads to find a way

472
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,400
Master, where are we going

473
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Shopping

474
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
Shopping

475
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,000
Shopping

476
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
This is Kongji City

477
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
It is one of the formal main cities on the glorious continent.

478
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,240
All players can trade equipment here.

479
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,240
Buy supplies

480
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,400
The most important thing to do is

481
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,800
After the character was killed in battle

482
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,280
You can choose to return to the city and continue fighting after resurrection.

483
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,160
There is a barrier at the gate of the city.

484
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
It is equivalent to a huge protective cover.

485
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,760
It is forbidden to fight in the city, but it is not allowed to fight out of the city.

486
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,560
This empty city

487
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,040
Later is our stronghold

488
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
After brushing so many copies

489
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,440
Finally, we can enter the city.

490
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,800
Boss, look at this bloodsucking claw I picked

491
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
Isn't it handsome?

492
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,840
The weapon of 800 gold coins is different

493
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,240
Of course, all the gold coins have been spent for you.

494
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,320
Thank you, boss.

495
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
Buy things and become the boss

496
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,040
This is too obvious for you, isn't it?

497
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
Boss

498
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,200
You also buy a weapon for Tang rou's sister

499
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,840
She shouldn’t beat me without orange weapon.

500
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,840
Weapons are not that important to me.

501
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,760
The examination is about to begin.

502
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,520
I'm exhausted

503
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Let's go. Hurry

504
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Let's go.

505
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,920
Come on

506
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,840
You also cheer

507
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,120
The first training camp evaluation test is about to begin.

508
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,880
Let's go now

509
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,400
Good

510
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,760
Tang rou sister go so fast, why

511
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,240
Let me show you my new weapon.

512
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,040
Watch out for ambushes

513
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
Just in time

514
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
Let me try my new weapon

515
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,960
Team 2, firearms

516
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
and thermal missile preparation

517
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,600
Team 2 roger that.

518
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,240
Battlemage in Team 1,

519
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,400
flame strike preparation

520
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,760
The newly changed equipment has an influence on attack speed and moving speed.

521
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,240
Pay attention to adaptation

522
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
Got it

523
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,600
The attack speed improved do the timing right.

524
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
With the orange weapon

525
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,440
I feel that I run very fast.

526
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,080
Like a rocket under your feet

527
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
Boss, after my character runs out of blood

528
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,040
I will drop equipment, right

529
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
I have to watch out for such a good weapon.

530
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,520
Don't be blown away by others.

531
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,520
Return to Kongji City first

532
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Another one to look for abuse

533
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,280
An inch of Grey, Trickster

534
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,600
Who is this person

535
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
Are you helping us or killing us?

536
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Steamed Bun attack

537
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,200
And Tang separated by 60 degrees angle out of position

538
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,520
The two men staggered the attack time by 30 seconds.

539
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,720
Yifan watch our attack rhythm

540
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Judging the arranging position in advance

541
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,480
Got it

542
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,200
Are you that little broth I brought with me

543
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,080
Not bad, you

544
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
The rhythm is well mastered.

545
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,240
Continue refueling

546
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,080
Don't waste your time in formation.

547
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,320
The cooling time is well controlled.

548
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,720
Ensure maximum efficiency

549
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,600
Yes

550
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Cooperate with Han Yanrou

551
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,240
Miss it

552
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,080
Be careful

553
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
Don't panic and stabilize your hand speed.

554
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Give up the ice array and trick array first

555
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Moonlight array follows

556
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Don't mess up if you make mistakes.

557
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,880
The more urgent the situation is

558
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,840
The more you can exercise your mind and judgment

559
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
Got it

560
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,200
A knife array blessing

561
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
Trickster

562
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,240
Seize the opportunity and coordinate at the same time.

563
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,320
