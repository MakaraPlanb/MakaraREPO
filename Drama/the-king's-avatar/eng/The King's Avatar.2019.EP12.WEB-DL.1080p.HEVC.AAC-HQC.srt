=Episode 12=

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
You're kiding me, right?

3
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,040
I thought we had a deal

4
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,480
on the Line Canyon Dungeon!

5
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,760
What's with the sudden change?

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm not doing dungeon no more.

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
What?

8
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,080
Please don't tell me

9
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
some one bought you off.

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,760
Hell no!I can double my offer!

11
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,780
Name your price for the Line Canyon Dungeon,

12
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,625
Lanxi Pavilion must have the record.

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
I don't care about your offer.

14
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm done with dungeons.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
What? Why?

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
You don't want all these materials?

17
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,120
You retired now?

18
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,855
You're not quitting this, are you, master?

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
You can't do that!

20
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
You know Lanxi Pavilion wasn't involved

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
with what happened in Kongzhi Forest.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,640
I'm done with the leveling,

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,490
but I can still get you

24
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,950
the first dungeon kill.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,880
You won't help us with the dungeon,

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
but you gonna get us the record?

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,760
I don't understand.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,840
You wanna take a look at it?

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,240
It's good.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
OK.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Master, are you with me?

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
Let me show you something.

34
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:04,315

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,120

you'll break the recored for sure.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,040

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
So, you wanna give it a go?

I'm in!

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,080
Nail it!

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
So from now on, we're selling strategy guides

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
in exchange of the materials we need?

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
When god closes a door,

48
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,155
he opens a window.

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,800
Ain't no fun in it. I would rather get them by myself.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
We have to say thank you to those who put us down.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,160
They made us realize

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
life gets even easier if you're on the floor.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,080
So, you don't need me

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
for the dungeons in the future.

55
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:06,815
What? Wanna take a sick leave again?

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
You're done with insomnia,

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,480
what's next?

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,480
Anxiety.

59
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,025
You're too young

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
to have anxiety.

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,420
All those weekends at All-Star Game,

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
you were with me.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
This year you're not around.

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,040
It just feels wrong.

65
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,240
You were there for the past seven years.

66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Why don't you

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
just consider it to be a habit of yours

68
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,000
and come with me.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
And do what?

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,060
To be there for me!

71
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
I even got the tickets ready!

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Guess I'm not the only one you invited.

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Just for your company.

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
Gotta set you up with two bouncers.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,840
You are the God of Fights.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,800
Or

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,200
you can come

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
with a figure board of Leaf of Autumn.

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
I can

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,840
take photos for you.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Are you even listening?

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
You're quite multitasking.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Talking while enjoying your coffee.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Here.

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,000
A real man

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,800
gives no damn to coffee stains.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Ye Xiu,

88
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm heading back to Jia Shi.

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
You're going back to Xing Xin I guess.

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
I'll see you

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
at the ALL-Star Game.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Well,

93
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
talking sweat to me.

94
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,505
I wonder where she got that from.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,700
=Xing Xin Net Cafe=

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
Xiao Ming promised that he'll come up

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,520
with the tickets for All-Star.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
And he didn't

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,280
send us the tickets yet!

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
I have all the supporting goods ready!

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
Can we really count on him?

102
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Xiao Ming haven't showed up

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
since Master retired.

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
I can‘t get hold of him either.

105
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,280
Then what should we do?

106
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,640
All-Star's tomorrow!

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Should we just sit outside and watch?

108
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,200
I can't do that!

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,780
I have to be there!

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
What happened? Who got on her nerves again?

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,440
Our boss is not getting

112
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
the All-Star tickets that she's been looking forward to.

113
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,280
Right, Bro. Ye,

114
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
these two boxes down here,

115
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
would you mind move them over there?

116
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,835
What a fake.

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Boss, here‘re your boxes.

118
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,115
Just put them here.

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Where?

120
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,220
On the floor!

121
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,085
What should I do?

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
It's so...

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,760
Xiao Ming, you did it!

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,720
He got us two free tickets.

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
That's three in total.

126
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,560
Tomorrow you and I and Xiao Tang,

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,840
the three of us will go together.

128
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,480
What about my shift?

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,980
I am the boss!

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,400
Of course.

131
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
Right?

132
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Now your boss

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
is taking you out for the event

134
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
and you can only say yes.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
You know what?

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Take these two boxes

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
with you tomorrow.

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
Work for your ticket,

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
OK?

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,480
Wait, take them

141
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,520
to the front desk.

142
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Be very careful with them!

143
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
They

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
worth more that your life.

145
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,800
Especially that figure board!

146
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,160
It's the same price as your monthly pay.

147
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
Or

148
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,640
you can come

149
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,735
with the figure board of Leaf of Autumn.

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,280
I can

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,800
take your photos.

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,240
Did she know about this

153
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,355
and gave me those tickets on purpose?

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,280
All-Star Game, here we come!

155
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,180

Where's everybody?

158
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,920
Where's Ye Xiu? Did he get on the bus?

159
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,520
Yes, I guess?

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,680

161
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,000
Please support Ye Qiu!

193
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,120
Thank you.

194
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Support Ye Qiu!

195
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,720
Master of Leaf of Autumn.

196
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
Thank you for your support.

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,720
Thank you.

198
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,600
Where have you been?

199
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
The rest shops

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,480
are ready,

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
they're all here.

202
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
It's time to enter.

203
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
Hurry up.

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Please come and take a look at

205
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,920
the real master of Leaf of Autumn.

206
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,360
Ye Qiu!

207
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,920
Come!

208
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,680
This way.

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Support Jia Shi!

210
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,680
They're free.

211
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,360
Xiao Ming, you're here.

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,720
I thought you won't be here.

213
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,000
Glad you made it.

214
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Thanks for the tickets.

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
I know they're difficult to get.

216
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,920
It must be hard for yuo.

217
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,040
What's with you for this month?

218
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,440
I haven't seen you talked in the group chat.

219
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,840
You knew about Master, right?

220
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,960
Yes.

221
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
This is the only picture of Ye Qiu

222
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
and Leaf of Autumn.

223
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
I had someone

224
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
printed this for me.

225
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,880
We'll give it to everyone.

226
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,360
It is the right time

227
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,800
to let all people know

228
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,160
that Master is the true top of Glory.

229
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
You take this.

230
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,000
Guo Guo,

231
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,800
Ye Qiu was the to.

232
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,040
Now he's not.

233
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
What the heck you talking about?

234
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,600
Guo Guo, Ye Qiu retired.

235
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
Sun Xiang, god of fights.

236
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Now is Sun Xiang's turn in Jia Shi.

237
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,480
Sun Xiang, god of fights, Sun Xiang!

238
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
I don't know where you got these tickets,

239
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,520
but now

240
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,080
Ye Qiu is no longer a member of Jia Shi

241
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,680
Let me help you with this.

242
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,920
You should get going.

243
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Xiao Ming, this is not fun.

244
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,840
I've known you for ages.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
We've always been the fans of Ye Qiu Master.

246
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,360
Why don't you get it?

247
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,280
Idols have timings too.

248
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,160
Three years ago,Ye Qiu was Master.

249
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,160
Now Sun Xiang is Master.

250
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,280
That's their thing.

251
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,320
It's none of our bussness..

252
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
Their thing is not our concern.

253
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,920
And Glory is not your concern either.

254
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,440
Come.

255
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,440
Stay there!

256
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Get away!

257
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,280
Get away from Ye Qiu.

258
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,800
Don't touch it.

259
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,480
Move the table.

260
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
All of them.

261
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,720
Guo Guo, are you OK?

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,800
Boss, get up.

263
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Guo Guo,

264
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,440
we'll take the things back.

265
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,000
I never

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
need to follow a trendy idol

267
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,280
for the feeling of belonging,

268
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,120
that's just a trend.

269
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,640
Look.

270
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,720
Do something!

271
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,520
What can I do?You got ideas?

272
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,520
I don't know.

273
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Let's do it together.

274
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,280
OK.

275
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,280
Ye Qiu's not coming back?

276
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,440
This is a waste of time.

277
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I'm a joke.

278
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
Guo Guo, you know Ye Qiu the best.

279
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
He wouldn't be beaten by Sun Xiang.

280
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
He's hiding somewhere

281
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
waiting to fight back to Glory.

282
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
He knows that

283
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,080
you‘re supporting him.

284
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,960
It doesn't matter

285
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,600
whether he come back or not.

286
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,680
What's the meaning of all this

287
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,160
if he won't be back?

288
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
Yeah?Then what's the meaning

289
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,960
of all this

290
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
if he is back?

291
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
All you're doing

292
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,320
is self satisfiction.

293
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,880
I think

294
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,760
to you

295
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
or to him

296
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,680
it's meaningless.

297
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
I always want to know

298
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
what is idol.

299
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,080
Is it a person, a word,

300
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,080
or a power?

301
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,680
Guo Guo.

302
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,080
She can handle it.

303
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
Come,take a look at this.

304
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,000
Guo Guo,

305
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,440
I don't know what you think idol is,

306
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,760
but I know what I'm after.

307
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,920
Make impossible possible.

308
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
That's what Ye Qiu brought me.

309
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
As loog as Ye Qiu's spirit lives

310
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,360
I'll follow it no matter what.

311
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
That's my Glory.

312
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,480
You should have seen it.

313
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,080
I drop that line,

314
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,360
and then I just left.

315
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Chill as a cucumber.

316
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll go get you right now.

317
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,520
Boss.

318
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Down here.

319
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,440
Down here.

320
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,760
Down here.

321
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
Guo Guo,I'll get you something to drink.

322
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,040
OK.

323
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
Who gave me these tickets?

324
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,840
Besides Xiao Ming

325
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
I didn't ask anyone for them.

326
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
It could be from some kind hearted man.

327
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,000
Kind hearted man?

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,480
What kind of kind hearted will offer me tickets

329
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,680
with

330
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
thess kind of great seats?

331
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,360
I'm telling you,

332
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,720
I used to sit at the far end.

333
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,560
Can you help me tie this?

334
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,560
Sorry,

335
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,360
excuse me.

336
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,360
Don't be silly.

337
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
So this is how it feels like

338
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,280
to sit here.

339
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Su Mucheng.

340
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,000
Su Mu!

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,520
Shish

342
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,120
Quite!

343
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,600
It is you!

344
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
The one who always sits on the stage

345
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,560
now sits under the stage.

346
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,680
Isn't it fun?

347
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
Right?

348
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,520
Yeah.

349
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,080
What do you want?

350
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,560
You tell me.

351
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,840
Can I take a picture with you?

352
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,560
OK.

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,080
Thank you!

354
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,600
Come.

355
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
What is that badge?

356
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,320
Can I see it?

357
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,720
Of course.

358
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,240
That's cute.

359
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,840
It's limited version for Ye Qiu's fan.

360
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,600
So you're Ye Qiu's fan as well.

361
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Yep.

362
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm the No.1 fan

363
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,200
of Ye Qiu‘s fan club.

364
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,920
But there's not much

365
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,080
of us left now.

366
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,760
You like it?

367
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,800
You can have it if you want.

368
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,200
Let me.

369
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,480
Let me.

370
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,080
So today on,

371
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm fan NO.2

372
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,160
in fan club of Ye Qiu.

373
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,360
I'm under your watch now.

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,160
You bet.

375
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,280
Well

376
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
I have something to ask you.

377
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,080
Sure.

378
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
Are you still in touch of Ye Qiu

379
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,600
after he retired?

380
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,520
He'll be back

381
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
with Glory?

382
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,440
I'll tell you a secret.

383
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,280
I think

384
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,000
you'll be seeing him soon.

385
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
You gotta be kidding me!

386
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,280
Stop it!

387
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,000
For real!

388
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
But I don't even know

389
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,920
what he looks like.

390
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,320
He wears that black mask

391
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
in every game.

392
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,800
What is he like?

393
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,120
How could I know it was him if I saw him?

394
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
It's Su Mucheng.

395
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Stop taking pictures!

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,120
I have to go.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,560
Bye.

398
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,080
Bye.

399
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,760
By the way,Ye Qiu looks just so so.

400
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,560
Two eyes and a nose.

401
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,360
Just like everybody else.

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
But when you see him,

403
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,160
don't be disappointed at the Master.

404
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,800
And thanks for your badge.

405
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,760
Bye.

406
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,680
Bye!

407
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,720
Today is my day!

408
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
I got the best seat!

409
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,200
And I bounped into Su Mucheng.

410
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
It was Su Mucheng!

411
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
It's just Su Mucheng.

412
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
What do you know?

413
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,080
And you!

414
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,200
He was sitting right here

415
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,240
and you didn't even say hello.

416
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,840
I shouldn't had brought you.

417
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Rou Rou is back.

418
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,160
Thank you.

419
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,000
What's with the sudden high?

420
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Nothing, just the power of idol.

421
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Hello, sir.

422
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,240

430
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760

446
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
that I'm the leader of Jia Shi.

447
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,680
I'm better than Ye Qiu.

448
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,920
Go!

449
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,880

Glory All-Star Game.

464
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,720
Are you ready for it?

465
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,800
Yes!

466
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,360
Now

467
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,200
let's bring all

468
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,080
teams out first.

469
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,840
They're the Thunders.

470
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,520
Jia Shi.

471
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,440
Blue Rain.

472
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,400
Ambitions.

473
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,440
Wei Cao.

474
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,320
Xu Kong.

475
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,520
Welcome for all of you coming here!

476
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,840
Glory

477
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,440
has been with us for the past ten years.

478
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,680
In these ten years,

479
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,040
we have so many young talents

480
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,160
to bring livelyness to Glory.

481
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,120
But we also won't forget

482
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,440
those names

483
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,680
no longer in the League.

484
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,680
They made

485
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
Glory great.

486
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,240
Now let's recall

487
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,920
on those retired players

488
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,960
who made the Glory.

489
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
And let's appauls

490
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,920
for all these people who devoted their youth to Glory.

491
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,840
Veterans never die,Glory forever.

492
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,560
This stage will remember

493
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,240
you as fighters.

494
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,560
MVP

495
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,200
new talents challenge show.

496
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,040
I bet all of you know what that is.

497
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,360
To new gamers,

498
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,440
this is their chance

499
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,320
to challenge the best.

500
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
For player who's familiar with the game,

501
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,840
it's also fun

502
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,840
to play with someone new.

503
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,760
Now the first challenger today

504
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,840
is ready to go.

505
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,120
Let's look at the screen

506
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,360
and Welcome our first newbie!

507
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,920
Gao Yingjie from Wei Cao.

508
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,280
Gao Yingjie! Gao Yingjie!

509
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,440
Who is this Gao Yingjie?

510
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,280
Neven seen him before.

511
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,040
Maybe he have played on public.

512
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,680
He's a promising rising start

513
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
in Wei Cao.

514
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,360
Well

515
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,280
I think Cap Jiexi

516
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
just brought him out for a test ride.

517
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,880
To introduce him.

518
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
Not so familiar with him.

519
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,520
Let's talk to Yingjie first.

520
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,840
What do you think of this?

521
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
I, I just choce

522
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
the same career like our Cap.

523
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,200
Scholar of Diabolism is the trade mark of Wei Cao.

524
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
So for today,

525
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,320
who would you like to challenge?

526
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,640
Cap, no

527
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,240
Gamer Wang Jiexi.

528
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,040
I'll buy you dinner if Cap lose.

529
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,640
Not fair!

530
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,080
You just want me to buy you dinner.

531
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,560
You heard that?

532
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,760
Fake friends.

533
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,760
Mind your words.

534
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
Fake friends?

535
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,080
Don't you know

536
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,560
he's tight with Qiao Yifan?

537
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,840
You didn't say it.

538
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,200
Now let's welcome Captain of Wei Cao.

539
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,280
How would he know?

540
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
I think Wang Jiexi will win.

541
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,960
What do you say?

542
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,160
Right?

543
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Welcome, Wang Jiexi

544
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Welcome our Cap.

545
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,160
Now both players

546
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,680
are on broad.

547
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,520
Welcome.

548
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,400
I cann't imagine

549
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,280
Yingjie

550
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,000
is going after his Cap.

551
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
Wang Jiexi, AKA magician.

552
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
And their characters

553
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,880
both Mu En and Cowherb Seed are of the same career.

554
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,560
To face the most powerful Diabolism Scholar,

555
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,200
Gao Yingjie is trying to prove himself.

556
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
First show in All-Star

557
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,160
is already fun.

558
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,440
Alright, let's head back to the game.

559
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,400
First show in All-Star Young talents Challenge.

560
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,360
Gao Yingjie VS.Wang Jiexi

561
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,160
Forest map.

562
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,840
Forest map

563
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,520
is perfect for hiding.

564
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
So if one party plays snicky in the woods,

565
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
you can't really locate him.

566
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,000
We can see Mu En is being cautious.

567
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,720
He found a hide-away

568
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,040
in the woods.

569
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,240
Look like he's getting some pressure facing his Cap.

570
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
Cowherb Seed is searching above the woods.

571
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,400
Mu En has a good starting position.

572
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,640
He advoided being in the purview of Cowherb Seed.

573
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,320
So if it continues like this,

574
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,960
who ever finds the other player first

575
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,760
will have a great first-hand advantage.

576
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,760
Cowherb Seed is sensitive.

577
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
He is marching

578
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,200
right towards Mu En.

579
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
They are about to make contact.

580
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Holly,Mu En just got busted.

581
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,880
Wang Jiexi plays tough!

582
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,600
He pinpointed the location

583
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,760
of Xiao Gao at once.

584
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,640
And attacked right away.

585
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,880
We can see Gao Yingjie is not ready for this.

586
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
He's been retreating

587
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,400
ever since he's exposed.

588
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,760
He has no chance to strick back.

589
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,800
Mu En's HP

590
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
is down to 68%.

591
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,200
Wang Jiexi

592
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
is kiling him!

593
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,760
He's taking it way too serious.

594
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Isn't it just a warn up game

595
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,960
for his new player?

596
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,880
而且话说And to be honest,

597
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,920
this doesn't look like Wang Jiexi's style.

598
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,520
That's right.

599
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,760
And we're not sure who will be the winner yet.

600
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,320
There are

601
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,720
different kinds of shows.

602
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,400
This might be the biggest weakness
when they're fighting againest the experienced.

603
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,560
Let's hope Gao

604
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
will get used to this tempo fast.

605
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,040
Cause he's HP is running low.

606
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,000
Cowherb Seed has 85% left.

607
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,720
Nice!

608
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,520
Mu En uesd

609
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,800
the second before Cowherb Seed's skill explode

610
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,680
and got away nicely.

611
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,080
Will that be the turning point of this game?

612
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,000
Cowherb Seed lost his target.

613
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,080
He seems stuck.

614
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,360
How would he handle this?

615
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,960
It seems that he's trying to predict Mu En's position.

616
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,080
No wonder they call him magician.

617
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
He has a great hanch for the overall picture.

618
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,480
He's moving towards Mu En.

619
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,240
Mu En is changing his position.

620
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,680
He's looking after a chance to attack.

621
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,080
Cowherb Seed is being cautious.

622
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,840
Cowherb Seed didn't fly low,

623
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
he used the lava bottle

624
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,360
and set the surrounding on fire.

625
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,400
He is trying to make Mu En show himself.

626
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,240
Wang Jiexi is playing it hard with no mercy.

627
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Xiao Gao went too far to try to challenge him

628
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,240
but he could have gone more subtle.

629
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,360
He might have done it

630
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,600
to provoke Xiao Gao's will to fight.

631
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,120
We see now that Mu En is surrounded by fire.

632
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,200
He's being burned.

633
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,240
HP's running low!

634
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,040
If he don't find a way out now

635
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,520
he might lose the final shot.

636
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,840
What is he waitng for?

637
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,920
You think Gao Yingjie got a better tactic?

638
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,040
Mu En is still in the flame.

639
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,800
if this continues,

640
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Mu En will vanish into dust.

641
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
Yes, we can see his HP is still dropping.

642
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,080
If he don't move right now,

643
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
then this is the end of the game.

644
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:28,920
That's right.

645
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,640
It is very bad for Mu En.

646
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,800
He needs to adjust his position

647
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,440
right now, immediately!

648
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,320
Cap!

649
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,440
I, I'm not ready for this.

650
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
That's OK.

651
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,560
It doesn't matter who the winner will be.

652
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,200
What really matters

653
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,640
is that you have to give it your best.

654
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,400
You're very gifted.

655
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,880
What you have to do,

656
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,120
is just show them what you've really got.

657
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
We're not afraid to lose and we will alway fight.

658
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,880
That's the spirit!

659
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,320
OK?

660
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Mu En is making his move!

661
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,600
He moved!

662
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,640
He made it out of the flame!

663
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
Cowherb Seed is right behind him.

664
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,800
They're about to make contact!

665
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,960
This is a fight all about skills.

666
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,200
We can see

667
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,760
that both of them are taking the advantages of the forest

668
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,000
and avoiding opponent's attacks through the change of position.

669
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,640
Their HPs are getting closer!

670
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,840
Nice play for Xiao Gao!

671
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,960
A fast chase like this

672
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,720
is only possible

673
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
among Diabolism Scholars.

674
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,600
Yes,

675
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,280
only among the very best.

676
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,080
Xiao Gao was outstanding.

677
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,840
This is the battle between two magicians.

678
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,600
Yes, looks like Gao Yingjie from Wei Cao

679
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,960
will be the successor of magician.

680
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
Thunder chains and locked!

681
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,000
Holy, Mu En is in danger.

682
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
If he falls

683
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,040
he'll lose.

684
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Mu En, come on!

685
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,840
If you don't trust yourself in winning,

686
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,400
no matter how many times you pratice,

687
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,000
you'll never win.

688
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,920
You have to trust in you!

689
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,760
Come on!

690
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,040
Nice!Mu En didn't give up.

691
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,440
Great!Besom Whirl!

692
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
Very limited distance!

693
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,040
He hit Cowherb Seed

694
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,960
at the very second they encounter.

695
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,520
What a great newbie!

696
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,440
With a disvantange like this,

697
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,080
he manage to even their HPs.

698
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,880
Now that the HPs of the two players are almost the same.

699
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,960
In battles fast like this one,

700
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,600
one mistake

701
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,360
will cause their life.

702
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,200
He is good.

703
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,360
He is a rising star.

704
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,920
Wang Jiexi might actually lose.

705
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,640
That is really good.

706
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,400
Such a powerful new comer!

707
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Both HPs are red now!

708
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,880
It's about to end.

709
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,120
The last strike!

710
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,920
At the same time!

711
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,520
They released the Star-Rays at the same time!

712
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,680
We don't have a clear view

713
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,120
of what really happened in there.

714
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,680
Who is the winner?

715
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,120
They were too fast!

716
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,160
Let's see who's the last one standing,

717
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,680
It was Mu En!

718
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,480
Mu En walked out alive!

719
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,880
Nice play!

720
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,360
Mu En survived!

721
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,920
The victory goes to newbie Gao Yingjie!

722
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
That was unbelievable.

723
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,120
Gao Yingjie had beaten

724
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,760
Wang Jiexi, his own Cap.

725
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,800
Yes, and that is the fun of games.

726
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,080
No one is a sure winner

727
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,760
before he really wins.

728
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,840
As long as you fight.

729
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,520
Yingjie won!

730
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,840
Am I dreaming?

731
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
My god!

732
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,040
Wang Jiexi lost!

733
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,040
No, Wang Jiexi didn't lose.

734
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,200
What do you mean?

735
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,040
Wang Jiexi did it on purpose.

736
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,080
He meant it?

737
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,520
No way!

738
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
I can tell if it's deliberate.

739
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,840
No freaking way.

740
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,000
He lower his skill point.

741
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,440
If that's the case

742
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,000
then it kind of make sence...

743
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,200
But why?

744
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,840
He didn't have to do it.

745
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,760
Even it's for someone from his own team.

746
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,160
What did Wang Jiexi do it for?

747
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,160
Simple,

748
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,080
for Wei Cao's future.

749
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,640
In pro-gaming,

750
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,040
some might strike back over painful failure.

751
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,280
Others need a victory at the right moment

752
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,520
to built his own confidence.

753
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,280
Gao Yingjie is the later.

754
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,200
That's why Wang Jiexi tried so hard

755
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,520
to let him win

756
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,520
even that means sacrifying himself.

757
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,600
He's a good captain.
