4
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:39,160
What are you looking for?

5
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,337
Since I can't stop other people,

6
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,860
Then I have to handle it internally.

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,220
How many locks you think I should put on the door of the attic?

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,780
What? Locks?
 

9
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,580
Or I can take down the stairs of the attic.

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,660
He is so indoorsy, anyway.

11
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,045
This should pose no problem for staying there for about ten days.

12
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:04,500
No. Guoguo.
 

13
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,540
What you are saying is being so weird.

14
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,780
I will give him the computer.

15
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,548
After all, it is enough to

16
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,140
have Glory in his world.

17
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,740
As long as he efface himself,

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,580
the journalists will not know.

19
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,920
Perfect.

20
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,000
That is way off base.

21
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,022
Even if he journalists won't come,

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,460
the police will come.

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,700
This way won't work.

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
That way won't work as well.

25
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:29,720
Then what should I do?

26
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,740
I can't think of any ways.

27
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:35,220
Guoguo, it's not that complicated
 

28
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,740
to keep him staying here.

29
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:39,468
Then what should I do?

30
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:45,740
Shall I

31
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,925
break his legs?

32
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:50,820
It is not that impractical.

33
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,045
As long as he has his hands.

34
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,220
Of course no.

35
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,137
What are you

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,700
thinking about right now?

37
00:02:58,253 --> 00:02:59,580
I mean,

38
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:01,560
to keep a person staying,

39
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,300
you should retain his heart.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,700
But how?

41
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:10,666
Two words.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,933
Spoiling him.

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,820
Spoiling him.

44
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,073
That's strange.

45
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,546
Why does nobody call me?

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,820
The plan is kind of cliche,

47
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,860
but he is a man.

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,700
It should work.

49
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,193
Chu, he's coming.
 

50
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:21,493
Ye,

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,000
You wake up.

52
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,180
Why not using the vacuum cleaner?

53
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,940
My boss said,

54
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,420
the vacuum cleaner is too noisy.

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,380
It may disturb you.

56
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,900
By the way,
 

57
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,780
the breakfast is ready.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,020
Eat it while it is warm.

59
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,460
It won't be tasty when it's cold.

60
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:41,420
What's going on?

61
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,300
This way. This way.
  

62
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:43,340
Come here. Come here.
  

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,900
From this one to that one,

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,180
they are all prepared for you.

65
00:04:58,446 --> 00:04:59,500
What's this?

66
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:00,580
Introduce now.
 

67
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:05,180
These are ten kinds of nutritious porridge.

68
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,500
Including Eight Ingredient Porridge,

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,860
Porridge with white fungus and lotus seeds,

70
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,820
and porridge with red bean and corn.

71
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,860
They are all prepared by the boss.

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,620
Of course.

73
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,460
What should I do now?
 

74
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,653
There is also salty porridge.

75
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,193
Well, Ye,
 

76
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,180
You don't like sweet porridge, do you?

77
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,660
There is also salty porridge here.

78
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,040
Like porridge with corn and spareribs, and shrimp meat porr...
 

79
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,340
Stop. That's enough.
 

80
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:37,173
I have a full understanding

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,553
of her minds.

82
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,260
Really?

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,686
She wants to use the carbohydrate

84
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
to make me overeat to death,

85
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,260
So that she could inherit my Glory equipment, right?
 

86
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:51,706
I see.

87
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,260
I won't be fooled.

88
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,833
No.

89
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:55,480
The express.

90
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,380
Ye, your express.
 

91
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,733
Your express has arrived.

92
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,540
What else?

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,060
Hello. It's your express.
 

94
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,020
It's too hard to please him.
 

95
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,460
What's this?

96
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,380
This is...

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,380
This is a coffee maker the boss bought for you.

98
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:19,306
In the morning,

99
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,980
She can grind coffee beans for you.

100
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,033
At night,

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,620
She can make the cold brew coffee.

102
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:26,346
Whatever you like.

103
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,820
Please sign.

104
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,580
Suning delivers the parcel so fast.

105
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,340
She thinks I don't stay up late enough.

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,820
wants me to work overtime everyday.

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,133
Sir, if you don't like it,
 

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,380
it's refundable within 30 days.

109
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,126
Really?

110
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,686
No.

111
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,220
Move. Move
  

112
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:46,693
Boss,

113
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,340
So many porridge.

114
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,820
It's so pitiful that they're not prepared for me.

115
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,426
If they are prepared for me,

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,260
I must thank that person kindly.

117
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,420
Why do you look at me?

118
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,260
I love drinking juice.

119
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,340
But some people doesn't

120
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,060
buys me a juicer.

121
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,780
Appreciate what you are possessing.

122
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,620
Is there something wrong with this computer?

123
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:27,980
This...

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,820
What are you doing?

125
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,526
Don't. let me do it.
 

126
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:53,940
You such a fool...

127
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,140
Why bothering to do such menial work?

128
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:04,046
Let me do this. Let me do this.
  

129
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:09,620
Boss, What's wrong with you?
 

130
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,180
Do you think today I am

131
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,620
kinder to you than before?

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,820
No.

133
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,946
Fine. Fine.
  

134
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:50,620
Fine.

135
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,540
Since today,

136
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
You don't have to manage the net cafe.

137
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,740
You can play Glory whenever you want. I will still pay you.
 

138
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,380
How about that?

139
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
I think it's a trap.

140
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
It's not.

141
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,500
Only my sincerity.

142
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,620
I... let me make coffee for you.
 

143
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,493
Here.

144
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,300
Be careful. It's hot.

145
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,220
I don't want a blend of Robusta.

146
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,866
I want freshly roasted Arabica beans.

147
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:30,726
At least,

148
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,426
I want liberica.

149
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,700
Do you have it?

150
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,020
I will ask Chu to buy it.

151
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,500
So you don't have?

152
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,620
How about drinking some tea?

153
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,140
I have red tea, green tea, white tea...
  

154
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,660
Whatever you want.

155
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,940
Which one do you want.

156
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,913
Flower tea.

157
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,340
I will ask Chu to buy it too.

158
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,053
Then forget it.
 

159
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,820
No coffee. No tea.
 

160
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,660
Then give me a fruit tray.

161
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,180
OK.

162
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:28,233
It's ok.

163
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,746
Are you kidding me?
 

164
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,680
What?

165
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,620
Do you know how to peel an apple?

166
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,940
I have peeled it.

167
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:46,860
Have a try.

168
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,100
You call this peeling apples.

169
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,900
I need something artistic.
 

170
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,220
It's too ugly.

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,886
I won't eat it.

172
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,173
Artistic.

173
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:03,706
It's ok.

174
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,080
You are quiet deft.

175
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,940
The rabbit is pretty delicate.

176
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,653
Sure. I am telling you,
 

177
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,340
It's quiet difficult to carve the rabbit.

178
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Look at its ears.

179
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
It would be broken

180
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,500
if you are not careful enough.

181
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,060
Unpalatable. I won't eat it.
 

182
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,660
You such a bast...

183
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,180
Bastard.

184
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:42,533
Say that again.

185
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,093
Bastard. Bastard.
 

186
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:48,580
Don't think that I am kind to you,

187
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,700
So that you can be insatiable.

188
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,493
Boss, keep on.
 

189
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,433
Just speak your mind and be your true self.
 

190
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,300
Otherwise, I have to act everyday.

191
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:02,200
It's too exhausting.

192
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,460
Acting

193
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:09,826
Yes. You want to be a fan.
 

194
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,100
Then I have to wrong myself

195
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,340
And act an idol.

196
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,580
I regard you as my idol.

197
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,220
But you play a trick on me.

198
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,446
OK. You trick me, don't you?
 

199
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,533
Don't you?

200
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,453
Boss, I say speak your mind.
 

201
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,613
Not beat me whenever your mind.

202
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:35,653
I'm beating you now.

203
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,453
So what? I…


204
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,706
You are so grumpy. Aren't you afraid that I will leave?
 

205
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:45,473
Great.

206
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,766
Don't come back if you leave.

207
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:55,626
I don't dare to.

208
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,953
Hello

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,360
This is me.

210
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,393
Shall we have a meeting?

211
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,413
It's been so many years.

212
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,820
I've always been a novice in Glory.

213
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,913
When I just met Su Muqiu and Ye Qiu,

214
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,166
They have been the experts in Glory.

215
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:38,780
As for me,

216
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,780
I was just a loser,

217
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,286
who couldn't do his work well,

218
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,140
nor play Glory.

219
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,820
The jungle.

220
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:02,260
The boss appears in the jungle.

221
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,626
Position (234 665)


222
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:04,466
Come here right now.

223
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:05,733
I'm coming.

224
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,326
Waiter, check out.
 

225
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,360
Your timing seems not right.

226
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,386
The time flies so fast.

227
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,266
The timing has been tampered with. 

228
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,713
Give me the account book.

229
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,560
Boss.

230
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,100
What's this for?

231
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,900
It's for timing. A good thing.
 

232
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,420
It's to steal the online time of our customers.

233
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,260
What a shame. You study business.

234
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,420
You don't know what is profit maximization, do you?

235
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,020
But you can't be conscienceless ,

236
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,340
And make evil money.

237
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:02,140
The most important quality for a great businessman

238
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,320
Is honesty.

239
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,140
What a businessman needs is not qualities,

240
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:07,606
But minds.

241
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,380
If you want to make money, stop talking about morality.

242
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,180
If you want to make money, stop talking about morality.

243
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:17,180
At that moment, what I hated most was this sentence.
 

244
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:46,700
What's going on?

245
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:51,883
I'm going to meet an old friend.

246
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,980
I believe the competitive spirit we advocate

247
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,220
will definitely change some people's understanding

248
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:01,860
On this fields in this future.

249
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,060
Next, we will give vigorous support to

250
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,135
qualified people in this fields.

251
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,396
And form the esports team

252
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:09,316
as soon as possible.

253
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,160
= The First Glory League =

254
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,920
Sportsmanship, esports team.
 

255
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:18,707
These two strange and familiar phrases

256
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,929
thrilled Muqiu and me.

257
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,060
We wanted to hold the first Glory League,

258
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,700
inviting those transregional masters to compete together.

259
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:31,163
And change Glory into a real competitive sport.

260
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,953
Tao Xuan was fired undoubtedly

261
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,900
due to rise against the dishonest merchant.

262
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,620
and joined us.

263
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:40,980
The Poor Trio

264
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,900
only had broken screen and old computer host,

265
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:47,220
But expected to do a great thing.

266
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,060
Ye, you are the commander in chief of the whole strategy.
 

267
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,020
And our commando as well.

268
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,740
You are in charge of the competition schedule.

269
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:56,820
The whole level of this competition

270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,740
depends on you.

271
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,260
Invite the players here,

272
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,923
and defeat them one by one. Easy.
 

273
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:05,780
# Unwilling to mediocrity #

274
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,735
# Not limited by the success #
 

275
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,070
For the competitive spirits,

276
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:10,498
for our professional careers,

277
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,529
we spent the poorest

278
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,609
but the most eventful time.

279
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,620
# Floating with the stream, #

280
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,489
# Standing at the peak of the star, #

281
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,984
# At that moment, I finally understand me of the past, #

282
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,815
# Always being my own hero. #

283
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,420
# I once saw  #

284
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,660
# the legend. #

285
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,550
Wei Chen and Han Wenqing, the most strangest players 

286
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,020
in the second district, come to join the competition.

287
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,180
Our old  assembled computer finally had to face

288
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:42,900
- the challenges from the masters. - Let me do it.

289
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,812
Hello. Hello.
 

290
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,100
Come in, please.
  

291
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:46,800
Ready?

292
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,975
Go.

293
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:13,550
Go around.

294
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,300
The most strangest player in the second district,

295
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,620
is definitely worth of his name.

296
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,660
Let's decide the winner through one move. How about that?
 

297
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:22,500
That's exactly what I want.

298
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,156
What's wrong?

299
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:35,667
Why I can't move?

300
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,563
Wait a minute.
 

301
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:38,344
I will handle it.

302
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,375
You don't seize the chance to kill me?

303
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:42,340
This is competition,

304
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,246
Not the fight in the jungle.

305
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:50,166
Ok. I finish it.
 

306
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:51,230
There will be no proble...

307
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,283
An unfinished competition,

308
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,180
A broken screen,

309
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,540
They constituted the memories of our young age.

310
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,535
Ye Qiu,

311
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,860
Come and have a seat.
 

312
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:42,620
It's been a long time since I played Glory.

313
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:43,286
Cut to the chase.

314
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,420
Come back. Come back to Jia Shi.
 

315
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:54,996
Being a coach.

316
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,009
In fact, the position of the coach

317
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:00,276
is always being left to you.

318
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:03,020
I never consider giving you up.

319
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:04,929
I have no interest in standing aside.

320
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,316
I prefer to standing on the arena.

321
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,200
It's only temporary to be a coach.

322
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,095
As long as you have retired for one year,

323
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,775
you can come back at once.

324
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:13,780
I have come back.

325
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,673
In fact, we are all very clear that

326
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,020
the Pro-League nowadays

327
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:21,940
is quite different from that in the past.

328
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,353
Yes. I admit that.
 

329
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,320
Tactics and cooperation are also very important.

330
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,750
However, as for your high-end play,

331
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,141
maybe none of the audience

332
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,460
could understand them.

333
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:34,898
What do they want to see?

334
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,498
They want to see that

335
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:38,260
one can fight against many players,

336
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,780
or save the desperate situation on his own.

337
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:42,406
This is what they want to see,

338
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,984
like to see and hope to see.

339
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,209
I go to play games,

340
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:47,981
instead of pleasing the audience .

341
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,380
Your Dragon Head Raising.

342
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,295
You said it was just for fun.

343
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:53,860
But all the fans

344
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,544
regarded it as your representative skill.

345
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,846
Its practical value is limited.

346
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:58,720
Does it matter?

347
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,900
It doesn't matter.

348
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,433
What matters is that it is irreplaceable.

349
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,940
Only you can use it.

350
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,860
Using Dragon Head Raising is necessary.

351
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:07,224
It's not for showing the virtuosity.

352
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,981
But you are successful in showing it this time.

353
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,270
When you use Dragon Head Raising

354
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,649
in the All-Star game,

355
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,340
it can rouse the crowd immediately.

356
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,300
I don't believe you never realize that.

357
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,649
Why not seizing the chance

358
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,300
and ascend the throne thoroughly?

359
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:28,006
You are right.

360
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,240
But that's not what I want.

361
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,316
Then what do you want?

362
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:32,455
Winning.

363
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,990
Do you think now you can

364
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:47,140
win back

365
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,520
the glory that belong to you?

366
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,110
Give it a try.

367
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:56,873
I...

368
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,332
only focus on the future,

369
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,540
and I'm never stuck in the past.

370
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,655
As for those

371
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,193
stumbling blocks to the future of Jia Shi,

372
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:10,720
I will throw them away without hesitation.

373
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:15,464
But...

374
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:17,741
in this regard,

375
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:21,858
we are the same.

376
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,366
Recently, I've been thinking that

377
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,460
if Muqiu was still here,

378
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:33,556
whether we wouldn't be

379
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,460
brought to this point.

380
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:38,947
Ye,

381
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,540
afterwards, you are the core of our team.

382
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,740
The personnel allocations

383
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,046
also serves for you.

384
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,849
You can also decide the tactics.

385
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,683
I don't worry your capacity.

386
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,360
You will definitely become the first in Glory.

387
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:00,356
Muqiu,

388
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,123
Here.

389
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,243
You are also one of our team.

390
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:06,824
After all, only you can

391
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,020
have the best cooperation with Ye Qiu.

392
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,409
But apart from the competition,

393
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,660
You have to offer some technical support,

394
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,340
Issues like the design of the equipment

395
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:14,781
are all handed over to you.

396
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,483
They should pose no problem

397
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,780
for a genius like you.

398
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
Tao, you are flattering me.
 

399
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:26,855
As for me, I will do odds and ends for you.
 

400
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,780
I will offer the logistical support.

401
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,843
I believe we will definitely

402
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,740
become the first team in Glory.

403
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,907
Come.

404
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:37,107
Come.

405
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,563
With Glory in your heart,

406
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:41,323
you are invincible.

407
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:45,520
Waiter,

408
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,209
throw these away.

409
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,260
Throw all of them?
 

410
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:54,860
Including the computer?
 

411
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,513
It has been broken, anyway.

412
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,412
What is the use in keeping it?

413
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,815
Wait.

414
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:22,436
It indeed has been broken.

415
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,030
See, this is my design.
 

416
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,233
Freelancer has existed in Glory.

417
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,580
But due to the cooldown of changing the weapons,

418
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:33,556
and the high load,

419
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,498
There are many shortages on the continuity of the attacking.

420
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,203
We can't put together the low-level skills

421
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,340
of different professions perfectly.

422
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:41,526
But you see,

423
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,396
if there is such a weapon,

424
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,569
it can change its forms at any time.

425
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,480
What do you think of it?

426
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,369
Then it can use all the professional

427
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,700
skills constantly.

428
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,153
Right.

429
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,849
I am designing a weapon like this.

430
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:00,744
I call it thousand-machine umbrella.
 

431
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:02,018
Great. You.
 

432
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,926
You have already thought about it.

433
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,218
And have it to conceal from me.

434
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,695
I haven't finished it.

435
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,340
There are still two forms left.

436
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,473
These two forms

437
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,020
can't switch between each other at random.

438
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,550
When I finish the design,

439
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,033
and find the two materials left,

440
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:16,750
you prepare to sweep away the players,

441
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,003
and surprise the entire Glory.

442
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:49,692
Yes.

443
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:54,455
Ye,

444
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:56,867
I heard that Muqiu and you

445
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,489
are designing a weapon for the freelancers.

446
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,452
Yes. With this weapon,
 

447
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,486
I can be

448
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,575
a real freelancer.

449
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:11,003
No. It should be called The King's Avatar.
 

450
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:13,780
But if you don't change your profession,

451
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:16,436
you can only use the skills of the twentieth levels or less.

452
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:17,901
How can you play the game?

453
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:18,867
I can.

454
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,895
Tao, you see,
 

455
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,012
even if I could only use the small skills of 

456
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,612
the twentieth level or less, it can still produce 

457
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:25,298
amazing transformations as long as there are enough skills.

458
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:27,396
The potential of the freelancer

459
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,249
is not worse than that of twenty-four professions.

460
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:30,880
He could even be better.

461
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:36,233
Fine. Forget about the skills,
 

462
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:37,600
What about the league?

463
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,615
What if the freelancer

464
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,393
is not allowed to use in the league?

465
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,984
What if the level of Glory raise its limitation?

466
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:46,701
When it raise its levels to the ninetieth level,

467
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,104
to the hundredth level,

468
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,480
Do you think playing the freelancer is still of any value?

469
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:57,089
Tao, in fact, you have been determined
 

470
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,700
not to allow me to play the freelancer.

471
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,704
Risk. Risk. Risk.
  

472
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,341
It's about risk.

473
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,861
I can't ignore the danger of it

474
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:06,260
Just for your mischief.

475
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:07,680
I have agreed to your request

476
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,803
of effacing yourself and not accepting any endorsement.
 

477
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,821
Do you continue to be so headstrong?

478
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,649
Tao, please trust me,
 

479
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,581
these problems,

480
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:28,584
I believe Muqiu and I can handle all of them.

481
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,326
Think it over.

482
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:45,378
Persuade Ye Qiu.

483
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,529
= All the rare materials have been taken down. =

484
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,606
= The thousand-machine umbrella is at the first level =

485
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:34,400
I think this time

486
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,100
we had better listen to Tao.

487
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:41,913
Why?

488
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,433
My research failed.

489
00:30:45,963 --> 00:30:48,381
The thousand-machine umbrella. I have sealed it.
 

490
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,803
Are you kidding me? This is not joke.
 

491
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:53,580
Look at what you designed before.

492
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:55,550
Look at the cannon. So gorgeous.
 

493
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:57,224
And the weapons in the rear.

494
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,683
Right? And this one.
 

495
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:07,827
This...

496
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,966
Actually,

497
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:32,313
The freelancer is not a conventional profession.

498
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:34,380
Its play is very changeable.

499
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,740
Even if we can use it very well,

500
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:40,276
after Jia Shi recruits new members,

501
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:42,620
they can't handle so

502
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,260
changeable play like us.

503
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:47,900
It is a big problem

504
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:50,036
for our team composition.

505
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,753
In fact, it's not important.

506
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:56,700
Most importantly, one day,
 

507
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:59,020
we can rise to the top of Glory together

508
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,020
instead of depending on the weapons.

509
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:03,470
Therefore, whether using the thousand-machine umbrella or not,

510
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,060
whether I lie to you or not,

511
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,510
it's not important.

512
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,520
Right?

513
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,015
How about that?

514
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,443
Let's make a bet.

515
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,140
First, we change Jia Shi into the first team.

516
00:32:15,544 --> 00:32:16,646
Then the best member of the time

517
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,000
will have the right to reset the thousand-machine umbrella.

518
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,700
What do you think? You dare to make a bet with me?
 

519
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:36,180
Here. This is a weapon I specially made for you.
 

520
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,180
I call this weapon

521
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,464
Que Xie.

522
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:41,667
How about that? Do you like it ?
 

523
00:32:48,203 --> 00:32:50,381
Since the thousand-machine umbrella can't be finished,

524
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:53,820
then let Que Xie

525
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,140
accompany you and rise to the top of Glory.

526
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:39,556
Su Muqiu,

527
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,227
You

528
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,064
indeed lied to me.

529
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,020
This is my secret.

530
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:01,100
Ye, when you find it,
 

531
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,003
Jia Shi and you

532
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:07,460
must have reached the top of Glory.

533
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,633
= Statement on Retirement = 

534
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,652
= Your article has been sent. =

535
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,618
My retirement

536
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,460
causes many related assumptions

537
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,420
from the media and fans.

538
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,860
I hereby certify that

539
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:49,860
my retirement has nothing to do with others.

540
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,778
It's my personal decision.

541
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:56,424
With Glory in your heart, you are invincible.
 

542
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,560
Ye Qiu.

543
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,012
= Statement on Retirement = 

544
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:13,716
Tell them, don't need PR for now.
 

545
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,015
Ok.

546
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,020
The dungeon of the Field of God is a Tower of Babel.

547
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:39,255
Normally,

548
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:41,120
after the player kills all the monsters,

549
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:42,843
the gate of the tower will open,

550
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,900
and send the player to the Field of God.

551
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:46,523
But the thousand-machine umbrella couldn't.

552
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:48,020
Because the thousand-machine umbrella

553
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:49,433
still needs the last step.

554
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,900
It will be finished when the player

555
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,580
passes the dungeon of the Field of God.

556
00:35:53,187 --> 00:35:54,240
Before that,

557
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,907
the thousand-machine umbrella can not be attacked

558
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:57,260
by any frost monsters in the dungeon.

559
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:59,452
Otherwise, the umbrella will be torn apart.
 

560
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:02,060
Thus, if you want to pass the dungeon of the Field of God
 

561
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:03,860
with the thousand-machine umbrella,

562
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,932
you can only climb from the outside of the Tower.

563
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,540
Transforming the form of the umbrella into a long sword,

564
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,540
you can use the skill of Swordsman,
 

565
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,646
Spellblade and Berserker.

566
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,172
Transforming the form of the umbrella into a rotor,

567
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,100
you can use the skill of a machinist.

568
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:22,873
I hope one day,

569
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:26,620
the thousand-machine umbrella can reach the top of Glory.

570
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,396
Are you so free? Especially wait for me here.
 

571
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,220
I am very busy, OK?

572
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,683
Watch this.
  

573
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:23,580
You are here to accompany your captain and try the weapon, right?

574
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,740
I'm here to accompany Shaotian.
