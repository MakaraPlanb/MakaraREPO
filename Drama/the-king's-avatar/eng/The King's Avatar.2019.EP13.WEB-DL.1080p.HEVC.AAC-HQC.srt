= Episode 13 =

3
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,460
Today,

4
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,700
on the All-Star Game,

5
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,420
you defeated your own captain.

6
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,780
Anything you wanna say?

7
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,940
I... I never thought I could win.

8
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,020
Captain, I'm sorry, I...

9
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,620
Yingjie,

10
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,500
It's for you to shoulder the responsibility of Weicao's future.

11
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,220
Let's give the applause

12
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,540
to the two players again.

13
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,020
Are you satisfied with your performance today? 

14
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,620
Gao Yingjie, do you think 

15
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Is it a fluke or strength

16
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,780
to win the game today?

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,180
Ying Jie did very well today. 

18
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,820
He gave full play to his strength.

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,580
Captain Wang Jiexi,

20
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,460
are you really sure 

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,260
you didn't intentionally lose today?

22
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,180
That's his strength.

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,020
Player Wang Jiexi,

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,620
When will you give away 

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,300
Wang Bu Liu Xing's account card? 

26
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,140
That's all.

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,940
Player Wang Jiexi,

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,340
Please answer the question directly. Thanks. 

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,300
Captain Wang Jiexi,

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,660
you...

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,580
Captain Wang Jiexi,

32
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,380
Do you really believe that

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,300
Gao Yingjie can be the future of Weicao?

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,380
I believe that one day 

35
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,700
each of you will be able to defeat me. 

36
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,500
Today, we witnessed the whole process of

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,700
the rise and blossom of an alliance new star.

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,460
Captain.

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Are you all right, captain?

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,940
...on the stage of All-Star Game's history.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,060
You are the future of Weicao.

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,340
Sit down, please.

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,820
Yingjie.

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,140
I still feel like a dream. 

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,340
How could I win the captain?

46
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,820
Yingjie,

47
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,180
believe in yourself.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,980
That's your strength. 

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,900
Now let's welcome the next newcomer challenger,

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,780
Qiao Yifan, who is also from Weicao,

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,580
Let's look forward to the wonderful games he brings us.

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,980
Welcome Qiao Yifan.

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,940
Yifan.

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,340
The one who played the Dungeon with you.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,540
He belongs to Weicao.

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,620
He is...

57
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,780
He wanted to prove himself. 

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,300
Sorry, captain.

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,060
I was going to tell you in advance. 

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,580
But I really want to play once. 

61
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,140
If you want to play,

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,740
then play well.

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,820
This way.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,300
Go for it, captain.

65
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,900
Go for it, Yebo.

66
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,020
Go for it. Go for it.

67
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,420
Go for it.

68
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,980
Go for it, Yingjie.

69
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,540
Go for it, Weicao.

70
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,940
Yifan.

71
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,660
Yingjie.

72
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
He is the jungling...

73
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,260
What?

74
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,420
Nothing.

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,780
I mean... are they rebellion together?

76
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,660
Another Weicao's player again.

77
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,420
Qiao Yifan, also from Weicao,

78
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,300
Let's look forward to the wonderful games he brings us.

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,740
Welcome Qiao Yifan.

80
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,340
Qiao Yifan's opponent to challenge today

81
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
is Xu Kong team's captain,

82
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,780
who is the best at Array Ghost,

83
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,660
Li Xuan.

84
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,860
He picked the wrong opponent. 

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,700
Both of you are standing beside me now. 

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
First of all, I would like to ask Yifan

87
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,500
What's your feeling to challenge the senior today?

88
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
Thanks for your instruction.

89
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,980
And how about you?

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,660
Take good care of yourself.

91
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Two players has already sparked

92
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,540
before the game started.

93
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,980
Let's invite them to

94
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,500
the battle seats.

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,620
Qiao Yifan from Weicao team

96
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,420
is using the Array Ghost Yi Cunhui.

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,100
We know that

98
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Array Ghost don't have much advantage in one-on-one. 

99
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,820
His value is mainly reflected in team games.

100
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,100
After all, Array Ghost has a very good supporting effect. 

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,180
But he's challenging

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,100
Li Xuan's Feng Shan Gui Qi from Kong Xu team.

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,340
As the best Array Ghost of the league,

104
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,420
He actually used Execute Ghost this time. 

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,740
I don't know how Qiao Yifan would feel

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,780
if he knows about it. 

107
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
OK. The game will begin soon. 

108
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,740
Yi Cunhui, operated by Qiao Yifan from Weicao,

109
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,660
versus Feng Shan Gui Qi, operated by Li Xuan from Xu Kong.

110
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,580
The map of this game is Exile Land.

111
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,860
it's a regular map for Ghost Swordsman.

112
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,580
Right, if Yi Cunhui can use the terrain 

113
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,900
to lay out the Ghost Array ahead of time. 

114
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,540
There's an opportunity to take the opponent down.

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,700
The best Array Ghost of the league he againsts

116
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,580
would not give him such an opportunity. 

117
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,680
Well, we see both players

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,660
are moving into the Exile Land.

119
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,740
Neither side attack immediately 

120
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,820
after entering the game,

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,020
They are surveying the terrain,

122
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,940
which means that the dependence of Ghost Array 

123
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,380
on terrain is very strong.

124
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,620
Right. Making good use of terrain to create advantages

125
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,940
is particularly important for Ghost Swordsmen.

126
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,700
Feng Shan Gui Qi takes the lead in attacking.

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,580
As the best Ghost Array,

128
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,100
He knows exactly where the weakness of it.

129
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
If he can get the first hand,

130
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,620
there will be great advantages. 

131
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,980
The terrain Yi Cunhui chose was very open. 

132
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,860
The blind areas are rare,

133
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,220
but it also exposes itself. 

134
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
He's still a newcomer.

135
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,860
Found him.

136
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,620
Feng Shan Gui Qi did not choose

137
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,460
to rush directly, but tactical positioning. 

138
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,860
He found Yi Cunhui's blind spot.

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,660
Waiting for the opportunity.

140
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,820
The veteran is surely experienced. 

141
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,140
Feng made a sneak attack.

142
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,460
Facing the best Ghost Array, Li Xuan,

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,260
he seems to be suppressed.

144
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,700
He can barely withstand 

145
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,300
when he is directed against.

146
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,060
Ghost Array was completely conquered by Execute Ghost.

147
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,020
We see that Qiao Yifan's HP

148
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,860
is dropping rapidly.

149
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,940
The speed of Feng Shan Gui Qi is very fast.

150
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,380
and gave him no chance to breathe at all. 

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,140
Cross sidestep.

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,540
Unexpectedly, Qiao Yifan cut him sideways 

153
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,980
with the skill of an assassin. 

154
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,460
Exactly counterattack.

155
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,140
He wants to find the rhythm back.

156
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,860
It's an opportunity for Yi Cunhui.

157
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,940
False action.

158
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Feng Shan Gui Qi is frozen.

159
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,460
Yi Cunhui released the array of ice.

160
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,180
He tricked the best Ghost Array.

161
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,740
This newcomer is really something.

162
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,220
Yifan will win, right?

163
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,500
No. He'll lose.

164
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
Where are you going?

165
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,420
Have some fresh air.

166
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,420
Let's see how Feng Shan Gui Qi will respond. 

167
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,060
Another false action. Ghost.

168
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,460
Feng Shan Gui Qi is unfreeze. 

169
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,180
He fooled Yi Cunhui,

170
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,940
made a counter attack when Yi Cunhui rushed up.

171
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,020
Yi Cunhui's in danger.

172
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,940
He'll be taken down.

173
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,660
He really did it on purpose.

174
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,620
All Skills are hit on him.

175
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,500
Yi Cunhui's HP is empty.

176
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
Feng Shan Gui Qi wins.

177
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,900
Let's congratulate Li Xuan of Kongxu Team 

178
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,620
on winning the game. 

179
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,260
The old man is a fount of wisdom. 

180
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,740
The best Ghost Array deserves his reputation.

181
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,700
Newcomer is still newcomer.

182
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
I can't believe he challenged the best player in his profession. 

183
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,540
Though Qiao Yifan has been suppressed 

184
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,580
in this game all long,

185
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,340
this also shows us his potential.

186
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,860
Right, I think Qiao Yifan will gain a lot 

187
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
from his understanding of Ghost Array and 

188
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,660
Execute Ghost after this competition.

189
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,580
Li Xuan also showed the best Ghost Array of league's 

190
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,060
superb understanding of the profession. 

191
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,420
This game also broke the league's

192
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,500
fastest one-on-one winning record. 

193
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Compared with the last game of the same profession,

194
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,860
We can see that

195
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,420
Qiao Yifan has a long way to go.

196
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Let's cheer for the newcomer.

197
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,700
Although Qiao Yifan lost the game,

198
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,500
facing such a powerful opponent,

199
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,180
I believe he has tried his best to 

200
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,540
exert all his strength.

201
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,620
Now I still want to know how the winner, 

202
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,420
Li Xuan, our senior,

203
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,980
commented on Yifan's performance. 

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,340
You played well today,

205
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,180
but unfortunately you met me.

206
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Thank you.

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,460
Li Xuan. Li Xuan.

208
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
Why did you play Execute Ghost today?

209
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,220
Li Xuan. Li Xuan.

210
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,580
As the best Execute Ghost in Glory,

211
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,540
How do you evaluate Qiao Yifan's Ghost Array today? 

212
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,100
Ask him more.

213
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,140
Listen to what he thinks.

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
Player Qiao Yifan,

215
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,100
Is your fight against Li Xuan

216
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,980
an individual fan behavior 

217
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,140
or a team arrangement? 

218
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,620
Qiao Yifan,

219
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,940
Your original career was assassins. 

220
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,740
Why did you suddenly 

221
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
play Ghost Array today?

222
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,940
Did you not consider the difference between 

223
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,980
you and Li Xuan's strength before the competition?

224
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,580
How do you feel about  

225
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,940
being the fastest loser

226
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,620
in the newcomer competition? 

227
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,740
Do you think you're the right one to Ghost Array?

228
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Do you think you're good at playing Ghost Array?

229
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,100
Do you think you'll continue 

230
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,140
playing Ghost Array after losing so badly today?

231
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,660
Sorry.

232
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,500
You are too bold. 

233
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,860
Senior.

234
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,980
I know what you're thinking.

235
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
You want to use this stage

236
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,060
to prove your ability to use Ghost Array. 

237
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,580
But your choice of opponent is too exaggerated.

238
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,700
One month, and you want to challenge the best Ghost Array.

239
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,940
Why?

240
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,940
I know he's great. 

241
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,540
If you're looking for advice,

242
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,900
and salute to seniors,

243
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,700
Li Xuan is a good choice.

244
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,180
But if you're trying to show off

245
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,780
your ability to use Ghost Array,

246
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,260
Li Xuan should be your last choice.

247
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
No one in the Glory circle knows 

248
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,380
Ghost Array more than Li Xuan.

249
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,060
and you want to display 

250
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,260
your technology in front of him.

251
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,540
No wonder you were restrained so easily.

252
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,780
Moreover, as the support,

253
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
Ghost Array is valuable in a team.

254
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,060
Team awareness and skills are hard to express

255
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,900
in such single-handed competitions. 

256
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
You have little experience,

257
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,060
mistakes are a matter of time.

258
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,060
You're not even close to play Ghost Array.

259
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,100
Glory is not as simple as you think

260
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,020
Senior,

261
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,180
I just want a chance.

262
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
A chance that the captain can notice me.

263
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,300
Now is not the time. 

264
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,300
Then when is?

265
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,190
Wait till we abandoned by the team completely?

266
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,340
I've done everything I can. 

267
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,060
Maybe I should have given up.

268
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,220
It's not the team or the captain

269
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,780
who can abandon you.

270
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,540
It's you.

271
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,580
Yifan.

272
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,820
Don't question yourself.

273
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,940
You are still young.

274
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,140
There is plenty of time for further training. 

275
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Keep looking for opportunities.

276
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,860
Rebound while touching the bottom.

277
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Never give up.

278
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,340
Senior, you told me not to give up,

279
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,140
But why did you retire?

280
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm also looking for opportunities. 

281
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,740
Though I am elder,

282
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,900
I never mean to give up.

283
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,420
After all,

284
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
No one wants to live in a shadow. 

285
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,300
How do you feel sitting in the audience?

286
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
Great.

287
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,820
Do you want to experience it? 

288
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,100
That day will not come.

289
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm experiencing in advance

290
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,340
to avoid being unsuitable for retirement. 

291
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,220
Lao Han,

292
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,140
Everyone's getting old,

293
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,980
Don't argue with it.

294
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,820
If I remember correctly,

295
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,460
you're one year older than me. 

296
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,300
You're feeling slippery these days, right?

297
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,380
And never thought

298
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,980
you would quit the game one day. 

299
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,380
I won't give up.

300
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,540
The confrontation between Sun Xiang 

301
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,380
and Han Wenqing will begin right away. 

302
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,100
I believe you all look forward to it as much as I do. 

303
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,980
Right?

304
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,780
As everyone knows, Jia Shi's dream of

305
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,620
four quadruple crown ended by Ambitions,

306
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,100
Now they are enmity and resentment,

307
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Strong versus strong,

308
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,660
Let's have the captain of Jiashi, Sun Xiang.

309
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,140
Then let's have the captain of Ambitions, Han Wenqing.

310
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,020
The popularity of Han Wenqing is very high.

311
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,460
Sun Xiang's popularity is not low either.

312
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Sun Xiang was the newcomer king of last season.

313
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
How about this year?

314
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,780
First year of joining the league,

315
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,060
and he was elected as an All-star,

316
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,740
Now he inherited Ye Qiu Master's 

317
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,780
Leaf of Autumn.

318
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,260
His strength goes further. 

319
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,940
Where are Sun Xiang's fans here?

320
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,060
Let me see you. 

321
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
Senior King of Fighter,

322
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,020
It's time to step aside 

323
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,260
when you're old.

324
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,860
Is it?

325
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,980
You beat me before, 

326
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,060
but only took advantage of the Smoke Alone. 

327
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,100
Now I have Leaf of Autumn,

328
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,980
Do you think I'll lose again? 

329
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,660
Let's see.

330
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,500
We saw that the two old friends

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,420
greeted each other at the beginning. 

332
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,860
But I'm also very curious that

333
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,260
What did Sunxiang say 

334
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,500
to Master Han Wenqing just now?

335
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,500
Nothing important.

336
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,460
I just want to tell senior

337
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,300
The purpose of my challenge is 

338
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
to make a closure to the old grievances of

339
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,740
Jia Shi and Ambitions,

340
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,420
also of Leaf of Autumn and Smoke Alone.

341
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,380
I've smelled the strong smell of gunpowder. 

342
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
War is imminent.

343
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,540
He is so confident.

344
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,900
Please enter the battle seats.

345
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,140
All right. Both players are logining the characters.

346
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Entering the match map.

347
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,300
Sun Xiang, Leaf of Autumn,

348
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,780
versus Han Wenqing, Smoke Alone.

349
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,380
The game is about to begin. 

350
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,060
Here we go.

351
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,660
We saw that there were 

352
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,780
no tactical moves at the beginning. 

353
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,340
Both sides rushed directly to the center of the map.

354
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,180
Speaking of Leaf of Autumn and Smoke Alone,

355
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,740
I believe you are all familiar with

356
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,820
these old enemies for many years. 

357
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,180
Each match they played 

358
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,260
from the game to the arena

359
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,180
was impressive.

360
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,100
I believe today's game 

361
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,260
will also be a classic match 

362
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,460
in the history of glory. 

363
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,980
We all knew that

364
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,260
Han Wenqing's character is firm,

365
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,140
he never reteats,

366
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,300
The character he used,

367
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,500
King of Fighter Smoke Alone,

368
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,020
is godly character of the initial Glory.

369
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,220
Leaf of autumn Sun Xiang operated

370
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,540
is also godly character of the initial Glory,

371
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,780
the title of God of Fights.

372
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,900
Within the tough fighting Sun Xiang played,

373
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,820
The game is bound to be

374
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,860
a spectacular close-up game. 

375
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,140
Straight Punch, Launching Kick, Soaring Tiger.

376
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,940
Smoke Alone starts without reservation,

377
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,380
constantly attacking Leaf of Autumn.

378
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,740
Leaf of Autumn begins to fight back.

379
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,620
Falling Flower Palm, Dragon Tooth, Draconic Crusher.

380
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,900
A series of moves, easy and smooth.

381
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,660
You said that Newcomer Challenge

382
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,980
is just a show. 

383
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,220
Did Han Wenqing just 

384
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,540
push himself so hard? 

385
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,060
He's getting old.

386
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Days are countable.

387
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
He had to.

388
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,660
I seem to recall that

389
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,660
he's only 26.

390
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,420
That is a veteran for professional athlets.

391
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,980
He just won't accept it.

392
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,300
Is it wrong?

393
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,220
Not quite.

394
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,540
Smoke Alone has broken through 

395
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,020
the advantage of distance

396
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,660
and send himself to the side of Leaf of Autumn.

397
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,260
He deserves admiration.

398
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,300
Excellent Attack-Defense conversion.

399
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,780
Why don't you learn from him,

400
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,020
the one who's experiencing retirement ahead of time?

401
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,180
Leaf of Autumn made it,

402
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,660
and want to attack and fight back immediately. 

403
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
But we can see that Smoke Alone 

404
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,780
squatted a horse's step.

405
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,260
The left hand wanders in front,

406
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,660
The right hand is hidden in the waist. 

407
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,380
This is the start-up of the great move, Emperor's Fist.

408
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,500
I accidentally heard your conversation. 

409
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,500
I really want to know 

410
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,380
how it feels to sit in the auditorium for the first time.

411
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Leaf of Autumn dodged in a sudden.

412
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,220
Only a fist...

413
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,660
Nice.

414
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,780
Go for it, Han Wenqing.

415
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,620
Have you ever wondered

416
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,140
how you would bear Guoguo's anger

417
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,780
if she knows who you really are one day? 

418
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,140
She won't refuse surprise. 

419
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,780
We wonder if God of Fights can bring us

420
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,420
different surprises after changing his master. 

421
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,580
Sun Xiang's method of operation

422
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,420
is very similar to Ye Qiu's.

423
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
For a moment, 

424
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
I feel like I'm back in the era when the God of Fights

425
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,980
and the King of Fighting were at their peak. 

426
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,500
Treasure your time, Lao Han.

427
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,100
I have no intention of retiring. 

428
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,500
How about you?

429
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,580
My career must be one day longer than yours. 

430
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,260
Big talk. We'll see.

431
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,660
We saw Han Wenqing's somewhat distracted. 

432
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,420
He didn't escaped the Dragon Tooth of Leaf of Autumn.

433
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,580
It shouldn't happen.

434
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,740
Did he fail to keep up with his

435
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,500
excessive physical exertion before?

436
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,380
Is he really recalling the past? 

437
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,100
Leaf of Autumn seizes the opportunity to attack Smoke Alone.

438
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,900
Leaf of Autumn's HP is in the lead.

439
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,180
It's unimaginable that

440
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,900
Senior Han Wenqing also had times of being suppressed.

441
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,420
The heyday of professional athletes 

442
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,900
lasted that long. 

443
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,140
Even if he doesn't talk, 

444
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,540
he knows better than anyone.

445
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,420
So the captain feels anxious,

446
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,300
and want you to take on the future of Weicao. 

447
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,980
The future of Weicao

448
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,740
isn't one person's future.

449
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,340
It's ours.

450
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,420
I know I'm not in the plan of Weicao's future. 

451
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,220
Yifan, don't give up.

452
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,300
You have a lot of chances

453
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,580
to prove yoruself to the captain.

454
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,380
Yingjie,

455
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,100
I don't want to prove anymore.

456
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,980
I'm not belong in Weicao's future,

457
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,220
but I have the future of my own.

458
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,900
Professional players have such a short career,

459
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,660
everyone is doing their best,

460
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,980
how could I give up?

461
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,900
After all,

462
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,580
No one wants to disappear into the night 

463
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,660
without a bright light. 

464
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,540
Old fella,

465
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,740
are you out of breath?

466
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,180
Smoke Alone is now very passive,

467
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,300
and may be taken away with a series moves

468
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,100
by Leaf of Autumn any time.

469
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,020
I'll end him. 

470
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,460
Here we go.

471
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,100
Dragon Breaks the Ranks, Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart.

472
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,180
This set of skills is released very accurately. 

473
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,500
What happened, captain?

474
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,460
Lao Han's really old,

475
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,660
Why is he so slow?

476
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,940
He can't lose.

477
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,060
That's too shameless.

478
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Are you kidding?

479
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,540
Han Wenqing didn't give up.

480
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,420
He's defending the dignity of an veteran. 

481
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,220
This is King of Fighter. This is Han Wenqing.

482
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,620
This is the spirit of Ambitions.

483
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,060
Never give up though at a disadvantage.

484
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,980
March forward courageously.

485
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,820
Now the game has reached a fever pitch. 

486
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,260
It's amazing. 

487
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,500
Impossible.

488
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
The HP advantage of Leaf of Autumn 

489
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
did not continue to expand.

490
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,660
It is closely followed by Smoke Alone.

491
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,500
Smoke Alone, Soaring Tiger.

492
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,940
Leaf of Autumn, Dragon Strikes the Heart.

493
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,260
Both sides are saving power. 

494
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,180
The one wins this blow 

495
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,740
can seize the rhythm.

496
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,500
Han Wenqing and Sun Xiang are both

497
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
looking for the opportunity to launch skills.

498
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,140
It's just a dying struggle. 

499
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,220
Here it comes.

500
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,100
Both sides launched almost at the same time. 

501
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,260
They hit each other at the same time.

502
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,580
Another exchange of HP.

503
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,380
it's very unfavorable for Smoke Alone with the lowest HP. 

504
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,140
King of Fighter, look out.

505
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,660
You're feeling slippery these days, right?

506
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,020
And never thought 

507
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
you would quit the game one day. 

508
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,540
Right.

509
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,540
I will leave one day .

510
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
I will be defeated.

511
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,220
I will quit Glory.

512
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,860
But it's not today.

513
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,460
Not here.

514
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,340
Nice.

515
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,940
One strike with Collapsing Fist on Leaf of Autumn. 

516
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,620
He's still attacking

517
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,180
while facing such a disadvantage,

518
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,860
He's catching up. 

519
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,500
At present, HP of Smoke Alone is 8%.

520
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,820
HP of Leaf of Autumn is 9%

521
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,300
The result of this climax confrontation...

522
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
I will never lose.

523
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,380
Dragon Soaring.

524
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,020
Leaf of Autumn made the great move.

525
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,900
Dragon Soaring.

526
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,620
If he hits,

527
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,500
he'll take away Smoke Alone directly.

528
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,540
Excellent.

529
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,820
Smoke Alone escaped this skill with Eagle Stamp.

530
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,620
Ferocious Tiger Flurry.

531
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,060
Smoke Alone released the great move of Fighters, 

532
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,660
Ferocious Tiger Flurry in the end.

533
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,220
Nice move.

534
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,900
Smoke Alone killed Leaf of Autumn 

535
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,220
at the last moment. 

536
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,180
He's still got it.

537
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,900
King of Fighter Han Wenqing defeated Sun Xiang. 

538
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,380
This climate confrontation ended 

539
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,580
with the victory of Han Wenqing's Smoke Alone.

540
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,020
I'll never give up.

541
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,660
What's wrong with getting old?

542
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,620
What's wrong with the slippery?

543
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,860
if you can't win with one punch, then ten it is.

544
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,540
Or twenty.

545
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,300
Or a hundred.

546
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,980
Till I can't move.

547
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,420
From game to competition,

548
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,460
as an opponent for many years,

549
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,620
Han Wenqing is too familiar with Leaf of Autumn.

550
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,460
Eagle Stamp at last can 

551
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
precisely avoid Dragon Soaring,

552
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,180
We saw the experience of veteran,

553
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,380
and the perseverance of Han Wenqing. 

554
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,420
The strength of newcomer should not be underestimated,

555
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,860
But the spirit of disobedience of veteran

556
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,020
and his unyielding will

557
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,580
still impressed us.

558
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,580
Sun Xiang also came out.

559
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,500
Though he lose with one move,

560
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,180
He still brought us 

561
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,900
a very exciting confrontation.

562
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,220
Let's give the applause to the two players again.

563
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,220
This time I was unlucky. 

564
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,340
Next time,

565
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,700
I will never lose. 

566
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,620
Oh, yeah?

567
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
I remember you didn't say that just now.

568
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,420
Thanks.

569
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,740
Thanks for the two players again. 

570
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,380
Thanks.

571
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,780
Please come back to our lounge

572
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,860
and get some rest.

573
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,900
Do you think it's easy to 

574
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,140
win the game, King of Fighter?

575
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,580
Sun Xiang,

576
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,820
What do you think of this challenge?

577
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,140
How do you feel about yourself? 

578
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,500
Sun Xiang. Sun Xiang. Sun Xiang.

579
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,260
Sun Xiang.

580
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,620
What do you think of what you said just now?

581
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,060
Make a closure to the old grievances 

582
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,180
of Leaf of Autumn and Smoke Alone.

583
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,420
Are you talking big? 

584
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,940
Are you here for fun? 

585
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,260
What did you say?

586
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,380
Say it again.

587
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,740
Am I wrong?

588
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,900
Sun Xiang did play well. 

589
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,981
The precise Dragon Breaks the Ranks 

590
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:47,340
and Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart,

591
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,180
few people can do it.

592
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,940
Master Han,

593
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,660
Can you comment on 

594
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,780
Sun Xiang's performance today?

595
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,420
But if it was Ye Qiu, 

596
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,180
the last move of Dragon Soaring would never miss.

597
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,900
Young boy,

598
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,220
It's too early for you 

599
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,300
to replaced us.

600
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Sun Xiang. Sun Xiang. Sun Xiang.

601
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Do you think you deserve Leaf of Autumn?

602
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,660
Sun Xiang, let me tell you.

603
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,580
You can never replace Ye Qiu.

604
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,060
You can never replace Ye Qiu.

605
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,180
Do you like e-Sports? 

606
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,540
If so,

607
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,460
Think of it as glory, 

608
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,020
not ostentation. 

609
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,820
Next up is the audiences'

610
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,100
interactive competition.

611
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,610
At this point, we will invite training camp players 

612
00:28:32,674 --> 00:28:34,632
from each team and lucky audience to compared notes.

613
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,728
This is an unexpected part of the All-Star Game.

614
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,801
It is not restricted by the rules of the game,

615
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,435
Mainly for communication and performance, 

616
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,228
professional assistants would appear sometimes,

617
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,385
so there will be many points of view and surprises.

618
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,260
Let's have the first guest on stage.

619
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,540
Welcome Li Rui from Jia Shi.

620
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,700
What's wrong, captain?

621
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,220
Fight well.

622
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,100
Playing as a Professional Player.

623
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,060
Don't worry, captain.

624
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,260
I'll never let you down.

625
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,500
This is an opportunity to fight against professionals,

626
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,700
It's lucky to be selected.

627
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,060
Really?

628
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,940
Of course.

629
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,380
It's lucky to fight against professionals,

630
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,060
it's luckier to fight against Masters,

631
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,620
- If you wantto fight against Ye Qiu... - Lukiest.

632
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
That's not lucky.

633
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,860
Why?

634
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
That's dreaming.

635
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,300
Welcome Li Rui.

636
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Dreams may come true 

637
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,180
after a long time.

638
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,860
Who is the lucky one to be chosen?

639
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,940
Stop.

640
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Me?

641
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,820
Let's congratulate her.

642
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,660
What a suprise.

643
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,820
You are the one lucky guy, Tang.

644
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,700
Play well, don't disgrace your master.

645
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,980
She's a girl.

646
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,540
When did you become my master?

647
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,900
Always.

648
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,700
Learning so much from me, 

649
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,340
you can't turn your back on it. 

650
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,020
I was self-taught. 

651
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,180
Go for it, Tang.

652
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,820
Go for it, Go for it.

653
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,420
Welcome to our first lucky audience.

654
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,140
Hello.

655
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,100
Let's say hello first. 

656
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,340
Introduce yourself, please.

657
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,460
Hi everyone, I'm Tang Rou.

658
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,980
It's Tang Rou.

659
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,340
Then Lao Ye must be here.

660
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,380
Tang Rou.

661
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,820
let's take a look at

662
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,100
their relevant information in Glory.

663
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,540
Let's see the big screen. 

664
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,260
29 days.

665
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,540
29 days.

666
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Does that mean 

667
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,860
you played in Glory less than a month?

668
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,100
Yes.

669
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,260
It turned out to be a rookie of Glory.

670
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,020
Li Rui,

671
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,820
You'll have to be merciful later.

672
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,460
Sure.

673
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Let's invite two players into the battle seats. 

674
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,220
a rookie girl of Glory

675
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,860
versus a professional-to-be player,

676
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,780
What do you say?

677
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,020
I'm looking forward to the sparks 

678
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,180
two battle mages will make.

679
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,940
Game started.

680
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,340
We can see that

681
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,260
Han Yanrou rushed to her opponent at the beginning.

682
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,660
She's full of momentum. 

683
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,340
Too many flaws.

684
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,660
Mage Fighter dodged easily.

685
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,100
Dragon Tooth.

686
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,220
Still be dodged.

687
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,940
It seems that Li Rui deal with it easily.

688
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,780
Falling Flower Palm.

689
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,620
Such a quick speed.

690
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,500
Mage Fighter made a mistake this time

691
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,460
and was blew up directly.

692
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,900
Such a quick speed for a newcomer.

693
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,260
Another Circle Swing.

694
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,580
Mage Fighter is struke down.

695
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,020
Mage Fighter strikes back.

696
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,180
She made it.

697
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,420
I think the audience was as surprised as I was. 

698
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
After launching Dragon Tooth,

699
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,060
It's most likely to launch Circle Swing.

700
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,780
At this time, you can launch Falling Flower Palm

701
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,660
to blow the opponent up,

702
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,860
break-in the skill.

703
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,060
After that,

704
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,380
release Draconic Crusher immediately,

705
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,100
which will force the opponent to fall down.

706
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,220
you can damage three seconds. 

707
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,180
At this time,

708
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,580
If he is a master,

709
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,500
he'll launch Falling Flower Palm to the ground

710
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,780
after he stands up

711
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,780
in order to keep your distance.

712
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,740
So you need to launch Dragon Breaks the Ranks 

713
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,380
which the Attack Range is far enoough.

714
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
It's a test of foresight. 

715
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,660
Be sure to be accurate.

716
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,740
Tang Rou, come on.

717
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,940
It seems that Tang Rou has made rapid progress.

718
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,500
It's only half a month before she becomes this.

719
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,900
And she plays just like Lao Ye. 

720
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,500
Captain,

721
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,820
Sun Xiang has just be defeated by Lao Han,

722
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,140
Now his apprentice is being abused by Tang Rou. 

723
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,020
This is so beatiful.

724
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,180
Tang Rou's uses her speed advantage

725
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,540
to put pressure on Li Rui continuously.

726
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,260
It seems that Jia Shi really has a bad luck. 

727
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,180
So gossipy.

728
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,100
Tang Rou is so powerful.

729
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,420
Do you think this is Sun Xiang's expression now?

730
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,580
A Player who have just played Glory for less than a month,

731
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,420
this is a little embarrassing now.

732
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Li Rui, as a professional-to-be player of Jia Shi,

733
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,900
will he be defeated by a newcomer like this?

734
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,580
Han Yanrou has completely crushed Mage Fighter,

735
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,260
Li Rui seems to be a newcomer. 

736
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,580
We see that the current HP

737
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,020
is 60% versus 30%. 

738
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,300
Han Yanrou is in the lead.

739
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,860
She is storing force.

740
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,940
Dragon Breaks the Ranks. 

741
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,380
Han Yanrou wants to win the game.

742
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
If this hits,

743
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,100
Mage Fighter will be defeated with a series skills.

744
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,940
It's over.

745
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,300
Tang is gonna win.

746
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,660
Wonderful.

747
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,260
have you seen a professional defeated by...

748
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,100
Did you see it? 

749
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,700
... a normal player?

750
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,260
Well, she's still a newcomer.

751
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,860
Right. Mage Fighter can't 

752
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,340
dodged this blow in the air. 

753
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,020
What?

754
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,180
He dodged?

755
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,300
What happened?

756
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
What, what, what?

757
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,620
Go away.

758
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,980
He dodged?

759
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,780
This operation is truely impressive.

760
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,060
He dodged.

761
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,020
It must be a coincidence.

762
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,100
He dodged.

763
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,780
Dragon Breaks the Ranks is exploded in front of him,

764
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,300
and he escaped without any injury. 

765
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,060
This dodge can be regarded 

766
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,420
as a professional standard.

767
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,100
Someone helped him.

768
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,140
He's just playing normally.

769
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,540
Who's that?

770
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,980
You watch him carefully. 

771
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,820
The way he forecast, the timing he grasp.

772
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,020
Can you recall anyone?

773
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,020
Sun Xiang.

774
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,420
It's really him.

775
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,820
His self-esteem is too strong. 

776
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,220
That's why he can't afford to lose.

777
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,180
Look closely.

778
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,300
What?

779
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,980
Four thorns in the air.

780
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,500
This battle mage is unusal.

781
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,060
Nice.

782
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,660
Four thorns in the air.

783
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,740
Mage Fighter's attack is so quick,

784
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,660
Han Yanrou has no power to fight back. 

785
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,300
The advantage HP is gonna lose.

786
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,700
If it goes on like this,

787
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,020
She will lose the game.

788
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,380
It's not that easy.

789
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,300
She got up.

790
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,420
We see that Mage Fighter didn't make a concession.

791
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,700
He's approaching Han Yanrou.

792
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,620
Draconic Crusher.

793
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,620
What?

794
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,940
He cancelled it at the last moment

795
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,740
and change into Dragon Tooth.

796
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,140
Han Yanrou only drops one percent of HP. 

797
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,620
Sky Strike. Another two percent.

798
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,900
What is he doing?

799
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,580
Han Yanrou didn't give up.

800
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,980
She operates the character to stand up

801
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,780
and rush into Mage Fighter.

802
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,620
She's gonna fight back.

803
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,740
Another Dragon Tooth?

804
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,460
Mage Fighter uses a micro skill again

805
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,420
and consumes 1% of HP of Han Yanrou. 

806
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,900
Is he humiliating her?

807
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,820
How could he?

808
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
What is he doing?

809
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,900
He's humiliating with micro skills.

810
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,860
Humiliating an amateur in front of these people,

811
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,180
Jia Shi is not afraid of losing face.

812
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,260
Making fun of an amateur player,

813
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,860
Is he qualified for the professional league? 

814
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,700
Are you kidding?

815
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,660
What are you doing?

816
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,420
Are you humiliating her?

817
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,900
Mage Fighter is still using micro skills

818
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,420
That's too much.

819
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,780
to consume Tang Rou's HP.

820
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,660
How could he treat a newcomer like that?

821
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,420
That's so humiliating.

822
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,300
But she didn't give up.

823
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,140
She's still looking for opportunities to fight back. 

824
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,580
Han Yanrou only leaves 10% of HP.

825
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,900
Looks like the newcomer is going to lose.

826
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,460
It's over.

827
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,820
Storing the force.

828
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,300
Another Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

829
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:40,900
As a newcomer,

830
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,700
I'm afraid it's hard for Han Yanrou

831
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,340
to copy the operation and avoid it.

832
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,020
What? Wonderful!

833
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,780
She dodged.

834
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,700
She dodged Dragon Breaks the Ranks precisely.

835
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,860
Exactly.

836
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,700
She dodged it.

837
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,260
It seems that there's a mysterious person showed up.

838
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,780
What now?

839
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,540
She dodged?

840
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,940
Dodged.

841
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,300
Such a wonderful interactive spectator competition.

842
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,940
The operation of both sides is much faster than just now. 

843
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,020
This rhythm feels like a professional league. 

844
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,180
At this point, Mage Fighter's HP is still ahead.

845
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,300
But both players' HP are not much.

846
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,420
Such a deadlock situation,

847
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,140
Direct Li,

848
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,900
What do you think the players will do next?

849
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,980
One hit kill.

850
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,180
They can only take each other away 

851
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,900
by great moves under this condition,

852
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,100
otherwise, nobody is sure of winning the game. 

853
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,940
by changing with micro skills.

854
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,700
Dragon Soaring.

855
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,060
Both players are releasing Dragon Soaring.

856
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,180
They both want to make one hit kill.

857
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,980
The game is about to be won or lost. 

858
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,580
You're right.

859
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,740
They launched at the same time. 

860
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,260
This is it.

861
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,660
Not good.

862
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,300
Han Yanrou missed.

863
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,380
Let's congratulate Mage Fighter.

864
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,620
What?

865
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,260
Mage Fighter's HP is empty.

866
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,660
Han Yanrou wins.

867
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,500
What happened.

868
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,260
Mage Fighter lose first.

869
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
What happened indeed?

870
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,740
Everyone,

871
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,260
it happened just so fast,

872
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,380
We have no idea what happened. 

873
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
Let's follow the slow-motion camera.

874
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,060
Good. They both launched Dragon Soaring.

875
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,740
They both dodged.

876
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,060
What?

877
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,700
Dragon Soaring of Han Yanrou changed direction,

878
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,020
Mage Fighter didn't make it.

879
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,100
It's Dragon Head Raising!

880
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,260
Han Yanrou used Dragon Head Raising!

881
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,820
My god, it really is Dragon Head Raising!

882
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,940
Impossible.

883
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,340
What just happened!

884
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,990
Han Yanrou used Dragon Head Raising as a newcomer.

885
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,820
Let's congratulate Han Yanrou

886
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,820
won this game.

887
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,260
Did you do your best this time? 

888
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,300
I try my best 

889
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,820
in every game. 

890
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,700
# standing on the top and claiming that #

891
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,180
Did you really give up like this? 

892
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,340
Giving up does not mean admitting defeat. 

893
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,580
Fine.

894
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,300
Don't be a deserter then.

895
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,820
I'll see you in the All-Star game next year.

896
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,520
Dragon Head Raising, Dragon Head Raising, Dragon Head Raising.

897
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,540
It will rebound 

898
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,820
while touching the bottom.

899
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Never give up

900
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,460
at any time.

901
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,220
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

902
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,820
# We are the brightest fireflies #

903
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,860
# I came from the past and will write the furture #

904
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,140
Master Ye Qiu.

905
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,540
# This fight, we will make it memorable #

906
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,820
Master. Master Ye Qiu.

907
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,820
Where's Master Ye Qiu?

908
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,300
Where's Master Ye Qiu?

909
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,940
He just...

910
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,540
left.

911
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,060
Let's go.

912
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,820
Every unwilling departure,

913
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,500
is for the final return.
