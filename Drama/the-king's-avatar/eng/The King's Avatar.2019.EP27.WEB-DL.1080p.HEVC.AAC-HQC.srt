= Episode 27 =

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,440
How about the guild?

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,520
Fine.

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,400
Pretty busy.

6
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,260
Do you have something else to say, vice captain?

7
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,880
Or I'd better go now.

8
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,200
Are you still interested to join the team one?

9
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
You know, guild is important for Jia Shi.

10
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,620
Without your support,

11
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,800
the team will find difficult

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,940
to gather materials in game instance.

13
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,100
However,

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,420
if there's someone

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,320
who attempts to gain a foothold in our team

16
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,300
to make waves,

17
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,460
then no matter how difficult we may find,

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,260
we will kick this guy out.

19
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,200
Chen,

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,780
you're suitable for guild work,

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,520
= Data on Freelancer of Ye Xiu =

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,460
but these things won't be useful.

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,260
Just focus on your own business.

24
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,360
= Backpack =
= Yi Cunhui =

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,880
Have you gotten all the

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,220
skill points?

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Yep.

28
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,580
Are you ready to celebrate?

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,240
Mo Fan,

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,920
All set?

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Yes, K/D ratio has been over 0.96.

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,580
Ready to go?

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,460
Take it easy!

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,180
No problem.

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,180
Well, let's

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,380
go.

37
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Go! Go! Go!

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,640
The match today is Xing Xin versus Jia Shi

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,980
scored by kill count.

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,540
The map randomly chosen is the Place of Exile Dungeon.

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,600
As agreed by both sides,

42
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,340
as long as Xing Xin scores a point,

43
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,300
it can keep its competition eligibility for the Challenge.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,680
So let's get ready!

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
What?

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,360
Sun Xiang is unexpectedly not in the starting line-up.

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,060
Captain,

48
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,380
should we alter our tactics?

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,840
Adopt Plan B

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,520
Yifan,

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
you'll replace Lao Wei to start the game.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,180
We'll aim at

53
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,860
Sheng Lingmie

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,640
This historic game between Xing Xin and Jia Shi

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,960
is fueled by a bet,

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
which is

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,840
the competition eligibility of Xing Xin

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,280
Even though it's not an official one,

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,960
the delicate relationship between two teams

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,100
still makes this game a hot topic.

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,420
Under the leadership of Ye Qiu, will Xing Xin

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,880
go forward or stop over there?

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,240
It is seen that

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
Jia Shi wins a good beginning.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
They have recognized Xing Xin's Cleric.

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,460
Now Jia Shi targets at Cold Hands.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,780
Sheng Lingmie keeps blocking him with skills,

68
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,380
in order to slow him down

69
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,880
or even directly weed him out.

70
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,620
The Cleric from Xing Xin enters the Old Town.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,640
Keep rank.

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Roll back.

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,360
Got it.

74
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,320
Move.

75
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,900
No!

76
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,740
It's a trap!

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,060
Xing Xin applied a tactic.

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,860
Han Yanrou and Dragon Breaks the Ranks give him a direct attack.

79
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,720
Sheng Lingmie edged away from it,

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,540
but Striker Successive Strike is knocked over.

81
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,080
Sheng Lingmie

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,800
uses Rock Punch,

83
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,140
moving back by recoil.

84
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,880
He misestimates the distance

85
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,300
and one of his feet is frozen.

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
It can't be real!

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,060
How big the array of ice is?!

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,740
Han Yanrou and Dragon Breaks the Ranks

89
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,000
made such an overestimation.

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,360
It's because of SP.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
They've strengthened their skill rank.

92
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,760
We have no advantage here.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,400
Pull out!

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,040
Sheng Lingmie breaks out from the siege

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,100
and adopts a tactical dodging.

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,060
The rest of Jia Shi also scatter.

97
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,500
They use electronic eye.

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,640
It means that the tactician

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,840
will overlook the battlefield

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
in order to design targeted tactics.

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,660
All the Xing Xin players' dodging

102
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,800
and skills are captured by Xiao Shiqin.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
No, there's one person still out of sight.

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Deception is very agile

105
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,880
and elusive.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,980
His operation is quite smooth.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,240
It is Scrap Picker

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,980
who is good at seizing the moment.

109
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,340
Strangle Knot from Behind.

110
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,020
Deception attack Sheng Lingmie again.

111
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,460
The core members have lost half of HP.

112
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,520
And Deception sticks to Sheng Lingmie

113
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,340
finding a chance for close quarters and consuming his HP.

114
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,740
Brilliant!

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,860
The strike from Mo Fan

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,800
greatly wounded Sheng Lingmie.

117
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,720
Very close.

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Deception keeps dashing,

119
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,840
takes the chance that Sheng Lingmie turns back on to him.

120
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,600
Thruster!

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,120
Sheng Lingmie pull himself away from Deception.

122
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,220
Besiege them.

123
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,580
Mo Fan, come back and support us.

124
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,120
And I will look for a chance.

125
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,600
Now Jun Moxiao arrives.

126
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Dragon Tooth.

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,100
Yes, it's shown that Xing Xin is aiming at

128
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,880
eliminating Sheng Lingmie.

129
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,780
Bounding mine!

130
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,820
Sheng Lingmie is really swift.

131
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,940
Jun Moxiao escapes by jumping up,

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,760
keeps chasing to attack.

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,420
Energy Connon!

134
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,400
Jun Moxiao is hit.

135
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,560
It's from Dancing Rain.

136
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
She covers Sheng Lingmie's withdrawal.

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
Jun Moxiao and Dancing Rain used to be the best partners,

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,660
but now they fight against each other.

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,920
Jun Moxiao is blocked.

140
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,720
Will he choose to

141
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,220
beat off Dancing Rain first?

142
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,100
You merely focus on Xiao Shiqin

143
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,680
rather than saying hi to me.

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
He sends you to block me.

145
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,660
Good idea.

146
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,220
They truly know each other very well.

147
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,320
Regardless of being partners

148
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,140
or being rivals,

149
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,600
they are always well matched.

150
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,060
Stiffness bullet.

151
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,260
Both of them are hanging in the air.

152
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,160
They used to be true best partners.

153
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,160
How tacit they are!

154
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,900
They remain in the air.

155
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
Dancing Rain attempts to attack.

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,360
So does Jun Moxiao.

157
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
At the same time! Again!

158
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,440
They fire anti-tank gun simultaneously.

159
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,180
I've blocked Jun Moxiao.

160
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,320
But suddenly, Sheng Lingmie stop moving.

161
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Is that a device?

162
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,900
Ninja Burrowing.

163
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,300
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,840
Bounding mine!

165
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,820
Absolutely, it's designed by Sheng Lingmie.

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Xiao Shiqin is a tactician indeed.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,520
Followed by Aerial bombs.

168
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,160
Deception's HP is rapidly declining.

169
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,400
Go and keep the pace with Mo Fan.

170
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
His teammates timely arrive

171
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
to rescue him from the trap.

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
Xiao An, get set at position one.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,380
Roger.

174
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,660
Mo Fan, defend.

175
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,160
It should be mine.

176
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,300
He abruptly speeds up,

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,560
hindering his teammate Yi Cunhui

178
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
and Cold Hands to exercise their skills.

179
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,440
Wait, Mo Fan!

180
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,600
What are you doing?

181
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,880
Once the target is hit,

182
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,300
the game is over.

183
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,640
What?

184
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,300
Deception

185
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,940
and Han Yanrou bump into each other.

186
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,960
No communication between them?

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,620
Too reckless!

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,200
In such a crucial competition,

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,020
it is undoubtedly a blunder!

190
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,600
Satellite Ray.

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,700
Emergency!

192
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,140
Han Yanrou's HP is emptied.

193
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,460
Deception is in danger, too!

194
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,140
Double kill!

195
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,540
Mastering the art of perfect timing

196
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
helps him kill two of Xing Xin.

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Xiao Shiqin ensnares them

198
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,400
- to support Dancing Rain.

199
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,620
- how does that happen?
- to support Dancing Rain.

200
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:43,660
- how does that happen?

201
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,480
Now Xing Xin is in great danger.

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,360
Captain,

203
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,600
I remain only half a HP.

204
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,580
Mo Fan and I have been weeded out.

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,960
We lose all the benefits!

206
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,540
We have neither enough carry

207
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,420
nor time.

208
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,480
If nothing changes,

209
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
we'll lose the game.

210
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,720
The game is not over yet.

211
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,620
Cheer up.

212
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,420
Yi Fan and Xiao An, notice your HP,

213
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,240
and see you in District C.

214
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,760
Roger.

215
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,020
Lao Wei,

216
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,940
go for it.

217
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,700
Windward Formation, Xing Xin's substitute, joins the game.

218
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,140
But Jun Moxiao

219
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,920
is being blocked by three rivals

220
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,860
and unable to get out of them.

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,440
Xing Xin's players should get together right now.

222
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,180
Sheng Lingmie takes the advantage of gunshot,

223
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,580
drains the HP of Yi Cunhui

224
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,560
and Cold Hands.

225
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Jun Moxiao escaped!

226
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,260
Coordinates?

227
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,260
249

228
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,780
653

229
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
It's substitute district.

230
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,700
They're going there for Windward Formation.

231
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,820
It's my showtime.

232
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,440
Jia Shi's Matchstick is moving to substitute district,

233
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,140
and Leaf of Autumn will replace him.

234
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,660
It appears that

235
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,200
they'll let Sun Xiang finish the game.

236
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,920
As we can see,

237
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Xing Xin are now short of hands.

238
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,180
Yi Cunhui and Cold Hands

239
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,020
remain only a little HP,

240
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,540
while Jia Shi keep blocking them.

241
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Anti-tank gun!

242
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,860
Retreat.

243
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,880
Jun Moxiao covers

244
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,680
the rest of Xing Xin to retreat

245
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,700
and wait for a chance to recover.

246
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,620
Drawing Jia Shi's attention,

247
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,760
will offer them a good opportunity to heal.

248
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,080
No!

249
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,660
Leaf of Autumn arrives ahead of him

250
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,800
and blocks them.

251
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,920
Stiffness bullet!

252
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,500
Leaf of Autumn is hindered

253
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,760
by Jun Moxiao.

254
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
They finally come face to face with each other.

255
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,060
Jun Moxiao controlled by Ye Qiu

256
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,740
clashes with Leaf of Autumn controlled by Sun Xiang.

257
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,640
Leaf of Autumn stops blocking

258
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,460
and dashes to Jun Moxiao.

259
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,520
By switching forms,

260
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,700
Jun Moxiao strikes back with Gatling Gear,

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
dodges the attack from Leaf of Autumn by sliding.

262
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,840
At present,

263
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
Jun Moxiao intends to block Leaf of Autumn,

264
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
thus helping his teammates quickly retreat

265
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,140
and regenerate HP.

266
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,820
I'll block him.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
And you move in the direction of 10 o' clock.

268
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,480
Dragon Soaring!

269
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,600
Leaf of Autumn uses an ultimate skill,

270
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,260
which shows that he'd like to finish the game as fast as possible

271
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,780
to chase those without enough HP.

272
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,160
Jun Moxiao turns his gun into shield.

273
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,580
He's gonna directly take it?

274
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,360
No.

275
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,380
Dragon Soaring was aimed at

276
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,800
Yi Cunhui and Cold Hands.

277
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,800
Leaf of Autumn feinted against Jun Moxiao

278
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
in order to wait for a chance

279
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,940
to kill those two of Xing Xin.

280
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Before returning to League,

281
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,460
You still have a long way to go.

282
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,820
Awesome tactics! Double kill!

283
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,720
Xing Xin is on the edge of danger

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,140
with less than one minute left.

285
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,180
Jun Moxiao is under siege of five of Jia Shi.
with less than one minute left.

286
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,500
Jun Moxiao is under siege of five of Jia Shi.

287
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,220
He persists in his original goal

288
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,200
which is to kill Sheng Lingmie.

289
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,520
Only twenty seconds left.

290
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,720
Gate of Death!

291
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,740
At this critical moment,

292
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
except Sheng Lingmie, four of Jia Shi are captured.

293
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,440
Windward Formation arrives.

294
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,340
Not much time left.

295
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,040
Sheng Lingmie's HP keeps decreasing.

296
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,440
Five seconds left.

297
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,720
Three.

298
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,700
Two.

299
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,540
The last hit.

300
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,840
Can he make it?

301
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,100
Fire!

302
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,920
Time's up.

303
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,600
Sheng Lingmie surprisingly

304
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,560
remains 0.1% of HP.

305
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,700
What a pity.

306
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,040
Unfortunately, Xing Xin was defeated.

307
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,580
Let's go back.

308
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,720
Bao Zi sneaked it again?

309
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,700
No, I didn't.

310
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,860
Boss, I saw him.

311
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,720
Well,

312
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,600
let me help you.

313
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,700
We'll go for the Challenge!

314
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,960
Bao Zi,

315
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,760
are these slanted?

316
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,120
Bao Zi?

317
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Taking part in the Challenge

318
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,520
may be impossible for us.

319
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,320
We lost the game...

320
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,240
We'd better clean up these things,

321
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,780
in case they feel upset.

322
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,260
Don't do that.

323
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,120
Just because they are upset now,

324
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,820
we should keep these things intact.

325
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,620
We should

326
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,780
cheer them up.

327
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,000
Come on,

328
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,040
never mind,

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
even though we miss the chance this year,

330
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,760
we can seize it next year.

331
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,620
Hurry up, let's get these things done!

332
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,900
= Xing Xin Team =

333
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,240
Captain Ye,

334
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,060
Xing Xin finally killed one of Jia Shi.

335
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,760
We didn't fail completely?

336
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
There was a mistake in the referee's timer.

337
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,020
You successfully killed Xiao Shiqin at the last moment.

338
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,240
You made a big mistake.

339
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
The name of team is wrong.

340
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
It should be called

341
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,100
Xing Xin.

342
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,540
Boss,

343
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,080
from now on,

344
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,480
Ye Xiu and Jun Moxiao

345
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,800
will always be with Xing Xin.

346
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,960
Tang Rou, Han Yanrou will be with Xingxin.

347
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,780
Bao Zi, the Invader will always be with Xing Xin.

348
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Qiao Yifan, Yi Cunhui will be with Xing Xin.

349
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,840
Thank you so much.

350
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,380
I will not fail

351
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,040
your expectation.

352
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,360
Dad,

353
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,000
something puzzling happens to me today,

354
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,500
would you like to hear me?

355
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,640
Our team

356
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,600
have tackled all kinds of toughness,

357
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,020
but still failed to reach the Challenge.

358
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,120
We can wait for another year,

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,540
but, you know, easier said

360
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,840
than actually done.

361
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,280
Dad,

362
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,640
will this team still exist?

363
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,120
Are they really willing to face

364
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,480
failure and consequences?

365
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,000
Why don't you choose

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,700
Battlemage as Leaf of Autumn?

367
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,720
Short-sighted.
Battlemage as Leaf of Autumn?

368
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
Short-sighted.

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,260
For you, Launcher is enough.

370
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,460
See,

371
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,680
# Your old coat feels like an umbrella #

372
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,720
No matter how far your target is,

373
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,420
once you are determined,

374
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,540
you just need to focus on it

375
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,140
and never give up,

376
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,820
then you will finally reach it.

377
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,700
Got it?

378
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,240
Have a try.

379
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Never say never.

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,940
Find out about wrongdoings.

381
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,560
Try again.

382
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,520
Fire!

383
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,820
That's my girl!

384
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,500
Dad, I got it.

385
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,080
What I should do is to promise them

386
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll make all my efforts to lead them to the destination.

387
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,280
As long as we are still be together,

388
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,260
we will never lose hope.

389
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,220
We should face our failure,

390
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,860
find out our problems

391
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,420
and tackle them.

392
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,700
# Time sometimes flies so fast when we are together #

393
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,020
# Sometimes time becomes so slow #

394
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,680
# You are my dearest in my heart #

395
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,200
Dad,

396
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,960
There's still a long way to go.

397
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,000
# Let us stay together #

398
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,620
A candy for you

399
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,040
to make you feel sweet

400
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,580
and happier.

401
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,940
Or eat a lemon?

402
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,780
Its sour can

403
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,200
let you forget all the troubles.

404
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,780
Congratulations.

405
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,540
But you are merely worth one point.

406
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,940
Team can't survive without funds,

407
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,500
but I'm not good at making money.

408
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,940
Boss,

409
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,420
that's not a big problem.

410
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,240
Adequate funds will not automatically bring a team unity.

411
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,520
You're right.

412
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,340
Although I am not good at making money,

413
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,320
providing backup services,

414
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,420
and administering,

415
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,540
I will work harder

416
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,540
and never give up!

417
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,740
Let's reflect on our performance.

418
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:30,820
Yes,
Let's reflect on our performance.

419
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,320
Yes,

420
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,240
the Challenge is coming soon.

421
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,100
We ought to

422
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,140
find out our wrongdoings.

423
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,300
We should make more efforts than ever before

424
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
and adjust our training methods.

425
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,460
Take it easy.

426
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,860
As for tonight,

427
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,660
let's take a break.

428
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,240
Have you been eager to

429
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,680
get some rest?

430
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,440
What about tonight?

431
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,580
In normal times you are

432
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,280
restrained by team rules.

433
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
So tonight is the time

434
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,060
for you to do something you want

435
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,920
but you are not allowed before.

436
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,040
Are you frozen?

437
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,020
Come back!

438
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,600
See you!

439
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,440
Bye!

440
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:20,960
Bye-bye!

441
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,000
See you then.

442
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,660
Bye.

443
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,620
Goodbye.

444
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,440
Any comment on me today?

445
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,260
Really relentless.

446
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,140
But... professional.

447
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,340
Of course I am!

448
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,300
Because I have a good trainer.

449
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,780
By the way,

450
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,700
where are you going?

451
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,280
No idea.

452
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,380
# I'm just as before #

453
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,340
Why not get on the bus?

454
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,780
Then get off whenever you want.

455
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,980
# Remain true to original aspiration #

456
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,760
# You're just as before #

457
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,680
# Keep calm even though I have to leave #

458
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,680
# I'm just as before #

459
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,360
# Writing an end for the story #

460
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,060
If you were me,
# Writing an end for the story #

461
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,140
# Writing an end for the story #

462
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,060
what would you do?
# Writing an end for the story #

463
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,640
# Writing an end for the story #

464
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,680
You would shoulder the responsibility

465
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,220
# Let me have a short break #
You would shoulder the responsibility

466
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,360
# Let me have a short break #

467
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
and grow stronger,
# Let me have a short break #

468
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,440
# Let me have a short break #

469
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,440
wouldn't you?

470
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,220
# I believe after frustration #

471
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,300
# One day my courage will create miracle #

472
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,240
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

473
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,880
I see.
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

474
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,480
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

475
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,180
Thanks.
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

476
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,540
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

477
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,640
# My friends are waiting for me #

478
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,080
# I know I am never alone #

479
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,820
# We will go together and shake the world #

480
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,840
# Let's move towards the legend #

481
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,400
# Unwilling to mediocrity #

482
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,720
# Not limited by the success #

483
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,480
# We've agreed to meet again one day #

484
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,340
# I'll coming back with a larger scale than I left #

485
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,200
# Floating with the stream, #

486
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,480
# Standing at the peak of the star #

487
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,020
# At that moment, I finally understand me of the past #

488
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,880
# Always being my own hero #

489
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:42,180
# I once saw the legend #

490
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:52,260
# I once saw the legend #

491
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,520
You have something in mind?

492
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,920
Why not tell me about it?

493
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,760
Telling someone who knows me well

494
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,880
will be useless but trouble her.

495
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Young man,

496
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,320
what's your troubles?

497
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,000
Tell me to please me.

498
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
I...

499
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
just have some mixed feelings.

500
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
All of you have made progress,

501
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,520
especially Sun Xiang

502
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,360
who has made a dramatic improvement.

503
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,120
Xiao Shiqin is truly helpful.

504
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,080
He enlightened Sun Xiang to win the game

505
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,620
rather than merely defeating you.

506
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,880
So,

507
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,640
does it make you upset?

508
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,880
I remember your brother's words that

509
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,020
only facing competitive rivals,

510
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,760
will we grow stronger.

511
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,840
You also said that

512
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,060
You will be back

513
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,200
in a year.

514
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,700
Now there only half a year left,

515
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,400
and you cannot forget your words.

516
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
I have never forgotten my words.

517
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,800
Yesterday I popped over every place you might go to!

518
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,540
I went to Lao Wei's previous studio,

519
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,240
then went to Xiao An's campus.

520
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,560
In case Yi Fan went back his hometown,

521
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
I even waited at the train station.

522
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,160
But you guys

523
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,660
just got high

524
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,820
in which were near net bar within only one kilometer!

525
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
How much time I wasted!

526
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,420
Considering that no one

527
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,040
contents with the game yesterday,

528
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,880
we'll hold a secret ballot.

529
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,100
Don't pass the buck.

530
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,940
If I'm the one who should be blamed the most,

531
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,100
then I will do my utmost

532
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,500
to improve your living conditions;

533
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
if that's not me but one of you,

534
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,680
this guy will undergo some devils training,

535
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,740
and the rest of you

536
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,100
will not be punished.

537
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,820
Go ahead.

538
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,300
What is it all about?

539
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,100
Say something, Ye.

540
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,280
Do we have to find someone to blame?

541
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,840
Luo Ji,

542
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,780
count ballots later.

543
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
Okay.

544
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,880
Now they are all sitting here,

545
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,220
but still have some unsettled problems.

546
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,140
they actually got the hump

547
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,320
= Wei Chen =

548
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
but felt embarrassed to speak out.
= Wei Chen =

549
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,800
but felt embarrassed to speak out.

550
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,860
Not far off.

551
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,780
Indeed, they need a chance to speak out.

552
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,400
Mo Fan's under considerable stress.

553
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,480
= Qiao Yifan =
Mo Fan's under considerable stress.

554
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,300
Mo Fan's under considerable stress.

555
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,740
Unless he releases it,

556
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,940
he will never dare to face it.

557
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,360
For the rest of them,

558
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,040
it is a good chance to be open and honest.
= An Wenyi =

559
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,800
it is a good chance to be open and honest.

560
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,740
Boss,

561
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,460
now you are clever the same as me.

562
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,360
Same?

563
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,440
No, we are different.

564
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,860
I am

565
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,160
totally sincere.

566
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,500
Really?

567
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,040
Yes, I not only urge them to do that,

568
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,940
but urge myself

569
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,920
to complete my schedule as early as possible.

570
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,260
It's fair to us all, so I'm sincere.

571
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,220
One vote goes to Tang Rou.

572
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,180
One vote goes to the boss.

573
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,500
One vote goes to Qiao Yifan.

574
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
One vote goes to An Wenyi.

575
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,760
One vote goes to Wei Chen.

576
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,960
One vote goes to the captain.

577
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
As for the last one...

578
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,160
The last one will

579
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,700
either make everyone get one vote,

580
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,120
or determine who will be punished.

581
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,940
Captain Ye,

582
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,780
What do you think?

583
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,160
Unfold it.

584
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,080
This is an

585
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,840
abstention.

586
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,220
So the one who won't be punished

587
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,680
is Mo Fan.

588
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,240
Any other ideas?

589
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,080
It shouldn't be like this.

590
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,760
I deserve the punishment and blame

591
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
because of what i did.

592
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,680
Nope,

593
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
it's my fault.

594
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,140
I could have kill Lao Xiao in the second half of the game.

595
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
My fault.

596
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,780
I didn't protect Xiao An well.

597
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:01,800
It's not your problem
I didn't protect Xiao An well.

598
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,560
It's not your problem

599
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,200
but mine.

600
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,600
I failed to heal you, either.

601
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,920
I'll take responsibility for our failure.

602
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,500
No, I should be blamed.

603
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,880
If I can attack rivals

604
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,140
in a more effective manner,

605
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,060
we couldn't have suffered

606
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,000
such an awkward situation.

607
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,660
Nay!

608
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,840
It's all my fault.

609
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,120
If I have joined you,

610
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,420
they wouldn't have won.

611
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,240
Are you kidding?

612
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,420
It's none of your business.

613
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,180
You were not there yesterday,

614
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,020
and you know nothing.

615
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,860
It's not a proper way to ask for more training.

616
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,980
In Xing Xin team,

617
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,300
we stick to the facts.

618
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,340
You needn't apologize for it so eagerly.

619
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,580
Have a seat.

620
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,560
Well,

621
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,920
except Mo Fan,

622
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
as we promised just now,

623
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
because each of us gets one vote,

624
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,100
each of us should face punishment.

625
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,840
We have no problem with that,

626
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,920
but you may face

627
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,160
a big problem.

628
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,280
Boss,

629
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,940
to be honest, we are satisfied with current situation.

630
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,940
I haven't done nearly enough.

631
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,120
You all try your best,

632
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
I ought to do my utmost, too.

633
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,460
In another word,

634
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,320
as your boss,

635
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
of course I should be a good role model.

636
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,120
What has been said

637
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
cannot be unsaid.

638
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,700
Even if it is a burden,

639
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,900
it's my pleasure to shoulder it.

640
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,860
Captain Ye,

641
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
you used a wrong word.

642
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,160
There's no burden for me

643
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,200
but pleasure.

644
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,700
Hello?

645
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,100
You want to buy skill books?

646
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Well, you need to queue up,

647
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,100
because there are considerable teams waiting to buy.

648
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,980
Look, first come, first serve.

649
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,060
Thanks for your support.

650
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,760
Boss,

651
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,900
what are you selling?

652
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,200
You know, the skill is our competitiveness.

653
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,020
so I am trying to transform our skill

654
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
into products.

655
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,780
That's why

656
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
our skill books

657
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,440
are the best choice.

658
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,360
That's true！

659
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,280
Improving SP with skill books,

660
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,600
for other teams,

661
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,820
is really attractive.

662
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,380
Why couldn't I think of that?

663
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Of course you couldn't.

664
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,120
I was inspired by our captain.

665
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,520
Although it's unsure whether there's any buyer,

666
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,380
at least I could give a try.

667
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,620
Hello?

668
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,220
Yes?

669
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,260
Make a deal!

670
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,720
We huddle together

671
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,860
in the hurly-burly,

672
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,560
but still find joy.

673
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,260
However,

674
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,720
we can't be stuck

675
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,380
in a rut.

676
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,940
Since we sold skill books,

677
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,520
Our new life begins.

678
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,260
Well,

679
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,740
Being woke up by noisy radio

680
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,500
is not what we look forward to.

681
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,380
# The Third Set of Radio Calisthenics #

682
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,020
# for China's Middle School Students: Dancing Steps of Youth #

683
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,040
Who's doing that?
# for China's Middle School Students: Dancing Steps of Youth #

684
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,140
# for China's Middle School Students: Dancing Steps of Youth #

685
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,520
I hate it!

686
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,860
Bao Zi,

687
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,480
Bao Zi, wake up!

688
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Get out of bed,

689
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,840
or we'll be late for training.

690
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,880
Wake up!

691
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,520
Captain

692
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,080
and buddies,

693
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,080
it's time to get up!

694
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,080
Here you are.

695
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,100
I've made breakfast,
Here you are.

696
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,440
I've made breakfast,

697
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,460
in case you'll be late.
I've made breakfast,

698
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,340
in case you'll be late.

699
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,260
We can't be late at all!

700
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,300
It's only eight now,
We can't be late at all!

701
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,700
It's only eight now,

702
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,360
unless you live in GMT+9 timezone.

703
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,000
You wake us up an hour early.

704
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
- No, captain,
- I don't wanna eat it.

705
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,500
it's specially prepared for you.

706
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,540
You have to eat up your food.

707
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,100
I slept so well here.

708
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,080
Look at this room.

709
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,340
Look at this TV,

710
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,020
furniture and decoration.

711
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,140
It seems designed for me.

712
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,420
Without my enormous contribution,

713
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,980
we couldn't have had any skill book;

714
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,900
Without skill books,

715
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,400
we couldn't have had such a big house.

716
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,240
Without this big house,

717
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,000
you couldn't have had such a high living standard.

718
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
Hey, hey!

719
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
You boys doe!

720
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,080
Well, I know you're thankful for these.

721
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,880
What's the matter with him?

722
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,420
Last week's training data

723
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,560
has been generated.

724
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,880
Come here and have a look.

725
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
Tang Rou's DPS is truly high.

726
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,140
So she certainly has no need to check her data.

727
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,040
All of us have made

728
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
a steady progress.

729
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,220
However...

730
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,340
To my surprise,
However...

731
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:04,820
To my surprise,

732
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,260
bro,

733
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,300
you are not the last one

734
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,260
but rise from the bottom!

735
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,180
Data tells the truth.

736
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,760
It's just part of the truth.

737
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,600
What does that mean?

738
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,700
It means that

739
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,660
you are fortunate this time,

740
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,120
and next time Mo Fan will definitely exceed you,

741
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,160
will you, Mo Fan?
and next time Mo Fan will definitely exceed you,

742
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,020
will you, Mo Fan?

743
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,020
Why am I always be the last one?

744
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,180
I can't be a burden of Xing Xin.

745
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,600
I'll get back to Glory

746
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,880
and practice hard.

747
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
Although he's at the bottom of this list,

748
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,580
But he's at the top

749
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,080
of another list.

750
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,240
Scrap Picker reward list.

751
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,320
No more than three words a week,

752
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,660
I can't see through what's going on in his mind.

753
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,240
Let's see him in the game.

754
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,900
I am the top Scrap Picker of Glory.

755
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,580
This kid's lucky.

756
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,060
Got an orange suit at the beginning.

757
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,040
So lucky.

758
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
= System prompt: orange equipment, the Lightsaber is available =

759
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,660
I can't be the last one.

760
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
What?

761
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,180
He doesn't pick the equipment after killing someone?

762
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,280
Isn't he here to scrap-pick?

763
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
He'll lose badly sooner or later

764
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,340
if he still plays like that.

765
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,060
He might be training in this way.

766
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,880
But unfortunately,

767
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,760
it's a wrong way.

768
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
Kill people steadily and severely.

769
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,100
My DPS

770
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,260
can't be the last.
