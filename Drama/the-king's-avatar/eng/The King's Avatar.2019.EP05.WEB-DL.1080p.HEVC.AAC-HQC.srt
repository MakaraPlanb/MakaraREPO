=Episode 5

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Win again

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,640
Just a little luck.

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
Clearly is very strong

6
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
The time for modesty must be low-key.

7
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
The high-profile time must show off

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
I-I really don't have a strategy

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
You are really experienced

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,160
No friends, no files

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,320
What can I do? I am also very helpless

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,360
If you don't add friends, you can teach by word and deed.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Do not receive files

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
You will change your strategy

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
What can I do then

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
I am also very irritable.

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
That craziness can't solve the problem either.

18
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you sure you can't finish the task

19
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
I

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Definitely

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,240
Under the guidance of the boss

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,920
It is an achievable task.

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
The deadline is 24 hours.

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
The bell rang

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Become a useful person

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
or become a slag

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
This is my handwritten Glory World Rule

28
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,720
It's not a teaching strategy.

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
It's just a process introduction.

30
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Nor is it a boast of successful experience

31
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
It's just a collection of failures and lessons.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry

33
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
I don't read manuscripts

34
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,720
Bring it here

35
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,200
What broken manuscripts can only be thrown away

36
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Don, take your time

37
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,320
Come on, come on, have fun

38
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Smelly boy go to work quickly

39
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,720
Xiao Tang, you are quite good now.

40
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Progress is very fast.

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,160
You didn't fight me for two minutes before.

42
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
Now you can't even reach 40 seconds

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,640
In fact, it can be faster

44
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
What miracle did you swallow?

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
Or did you take the medicine

46
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
It must be the manuscript

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
I just flipped through it

48
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
There is nothing worth watching

49
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
You threw it away

50
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Where did you throw it

51
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Throw it at the bar

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
Uh

53
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,120
Please type last month's statement.

54
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll pass

55
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,600
Boss, you have been urging me

56
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
Do things early

57
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,480
So I finished it yesterday

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
By the way, use Microsoft spreadsheet software

59
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,320
A settlement was drawn up.

60
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
The computer in Area B 47 is broken

61
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,760
Take a look at it

62
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,560
Boss, you have been urging me

63
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Internet cafes run on computers.

64
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,280
Head can be broken blood can flow computer must be good

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
So what?

66
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,200
The one in area b

67
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,080
I fixed it as soon as it broke down.

68
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Thank you for the universal restart button.

69
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Did the boss tell you

70
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,160
They should disappear when they should not appear.

71
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,800
What should not appear

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,520
Now

73
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Network manager

74
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,560
Coming

75
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
When did you become so quick

76
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Okay

77
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
This is a long-lost one.

78
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,200
The secret of Glory

79
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,120
Xiao Tang watched this

80
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
As if the light had been turned on

81
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
I also don't ask for light

82
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
I just look at it

83
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
What is this?

84
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
Poached Egg

85
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,880
This little Tang is practicing strategy？

86
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,040
Or a recipe.

87
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,640
Z-word jitter

88
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,000
The most important thing is that during the movement process

89
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hand Speed Control for Direction Change Operation

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What kind of salted duck egg is it?

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
Falling palm

92
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,760
Although is not a high-level skills

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
it has a very strong blowing effect

94
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,040
The blowing distance played

95
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,000
can control outside the opponent's attack range

96
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
That is an extremely terrible micromanagement

97
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,920
Is this a teacup?

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,240
Why there is a cup?

99
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
Fancy tattoo

100
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,360
This must be a fancy tattoo practiced by battlemage.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
This critical moment

102
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
Still have to rely on my sister's understanding

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sitting for too long is not a good combination of work and rest.

104
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,560
See here please get up and have a drink of tea

105
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Let's take a break between classes.

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are we talking about

107
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,600
I gave you a copy.

108
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Jun Moxiao online time statistics

109
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,600
If you have to wait, you should at least follow his schedule.

110
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Otherwise, you will wait for the rabbit.

111
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
It's almost like a Waiting Stone.

112
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm tired of thinking about the plan.

113
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
How to arrange it?

114
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Uh...

115
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,160
You go and call a group of people together.

116
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
I have a task later

117
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,400
How will the big plan be arranged?

118
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
The place where the bones were buried was agreed upon by the brothers last time.

119
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
When will you get off the books?

120
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
You really miss it

121
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Oh,no. You lied to me last time

122
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
I'll wait for you because I've arranged all the people.

123
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
You don't sway me

124
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Your people don't have to bother

125
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,880
I have my own team

126
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
See you in half an hour

127
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
His own team

128
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
This is to bring a team of experts to help me

129
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,520
Come with me to Buried Ground

130
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,320
What do you think?

131
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
Can some one fight against mein the Buried Ground?

132
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,200
There are plenty of opponents to practice with.

133
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
Everyone is quite fierce

134
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
That's quite suitable for me

135
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,160
Give it a try

136
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,320
President, are these people all masters

137
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
Of course, is a master

138
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,920
You see the momentum of this female fighting method

139
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,920
A look at the ability is very strong

140
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
It seems that this is her first time

141
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,520
This year

142
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,240
There are fewer and fewer great gods willing to teach new people.

143
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
But copies like this

144
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
A team can only take one

145
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
You all have a chance

146
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,760
Later on

147
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
What about the future

148
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Look at this ranger

149
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,760
This ranger is very experienced at first sight.

150
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,080
President

151
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
This is the gunner last time?

152
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
The inexperienced one?

153
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
No experience

154
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
It's all a lesson.

155
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,040
Just looks a bit like

156
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
Master, let's go

157
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
Wait for another person

158
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
See

159
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
The master said to wait for another person

160
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
It must be a peerless player

161
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,200
All the top players are the final ones.

162
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
It must be very strong

163
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
She just registered yesterday and buying equipment now  .

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,680
Are you sure this can be recorded

165
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,280
Who pressed my stool

166
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Who?

167
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
This ..

168
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm-I'm going to start

169
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
Can these two newcomers do it

170
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
This Bao Zi is too random, isn't he?

171
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
It was he who beat a monster for ten seconds.

172
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,720
He won in two minutes

173
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
What level is this

174
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,600
Han Yanrou indeed as expected

175
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
haven't made any copies at all.

176
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,360
She have no idea of cooperation at all.

177
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,960
President, this is a bit messy.

178
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
Hold on, hold on. It's all tactics.

179
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
Why is one person missing?

180
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,760
Where is the gunner

181
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Why are there only four left

182
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
I lost one.

183
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
May be bought too many weapons and can't move

184
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,000
The gunner is also too unreliable

185
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Zombie Bailey escaped

186
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,080
The keel will be drilled soon.

187
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
It is really unreliable.

188
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,840
Zombie Bailey has run away

189
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,240
Still shooting aimlessly

190
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,560
Oh, my God, a reaction time of 0.1 second

191
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,640
Hit the target

192
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Who do you think is standing on the keel

193
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
Shooting all the way around

194
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,560
Accurately driving zombie Bailey

195
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,800
to Jun Moxiao

196
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,280
Broken umbrellas turn into spears.

197
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,560
This is a sharp stab.

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,280
What kind of gun is this?

199
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,160
She can use this

200
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
and play like this

201
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,120
Ninety percent must be professionals.

202
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,320
Female Gunner

203
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,960
Mu

204
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
Is it Su Mucheng

205
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,600
Of course it is Su Mucheng

206
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
to help us make a copy of Lanxi Pavilion

207
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
Must be Su Mucheng

208
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,680
This time, the President

209
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,120
President can boast around.

210
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,840
Even Su Mucheng has come to Lanxi Pavilion to make a copy.

211
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't be ridiculous.

212
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
This time is only lucky

213
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,840
to shoot like this.

214
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
Focus on our mission.

215
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
It turned out to be a coincidence.

216
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,720
I thought she is Su Mucheng

217
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,200
Congratulations to Lanxi Pavilion player Jun Moxiao

218
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Feng Shu Yanmo, Bao Zi Ruqin

219
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,240
Han Yanrou and Lan He break record of Buried Ground

220
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
See the new record

221
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
What did I just say

222
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,720
This is the strategy of my brother and I.

223
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,680
The president is wise

224
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,240
The president is wise.

225
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Yes, yes.

226
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,120
Jun Moxiao is awesome

227
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,480
Record again

228
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
Tenth District Record Grand Slam

229
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
Jun Moxiao you are the best.

230
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,080
Jun Moxiao is the strongest master in history

231
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,760
Lanxi Pavilion Dominates the top place

232
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,560
Who will break this record?

233
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
I ate the keyboard

234
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800
I said

235
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
If it weren't for my gun

236
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,240
Zombie Bailey had already run away

237
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,720
My lady, that's the President of Lanxi Pavilion.

238
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,080
He will know it is you.

239
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,480
If not say something

240
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
Jiashi will know it

241
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
What can you do

242
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,520
I'm not afraid

243
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
Professional players come to snatch the copy record.

244
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,120
How embarrassing is it to bully the small with the big?

245
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,280
Who would believe it if they said it?

246
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
Scold me

247
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
The new form is unlocked.

248
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,480
Help me test a thousand-machine Umbrella?

249
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,880
I will show no mercy

250
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,600
This transformation form

251
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,920
It's called the Pure Soul war spear

252
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,760
Attack speed 5

253
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
The Fastest Attack Speed in war spear

254
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,400
This transformation form

255
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,760
Called the decider's rifle.

256
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
Light weight and large recoil

257
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,200
Perfect Transformation of Gun Profession

258
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
This transformation is called heraldic shield

259
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,600
It evolved from the knight's shield.

260
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,640
Can easily change the priesthood skill of preventing high blood thickness.

261
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
At the same time, it also

262
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
owns high magic resistance and wide defense range

263
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,760
It is a close-fitting weapon for the fighting profession.

264
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
All right, stop it

265
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Because of it

266
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
We stole her hairpin the day before yesterday.

267
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,960
She stole her rubber band again yesterday.

268
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,200
She stole her performance dress today.

269
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,880
You didn't use the stolen word very accurately.

270
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
This thing goes back and forth in one's own hands.

271
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
At best, it can be regarded as recycling to maximize its value.

272
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,000
Isn't it

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
Look at this hairpin and this rubber band

274
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Especially this costume

275
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
Flexibility is just right.

276
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,360
Perfect

277
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,640
Run

278
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,840
Come here today.

279
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,160
I'm offline. I'm going to train.

280
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,200
On the tactics of this competition

281
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
We'd better confirm it.

282
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,880
I already said at the tactical meeting

283
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
You just need to be my assistant.

284
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,000
Leave the rest to me.

285
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,360
If this arrangement is absolutely necessary

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
There are a few points I would like to remind

287
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,000
Yu Wenzhou and Huang Shaotian in Lan Yu

288
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
This is not my first match

289
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,480
Mucheng is there.

290
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Captain

291
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
What's up?

292
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,560
Well, you just became captain

293
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,920
This is a new atmosphere both inside and outside Jiashi.

294
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,720
I think the decoration style

295
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,280
It must also be refreshed.

296
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,640
You see, this is a new rendering.

297
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
You can handle such trifles at your own discretion.

298
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,480
Okay, I'll get someone to arrange it right away.

299
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,920
But there is one thing I haven't done well

300
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,960
Say ..

301
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
Now Jiashi is on a upward trend.

302
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,680
Only this guild

303
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,240
With the atmosphere of the team

304
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,600
Drag the captain's hind legs

305
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,000
Is the guild's performance that bad?

306
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,080
The main reason is that there is an expert stirring up.

307
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,640
He not only robbed several big guilds' first kill

308
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,160
but also the record

309
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,680
He is a long-term occupying.

310
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
Copy record

311
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,640
This is simple

312
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,920
What kind of expert can there be in Glory

313
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
So

314
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,640
We will go to the team tomorrow to report a copy of the record

315
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
It is absolutely stable

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,320
No one can surpass it.

317
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,480
This is all the credit of everyone

318
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,280
But what we have to do is to make persistent efforts.

319
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
Take another copy of the record

320
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
Your enthusiasm was too high just now.

321
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,600
It scared the hell out of our new copy records.

322
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Three, two, one

323
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
Start

324
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Congratulations to Jia Dynasty players, Yi FeiXiangtian, Lin Linsha,

325
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Meng Tianchen, Jiuyang, Jinxiang.

326
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,280
Breaking the Record of Buried Ground

327
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Results: 16 minutes 56 seconds 78

328
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,080
What are records used for

329
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,920
is to let we Lanxi pavilion

330
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
to break

331
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,640
Everyone should be prepared

332
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,360
I will launch a new round soon.

333
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
Attacks on copy records

334
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
You also have to work hard to refuel

335
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,320
Come on

336
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
You can certainly do it

337
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Brother, do you have a paper record?

338
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,760
It broke in two days without persistence.

339
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
Is it too harsh to say so?

340
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,840
Can't say that

341
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Brother, the new records are all paper tigers.

342
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
You don't have to be too sad

343
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
No, in case

344
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,160
What if the master likes to challenge?

345
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,040
Brother, what did you withdraw again

346
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,280
Hideous news

347
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,800
Brother, do you need any materials recently

348
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,640
The guild has newly made a powerful spider silk

349
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,920
The more materials, the better

350
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Then make another appointment

351
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,440
But this record

352
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,880
How do you say after-sales service

353
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,880
Should there be a three-guarantee policy?

354
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,520
What three guarantees do you want for a three-no product?

355
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,600
I saw the new record

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,600
16 minutes 56 seconds 78

357
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
Should be deployed professional players

358
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,120
And this result is already the limit.

359
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,160
It is almost impossible to break through again.

360
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Is it impossible

361
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,480
Then our record is gone

362
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,200
But I like to be in the impossible

363
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
looking for possibilities

364
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
Sun led professional players to brush out

365
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,880
16 minutes 56 seconds 78

366
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
No matter how many times I simulate actual combat

367
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,720
Also can't find a way to speed up

368
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,040
and short the time

369
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,000
Since straight way is blocked

370
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,520
Then we have to find a  by-pass

371
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,760
But I still need a swordsman

372
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,920
Is this Internet cafe contracted by Ye Qiu

373
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,160
There's a match tonight. I'll help Jiashi.

374
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
So obviously you can't see it

375
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Particularly obvious

376
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
This is the same height humanoid board I bought for tonight.

377
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,920
The original size is exactly the same as that of Ye Qiu.

378
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,800
Can you help me put this here

379
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Give it to you.

380
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,760
Equal size?

381
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
Equal height?

382
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
By the way, smelly boy, I ask you

383
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,520
What do you think of the match tonight

384
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Which team will win?

385
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,280
Boss, which team do you want to win

386
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,480
Anyway, I think Jiashi will lose

387
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,600
Jiashi would be impossible to win without Ye Qiu

388
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
This

389
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,080
What are you hissing about

390
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,000
I asked you which team would win

391
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
I didn't ask you to disarm the bomb

392
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,320
Forget it

393
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,800
You put these posters later

394
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,320
Give me all hung up

395
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,760
I want everyone who comes to the internet cafe today

396
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,480
All bathed in Ye Qiu's eyes

397
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
Boss

398
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,400
You are good at picking posters.

399
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,000
It's very sharp and unique. The humanoid board is well done.

400
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,520
Higher than Ye Qiu himself

401
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,160
Handmade videos are also great.

402
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
Why don't we be thorough

403
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
The Internet cafe password has also been changed

404
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,000
It's called Ye Qiu Unbeatable and Most Handsome.

405
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Ye Qiu Unbeatable and Most Handsome.

406
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
That's a good one

407
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,080
I feel the temperament of my Internet cafe

408
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
It's all different.

409
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You should have heard it

410
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,880
I just used rhetoric

411
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,080
This is called irony

412
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,200
That's it

413
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,160
The smelly boy has made progress

414
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,120
This is the Glory Professional League

415
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,800
The 16th round of the season

416
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,120
The Jiashi Team Against Lan Yu Team

417
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,240
Hello, everyone, audience and friends

418
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,880
And everyone watching live

419
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,960
Little friends

420
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
See you again

421
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,040
I am your old friend.

422
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,960
Xiao Luo

423
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,760
Please welcome the host team immediately.

424
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Jiashi Team, please

425
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
First to enter

426
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,840
is the new captain of Jiashi

427
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Sun Xiang, known as the new king

428
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,440
Following him closely

429
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
is the first gunner in our alliance.

430
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
Su Mucheng

431
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,440
Let's welcome the challenger

432
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,320
Lan Yu Team, please

433
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,280
First came to us

434
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,600
The first is the so-called

435
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,760
Yu Wenzhou, one of the alliance's four greatest tacticians

436
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
The second is our Sword master Huang Shaotian

437
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,120
After all, whether the new Fighting God Sun Xiang

438
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,080
can survive Huang Shaotian

439
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,920
the Sword master

440
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,840
The two teams have assembled

441
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,920
Please shake hands with each other

442
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,800
The elder of the little classmate came to tell you

443
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,360
The gap between you and your father

444
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,560
Listen carefully in class for a while.

445
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Did Sister Su miss me

446
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
No

447
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
You're fat again.

448
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,920
Shut up

449
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,360
Now between the players of our two teams

450
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
All have simply said hello

451
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,840
I don't know

452
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,200
Did they make any sparks

453
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
This is incredible

454
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
Where is the webmaster beer

455
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,280
There

456
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,640
The Lan Yu team has fallen behind 0-3.

457
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,440
It seems that after the last victory over Wei Cao Team

458
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,240
With the the newcomer Sun Xiang

459
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Jiashi is very strong

460
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,640
And the Sun now has Leaf of Autumn

461
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,800
Such a divine account number

462
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,840
Then his strength will be by going up one flight of stairs

463
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,040
There are three players from each team in the ring match.

464
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,480
The loser leaves the game using KOF

465
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
Change other teammates on the team

466
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,320
No one can go to a certain team.

467
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
The winning team scored three points.

468
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,160
Is it possible for Sun Xiang to defeat the three

469
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,280
No way

470
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,320
As for itself, it is very difficult to defeat the three by one

471
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,680
What's more, the opponent's strength is not weak

472
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,080
Jiashi will win

473
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
Then finally comes

474
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,880
the long-awaited ring match

475
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,640
Jiashi vs. Lan Yu Challenge Race Begins

476
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,200
First round

477
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,680
Sun Xiang Leave of Autumn

478
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,480
Against Yu Feng's Crazy Swordsmen

479
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
Competition Map First-Line Canyon

480
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
Start of the game

481
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,360
We saw Leaf of Autumn coming forward

482
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,200
It's just going to be positive.

483
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,080
The blow was dodged by Leaf of Autumn.

484
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
Backhand Dragon Teeth Floating

485
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Then pick up the day strike Feng Mang Huijian fall on the ground

486
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,400
Strong dragon pressure

487
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
The attack rhythm of Yiyezhiqiu is very good.

488
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,920
Never excepted

489
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,280
Sun Xiang attacted as soon as he came up.

490
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,320
The pressure was too great for Yu Feng to resist.

491
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,240
The Leaf of Autumn suddenly launched an onslaught.

492
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Feng Mang Huijian is dangerous.

493
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,560
It is very likely that they will be taken away directly.

494
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,520
Sun only uses 15% of the blood volume

495
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,320
He killed Yu Feng, Lan Yu's first player.

496
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,160
Great advantage

497
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,280
It seems that one defeat three is very promising.

498
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,640
Lan Yu's second player

499
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,000
Qigong master Tao luo Shaming came on stage.

500
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
We saw that the fallen petal palm hit and was forced by the dragon.

501
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
Great, Sun uses only 10% of the blood volume

502
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,800
Another player from Lan Yu was killed.

503
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,360
Jia Shi's fans have already started shouting

504
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
Can Sun Be the Third This Season

505
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,680
finish the feat of one defaet and three?

506
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,720
The third set will begin.

507
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
We saw that Lan Yu's champion was

508
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,160
Ammunition experts, Qiang lin Danyu

509
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,040
It's another long-distance job.

510
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,320
Fu Long Xiang Tian

511
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,480
Seckill

512
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,760
Sun came to Jia Shi's first show and let us see it.

513
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,160
His terrible personal strength

514
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
It seems that Sun did it

515
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,360
He really made one defeat three

516
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,720
I think a new fighting king has been born

517
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,640
What kind of luck did you run into?

518
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,280
Can you give me a triple crown

519
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,560
Boss, boss, boss

520
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Your network manager

521
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,560
You came here

522
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
Boss, is this your network manager

523
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,520
He doesn't even know where the beer is.

524
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
Sorry, sorry

525
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,560
What's the matter with you?

526
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,040
You don't even know where the beer is

527
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,720
Now, immediately

528
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,760
Take the topographic map of this internet cafe

529
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
Draw a picture for me

530
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,600
The position of a screw

531
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
should be accurate to centimeter

532
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,720
Do you hear me

533
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,240
I

534
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
You take customers to get beer.

535
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Sorry, there it is, there it is

536
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,600
This kind of thing will not happen again next time.

537
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,440
Welcome back

538
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,880
After the singles and challenge matches

539
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,680
The score is now 0-6 behind Lan Yu.

540
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,320
If you want to win

541
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,440
In the next team match

542
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,600
Get five points

543
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,640
And get two points for team elimination

544
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,360
What good cattle do you have?

545
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Xiao Chu, bring me my account book

546
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,720
I've already calculated the account.

547
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
Do it again

548
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,440
All

549
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,960
Captain

550
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,720
Where shall we celebrate tonight?

551
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,400
Ying Chao bar

552
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,720
Later, all of you

553
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,840
All cover for me.

554
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,520
I have covered all the people across the street.

555
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
Understood, good captain.

556
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,000
Captain, let's go according to tactics.

557
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
Relax Mu Cheng

558
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,080
After all, we still have the captain.

559
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,840
We all know that the Lan Yu team has

560
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,480
Glory to One of Four Tactical Masters

561
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Yu Wenzhou

562
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
It is a team with very high tactical qualities.

563
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
The cooperation between the players is very tacit

564
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,040
And Jia Shi clan

565
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,480
The new captain Sun

566
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,520
Can he lead his teammates?

567
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,760
Play a different match

568
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,600
We will wait and see.

569
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,120
Remember, be happy

570
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,840
Less days

571
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,480
Remember tactics.

572
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Don't worry about me

573
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,440
When did I, the blade master,  drop the chain?

574
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,080
Is it right?

575
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,440
Come on

576
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Players from both sides enter the competition map.

577
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Jiashi vs. Lan Yu

578
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,720
The team match will begin immediately.

579
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
Of the two big teams

580
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
Sun battlemage Leaf of Autumn

581
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,240
Yu Wenzhou Warlock Su Ke Sa'er

582
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,360
Su Mucheng Gunner Mu Yu Chengfneg

583
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,160
Huang Shaotian, the swordsmen Ye Yu Shengfan

584
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,360
So these four star players

585
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,240
What kind of spark will they   create?

586
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,320
Sun has shown strong personal strength

587
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,440
I don't know

588
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,360
How will it work out?

589
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,080
A Leaf of Autumn Hero Pojun

590
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,600
The momentum is still very strong.

591
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,680
We saw the ammunition experts flying

592
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
After defeating Qaing Lin Danyu

593
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,360
Cut directly to warlock

594
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,280
Qaing Lin Danyu stands up

595
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,560
Interfering Leaf of Autumn's attack

596
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,360
This heat-sensitive missile repelled two people beautifully.

597
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,040
We saw Ye Yu Shengfan, the swordsman, on the other side

598
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,600
cut directly to Jiashi's sharpshooter

599
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,880
Yes, the choice of both sides

600
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
They all let the strikers cut to the back row.

601
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,080
disturb output

602
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,680
Sun's reaction is very fast

603
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,160
Yu Wenzhou's fantastic Predicts

604
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,320
Pull back the Qigong master

605
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,360
Escape the pressure of Leaf of Autumn

606
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
Yes, we see that the blood volume of both sides is now equal.

607
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,840
So this stalemate continues

608
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
Lan Yu is going to lose

609
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
The scene was very close

610
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
Lan Yu's Qigong Master fails to protect back row

611
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,400
Su Ke Sa'er is still pinned down by Leaf of Autumn.

612
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
Beautiful, Sun operates very fast.

613
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,800
Disengaging the ammunition expert's stiff bullet

614
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,480
Damn it

615
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,360
Leaf of Autumn hit Su Ke Sa'er.

616
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Sun continues the momentum

617
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,040
Sun fierce, Sun fierce

618
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
What a fart!

619
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,320
Devanning

620
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,680
Lan Yu needs to adjust the rhythm now.

621
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,960
Jia Shi's Full Staff strides forward

622
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
Want to give Lan Yu continued repression

623
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
Jiashi is to lose

624
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
To lose?

625
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,120
Who did you say was going to lose?

626
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,680
This is what you said Jia Shi is going to lose?

627
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,560
Who are you kidding?

628
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
You see, he has taken the limelight now.

629
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,360
No, Jiashi is to Lose

630
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,920
Why?

631
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,560
Yu Wenzhou used his trump card tactics

632
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,600
Lock-one & release-four tactics
