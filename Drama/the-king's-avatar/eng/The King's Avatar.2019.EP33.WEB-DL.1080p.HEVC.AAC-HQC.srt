00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,544
Our two players have been on the stage now.

4
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:37,808
Please get into the competition room
= The Ninth Glory Challenge =

5
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:38,344
for preparation.

6
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,827
Good. Yi Cunhui has detoured to the rear of Anxious Ghost.

7
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,564
His move and choice look more like an Assassin,

8
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,784
rather than a Ghostblade.

9
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,424
Now if Yi Cunhui sang the Ghost Array,

10
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:03,744
Anxious Ghost would be thrown into passivity.

11
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,749
The Ghostblade of Team Zhu Xian hasn't found that

12
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:07,798
his rival has already been in his rear.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,672
It's a bit reckless.

14
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:09,877
Yi Cunhui is going to attack.

15
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,188
It seems that he's not going to sing the Ghost Array.

16
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:21,448
Move!

17
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,495
Yi Cunhui gave up the chance of singing the Ghost Array.

18
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,828
He made a melee attack using Ghost Array and Ghost-Chop.

19
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:26,828
But it appears that flaw was exposed to

20
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:28,628
Yi Cunhui on purpose by Anxious Ghost.

21
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:30,028
What a pity!

22
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,588
He lost some HP.

23
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,588
Yi Cunhui is very familiar with this arena.

24
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,748
He escaped successfully.

25
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,228
Anxious Ghost lost his goal.

26
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,528
Yes. Anxious Ghost is very cautious now.

27
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:43,862
He is moving slowly.

28
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,508
He is searching for Yi Cunhui's location.

29
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:03,868
Look, right now Yi Cunhui is still

30
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,068
hiding on the top of the wall.

31
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,108
It appears that he's still observing the surroundings.

32
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,308
It isn't a long distance between Anxious Ghost and Yi Cunhui.

33
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,828
And the former is moving toward the latter.

34
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,988
That's a good chance!

35
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:23,868
But I don't understand what is he waiting for?

36
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,388
Anxious Ghost is quite near him.

37
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:26,668
He can make a sneak attack at any time.

38
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:27,919
Oh, no!

39
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,188
Yi Cunhui's location is exposed by his shadow.

40
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:30,468
Anxious Ghost has discovered!

41
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,628
What? Anxious Ghost didn't dodge.

42
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,308
He got hit! What happened?

43
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:41,748
Anxious Ghost is too passive.

44
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:42,468
He got repelled again.

45
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:43,388
Yi Cunhui is catching up with him.

46
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,028
It's Wen Array.

47
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:47,428
Anxious Ghost has nowhere to run.

48
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,908
Qiao Yifan knows the map much better than his opponent.

49
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:50,608
We can see that...

50
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,645
Yi Cunhui is still singing the ghost array

51
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,908
The location and timing that he chose are perfect.

52
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:03,605
One more Dark Array.

53
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:05,091
He blocked his opponent's line of sight.

54
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:06,908
Qiao Yifan's vision of overall situation is great.

55
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:08,908
Seal off the perimeter by using the Ghost Array.

56
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:11,428
It's like the encyclopedia of Ghost Array right now.

57
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,548
It's going to be game over.

58
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:16,548
The Feast of Ghosts.

59
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,628
All of the Ghost Arrays exploded at the same time.

60
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:19,028
Anxious Ghost is going to be hurt to dead.

61
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:19,828
Nice!

62
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,388
Okay. Congratulations on Qiao Yifan's victory.

63
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,308
For winning the first victory of Individual Event.

64
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:31,788
It's so amazing.

65
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:35,228
Qiao Yifan showed his strong dominance to this game.

66
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,788
He is familiar with every location,

67
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:39,668
every angle and each detail of this map.

68
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:40,988
Even to an alarming degree.

69
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:41,908
Well done.

70
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,148
Okay. Let's watch the playback on the screen.

71
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,551
It was the lightning.

72
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,915
He has used the lightning.

73
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,429
He has used the irradiating position of the lightning

74
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:54,614
when he started the second attack.

75
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:56,686
He hid his attack in it.

76
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:58,425
It caught Anxious Ghost off guard.

77
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,256
And got hit directly.

78
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,068
Ruo Feng,

79
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,708
I have a bold idea.

80
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,748
Yi Cunhui just failed in a sneak attack.

81
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,588
Was it really a stupid mistake?

82
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:07,905
After he failed, he ran quickly down to the footpath.

83
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,964
Anxious Ghost was disturbed by the lightning in the next moment.

84
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,385
Was these all a coincidence?

85
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,748
It means that it's a part of the plan.

86
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:15,374
Yes.

87
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,068
What kind of trick did you play?

88
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:20,348
We are all Ghostblade.

89
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,508
Haven't you noticed that?

90
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:27,105
We remember Qiao Yifan has been mediocre since his debut.

91
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,186
From the first time be defeated by Xuan Qi Knight

92
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,756
to nosed out the Everlasting.

93
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,308
And finally gave us such a wonderful performance today.

94
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:35,184
He has became a mature professional from an nameless person.

95
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:37,611
He is able to stand on his own two feet now.

96
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,954
And he can bring infinite hopes to the team.

97
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,068
A perfect victory.

98
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:44,468
Xing Xin Team took the first point.

99
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,228
It's fine.

100
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:48,428
- It doesn't matter. - You will make it next time.

101
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,468
Good!

102
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,380
You has shown your power to Zhu Xian Team.

103
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,557
See?

104
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:55,393
We will win even though Ye Xiu is not here.

105
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:58,695
We have to win even though captain is not here.

106
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:00,492
Next, it's my showtime.

107
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:01,752
I will win.

108
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:02,468
Congratulations on Xing Xin Team.

109
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:05,188
They took the first point of Individual Event.

110
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:05,933
In the following,

111
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,274
they decided to appoint Bao Rongxing.

112
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:09,628
And how about Zhu Xian Team?

113
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:12,104
It's Zhang Jian. They will be rivals in this round.

114
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:13,548
The second round of Individual Event.

115
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:16,068
Bao Rongxing from Xing Xin vs Zhang Jian from Zhu Xian.

116
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,381
Bao Zi, the Invader.

117
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,588
Zhang Jian, the Invisible Green Hornet.

118
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,148
It's him.

119
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:21,247
Bao Zi.

120
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:22,349
He has gone.

121
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:24,788
So fast.

122
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:25,868
We're in trouble.

123
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:27,119
What's wrong?

124
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,137
Zhang Jian is not a famous player.

125
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,508
They are all ready.

126
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,021
Please get our two players into the competition room.

127
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,868
His opponent is a veteran in Zhu Xian Team, Zhang Jian.

128
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,643
We don't know that if Bao Rongxing gets fully preparation.

129
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:51,228
They have entered the map. The game is on.

130
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,348
We can see that they meet each other in the beginning.

131
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,228
But Bao Zi is not going to fight face to face.

132
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:56,428
He chooses to run away.

133
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,300
Altough Zhang Jian is not a first-class player,

134
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,628
but he is a seven years old professional player.

135
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:01,691
He is quite experienced.

136
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,193
His techniques are very steady.

137
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:05,860
Bai Zi...

138
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,461
Maybe he can scare away the ordinarily players.

139
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:09,988
But not him.

140
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,128
Zhang Jian is a seasoned player.

141
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,138
They are getting closer.

142
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:17,988
Phoenix Cut.

143
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,108
Bao Zi, the Invader is downed.

144
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,308
He is cornered.

145
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,348
He has nowhere to run.

146
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,108
But only to fight back.

147
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,428
Bao Zi is so passive now.

148
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:26,148
He may die if he goes on like this.

149
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,335
The Intimidation Skill.

150
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:30,564
It only can weaken your opponent's attack and the attack speed.

151
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,680
It doesn't have any real defense efficacy.

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,468
It's so puzzling.

153
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,068
It seems like Bao Zi is going to fight back.

154
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,428
It works.

155
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:48,108
How can it be?

156
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,628
Ranger has no sword.

157
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,076
What's is going on?

158
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:57,301
The situation is reversing suddenly.

159
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,028
Bao Zi catches the rhythm successfully.

160
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,212
His opponent is dead now.

161
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,099
An Eye For An Eye.

162
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,486
Bao Zi has remembered his opponent's tricks.

163
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:05,363
And fought back with the same trick.

164
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,616
But when did Bao Rongxing decide to use An Eye For An Eye?

165
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:08,534
I didn't notice that.

166
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:10,672
It was that Intimidation Skill.

167
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:14,690
Although it didn't stop the Invisible Green Hornet's attack.

168
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,708
But it bought a brief gap for Bao Zi.

169
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,560
But...

170
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,068
He didn't play his best trick vexedly.

171
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:23,200
But to reverse their position by using Knee Attack.

172
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:24,828
And got behind his back to seize the opportunity.

173
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,108
Turned the tables finally.

174
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,473
He forced the Invisible Green Hornet into blind angle

175
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,328
and killed him.

176
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,038
Congratulations on Bao Rongxing.

177
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:31,443
He won this round.

178
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,393
An incredible victory!

179
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:39,865
Good!

180
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,301
Bao Zi.

181
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,373
I won!

182
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,540
Well done!

183
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:46,828
- Incredible! - You are so tough!

184
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,733
You are promising now.

185
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,554
You know how to use tricks now.

186
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,294
An Intimidation Skill with An Eye For An Eye.

187
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:53,383
How did you come up with that?

188
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,146
Are you let him forced you into the blind angle on purpose?

189
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,298
The blind angle?

190
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,338
Was that a blind angle?

191
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,988
The location where you almost lost.

192
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:06,803
Don't you know that?

193
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,910
I didn't think about it that much.

194
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,187
He was chasing me at the beginning.

195
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:13,948
And I just kept running. Ran and ran.

196
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,736
Then I felt so humiliated.

197
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:16,975
I thought I should intimidate him a little bit.

198
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,708
I didn't expect that he would use a ultimate skill on me.

199
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,937
And then I used An Eye For An Eye without thinking.

200
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,522
I thought the most important thing is to be alive.

201
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,004
Fortune always favours fools.

202
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:26,714
Well done!

203
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:27,914
Just keep trying.

204
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,136
- Fighting! - Fighting!

205
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,948
Next is the third round of Individual Event.

206
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,268
- Xing Xin Team sent Mo Fan. - Fighting!

207
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:38,068
And Zhu Xian Team sent Zhang Shu.

208
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,548
Captain is so drawling.

209
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:44,868
We don't know when will he come back.

210
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:47,388
Just play to your strengths later.

211
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,628
Go and find a place to hide.

212
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:51,788
Never launch an attack unless you have to.

213
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:53,868
Do you understand?

214
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,228
I've not finished yet.

215
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,868
Okay. The third round is going to begin.

216
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,388
Mo Fan from Xing Xin Team vs. Zhang Shu from Zhu Xian Team.

217
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,188
It's a battle between Ninja and Knight.

218
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:04,708
Speaking of it,

219
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,348
Mo Fan did a great job in Team Competition.

220
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:09,748
This is his first time to take part in the Individual Event.

221
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:12,708
Deception is a famous Scrap Picker in the Field of God.

222
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,948
His individual combat capability should be good.

223
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,348
Actually, I'm looking forward to it.

224
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,548
Will he take his opponent as a prey today?

225
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:19,948
To obtain his opponent's equipment.

226
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,668
They are ready.

227
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,308
Please get into the competition room for final preparation.

228
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:29,918
Please.

229
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,068
Okay. They have entered the map.

230
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,028
The third round starts!

231
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:50,068
In the very beginning, Deception choose to hide himself.

232
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:51,748
It seems like he is looking for a sneak attack.

233
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,268
They are very close.

234
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,428
The Knight will be attacked firstly if he hasn't found out yet.

235
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:02,308
Knight vs. Ninja.

236
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:03,668
It's a tough fight for Ninja.

237
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,188
Knight has the most strong defensive power.

238
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,468
Ninja needs to be very careful to exhaust Knight's HP.

239
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,148
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

240
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:12,861
There is an opportunity!

241
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,188
Zhu Yue didn't realize Deception at all.

242
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,268
Deception is going to launch an attack.

243
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:18,948
What's going on?

244
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,468
Mo Fan didn't choose to attack.

245
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,948
Was it the wrong timing?

246
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,748
It seemed like a good timing.

247
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,108
Such a good chance. What a pity!

248
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,188
The knight has turned around.

249
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,548
Deception can't launch an attack momentarily.

250
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:45,748
He's still looking for opportunities.

251
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:46,748
He is getting closer to the knight.

252
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:48,628
Scrap Picker's character is to forbear.

253
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,988
It seems like he won't attack unless he is sure.

254
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:53,868
There's a chance!

255
00:11:58,588 --> 00:11:59,788
But why did he give up again?

256
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,028
It's not like a Scrap Picker.

257
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:03,228
What is he doing?

258
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,708
Is he waiting for a better timing?

259
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,155
He is procrastinating.

260
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,141
Yellow card warning.

261
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:21,284
What?

262
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,308
If you don't attack in half a minute,

263
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:25,948
you will get a red card warning.

264
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,978
Mo Fan was penalized to be passive in game

265
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:30,188
for didn't launch attacks for a long time.

266
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:31,508
He got a yellow card warning.

267
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,708
It's so surprising.

268
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,348
I almost forgot about this rule

269
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:36,668
if the referee didn't give this penalty.

270
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,308
You asked him to do it.

271
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,654
I just asked him to delay the time a little bit.

272
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:45,118
I didn't know he didn't even know the rules of the game.

273
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,019
You know him well.

274
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,242
Okay. The game is continued.

275
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,108
As expected, he didn't seem like the same person at all.

276
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,348
But it's not a good time to attack the knight.

277
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:58,868
Is he going to fight with the knight fave to face?

278
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,188
Nice!

279
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,388
With Deception's attacks,

280
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:09,828
Zhu Yue can't fight back at all.

281
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,228
Zhu Yue is losing his HP.

282
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:13,588
It seems like Deception is going to win.

283
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,748
But he used his skills too often.

284
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,148
What's his plan in the following?

285
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,028
Why he chose to run away at this critical moment?

286
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,108
You can see that...

287
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,068
There is no ultimate skills in his skill books.

288
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:33,148
All of his skills are freezing.

289
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:34,548
Deception was caught by the Knight,

290
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:35,908
he can't use his Escape Skill yet.

291
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:36,708
If it goes on like this...

292
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:39,748
Deception is going to die before his skills get unfrozen.

293
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:41,588
He can do nothing after using the common skills.

294
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,228
It seems like he is still play like a Scrap Picker.

295
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,007
Yeah. He didn't seize the opportunity in the beginning.

296
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:47,771
And he made some mistakes.

297
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:49,868
His play wasn't very stable after the yellow card warning.

298
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,668
To against such a professional player,

299
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,948
and Knight has such a strong defensive power.

300
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:58,188
You can't expect to kill him so easy.

301
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,282
What a pity!

302
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:01,748
Mo Fan is still lack of experience.

303
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:02,948
He didn't seized the opportunity in the beginning.

304
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:05,167
But to be labile after he got a yellow card warning.

305
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:05,962
He was not calm enough.

306
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,068
Congratulations on Zhu Xian Team. They got one point.

307
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:12,108
Xing Xin hold a 2-1 lead over the Zhu Xian now.

308
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,280
- Well done! - It's fine.

309
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:21,828
It's fine. It's not your fault.

310
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,388
You just wanted to buy some time.

311
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:27,228
I will make Ye Xiu to say thank you when he is back later.

312
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,748
The decision has came out.

313
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,308
Do you want to know the result?

314
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,228
You're suspended.

315
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:34,428
I always thought we would meet in the final.

316
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:36,979
What a pity!

317
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,468
You're out early.

318
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,628
Maybe I am out.

319
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:47,828
But Xing Xin Team won't.

320
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,908
Do you know the scores of your team now?

321
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:01,668
I've known you for so long.

322
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,828
But I don't even know what you really want.

323
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,068
I could see that our friendship...

324
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,828
is so intriguing.

325
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,708
But it's good.

326
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,308
We won't meet in the final.

327
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:25,508
In case of our friendship gets worse.

328
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,388
The fame is fake.

329
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:39,188
But the feelings and experiences are true.

330
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:41,308
We've got two points.

331
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:43,148
We hold a 2-1 lead over the Zhu Xian now.

332
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:44,468
We still have a good chance to win.

333
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:50,748
We have to fight for Ye Xiu before he is back.

334
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:57,188
Tang, what do you think about the Arena Contest?

335
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:57,828
One-against-three.

336
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,228
I will do what I said.

337
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:02,308
That's right.

338
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,708
We should be overwhelming.

339
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:05,828
We should be confident.

340
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,388
We will not only take down the Arena Contest,

341
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:08,748
but also the Team Competition.

342
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:09,828
Come on!

343
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,148
We will make it!

344
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:12,068
Come on!

345
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:19,308
Fighting! Fighting!

346
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,348
Fighting!

347
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:21,428
Don't worry.

348
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,388
One-against-three.

349
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:24,268
One-against-three.

350
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:28,029
Xing Xin Team appointed Tang Rou for the first round.

351
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:31,257
- Zhu Xian Team appointed Ke Jian. - Ke Jian.

352
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:33,155
Please welcome them to come to the stage.

353
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:34,588
Ye Qiu is absent.

354
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:36,108
Here's the chance.

355
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,668
Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

356
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:40,548
One-against-three.

357
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:41,628
One-against-three.

358
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,148
One-against-three.

359
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,348
One-against-three.

360
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:45,548
One-against-three.

361
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,768
One-against-three.

362
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,786
Here comes to the Arena Contest.

363
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:50,997
Xing Xin Team appointed Tang Rou for the first round.

364
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,470
Zhu Xian Team appointed Ke Jian.

365
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,745
I heard all the fans of Xing Xin Team are yelling

366
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:56,485
One-against-three.

367
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:57,749
Okay. In the following,

368
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,180
Let's looking forward to the battle

369
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,308
between Battlemage and Assassin.

370
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,108
Ladies and gentlemen, the first round of Arena Contest.

371
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:07,748
Han Yanrou, a Battlemage vs. Shui Youhan, an Assassin.

372
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:08,708
Game starts!

373
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,668
They both good at melee attack.

374
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:12,628
Maybe they will fight hard in the beginning.

375
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,428
Tang Rou used her consistent strategy.

376
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:19,748
She launched onslaughts to her opponent.

377
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,148
It's a hard fight between Battlemage and Assassin.

378
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,668
You will be hard to fight back if you got attacked first.

379
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:58,708
Shui Youhan only can seek chances to consume her HP

380
00:18:58,788 --> 00:18:59,388
among Han Yanrou's attacks.

381
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:08,148
The rhythm of this game is too fast.

382
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,468
We will see the result very soon.

383
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:27,548
Shui Youhan failed to attack her back several times.

384
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:28,868
Han Yanrou is going to win.

385
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:30,508
Now it's the time.

386
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:32,228
Shui Youhan only got five percent of HP.

387
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:33,828
Shui Youhan is running so fast. It's too fast.

388
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:34,708
Struggled to blow.

389
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,788
Han Yanrou reacts quickly. She stepped back.

390
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:37,948
Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

391
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,148
They hit each other at the same time.

392
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,388
They perished together.

393
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,948
But Han Yanrou's HP goes to empty first.

394
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,548
Shui Youhan is the winner.

395
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,468
Bravo!

396
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,388
I am sorry, beauty.

397
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,548
You took the bait.

398
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,828
Struggled to blow.

399
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:52,548
He reversed the huge disadvantage successfully.

400
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:54,228
Tang Rou, as a newcomer,

401
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,108
her APM and skills are remarkable.

402
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,788
But she lacks of experiences.

403
00:19:57,788 --> 00:19:58,628
Her opponent took advantage of it.

404
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,348
She didn't anticipate his intention at all.

405
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,828
That led to her loss.

406
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,588
We believe she has learned a lesson from it.

407
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:05,348
Let's looking forward to the growth of this newcomer.

408
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,114
Congratulations on Zhu Xian Team

409
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,548
has took down the first round of Arena Contest.

410
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,268
Tang Rou, you have to leave now.

411
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,388
She can't fight anymore, so...

412
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:16,148
They have two players now.

413
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,388
I am sorry.

414
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:32,948
It was too fierce just now.

415
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,908
The second round is going to start.

416
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,268
Xing Xin Team appointed their manager, Chen Guo.

417
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:40,628
Zhu Xian Team appointed their captain, Lin Yi.

418
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:44,348
Boss, it's your turn.

419
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:49,988
Really?

420
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:50,868
Relax.

421
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,708
Just play steadily. Don't overexert.

422
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:54,148
I will get your back!

423
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:55,508
It's okay.

424
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,028
Fighting!

425
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,508
Play steadily. Don't overexert.

426
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:00,977
Boss, fighting!

427
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,039
Fighting!

428
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,217
- Fighting! - It will be okay.

429
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,072
Boss, fighting!

430
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,868
Fighting! Fighting!

431
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:08,028
Captain, that's their Team Manager.

432
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:09,148
She is not a professional player.

433
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:11,308
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

434
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,068
Even the Team Manager has to play it herself.

435
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,108
It seems like Xing Xin got into a big trouble today.

436
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,948
Okay. Here comes to the second round.

437
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:41,068
The Launcher of Xing Xin Team, Cloud Chaser.

438
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,428
Her opponent is the Swordsman of Zhu Xian Team.

439
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:43,628
Ten Thousand Swords.

440
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,268
They have entered into the map.

441
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:46,348
Game starts.

442
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:48,668
Speaking of Cloud Chaser,

443
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:50,748
she is the boss of Xing Xin Team, Chen Guo.

444
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,228
I didn't expect she will enter the field.

445
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,068
Chen Guo...

446
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:55,668
Play steadily.

447
00:21:57,268 --> 00:21:58,548
Maybe I should hide.

448
00:21:58,548 --> 00:21:59,668
We could see that Cloud Chaser is very cautious to

449
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:00,828
choose her dodging.

450
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,668
She has found a cover to hide.

451
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:05,268
Where is he?

452
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,948
But the position she picked is so terrible.

453
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:10,868
Ten Thousand Swords has found her

454
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:11,948
and getting to her from the back.

455
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:12,988
She didn't realize.

456
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,948
Ten Thousand Swords didn't attack her immediately.

457
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:20,268
He chose to remind her first.

458
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,588
Cloud Chaser turned around. But her reaction was too slow.

459
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,068
Combo killed.

460
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:25,988
Cloud Chaser can't stop it at all. She is losing her HP quickly.

461
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:27,588
Silver Blade. Got it!

462
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,588
Cloud Chaser is dead. Ten Thousand Swords is the winner.

463
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:33,188
Ruo Feng,

464
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,268
Chen Guo is the Team Manager of Xing Xin Team.

465
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,748
Her techniques are so amateurish.

466
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:41,868
Why did they choose this kind of deploy?

467
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:43,068
But not to appoint their professional Launcher, Wu Chen?

468
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,308
Maybe...

469
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:45,948
She is the boss of Xing Xin Team.

470
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,308
And she wanted to play it for fun.

471
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:49,268
What are you talking about?

472
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:50,628
Play it for fun?

473
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:54,468
Our boss is not an irresponsible person.

474
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:55,988
What's going on?

475
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:57,668
Master is not here yet.

476
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,428
If there any possibles that he can't make it,

477
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,548
so they let...

478
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,268
What are you talking about?

479
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,148
Sorry.

480
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:08,628
I can't help at all.

481
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,468
It's fine. It was a little bit faster than I thought.

482
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:12,348
It's fine.

483
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:14,348
Boss, it's okay. You've tried your best.

484
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,228
You played well enough.

485
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:18,028
It's my show time.

486
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:19,828
- Fighting. - Fighting.

487
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,068
In the following,

488
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,868
Zhu Xian Team is going to be the defender.

489
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,388
Xing Xin Team appointed their veteran, Wei Chen.

490
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:25,908
Okay.

491
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,348
The third player of Xing Xin Team,

492
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:28,228
Wei Chen is on the stage now.

493
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:29,708
Can he turn the tables?

494
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,748
Let's see.

495
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,228
Well done!

496
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,828
In fact, your performance surprised me.

497
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:37,228
I thought we can defeat you easily.

498
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:39,508
But it seems like I have to work on it now.

499
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,028
I hope that your hands won't get hurt in this game.

500
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,588
Okay. They have entered into the map.

501
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:52,108
Windward Formation.

502
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:53,028
He thrown a magic missile at the very start.

503
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,228
He is using H&R to contain Ten Thousand Swords

504
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:55,188
by using the advantage of terrain and hand length.

505
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:56,348
Very smart.

506
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:57,748
Of course, he the master of Containment.

507
00:23:57,748 --> 00:23:58,468
See?

508
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:02,948
They are getting closer.

509
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:03,988
Ten Thousand Swords used the Sword Draw.

510
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:04,748
Nice!

511
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:05,628
Windward Formation lost some HP.

512
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:06,628
Not bad!

513
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:08,468
Another Sword Draw.

514
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:09,388
Missed it!

515
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,388
Are you crazy?

516
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:13,828
It didn't work for me.

517
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,308
Five times.

518
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:23,788
He used the same...

519
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,828
No. He used the same skill six times.

520
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:28,348
But Wei Chen is a veteran.

521
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,548
He's very adept at adjusting the rhythm.

522
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,548
Ten Thousand Swords is in danger.

523
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,330
Six-light Prison! Got hit!

524
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,422
Ten Thousand Swords is being controlled.

525
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,868
Windward Formation released the Chaotic Rain.

526
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,268
Ten Thousand Swords can't avoid it.

527
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:58,028
He is losing his HP so quick.

528
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,308
He is dead.

529
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,388
It was too stressful.

530
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:04,268
Wei Chen is a veteran.

531
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:05,748
Such a powerful attack...

532
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:07,828
It seems like Lao Wei really can take down the Arena Contest.

533
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:09,188
Senior Wei is so great.

534
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,268
Okay.

535
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:11,948
Windward Formation has won this round.

536
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:13,908
Although Ten Thousand Swords' strategy is so unpredictable.

537
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:14,828
But finally,

538
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:16,228
he still lost this round.

539
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:18,708
Although Windward Formation has won...

540
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:20,548
What's wrong with him?

541
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:21,948
Only repeat those skills again and again.

542
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:23,868
Zhu Xian Team still has a good chance.

543
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:24,668
Hey! You!

544
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,628
Just go back to your mama if you are afraid to lose.

545
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,788
I hope you can say that again later.

546
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,068
In the following,

547
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:34,468
Xing Xin Team is going to be the defender.

548
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:38,068
Zhu Xian Team appointed Wang Luosi this round.

549
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,708
Please welcome Wang Luosi to the stage for preparation.

550
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,363
Okay!

551
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:44,788
Fighting!

552
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,428
Just play as what I did.

553
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,228
Ladies and gentlemen,

554
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,108
the Arena Contest between Xing Xin Team and Zhu Xian Team.

555
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:53,120
Finally comes the final decider.

556
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,572
Zhu Xian Team appointed their Sharpshooter, Hua Nongying.

557
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:56,868
His opponent is the Warlock of Xing Xin Team,

558
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:58,108
Windward Formation.

559
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,550
Game starts! We can see that...

560
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,468
These two profession began to fight at the very start.

561
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:07,828
What's wrong with him?

562
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,068
Why will he play like a Swordsman?

563
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:13,508
It's so strange.

564
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:16,948
The Sharpshooter avoided Pursuit.

565
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,348
Just to repeat the same move.

566
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,548
Not only their Sharpshooter played like this,

567
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:22,188
but also their Swordsman did.

568
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,708
Do they have any eccentricities? They are so sick.

569
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:29,188
The same skill. Hit!

570
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,388
Windward Formation got hit.

571
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,468
No. They did it on purpose.

572
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:34,708
They made me to repeat such complicated techniques.

573
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:37,188
In order to stimulate my injured wrist.

574
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:38,308
So they can exhaust my strength.

575
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,548
That's right. Windward Formation can't follow up

576
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,108
the rhythm of attacks released by Hua Nongying.

577
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:44,828
His dodge was always one step behind.

578
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:47,388
We don't know if he can adjust his state in time.

579
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,068
We can see that...

580
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:01,908
Hua Nongying is still using his captain's strange strategy.

581
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,068
The HP on both sides is going to be zero.

582
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,788
It's a critical moment.

583
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:07,828
Who will die first?

584
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:11,788
Simultaneous attack!

585
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:12,588
Hua Nongying dodged it.

586
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:14,228
Windward Formation got hit.

587
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,348
He is dead.

588
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:17,708
Hua Nongying is the winner of this round.

589
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,788
Zhu Xian Team has won the Arena Contest.

590
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,028
What a pity!

591
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:25,348
Windward Formation almost defeated two opponents continuously.

592
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,068
Congratulations on Zhu Xian Team on winning the Arena Contest.

593
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:30,868
Zhu Xian Team hold a 4-2 lead over the Xing Xin Team now.

594
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,508
Xing Xin Team has to take down the Team Competition

595
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,628
if they want to win this game.

596
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,268
The first half ended.

597
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:08,788
Xing Xin Team is two points behind.

598
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:12,788
Let's enjoy the Team Competition after a short break.

599
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:24,423
= Chen Guo =

600
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,068
Captain's phone is here.

601
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:34,052
Where are they?

602
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:47,781
Captain is absent. What else can we do?

603
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:49,110
There are many other ways.

604
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:52,932
For example, Tang Rou can take captain's place.

605
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,956
Yifan can be a alternate.

606
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:56,746
We can put Bao Zi in...

607
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:01,824
There are many other ways.

608
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:03,754
But we haven't tried them before.

609
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,048
It means we have no other ways.

610
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:22,895
Lao Wei, let's drink some water.

611
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:26,141
It's okay.

612
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:27,743
We still have chance.

613
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:06,268
What's wrong?

614
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,028
You can't even handle a zip-top can.

615
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,828
You said you are going to finish one-against-three in public.

616
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:16,908
But you were a little bit cowardly today.

617
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:19,028
It's fine.

618
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:20,708
You still have chance in the Team Competition.

619
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,708
Don't you want to challenge three of us?

620
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:26,108
By the way,

621
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,588
don't make the same mistake again.

622
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:31,028
Don't worry.

623
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,108
I won't make the same mistake twice.

624
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:43,268
Captain is going to lay out the new tactics.

625
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:43,908
Let's go.

626
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,908
She's broken down.

627
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,148
Xing Xin still has no chance to win the Team Competition.

628
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:55,548
I've decided that we won't appoint Wu Chen.

629
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,428
Bao Zi will take Wu Chen's place.

630
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,188
Mo Fan, you will be the alternate.

631
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,548
We will lose.

632
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:03,508
What do you mean?

633
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,308
The Individual Event.

634
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:05,948
The Arena Contest.

635
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:06,708
We all listened to you.

636
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:07,468
And what's the result?

637
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,388
We only got two points.

638
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:10,468
I suggest that...

639
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,708
We should follow captain Ye's strategy

640
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,068
if we want to win.

641
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,108
We should put Wu Chen in the first formation.

642
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:19,028
Bao Zi, you are in charge of...

643
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:20,388
Wu Chen is an invincible opponent to Zhu Xian Team.

644
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:22,908
Captain has his own reason to let him enter the field.

645
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,308
Wu Chen is a Launcher.

646
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:28,188
He has advantages in the Team Competition.

647
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,388
Lao Ye is still not back yet.

648
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:35,828
Yifan, you are in the first formation.

649
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,798
= List =

650
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:45,468
I don't know what's your reason.

651
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:47,668
And I don't know why Wu Chen is not here at this moment.

652
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:48,628
We are a team.

653
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:49,188
I just want to tell you...

654
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:51,228
Please don't put your feelings before the benefit of our team

655
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:52,428
if you want to win.

656
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:53,388
My personal feelings?

657
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:54,668
I just want to win so much that...

658
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,628
I can't take our team's fate as a stake.

659
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:00,148
I have my own reason.

660
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:01,908
Please trust me.

661
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:03,388
What should we believe in you?

662
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,028
Stop it!

663
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,388
Rookie!

664
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:06,588
What are you talking about?

665
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,628
You thought everything I did was wrong, right?

666
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,268
Stop it!

667
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:12,348
Go back to your seats.

668
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:29,095
It was not Lao Wei's fault.

669
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,268
It was not your fault neither.

670
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:35,539
We should blame on ourselves.

671
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,308
We forgot our tactical training for drinking.

672
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:41,588
According to our usual practice,

673
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:45,188
let's vote for it.

674
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,310
= Agree and disagree =

675
00:32:58,468 --> 00:33:00,388
Three vs. three now. Tie vote.

676
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:03,188
Yifan, how about you?

677
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:08,148
I abstain.

678
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:23,548
As the team manager, I will make the decision.

679
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:28,148
Listen to Lao Wei.

680
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,077
= Qiao Yifan =

681
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:34,212
= Alternate, Mo Fan =

682
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:37,273
= Su Mucheng =

683
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:39,068
Hello.

684
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:49,788
You only got two points in the first half.

685
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:54,401
That best newcomer has collapsed.

686
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:55,668
What's more?

687
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:58,988
Although Wei Chen is a veteran.

688
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:03,508
But his strength has reached its limit.

689
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:06,628
The most horrible thing is...

690
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:08,988
Your boss has to enter the competition herself.

691
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:11,308
What else can you do?

692
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:24,948
The game is not over.
