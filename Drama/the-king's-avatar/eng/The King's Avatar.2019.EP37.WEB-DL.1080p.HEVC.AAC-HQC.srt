Turn the Arena Contest from three players to five players.

The score will be based on how many players you kill.

You will get two points for killing one player.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,040
It means that you will lose two points for one player get killed.

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
The score will be enlarged if we are heedless.

39

If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.

I found a very famous coach in this field.

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
And helped you to develop a whole training program for you.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
In the next three years...

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
You can see that...

67
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Three years?

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,280
Right.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Your contract with Jia Shi is about to expire.

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,640
Here. A brand new contract.

71

It's just a process.

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,520
Mr. Tao, I won't sign an extension with Jia Shi.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,600
I will leave here as long as the contract expires.

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360

Can you play well in such a state?

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm a professional eSports player.

85

As long as I am a member of Jia Shi,

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
I will try my best to win.

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,520
You said you will do the one-against-three in public

before the match with Zhu Xian.

161
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
You would resign if you can't.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,520
So are you here to cheer today?

163
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
I am here to play.

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,480
Are you going to disavow your public statement?

165
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,440
You broke your promise. How can you just let it go?

166

I am sorry.

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
I didn't fulfill my promise.

168
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
I let Xing Xin's fans down.

169
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,280
Today,

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,360
I apologize for my recklessness and impulsiveness.

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
But I won't quit.

172
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
I will stick with it even I have to break my promise.

173
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,960
There is obviously a huge gap between you and Jia Shi.

174
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
And the rules have changed in final.

175
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,415
- You have no chance to win so far. - Can you win?

You don't know until you try.

Let's go.

178
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,400
They are having huge advantages.

179
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,240
So they will keep it steadily.

180
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,800
I think they will use conventional tactics.

181
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,760
Tang, you take the lead in the Arena Contest.

182
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,320
If everything goes well, your opponent is Sun Xiang.

183
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
Just keep to play it intrepidly and to infuriate him duly.

184
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,880
I see.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
You are the next. Play it rhythmically to consume his patience.

186
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,093
Yifan, you are the third one.

187
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,480
Beat him by using outflanking tactics.

188
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,800
Wei Chen and I...

189
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,680
will do the rest.

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,160
No problem.

191
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,680
And...

192
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Where is our boss?

193
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,360
I've handed the list accurately.

194
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,120
Tonight is a night of glory for all of us.

195
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Fighting!

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,720
Everyone, listen to me.

197
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,440
We can do nothing on the stage. But we can cheer up for them.

198
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,920
Let us practice our slogan again.

199
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,520
Okay.

200
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,080
Fans are everywhere!

201
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Fans are everywhere!

202
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,160
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

203
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,200
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
Fans are everywhere!

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Fans are everywhere!

206
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,360
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

207
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,360
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

208
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,480
We must pay attention to the rhythm and our vigour.

209
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
And our motions also.

210
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,480
Just take a break.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Here. Here.

212
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
Just take this. All right.

213
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Here. Just take it.

214
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Here. Here. Here.

215
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,440
This is nice.

216
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
Come here. Take it.

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
This color really suits you.

218
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Here. I help you to wear it.

219
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,320
Just wear it.

220
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,236
Has everybody got it? Here. Here.

221
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:11,324
= Block B =

222
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,720
Han... Han Wenqing.

223
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Zhang Xinjie. Wang Jiexi.

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
It's really them.

225
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
So many masters are here.

226
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
Bro, what a blockbuster!

227
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,600
Hello, Zhou Zekai.

228
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,280
Where are you? What's wrong?

229
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,400
You can't put on airs to me

230
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
for you are handsome and popular.

231
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
I tell you what. The game is going to begin.

232
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,920
We are all waiting for you.

233
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
Just tell me if you are coming or not.

234
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,880
Hello?

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
The sponsor invited him to do the commentary.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Will Zhou Zekai come here too?

237
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,400
How can you ignore me?

238
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
What's wrong with your sponsor?

239
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
To invite him to do the commentary?

240
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
The cost performance is too low.

241
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Although he is the most handsome in the league.

242
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,320
So what?

243
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,440
To do the commentary, your eloquence need to be excellent.

244
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,520
He is so tedious but charging too much.

245
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
It's better to put a humanoid card board here.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,320
It's the same.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,520
Huang Shaotian, you are careful to offend his fans.

248
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
It's okay. His fans won't know.

249
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,680
These microphones are already on.

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,200
Right.

251
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,880
Welcome to the Challenge Final of Glory.
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

252
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,400
Tonight, we are honor to be here

= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

254
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,440
The victory will goes to our ever-victorious general

255
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
or will it goes to our new star?

256
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,200
Let's see.

257
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
We will use new rules tonight.

258
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,761
There will be the Arena Contest and the Team Competition.

259
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,800
They will dispatch six players each to play the Arena Contest.

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,200
The score will base on how many opponents they kill.

261
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,960
They will get two points for killing one opponent.

262
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,400
And all the bonus rules will be remained.

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,840
Jia Shi Team got twenty four points in the group stage.

264
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,960
And Xing Xin Team got twenty one points.

265
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,840
So Jia Shi Team has a three points advantage in the final.

266
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,480
Tonight, our commentators are...

267
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,880
The captain of Lan Yu Team, Yu Wenzhou.

268
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,880
Hello.

269
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,000
And...

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,920
Hello.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,160
I am the best Swordsman of both talent and beauty in history.

272
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,840
I am Huang Shaotian.

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
Okay. Let's cut the crap.

274
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,400
Let's get down to business.

275
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
Let's see.

276
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Who are going to play in the first round?

277
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,037
Alright.
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

278
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Xing Xin Team is going to appointment Tang Rou first.
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

279
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Her role is Han Yanrou.

280
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
A Battlemage.

281
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
Fighting! Tang!

282
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,160
Even she plays the Glory less than one year,

283
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,600
but her style is so tough.

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,880
And she comes to the fore quickly with exceptional talent.

285
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,240
Let's see who will represent Jia Shi to play the first round.

286
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,040
It's him.

287
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,000
Jia Shi Team is going to appointment Xiao Shiqin first.

288
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,320
His role is Sheng Lingmie. A Mechanic.

289
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Jia Shi gave up their frequently-used tactics.

290
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,200
Captain.

291
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,480
Although Sun Xiang is so reckless,

292
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,720
he always want to take the first formation.

293
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,200
But he didn't this time.

294
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,760
Has he become smarter?

295
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Captain. Captain. Captain.

296
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,920
Captain. Captain. Captain.

297
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,640
They must thought that I will be the first one to play.

298
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,880
Mistake!

299
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,000
Be humble.

300
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
I am telling the truth.

301
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440
Fighting!

302
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,240
Fighting!

303
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,200
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

305
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,880
Fighting!

306
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:44,257
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

307
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,520
Jia Shi Team appoints Xiao Shiqin to take the lead.

308
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,200
They must made some adjustments according to the new rules.

309
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,440
We don't know if it's in Xing Xin's plan.

310
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,360
What should we do now?

311
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,720
Our previous deployments were all messed up.

312
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,920
Tang Rou and Mo Fan will be restrained by Xiao Shiqin.

313
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Tang said she will insist even she has to break her promise.

314
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,883
Besides, it's just Xiao Shiqin now.

315
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,783
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

316
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,360
The Challenge Final of Glory.

317
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,840
The first round of Arena Contest is going to begin.

318
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,040
Tang Rou, Han Yanrou.

319
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
Vs. Xiao Shiqin, Sheng Lingmie.

320
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,560
Captain Yu, what do you think about it?

321
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,160
Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

322
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,400
I think Tang Rou is likely to win.

323
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Her APM will make Xiao Shiqin get rattled.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,480
It's time to let newbie to show themselves.

325
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,680
Meets with Xiao Shiqin, the master of tactics,

326
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
can Tang Rou cover the shortage by her excellent APM?

327
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,440
Let's wait and see.

328
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,440
Okay. The game began.

329
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,160
We can saw that Tang Rou stick to her own style.

330
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
She rushed at the central of map at first.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,920
The fight between Mechanic and Battlemage.

332
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
Xiao Shiqin will take the advantage of far shot.

333
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
He will choose to consume her in distant.

334
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,080
Sheng Lingmie found himself get discovered.

335
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,360
He chose to  pull away immediately.

336
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,600
Han Yanrou, got hit!

337
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Han Yanrou adjusted herself quickly and fought back.

338
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
Tang Rou is so tough.

339
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,560
How could she fight back in such a situation?

340
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,000
Mechanical tracking will slow people down.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,480
So the first choice is supposed to defend.

342
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,520
Or to dodge.

343
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,680
But Tang Rou chose to storm.

344
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
She'd rather to take the sacrifice of ultimate,

345
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,160
but still want to strike to approach him.

346
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,280
Xiao Shiqin was caught off guard.

347
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,240
Ladies and gentlemen, did you see that?

348
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,240
These masters of tactics are so cunning usually.

349
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,040
We need some unconventional players to teach them a lesson.

350
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,720
It's really exciting, right?

351
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,440
Sheng Lingmie throw a bounding mine.

352
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,840
Han Yanrou was unaware. She is in danger.

353
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,920
But she avoided it as well.

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,480
How could she realized?

355
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
Was it a coincidence? Or was it her intuition?

356
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,600
None.

357
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
She can catch the sound precisely.

358
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,360
As a pianist,

359
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,200
her hearing is much sharper than ordinary person.

360
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,000
Xiao Shiqin made a mistake by using Sound Trap.

361
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
Bravo!

362
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,280
Even Xiao Shiqin couldn't do anything about her.

363
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
Don't jump to conclusions.

364
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
He is one of the best four tacticians in Glory.

365
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Xiao Shiqin.

366
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,600
Sheng Lingmie chose to use the Air Drops.

367
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
He wanted to astrict her blocking.

368
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,120
But Tang Rou is calm.

369
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,120
Han Yanrou lost track of her opponent.

370
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Shaotian, let's guess.

371
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,600
As a master of tactics and a sharpie,

372
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,800
what will he do next?

373
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,480
He will use his strange weapons,

374
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
to make this fight goes into the environment that best suits him.

375
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,320
Whatever he do,

376
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
I hope Tang Rou can break the predicament and win.

377
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
It seems like Han Yanrou can't judge his intentions now.

378
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,680
She moved prudently.

379
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,800
Sheng Lingmie used his trick again.

380
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Threw out two bounding mines by using Sound Trap.

381
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,560
Han Yanrou avoided them faultlessly.

382
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,800
It didn't work at all.

383
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,920
Why he chose to used this trick again?

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,440
He didn't want to consume her HP.

385
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,040
But to guide Tang Rou into his trap.

386
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,280
Game over.

387
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,680
The damage of the skill has been calculated.

388
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,360
It's about time.

389
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,920
Got hit! Han Yanrou was dead.

390
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,480
Sheng Lingmie led her into his own rhythm gradually.

391
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,600
And won the first round by 70% HP have left.

392
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,040
How could it be?

393
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
It's impossible.

394
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,360
Tang played it well all the time.

395
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,280
She has eluded so many attacks.

396
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
How could she lose?

397
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,840
Tang is quick in action and plays valiantly.

398
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,360
She is a talented offensive player.

399
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,320
Xiao Shiqin used her fortes to defeat her tactfully.

400
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,440
What do you mean?

401
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,360
Tang will get tired when she plays in high frequency.

402
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
Indeed.

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,800
She will become a fearful rival as Ye Qiu.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
As a tactician,

405
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
we always look for opponents' loopholes to win the game.

406
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,920
But Tang Rou chose to look for opportunities to fight back

407
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,040
in the holes again and again.

408
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,280
She still chose to storm even in the most dangerous of times.

409
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,760
There's nothing impossible in Glory.

410
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,200
Although Xing Xin has lost the first round,

411
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
but Tang Rou, as a newbie,

412
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
has put lots of pressure on Jia Shi by her performance.

413
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,800
Although she lost the game,

414
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,520
but we knew that...

415
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,360
There's a rising Battlemage star in Glory.

416
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,680
She is Tang Rou.

417
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,200
Fighting!

418
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,280
It's okay.

419
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Fighting! Fighting!

420
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,680
You did well!

421
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,200
Fighting!

422
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,280
How do you feel?

423
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,280
How about it?

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,600
I am so depressed.

425
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,280
Xiao Shiqin is the most horrible opponent I've met.

426
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,200
It's not a big deal.

427
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,240
Yeah.

428
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,840
It's not a big deal.

429
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,360
Xiao Shiqin is so skillful.

430
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,080
No one has the confidence to defeat him

431
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
in the whole league.

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200
There are always winners and losers.

433
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,040
I know.

434
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,280
But I couldn't do anything about him.

435
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,400
I didn't have any initiative even though I tried my best.

436
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
If this problem can be solved easily,

437
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,160
then I can teach you before you go to the stage.

438
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,440
What you're dealing with right now,

439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
is the highest level player in Glory.

440
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,920
He wouldn't be where he is today

441
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
if he has some huge loopholes that can be used by others.

442
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,640
Keep trying!

443
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,840
Enrich yourself comprehensively!

444
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,000
There will be no shortcuts from now on.

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,840
Captain is right!

446
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,920
The Glory is so hard to play.

447
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,440
That's why it's interesting, right?

448
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,320
It's really interesting.

449
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,160
The next player from Xing Xin is Mo Fan.
= Glory Pro League =

450
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,280
He is a former Scrap Picker whose action is

451
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,960
fast, accurate and relentless and good at biding his time.

452
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,320
Can he break through the encirclement set by Xiao Shiqin?

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
And fight his way out.

454
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
Let's wait and see.

455
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
The second round of Arena Contest.

456
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,200
Xing Xin chose to dispatch their Ninja, Deception.

457
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,280
To challenge Jia Shi's Mechanic, Sheng Lingmie.

458
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,840
Xiao Shiqin, such an old fox...

459
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
As a master of tactics, although he won last round,

460
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,080
but his HP was consumed by Tang Rou.

461
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,520
Deception, fighting!

462
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
You still have the chance to win!

463
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay. Game Started!

464
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,240
Deception is moving rapidly at the beginning.

465
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
He is finding the right place to hide himself.

466
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,520
This is a very typical opening for Ninja.

467
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,880
They will take the high ground first.

468
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,840
And to use the advantage of vision to find opportunities.

469
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
It seems like Mo Fan has the chance to break through.

470
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,080
Sheng Lingmie released the Electronic Eyes

471
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,160
to seek for Deception's position.

472
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
Xiao Shiqin knows Deception's strategy.

473
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
He is in patience.

474
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,400
He won't give Deception a chance to sneak attack.

475
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,040
Please don't hide anymore.

476
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,880
It's boring. Just fight!

477
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
Just fight face to face if you are real men.

478
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,680
You are the most famous chance taker in league.

479
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,200
You often use this tactic.

480
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,400
It means that your opponent can't find you for ages.

481
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,000
I just wait for chances to make no mistakes.

482
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,560
But they are so cheeky now.

483
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,760
We are different. You know?

484
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,000
You are so facetious.

485
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,040
Okay. Back to the game.

486
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,840
The Electronic Eyes is still seeking for Deception's position.

487
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,520
Deception used the shuriken.

488
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,520
He destroyed the Electronic Eyes.

489
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,600
Okay. We can see that Sheng Lingmie is taking actions.

490
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
It seems like he is heading for Deception's rear.

491
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,760
Sheng Lingmie has detected Deception's position.

492
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
Xiao Shiqin chose to rush at him directly.

493
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
But not to detour him from sides.

494
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,360
Maybe he wants to find out Deception as soon as possible.

495
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,800
Mo Fan knew that shuriken would expose his own position.

496
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
So when he used this skill,

497
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,960
he chose to move at the same time.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Deception attacked.

499
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,040
He used the ultimate, Moon-Slaying Sakura.

500
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,320
It was too close.

501
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,720
Sheng Lingmie couldn't avoid it but to take it.

502
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,720
We could see that after Sheng Lingmie got hit.

503
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
He launched a counterattack.

504
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
Mechanical Tracking. Deception got hit again.

505
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,440
Sheng Lingmie is still attacking.

506
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,198
Astrict his dodging by using bounding mine.

507
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:10,838
Body Replacement Technique.

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
Deception is adjusting his own position.

509
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,282
Disappearing Body Technique

510
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:16,320
after detonated bombs by using shuriken.

511
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
He avoided the Air Drops.

512
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
Mechanical Punch! Got hit!

513
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Deception's HP is going to be zero.

514
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,640
In last moment,

515
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,960
all the skills of Deception are freezing.

516
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
They can figure out opponents' skills will be frozen.

517
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,114
This is the biggest difference

518
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:10,079
between professional players and ordinary players.

519
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,600
Mo Fan needs time to practice.

520
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
What should we do?

521
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,440
Nice!

522
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,440
Nice!

523
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
Sheng Lingmie from Jia Shi killed Deception.

524
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,040
He did the one-against-two.

525
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,600
Sheng Lingmie's HP is 51% after two rounds.

526
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,000
He got four points.

527
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,240
Jia Shi Team got four points by killing two rivals.

528
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,920
Xing Xin didn't get any points.

529
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,880
The score on the field is four to zero now.

530
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,520
Xiao Shiqin hold the upper hand

531
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,600
in this fight between Mechanic and Ninja.

532
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,200
Xing Xin didn't get any points in the first two rounds.

533
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,160
And two of its players got killed.

534
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,080
The situation is not optimistic.

535
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,240
Sometimes, it's better to keep your skills.

536
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,760
I see.

537
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
If I have another match...

538
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,680
Sure we will.

539
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,840
There are nine points gap between Xing Xin and Jia Shi.

540
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,280
Xing Xin is going to dispatch Qiao Yifan.

541
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,640
If he can't win in the third round,

542
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,200
I think it will be hard for Xing Xin to comeback.

543
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:13,040
Yifan, fighting! Yifan, fighting!

544
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
Yifan, fighting!

545
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,960
Yifan, fighting!

546
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,240
Sorry. Excuse me.

547
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,600
You are from Wei Cao...

548
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:32,644
= The Ninth Challenge of Glory =

549
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,800
Qiao Yifan, fighting!

550
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,280
Fighting!

551
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,600
The third round of Arena Contest.

552
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,200
Yi Cunhui vs. Sheng Lingmie.

553
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
Game started.

554
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
Yi Cunhui chose tactical positioning.

555
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,080
But Sheng Lingmie already knew it.

556
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,400
He got intercepted halfway.

557
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,160
Sheng Lingmie hold the upper hand.

558
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,800
It's not good for Yi Cunhui.

559
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,360
Yifan, fighting!

560
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,239
Leaping onto the wall,  Qiao launches a counterattack...

561
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,748
while Xiao is alternating his skill strikes.

562
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:21,672
But Arrays of Ice and Plague may not enough to turn the tide.

563
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,672
He should use more Arrays of Ghosts...

564
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:26,314
and cause high damage to enemy by the Feast of Ghosts.

565
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:41,500
What happened?

566
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:43,745
Why did Xiao rush in the opposite direction?

567
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,165
Tell us why, Captain Yu.

568
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,760
Director, please replay these frames.

569
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,092
Yeah, it's here.

570
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,845
Xiao was shooting with his rifle at the same direction,

571
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:56,099
then hit the air with his Mechanical Punch.

572
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:58,098
But nobody was here, Captain Yu.

573
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,836
Let's see from Xiao's view.

574
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:02,771
What...

575
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:07,374
Shaotian, have you seen it?

576
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:11,405
It must be an afterimage that looks very real.

577
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:14,548
It's not surprising that Xiao mistook it for Qiao.

578
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,778
But I think it must be a coincidence,

579
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:19,008
because a Ghost has no skill creating an afterimage.

580
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:22,317
So Xiao was just unlucky and fell into the trap for no reason.

581
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:24,239
I don't think so.

582
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:28,810
The afterimage just appeared in a right place at a right time.

583
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,011
It was Visual Deception.

584
00:33:30,694 --> 00:33:32,289
Visual Deception?

585
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,526
What the hell is it?

586
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,892
These frames just frightened me.
