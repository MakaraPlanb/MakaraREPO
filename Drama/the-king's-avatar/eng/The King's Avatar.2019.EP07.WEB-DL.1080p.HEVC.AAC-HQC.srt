00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,300
=Episode 7

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Do you still need me to continue to ask

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
This is it, Captain

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
It's him. He said at the beginning.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,200
Ask me to brush a Copy

7
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
I said I wouldn't go with him

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Then he threatened me

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,640
And then he said

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,360
to take an unfinished thing

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,840
To bring umbrella back to life

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Also said to add a little excitement

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
to the Glory

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,720
Wait a minute

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
He really said so

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
He actually said like this

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
I want to add a little excitement

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
to the Glory

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
That's what he said

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,960
It's quite serious

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
I swear

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
Sorry, Ye Qiu

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
There is still time to brush the copy after the match.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
It seems that the training given to you by the team is not enough.

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,960
Captain, didn't you just say

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
we wouldn't talk about this matter

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
You will keep your promise, will you

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes, I will

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,240
Unless ..

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Unless what

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,080
You brush out the Smart Umbrellas.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,480
This is stealing

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
Captain, is this behavior

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,120
a little shameless

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
You know, we Lan Yu have always been

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
aboveboard.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Will this

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,200
How can this be said to be shameless?

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,200
We just borrowed it to study it.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
I will return it when we finish the study.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,760
By the way, you may not be able to beat him

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Captain, you are responsible for what you say.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,240
I can't beat him

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
I'll tell you what

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
I can beat him in minutes.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Believe it or not

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll be waiting for you for three hours.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
Is it really only three hours

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
When can you finish

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,200
the training match with me

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,240
Mr. Ye Qiu

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Quick, quick, quick

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
Up, up, up

54
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,160
All right, that's it.

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Why are you so slow

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,080
Not many moves. Not many moves. Come on

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Opportunity

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,120
OK

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
Not bad, this boy

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
How many have you won in a row?

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
You see, this Yu Wenzhou just can't do it.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Hand speed is too slow

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,320
How can I compare with you?

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
Be quiet.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,680
I'd like to announce one thing to you all.

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,440
Our training camp will officially test all of you tomorrow.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,600
with last elimination system

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Is everyone clear

69
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,040
Don't go. Don't go

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Yu Wenzhou, you are the only one I have ever seen

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
who have not won a formal competition.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,360
If you lose again this time, you will be eliminated.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,880
If you want to take this as a career

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
you have to work hard

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Understand

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,480
All right, students

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,240
Line up and draw lots to choose your fighting teacher.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Quickly

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,080
I'll go back first.

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,760
OK

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't be shy

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't be shy.

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,680
Don't be shy

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Just draw lots

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
Quick, quick, quick, quick

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Have a look

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,600
Who is it? Open it quickly

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,520
Quickly

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
Come on, who is it?

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,120
Who?

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,400
Don't hide it

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Ye Qiu

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Ye Qiu

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
You won the grand prize

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,640
You never won a game

96
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
There is no suspense.

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Come on

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Come on, you

100
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,920
It's okay.

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,440
The jeers of the students

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Let me inferiority to the extreme

103
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,680
I started an endless night

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
to practice like crazy

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
Warlock Hit battlemage

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
It was a bad match

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
The only turning point

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
Is whether I can release a big curse arrow

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
But it takes ten seconds to sing

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
To get the maximum energy

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
It is impossible not to be interrupted

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
The only possibility

113
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Is to completely control him for ten seconds

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Only five seconds

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
The singing will still be interrupted.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
We must find a way to fight for another five seconds.

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
This is a disaster

118
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
No suspense

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm sure I can't beat it.

120
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
There is no suspense

121
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
Here we go.

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,080
Here we go

123
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
The dragon teeth sprint leaf teacher came up so fiercely

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
No mercy

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
Sprint as soon as you get up.

126
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
Look up into the sky

127
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
Mr. Ye Qiu, Mr. Ye Qiu

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Five

129
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,280
Four

130
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,880
Three

131
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,600
Two

132
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
One

133
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,920
Two minutes and eighteen seconds

134
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,240
It became the driving force for me to move forward.

135
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,960
Ye Qiu also became

136
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,640
the opponent I most want to meet on the arena

137
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,280
It's done

138
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Captain, wait a minute

139
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,280
What is this

140
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,160
Smart Umbrella

141
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,280
Captain

142
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I followed your Captain's instructions strictly.

143
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,040
A Smart Umbrella were brought in successfully and quickly.

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,880
Mission completed

145
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,840
Lan Yu steal things so obviously

146
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,160
It's a robbery

147
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Long time no see

148
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
Long time no see

149
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,600
You two

150
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,040
good friends who are very strong

151
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
It was not easy to get together

152
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,840
You two catch on

153
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll go first. Bye-bye

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
You are very interested in my Smart Umbrella.

155
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
I'd like to have a try

156
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,360
the power of Smart Umbrella

157
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,920
The two minutes and eighteen seconds is what I owe you.

158
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
This is what I owe myself

159
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Two minutes and eighteen seconds

160
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,560
Hide yourself to prevent interruption

161
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,480
Very skilled

162
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,160
Overpraise

163
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,160
Indeed as expected it is a great weapon

164
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,960
It seems that your singing speed has also improved

165
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
But that's it.

166
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,240
There's another move

167
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
Did you do your best this time

168
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,920
I do my best in every match.

169
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,440
Smart Umbrella with scattered people

170
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,600
Maybe it can really change the pattern of the alliance

171
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
But

172
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
Maybe you can rely on Smart Umbrella

173
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
and a variety of skills to stir the wind and cloud

174
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
How are you going to pass the challenge in the realm of God

175
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think too much as you do.

176
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
It takes too much brain cells.

177
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,560
With that time

178
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,040
I think you should think about it first

179
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,200
How can Huang Shaotian be prevented from running around

180
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
Ye Qiu

181
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
Hope to see you next time

182
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,200
You can add some excitement to Glory

183
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Each of us is growing up

184
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
through pains

185
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,040
In a glorious world

186
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,640
We learn to reconcile with ourselves

187
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
Okay, come on, let's smile.

188
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
Three, two, one

189
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
OK

190
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Come and hold your chest with both hands.

191
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,600
Good

192
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,360
Three, two, one

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
OK

194
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,840
Let's take a look at 45 degrees.

195
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
here

196
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,160
OK

197
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,800
Three, two, one

198
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
Still no good

199
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,640
This eye of yours is a little too obvious.

200
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,120
It's still a big one and a small one.

201
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,000
All right, fine. I'll adjust it again

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,680
Both eyes are bigger.

203
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Good, good

204
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Let me do it

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Hold tightly

206
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,920
Look at 45 degrees

207
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,600
This time the picture is ok.

208
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,360
Eyes are the same.

209
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,120
Captain

210
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
Go ahead. What is it

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,280
Recently, there was a guy named Jun Moxiao in the 10th District.

212
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,840
The associations are not peaceful.

213
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,280
I doubt it.

214
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,000
He is a professional player of other teams.

215
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,040
It's a trip for us.

216
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
This is the end of today's work.

217
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Today's task is very arduous.

218
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you ready?

219
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
Ready

220
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
Forty-seven

221
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,560
Forty-eight

222
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
How are you doing over there

223
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Fifty-three

224
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
This is too unfair

225
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,840
I can only fight one by one

226
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
You attack faster than me.

227
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
This time we're going to fight Toya

228
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,640
It is not too difficult to play

229
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
But the reason why it has

230
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
still not been knocked out

231
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,960
It is because of the steps before the fight against Tonya

232
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
are closely linked

233
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,400
There is a time limit besides triviality

234
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,160
We can't make mistakes, Tang

235
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
Mind your own business

236
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,120
This Tang and Ye Qiu have been playing Glory for a long time

237
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
The cooperation is quite tacit

238
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,200
But Tang

239
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
played with us before

240
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,920
Now she only play with men

241
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
in the internet cafe.

242
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Continue

243
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,200
Watch your step

244
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Front, two

245
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,720
Tang

246
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Accelerate

247
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,720
Tang

248
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,960
Guoguo, wait a minute

249
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Tang, Sky Hit

250
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Good

251
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,040
Good

252
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Tang

253
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,440
We need to work harder.

254
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
A cake shop opened nearby.

255
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,680
I heard it was delicious

256
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Let's go together

257
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,880
We will go when I have time.

258
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
Watch your back

259
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,120
What's the matter?

260
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,800
There are several questions I can't do

261
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
You must help me.

262
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Why don't you teach me?

263
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,520
Of course you can. write it down first

264
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,920
I'll solve them later.

265
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Continue

266
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Play every day

267
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,960
Did I recruit you to play Glory?

268
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,680
Go to work quickly

269
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,280
From now on, you will practice with Tang.

270
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,360
Improving her skills is your job.

271
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,560
To the left

272
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Smelly boy playing trick with me

273
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Delete

274
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,680
Don't

275
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
What are you doing

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
You record it

277
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,440
Guoguo

278
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
Tang

279
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Let's eat and play something together.

280
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,440
Do something

281
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,200
It's my treat. Let's go.

282
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
All right, stop it

283
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,600
We are now brushing copies

284
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
Can we go later?

285
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,200
Back off

286
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Ultimate skill, pay attention to blood volume

287
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Add blood

288
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Strength and Difficulty of Team Training

289
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,680
is not suitable for you

290
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,560
Go back to training camp first.

291
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
and improve the skill level

292
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Then come back again

293
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
My name is Qiao Yifan.

294
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,120
I’m an Assassin in the Wei Cao team

295
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,680
I am a professional player

296
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,800
with examination result always at the bottom.

297
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,400
I've never been on the arena before.

298
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,520
Professional player

299
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Come on, come on.

300
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,800
Two, three

301
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,800
Yingjie

302
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,080
Come and take pictures together.

303
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,520
Quick, quick, quick

304
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,760
Yingjie, Yifan went to the training school.

305
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
It is estimated that it will be very difficult to come back.

306
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
Leave this position to us.

307
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
Step down, all of you

308
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,480
Let me take a handsome photo

309
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,240
with the future captain's successor

310
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,800
Good

311
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,600
Come

312
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Watch me knock you out with a brick.

313
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
It was clearly mine

314
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
It belongs to who wins

315
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
Everyone has a ten-minute break.

316
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
The next boss, Toya

317
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
will be a tough battle.

318
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Didn't you just say it wasn't difficult

319
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,520
This is designed according to the standard of ten people.

320
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,320
The leader of the wild map

321
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,440
The difficulty is not high.

322
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,440
But there are only three of us

323
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,080
Not good

324
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
This Jun Moxiao is doing

325
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,880
Toya's predecessors

326
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
This is the last step

327
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
There will be another first kill

328
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
Is it?

329
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
All the players

330
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,520
gather at the training room in ten minutes.

331
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,880
Emergency training

332
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,560
The performance of this training

333
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,360
Will be included in this month's assessment results

334
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Those absent scored zero in this month's assessment.

335
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
What kind of training is so exaggerated

336
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
Absence is zero

337
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,640
So to put it this way

338
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,320
If I did well

339
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,600
Is it possible to be in the starting line-up?

340
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Let's go, let's train

341
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,520
Go, go, go, go

342
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,320
Go, Yingjie

343
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,240
Hello

344
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
Hello

345
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,840
Yifan, wait

346
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,920
Yingjie

347
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
New opportunities

348
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
What are the new opportunities

349
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
Let's go

350
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,560
Where to?

351
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Fast

352
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,240
Sorry

353
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,800
No

354
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,520
This is an activity led by the captain.

355
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,280
You do well

356
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,760
Maybe you won't have to go to training camp.

357
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,840
Are you ready

358
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,360
Okay

359
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,800
Go

360
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,160
Captain

361
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Captain

362
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,560
Sit down

363
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,800
Go sit down

364
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Yingjie, you go first

365
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
I'll find you

366
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,360
Starting in five minutes

367
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
I am waiting to see your results.

368
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,560
Encircle and suppress Jun Moxiao

369
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Thank you

370
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,200
I must be in five minutes

371
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
Find a computer

372
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,120
In order to catch up with the examination

373
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,920
Stop

374
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
What's the matter, Boss

375
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,520
Ambush

376
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,000
Ying Jie directed the operation.

377
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Received

378
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
Spread out and fight one by one

379
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Liufei stuck position

380
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,040
Don't lose the target

381
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,520
OK

382
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
Ye Bai, be careful, not to underestimate the enemy

383
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
Xiao Yun hard, cold and soft

384
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,240
Pay attention to the preservation of physical strength.

385
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,840
Understand

386
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,880
Eat me a brick

387
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,880
Didn't you say to use the brick

388
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,760
I won't lose even if we end up together.

389
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,360
Steamed Bun, you are good.

390
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,440
Come back to help Tang

391
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,800
She's stuck

392
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,320
OK

393
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,040
Don't have to

394
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,200
Compared with my hand speed

395
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,520
I don't believe you can match me.

396
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,160
Send the head

397
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
I told you to wait for the Steamed Bun

398
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,120
You don't smile can insist on so long

399
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,960
Not to be outdone

400
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,280
I think a positive victory is almost impossible

401
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,240
Toya

402
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
They're going to fight Toya

403
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,720
You must pass through this cave.

404
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,440
The terrain here is complex and suitable for ambush.

405
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Shadow copy

406
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,440
Yingjie, watch the back

407
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Lose

408
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,720
It is no surprise.

409
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,160
But I didn't think of it

410
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,880
You lost so fast

411
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,440
Xiao Yun

412
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,440
Aggression is your greatest enemy.

413
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,280
No one ever started the match first.

414
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Who will win

415
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,360
Yes

416
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Liu Fei

417
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,440
It's good to care about your teammates.

418
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
But whenever a teammate is in danger

419
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,960
You lose your correct judgment of the whole situation.

420
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,200
This is the main problem you need to overcome at present.

421
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
All right, captain

422
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Ye Bai

423
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,160
Captain, I'll practice my low-level accounts well.

424
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,760
Find that again tonight.

425
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
The man who told Jun not to laugh avenged himself.

426
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,480
Do you think today's failure

427
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,480
It's because you used low-level accounts.

428
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,240
I

429
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,800
Is that what you all think

430
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,880
A regular member of a champion team.

431
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
But want to copy inside

432
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
Encircling an ordinary player

433
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,360
This is not worth all your efforts at all.

434
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,680
Right?

435
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
Yingjie

436
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,960
What do you think of this Jun Moxiao's strength

437
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,440
Very impressive

438
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,600
How powerful is it

439
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
Experienced

440
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,880
Attacks and skills are used properly.

441
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
All judgments are accurate.

442
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,600
He is better than all of us.

443
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,080
Yes, better than all of you.

444
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,440
Strong enough to wipe out your entire army.

445
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,240
So don't despise any enemy

446
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,840
Today is a good lesson

447
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
After returning home

448
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,920
Take a good look at the video of the match.

449
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,560
I hope you have something to gain.

450
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,280
who is this Jun Moxiao exactly

451
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,520
You met today

452
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,600
is the greatest Boss in the history of Glory

453
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,880
Ye Qiu

454
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
Ye Qiu, Ye Qiu

455
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,360
Look at this

456
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,200
It's kind of interesting.

457
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,520
Hang on, Yifan.

458
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
Let him stop

459
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
I'll find him

460
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
You have a lot of ideas, but unfortunately

461
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
You didn't find your problem

462
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,760
What's the problem?

463
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
Master is different.

464
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,600
The heat is killing me.

465
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,080
The operation is too handsome.

466
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,760
What are you doing

467
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
Today's training video

468
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,680
This is when Yingjie lose

469
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,280
Yeah

470
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
Yes, this is it

471
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,600
It was a terrible loss, wasn't it?

472
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
Do you know what this is called

473
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
This is called the Shadow Copy

474
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Ye Bai

475
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,120
Come back and watch it again.

476
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,800
Ye Bai

477
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,280
Where is the captain?

478
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,480
The Captain?

479
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,120
The captain should left now

480
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,800
In fact, it's nothing

481
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
The captain is afraid that you will lose too badly.

482
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,120
After all, the other party is Ye Qiu.

483
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,560
This is it

484
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,800
Jun Moxiao is Ye Qiu

485
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,080
The Master deserves his reputation

486
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,720
Yeah

487
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,800
When do you think I can be so good

488
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
Practice well

489
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
There is no water, Yifan

490
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,520
If it's okay, can you pour me a glass of water.

491
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,280
Thank you

492
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,520
Pour one more cup for me

493
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,120
Look at you, look at you, Liu Fei

494
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,040
Look at you, look at you

495
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,280
You see, you lost first

496
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,480
Don't look at me. I didn't play well today.

497
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
This is not how I used to be

498
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,720
In fact, I think

499
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,040
It would be nice for Yifan to go to glory training camp.

500
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,600
Stay in our team

501
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,720
It is even worse to be a server forever.

502
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,200
Keep watching. Keep watching

503
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,920
This one lost even worse.

504
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
Work hard

505
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
Liu Fei, Ye Bai water

506
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Thank you. Thank you

507
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,280
You see this operation is handsome

508
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
This is quite handsome.

509
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
Isn't that you

510
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,080
This is very powerful.

511
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
But then again

512
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,120
It’s useless

513
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560
Can’t beat Wei Cao

514
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,280
Exactly

515
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,920
By the way, Yingjie

516
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,640
I heard

517
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,640
the restaurant we always go to

518
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,080
is renovated recently.

519
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
It may take a long time

520
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,520
before we can eat its takeout

521
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,600
So you have to help me eat more.

522
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,440
Why this face

523
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm just going to train for a few days.

524
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,680
I will come back

525
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,240
Come back early.

526
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,520
Of course

527
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,200
When I come back

528
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,920
I must defeat the Jun Moxiao

529
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,440
I heard them say that the captain intends to train you.

530
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
to be a successor

531
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,200
Yingjie, come on

532
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
You too

533
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm leaving

534
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,920
In fact, I think

535
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,040
it would be nice for Yifan to go to glory training camp.

536
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,960
Stay in our team

537
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,080
It is even worse to be a server forever.

538
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,520
Okay, thank you
