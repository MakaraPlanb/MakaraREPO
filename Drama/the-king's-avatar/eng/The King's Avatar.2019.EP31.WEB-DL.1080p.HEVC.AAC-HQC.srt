Don't cotton up with me.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,340
You just said...

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,020
We fans of Jia Shi all went nuts.

34
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,660
The captain we supported the most before

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,300
has established his own team now.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,720
He rivals against his old team everywhere.

37
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,660
Do you understand how the fans feeling?

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,060
No one does.

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,180
You don't care about Jia Shi's fans, either?

40
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,960
I don't compete for the fans.

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,250
Not for the fans? Then for whom?

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,380
To be honest,

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,200
what we are striving for is a dream that is very personal.

44
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,570
Nobody does it for making others happy.

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,250
I hope you'll not misunderstand it.

46
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,260
We appreciate everything you've done for us.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,220
And we're touched.

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,700
But...

49
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,810
I need to tell you a ruthless fact.

50
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,700
It's not true if we say we'd compete for you.

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,100
At least I wouldn't.

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,300
Not at all.

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,660
But if it weren't for our support, there would be no eSports circle.

54
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,820
And there would be no professional players.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,770
You're right.

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,700
So I'm appreciated.

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,820
And I'm touched by your support.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,050
I say it sincerely.

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,060
But it's my competition.

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,300
I don't do it for you.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,420
It's totally different.

62
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,860
Brutal truth!

63
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,320
Didn't know Master Ye Qiu is so direct.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,140
In only 10 seconds, many have become his fans from the opposite.

He's a real professional player.

69
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,440
Telling the truth is the best gift for fans.

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,990
That's the true sportsmanship.

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,220
You...

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,540
Your arrogance won't last long

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,210
before the competition against Jia Shi starts.

74
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,920
Captain.

75
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,900
Captain.

76
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,340
You were awesome just now.

77
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,280
Finger heart.

78
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,460
Hi.

79
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:20,820
Thank you.

80
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,420
You're welcome.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,000
Captain.

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't think you should say all that.

83
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,660
Though it was true.

84
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,760
Yes. He's just a fan.

85
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,090
Not worthy.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,800
You're too naive.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,820
I said it to all of you.

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,160
When you become real professional players, you'll have many fans.

89
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,860
With their support and their encouragement,

90
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,440
knowing what they like and what they don't like,

91
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,820
will you be manipulated by those?

92
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,770
It's not something trivial.

93
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,300
It matters.

94
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,260
Why do you compete?

95
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
You should think thoroughly.

96
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,260
It may decide how long you would travel on the journey

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,780
and how well you would play.

98
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,220
It's OK to compete for making the fans happy.

99
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,140
But it's difficult to win the championship by doing it.

100
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,400
What fans like may not be the right things.

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,900
How you should play it depends on each of you.

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,220
Because you are professional players.

Please... look at this.

107

News about our Xing Xin team on line is bombarding everyone.

What news?

112
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,850
Just tell me.

113
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,020
Well...

114
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
It's difficult to say.

115
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,180
Do they want Xing Xin to withdraw or ask him to apologize?

116
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,930
Neither.

117
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,860
They say...

118
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,490
They want to see the truest Master Ye Qiu.

119
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,410
I would say...

120
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,860
The word "silly" could summarize Ye Qiu's entire life.

121
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,540
He could have been enjoying his welfare in Jia Shi.

122
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,900
But he's chosen to have a hard life in Xing Xin.

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,560
What are you doing?

124
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,490
Editing a video.

125
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,210
He's not only a silly person, but also has a one-track mind.

126
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,220
If someone like him wants to return to the league...

127
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,330
Master. Let me explain.

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,020
We planned everything in advance.

129
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,300
As you know, self-deprecating is the best way to whitewash.

130
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,420
So if we started with talking about your weaknesses,

131
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,970
the audience will resonate with you.

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,380
Right?

133
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,900
If someone like him wants to return to the league,

134
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,560
he'd better go to a mature team to be the core.

135
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,540
Yes.

136
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,980
It's much better than to babysit all the rookies here.

137
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,980
He's not a qualified captain.

138
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,180
He's much worse in doing things and conducting himself than me.

139
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,060
It was not self-deprecating.

140
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,930
They were just complaining about me.

141
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,740
All true.

142
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,880
Questioning or flattering, accepting or ostracizing,

143
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,980
they are not going to be our burdens.

144
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,130
To be specialized, dedicated and professional.

145
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,590

we'll have two competitions we pay high attention to.

151

They both won 6 times successively in the Challenge.

152
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,180
Jia Shi and Xing Xin will rival against others in order.

153

Jia Shi starts first.

154
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,500
And players in Xing Xin are entering the arena.

155

- Don't make the same mistake. - Boss Chen.

156

I'm the captain of Everlasting.

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,720
What's up?

159
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,510
I'm here to offer you a chance of cooperation.

160
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,660
Cooperation?

161
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,190
What cooperation?

162
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,810
As you see, Xing Xin and Everlasting are in the same situation.

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,220
We're facing strong teams like Jia Shi.

164
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,060
We've got powerful enemies.

165
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,900
And we've got the same goal.

166
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,700
It is to win the champion of the Challenge.

167
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,620
How about we teaming up and fighting together?

168
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,490
Am I right?

169
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,260
Teaming up?

170
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,420
What do you mean?

171
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,950
I've been watching you for quite some time.

172
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,220
Some of your players are in good conditions.

173
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,860
But a team like Xing Xin can't match with Everlasting

174
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,370
because we've got better equipment and environment.

175
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,360
If the two teams can merge into on team,

176
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,340
it will be a win-win opportunity with might redoubled.

177
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,560
It is an honor for Xing Xin to merge with us.

178
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,700
After merging, we'll be the new Everlasting together.

179
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,640
And you don't have to compete in the Challenge today.

180
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,880
No need.

181
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,810
Thank you for considering us.

182
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,580
But Xing Xin has never admitted defeat without fighting.

183
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:45,840
Thank you.

184
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,020
Think twice.

185
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,710
What really matters? Saving face or the future of the team?

186
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,370
You're the captain of Everlasting. Don't worry about our future.

187
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,700
To tell you the truth,

188
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,440
I don't want to negotiate with Xing Xin.

189
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm not interested in such a grass-root team like you at all.

190
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,330
I don't want to see a professional player

191
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,330
like Ye Qiu stops at the Challenge.

192
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,960
Ye Qiu wants to return to the league.

193
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,770
But Xing Xin is not the best option for him from any respect.

194
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,420
If you lost, have you thought how much Ye Qiu would lose?

195
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,540
ESports players don't have many years before retirement.

196
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,010
He should not waste his time in such a crappy team.

197
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,120
Everlasting is a better option for him.

198
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,920
He's not going to Everlasting.

199
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,720
Can you decide for him?

200
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,320
She can.

201
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,420
If you want to join Xing Xin, we might consider it.

202
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,010
Otherwise, let's compete in the Challenge.

203
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,530
Let's go.

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,810
Go for it!

205
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,780
Welcome, everyone. It's the competition field of the Challenge.

206
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,940
Our heroes for tonight will come right away.

207
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,840
Welcome Xing Xin and Everlasting!

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,560
= Go for it! =

209
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560

= Xing Xin; Tang Rou; Wei Chen; Mo Fan =

211
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,700
Xing Xin vs. Everlasting.

212
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,630
The competition begins now!

213
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,540
How awesome we played in the competition!

214
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,860
Luring the enemy in deep and defeating them all!

215
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,840
Amazing!

216
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,500
Have we won seven times successively?

217
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,500
Listen to me.

218
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,820
I was inside. The captain said we still needed to improve.

219
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,970
I think more training will come.

220
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,140
Seriously?

221
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,540
It could be true.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh, no. I'll take some rest now.

223
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,000
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =
= the 9th Challenge of Glory =

224
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,060
Speaking of successive wins,

225
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,520
only we and Xing Xin haven't lost any competition.

226
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,600
So?

227
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,620
You want to go watch Xing Xin?

228
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,860
The one who wants to know you best... is always your enemy.

229
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,700
= Everlasting =
Congrats, Xing Xin! They won again.

230
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,840
They ended the first half with 5-0.
= Everlasting =

231
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,820
They ended the first half with 5-0.

232
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,770
The Team Competition will start soon.

233
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
= Xing Xin =

234
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
= Everlasting =

235
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,260
OK. The players are ready.

236
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,020
The Team Competition is on the way.

237
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,180
Xing Xin vs. Everlasting. The competition starts now!

238
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,980
Sun Xiang.

239
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,290
You came to watch Xing Xin alone?

240
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,780
Who is watching them?

241
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,700
I'm watching...

242
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm watching Everlasting.

243
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,300
You study Everlasting.

244
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,930
We study Xing Xin.

245
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,820
We both study our rivals, right?

246
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,810
Facing the point-losing situation,

247
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,170
Ruo Feng, what would you suggest Everlasting and Wu Chen?

248
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,100
- Sure. - If losing this game...

249
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,080
The one who wants to know you best is always your enemy.

250
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,180
Wu Chen needs to step up at the crucial moment to lead the team.

251
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,060
- He must be stressed out. - Exactly.

252
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,180
In the first half, Xing Xin was sailing with the wind.

253
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,280
- What are you doing? - Watch the game aboveboard.

254
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,020
Your sight would be blocked by wearing a hood.

255
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,980
Let's expect their good performances in the Team Competition.

256
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,770
Shut up!

257
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:53,970
Go ahead.

258
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,800
= Ninja: Heavenly Rage; Warlock: Leopold; Launcher: Dawn Rifle; =

259
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,620
With such a cast, neither is launching their Cleric first.

260

= Knight: Three-lives Knot; Summoner: Ice Wing; Cleric: Stay Here =
Seems it'll be an output battle.

261
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,166
Seems it'll be an output battle.

262
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:01,860

= Freelancer: Jun Moxiao; Ranger: Bao Zi, the Invader; Cleric: Cold Hands =

267
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,340
Generally speaking, rarely would teams put Clerics on bench.

But what Xing Xin and Everlasting are doing surprises everyone here.

270
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,070
But what Xing Xin and Everlasting are doing surprises everyone here.

271
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,490
= Map options: the Place of Exile; Poisoned Wolf Land; Boneyard =
The map is the Poisoned Wolf Land﻿.

272
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,380
The map is the Poisoned Wolf Land﻿.

273
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,260
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =
It's a very different map.

274

= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =

275
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,500
It will be a horrifying battle.
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =

It will be a horrifying battle.

277
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,420
Instructor Ruo Feng, brief us about why the map is different.

278
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,970
Let me keep you all guessing.

279
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,400
We'll see why it's different when the game starts.

280
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,500
Count down on the Team Competition.

281
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,180
Five, four, three, two, one. Start!

282
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,060
OK. It starts.

283
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,420
-  Everlasting's captain... - The Launcher is ready.

284
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,160
Roger that.

285
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,190
Captain. Where are you?

286
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,900
In the map of the Poisoned Wolf Land,

287
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,580
everyone starts in a different place.

288
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,940
Look at your position.

289
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,540
All players start at various places.

290
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,580
They are scattered in different positions.

291
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,900
On the map, there is poisoned fog everywhere.

292
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,690
Oh, crap!

293
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,620
What's this?

294
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,500
Yes. The Poisoned Wolf Land is an escaping map.

295
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,220
Poisoned fog will slowly spread to the center from the periphery.

296
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,060
If you touched the poisoned fog, you'd continually lose blood.

297
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,060
Poisoned fog spreads to the center from the periphery.

298
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,420
The only safe battle field is the center of the map.

299
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,540
Everyone meets together in the center as soon as possible.

300
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,230
Gotcha.

301
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:39,980
Bao Zi.

302
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,410
Watch out.

303
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,080
Roger that.

304
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,260
A real man can't fall down at the same place two times.

305
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,460
Spotted Leopold, Everlasting's Warlock.

306
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,360
Spotted Everlasting's Summoner.

307
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,510
I found an exit!

308
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,890
What about Tang?

309
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,380
Spotted Everlasting's Knight Three-lives Knot.

310
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,680
We're surrounded!

311
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,100
Everlasting's Ninja is here.

312
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,660
Han Yanrou is fighting against two now.

313
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,540
Spotted the fifth of Everlasting.

314
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,860
Everlasting wants to kill Tang with two players by avoiding me.

315
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,160
Tang, hold on!

316
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,140
I'll back you up!

317
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,460
Roger that.

318
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,340
Now Everlasting and Xing Xin are engaging in a contact battle.

319
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,260
Windward Formation vs. Leopold. Yi Cunhui vs. Ice Wing.

320
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,980
Han Yanrou vs. Three-lives Knot and Heavenly Rage.

321
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,160
Bao Zi, the Invader hasn't met with Dawn Rifle.

322
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,980
Seems Jun Moxiao has been entangled with something.

323
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,010
Why are there six Everlasting players?

324
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,340
It's five.

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,140
The captain encounters a Summoning Monster.

326
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,400
Tang is in danger.

327
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,220
Tang can handle this one-against-two.

328
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,990
On other common maps, maybe yes.

329
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,000
But today we've got the Poisoned Wolf Land.

330
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,940
With one second delay, the damage it'll cause is fatal.

331
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,940
Due to the specialty of this map,

332
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,140
players can't meet with their teammates in a short time.

333
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,570
They can only get out of the plight with their personal abilities.

334
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,380
On the other side, Yi Cunhui is against Summoner Ice Wing.

335
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,980
The key will be how he gets rid of the Summoning Monster

336
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,060
and makes him switch into the Summoner.

337
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,230
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin Scores: 0-0 =

338
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,840
Good job! Ghost Step!

339
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,190
A successful switch into the Summoner!

340
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,380
We see Yi Cunhui is moving.

341
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,420
He's realized he needs to meet with his teammates soon.

342
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,540
Phantom of Dragon Tooth! Such a bilocation!

343
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,660
How fast she should be!

344
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,500
Tang Rou has got an amazing APM.

345
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,140
With great personal strength, she defeated the Ninja successfully.

346
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,750
Tang Rou! Tang Rou!

347
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,820
Hard to imagine the new player could grow so quickly!

348
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,050
Tang Rou, Tang Rou!

349
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,420
= Everlasting =
Tang Rou, Tang Rou!

350
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,910
Bao Zi, the Invader, was going closer to his teammates.

351
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,220
He got hit by a long-distance launching.

352
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,990
Who did it?

353
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,890
Who raided me?

354
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,180
It was Dawn Rifle who ambushed on a highland.

355
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,180
He used far shot to constantly attack Bao Zi, the Invader.

356
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,540
Hit him again!

357
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,900
Bao Zi, the Invader's blood volume has been dropping.

358
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,620
But seems he hasn't located where his enemy is.

359
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,100
Hard for him to dodge Dawn Rifle's attack.

360
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,620
With the dropping speed of his blood volume,

361
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
in dozens of seconds, he'll lose all his blood.

362
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,450
The visibility of the map is very poor.

363
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,190
But Dawn Rifle could accurately Blind Snipe Bao Zi, the Invader.

364
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,620
How surprising!

365
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,700
Seems Dawn Rifle is in a very good condition today.

366
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,690
Wu Chen is Blind Sniping in fog. His hit rate is ridiculously high!

367
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,400
You smelt a rat, too?

368
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,200
If it were me, I couldn't do it.

369
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,260
Bao Zi, the Invader, position(144, 571).

370
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,580
Good! Another Blind Snipe!

371
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,390
Dawn Rifle killed Bao Zi, the Invader successfully!

372
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,710
Everlasting eliminated on rival first.

373
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,060
Xing Xin's substitute is in.

374
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,130
= Everlasting =

375
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,440
Be careful.

376
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,380
The competition isn't over. We can't lose it.

377
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes, captain!

378
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,660
Next target: Han Yanrou.

379
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,640
Roger that.

380
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,180
Han Yanrou, position(134, 231).

381
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm afraid Xing Xin could be in danger.

382
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,300
He's about to shoot. Look who he's aiming at.

383
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,500
It's Han Yanrou.

384
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,780
Jun Moxiao found where Dawn Rifle is.

385
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,700
He intervened in time and helped Han Yanrou out.

386
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,820
Jun Moxiao stepped up at the crucial moment.

387
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,250
When did your shooting become so accurate?

388
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
How did you find me?

389
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,580
There is only one highland on this map.

390
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,180
Launchers will fight for it.

391
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,900
If you can't figure it out,

392
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,820
I'd say you are detached from the Alliance for too long.

393
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,020
Han Yanrou is being attacked by two.

394
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,020
But with strong personal strength, she is not in disadvantage.

395
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,380
But how long could she hold on in such a bloody battle?

396
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,340
If no one backed her up, she might lose much blood.

397
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,270
The Warlock of Everlasting is here.

398
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,660
A very difficult situation of one-against-three!

399
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,260
Her teammates, come soon!

400
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,020
Or Han Yanrou could be killed!

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
= Xing Xin Tang Rou =

402
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,150
Yi Cunhui arrives at the front and backs up Han Yanrou in time.

403
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,580
You OK?

404
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,010
Yes. I can hold on.

405
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,060
We are in disadvantage. Meet with the captain now.

406
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,600
Han Yanrou and Yi Cunhui made a breakthrough

407
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,100
by seizing the moment their enemies were positioning.

408
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,560
Everlasting players are right after them,

409
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,520
not letting go of a power play.

410
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,850
- Gate of Death! Good job! - Perfect timing.

411
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,370
The four of Everlasting are under control.

412
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,920
Xing Xin players are tacitly cooperating.

413
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,980
Han Yanrou and Yi Cunhui lured Everlasting players to the position.

414
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,760
Windward Formation resets the ultimate to control the enemies.

415
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,500
Windward Formation shows up in time!

416
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,770
Xing Xin players have assembled.

417
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,590
If everything goes well,

418
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,600
Gate of Death will kill the four of Everlasting one time.

419
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:39,970
Yes. Everlasting is in great danger.

420
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,520
= Dawn Rifle; Heavenly Rage; Leopold; Three-lives Knot; Ice Wing=
Yes. Everlasting is in great danger.

421
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,940
Yes. Everlasting is in great danger.

422
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,540
The four at the front are under control.

423
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,700
Its captain Dawn Rifle is held down by Jun Moxiao.

424
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,580
If there is no miracle, Everlasting will be defeated.

425

= Xing Xin =

426
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,980
It's over.

- What's wrong? - What happened?

431
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,490
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =
Be calm, please. We're checking what caused it.

432
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,040
What happened?

433
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,310
What? What just happened?

434
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,920
= Xing Xin Team =
Referee! What happened? We almost won!

435
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,250
Referee! What happened? We almost won!

436
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,410
What the heck?

437
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,010
= Everlasting =
What the heck?

438
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,060
= Everlasting =

439
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,640
Dear audience, please be calm.
= Everlasting =

440
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,860
Dear audience, please be calm.

441
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,660
After checking, we've found something wrong with the network.

442
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,690
= Xing Xin; Mo Fan =
Our staff are try to fix it as soon as possible.

443
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,740
So, when the competition starts again,

444
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,300
we'll have 10 seconds backward.

445
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,260
If they have 10 seconds backward, Wei's ultimate will be a waste.

446
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,660
Why will they make it 10 seconds backward?

447
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,970
We were absolutely winning!

448
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,180
It's the rule of the league.

449
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,930
If an irresistible force caused the competition to pause,

450
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,990
When it starts again, it will have 10 seconds backward.

451
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,660
When it has 10 seconds backward, everyone retreats immediately.

452
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,740
Pay attention to where Windward Formation ambushes.

453
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,500
Xing Xin has lost one player.

454
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,000
As long as we maintain our strength, we'll win at last.

455
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,460
Got it?

456
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,940
Captain.

457
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,700
Why did we lose connection at such a time?

458
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,540
Maybe some network problem.

459
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,540
But...

460
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,310
How coincidental it was!

461
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,860
I don't believe it's just a coincidence.

462
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,860
It must be the Everlasting bastards!

463
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,290
Whether or not they were cheating, we only have one option.

464
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,300
We must win.

465
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:49,620
Hello, audience! Now we've got the connection back.

= the 9th Challenge of Glory =
Hello, audience! Now we've got the connection back.

Hello, audience! Now we've got the connection back.

468
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,840
All players, please go back to your seats.

469
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,940
Our competition is about to start.

470
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,940
OK. Ladies and Gentlemen, the connection is back.

471
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,900
We are now having 10 seconds back.

= Start =

473
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Let's continue. As expected, Dawn Rifle retreats immediately.

474
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,980
Gate of Death didn't hit them.

475
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,020
Seems Everlasting is changing their strategy.

476
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,260
They're retreating. What they want is to stall.

477
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,540
And to win the competition by a power play.

478
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,410
= Xing Xin =

479
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,750
The array of ice!

480
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,000
Xing Xin chooses to go after Everlasting.

481
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,820
They want to control and drag the enemies into the poisoned fog.

482
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,910
They are locked in a tangled fight.

483
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,810
But we've seen how tacit Xing Xin players are.

484
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,860
Facing a three-against-four fight,

485
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,940
it isn't disadvantage with their tacit cooperation.

486
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,530
Watch out!

487
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,210
= Everlasting vs. Xing Xin =

488
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,700
Both sides are in the poisoned fog.

489
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,500
Will Everlasting win by a power play?

490
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,380
Or will Xing Xin win by their tacit teamwork?

491
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,500
The competition is over.

492
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,670
Everlasting wanted to play dirty.

493
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,000
But they picked a wrong rival.

494
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,420
= Everlasting =

495
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,030

Xing Xin! Xing Xin! Xing Xin!

497
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,740
It's Xing Xin! All three players break through the poisoned fog.

498
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,100
Incredible! Only such a good cooperation

499
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,970
= Wei Chen; Xing Xin =
could ace enemies in the poisoned fog without losing anyone.

500
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,420
Xing Xin made it!

501
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,420
Now Everlasting's substitute is in.

502
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,530
But only Dawn Rifle is left at the front.

503

= Stay Here; Leopold; Three-lives Knot; Ice Wing =

504
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,730
What happened?

505

Wu Chen.

506
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,170
If you could not defeat Xing Xin this time,

507
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,390
the investors would withdraw all their capital.

508
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,380
We can look for other investors.

509
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,400
Captain.

510
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,260
Do we have a chance to go back to the league this year?

511
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,570
We lost by one point the first year.

512
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,880
We'll have to start over for it.

513
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,140
The competition is way too brutal for each of us.

514
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,580
We were the runner-up the next year.

515
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,340
Always being a runner-up...

516
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,920
...forces us to watch others stand on the Champion podium.

517
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,500
Three successive years...

518
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,310
We can't waste any time with our age...

519
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,300
If we lost the competition...

520
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,030
...we should part our ways.

521
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,100
We will win this time.

522
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,930
Everlasting cannot be dissolved.

523
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,280
The competition will be over. But Dawn Rifle hasn't given up.

524
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,150
Ten seconds left.

525
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,180
Five seconds.

526
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,770
Three seconds.

527
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,980
One second.

528
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,220
Congratulations! Xing Xin won the competition by 10-1.

529
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,060
The reversal in the end showed us Xing Xin's great cooperation.

530
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,540
Everlasting's captain, Dawn Rifle, held on in the last few seconds.

531
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,600
It showed us the charm of eSports.

532
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,620
= Glory =

533
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,610
It's Everlasting's first championship in the Challenge.

534
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,850
Yeah!

535
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,900
We will win for a second time and a third time...

536
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,130
Until we get the championship trophy and return to the league.

537
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,150
If Everlasting survives, our morale keeps high,

538
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,320
we will create a miracle!

539
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:15,830
For us.

540
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,100
For Everlasting.

541
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,150
For Glory.

542
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,420
Go for it!

543
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,740
When the Challenge is over,

544
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,420
we'll bring our trophy and go to the highest point of the city.

545
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,180
Let's view the place where we've fought together.

546
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,250
Wait.

547
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,970
We've never seen the city together.

548
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,480
Why bother?

549
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,230
To make an announcement to the whole city

550
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,730
that Everlasting will be dissolved?

551
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,700
As the boss of Everlasting,

552
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,820
I'm sorry to announce the team

553
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,930
will be dissolved from today.

554
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,770
- Do you have any plan for the future? - What?

555
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,250
They are being dissolved?

556
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,540
No wonder they played so dirty.

557
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,790
Fight to win or die.

558
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,320
How ruthless they are!

559
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,480
Ruthless to their rivals and themselves.

560
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,450
They were competing just now, and they are dissolved now.

561
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,900
They fought so hard to stand out from hundreds of teams.

562
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,860
And made their way to the Challenge.

563
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,420
It's half way now.

564
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,180
They are dissolved suddenly.

565
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,100
How much time and energy they dedicated!

566
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,220
ESports will never look at how much effort you've put in.

567
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,330
It only looks at how powerful you are.

568
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,130
Captain Ye.

569
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,450
Sorry.

570
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,240
I cheated.

571
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,470
The disconnection.

572
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,930
Outside calls.

573
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,960
All my fault.

574
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,980
You don't need to apologize to me.

575
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,820
If you have time to apologize and ask for forgiveness...

576
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,630
I'd rather have a talk with you.

577
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,230
= Equipment List =
The Warlock's Cloth Armor can increase the moving speed.

578
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,110
= Equipment List =

579
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,790
It's suitable for your Containment strategy.
= Equipment List =

580
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:48,810
= Equipment List =

581
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,380
And the Cleric's Defender will buff the Health point.

582
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,050
And the shinobigatana...

583
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,660
It isn't very special.

584
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,320
But we made it by ourselves.

585
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
If it's OK...

586
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,320
I hope you will not disassemble it.

587
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,460
Now the silver equipment is yours.

588
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,600
To upgrade Xing Xin's strength with Everlasting's equipment.

589
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,930
I am happy.

590
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,100
What about you?

591
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,690
The day before yesterday, I sold our desks and chairs.

592
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,030
Yesterday I liquidated all the money in our bank accounts.

593
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,690
Today I've sold you all our weapons we fought with.

594
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,710
What's next?

595
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,790
I'll figure out a way to stay in Glory.

596
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,480
How?

597
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,340
With your current status, transferring to other guilds isn't easy.

598
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,630
Right.

599
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,340
My physical strength is not as competitive as younger players.

600
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,710
And I'm not as experienced as other veterans.

601
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,090
I do know that I'm in a dilemma.

602
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,970
But I don't want to recede.
