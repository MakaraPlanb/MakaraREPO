Are you really going to give up like this?

Giving up does not mean admitting defeat.

I'm the one who's been with Ye Qiu in his entire Glory career.

40
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,440
Since the replacement failed, why did you do it?

41
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,330
Exactly. Why?

42
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,960
Ye Qiu could do it.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,020
Why replaced him with Sun Xiang?

Why?

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,460
The answer is:

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,060
he decided to retire and replace him with Sun Xiang.

I'll throw away everything from the past.

And then walk with the master to the peak.

77
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,980
Now we'll call ourselves "Jun Moxiao".

78
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,700
Then what is your plan to walk on the path to the peak?

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,280
Go back to the hotel now.

80
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,152
I'll get to know the master all over again.

81

89

She asked me to help her for a while.

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,060
Why did you buy the balloons and tease me?

121
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,620
I told you.

125
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,460
You want it?

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,560
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

Guoguo, what are you doing?

131
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,210
The master has been in his room for a long time.

132
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,800
What is he doing?

133
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
If you wanna find out, go knock on his door.

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,230
It's not proper.

135
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,570
The boss visiting her employee.

136
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,710
Nothing improper.

137
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,940
Go.

138
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,380
Sounds plausible.

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,660
I'm going.

140
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,380
- From today, you'll do the network management. - OK.

141
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,100
You'll do the cleaning.

142
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,640
And hard labor? You'll do it, too.

143
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,830
Meals and accommodation are included.

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,870
But I won't pay you any money.

145
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,920
No money...

146
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,510
I was way too mean.

147
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,180
He's the master.

148
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,690
How can I just treat him like trash?

149
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,890
I even criticized him for he couldn't change the light bulb.

150
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,880
I thought he was a loser.

151
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,320
How could he be a loser?

152
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
Look how cute he is!

153
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,180
Will I never meet Ye Qiu again?

154
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,140
You're not eligible to say so.

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,860
The master was right.

156
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm not eligible to say so.

157
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,980
I was closely associated with him for so long.

158
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,570
He cared about me so much.

159
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,010
But I didn't know anything.

160
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,140
Tang, do you think it's my blessing?

161
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,420
I don't think it's blessing.

162
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,660
It's revenge.

163
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,780
It's the revenge for your ignorance

164
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,130
when the master was there but you knew nothing.

165
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,870
- Boss. - Yes?

166
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,410

The garage kit video is amazing.

175

Why not be more thorough?

176
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,010
Let's change the password of the network.

177
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,820
How about "Ye Qiu is the most handsome and invincible"?

178

"Ye Qiu is the most handsome and invincible."

179

That sounds great.

180
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,300
I feel my net cafe has been upgraded so much.

181
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,970
You should have known I was using a rhetorical device.

182
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,940
It is called "irony".

183
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,090
It's "irony". The master is satirizing me.

184
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,776
Why would I always push him so hard?

185
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,050
I was baring my heart as a fan while scolding him as a boss.

186
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,740
Look how quickly I switched my mode!

187
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,970
Tang, what should I do?

188
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,890
What if the master leaves?

189
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,790
What if he doesn't leave today but departs tomorrow?

190
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,540
What if it's not tomorrow but the day after tomorrow?

191
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,260
Turn right. The second room.

192
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,380
Go inside and "kidnap" him now.

193
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,900
Or wait for him quietly at his door until he's touched.

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,136
Wait.

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,260
"Kidnapping" isn't a good option.

196
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,180
It'd made me look crude.

197
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,120
But waiting isn't a good option, either.

198
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,000
It'd make me look stupid.

199
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,250
Then what do you want?

200
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,910
I heard some noise.

201
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,810
He's throwing things.

202
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,390
Is he mad?

203
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,570
He just closed the closet.

204
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,540
He's coming.

205
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,540
Boss.

206
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,460
What are you doing?

207
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,180
Boss, move aside, please.

208
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,100
You are in my way.

209
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,530
This way, please.

210
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,620
Are you OK?

211
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,220
Yes.

212
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,740
Really?

213
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,180
Yes.

214
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,010
Did he just smile at me?

215
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,230
- Did he? - Yes.

216
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,100
And the smile was creepy.

217
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,630
Is he going to part ways with me?

218
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,010
I may look domineering at work, but I don't mean it.

219
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,380
Tang! Tang!

220
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,260
Come back!

221
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,020
Tang!

222
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,340
Don't.

223
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,900
Need anything?

224
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,780
Could be something or nothing.

225
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,220
Depends on what you'll say.

226
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,020
Could say something or nothing.

227
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,670
Depends on what you'll ask.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,660
Want something to drink?

229
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,860
Anything.

230
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,740
Then, tea.

231
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,040
Dragon Head Raising is so amazing.

232
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,010
Why is it not in the strategy guide you gave me?

233
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,570
If it's not there, you'll never learn about it?

234
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,580
I'm not saying it.

235
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,380
I can always steal from others.

236
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
To steal?

237
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,820
You'd value skills that are stolen.

238
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,220
Right?

239
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,970
So...

240
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,210
You'd value a name that is stolen, right?

241
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,660
I'd value my salary more.

242
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,260
Please ask the boss when the payday will be.

243
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,580
Didn't Guoguo tell you?

244
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,580
She never pays the salary each month.

245
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,320
It's a 10-year contract.

246
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,220
Salaries are paid every other 6 months.

247
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,340
It's a contract of selling myself.

248
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,140
Wanna breach it?

249
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,220
That contract means...

250
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,340
I could never leave even if I wanted to.

251
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,432
Have a good rest.

252
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,540
Did you hear everything?

253
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,700
Go to bed.

254
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,060
"He could never leave even if he wanted to."

255
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,020
What does it mean?

256
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,330
Did he mean he wanted to go?

257
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,300
Or he couldn't leave?

258
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,420
Wait.

259
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,440
Would he leave or not?

260
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,120
Put it here.

261
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,380
Guoguo.

262
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,560
What is your plan?

263
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,970
Holding his luggage equals to holding him in my hands.

264
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,690
- Beauty. - Yes?

265
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,220
Well, it's my seat.

266
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,340
- We're friends. We're just chatting. - Friends?

267
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,580
- Yes. - It's OK. Take my seat.

268
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,750
- I'm sorry. - It's OK.

269
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,420
Handsome, you look kinda familiar.

270
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,750
Do I know you?

271
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,650
Now I remember.

272
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,940
You look like someone who is playing eSports.

273
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,740
Really?

274
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,420
People say it often.

275
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,180
See?

276
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,450
Handsome, we're done chatting.

277
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,710
Wait a sec. You are Trou...

278
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,060
You can go back to your own seat.

279
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,780
Troubling Rain.

280
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,140
Exactly.

281
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,420
Am I right?

282
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,460
He does look like him.

283
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,980
He does.

284
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,020
If I didn't remember it wrong, one month has passed

285
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,580
since Master Ye Qiu announced his retirement.

286
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,340
Lots of fans are very curious about

287
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,220
what the master has been doing during the entire month.

288
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,900
If I were him, after the seven-year career of Glory,

289
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,420
competing in the field for such a long time,

290
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,820
I would take a long vacation.

291
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,150
Yes.

292
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,250
Going to a remote island, enjoying the sunshine and the beach.

293
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,640
- And enjoying sea waves and views. - Boss.

294
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,470
- The sunshine and the beach... - Boss.

295
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,060
- ...On the past weekend... - That's my seat belt.

296
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,780
Master Ye Qiu has a unique skill: "Dragon Head Raising".

297
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,940
It's something that many people don't expect.

298
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,860
Yes. We want to hear what players in other teams would say.

299
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,220
No comment.

300
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,940
Our captain means we don't know what's going on with Ye Qiu.

301
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,940
= All-star Game =
But if he wants to come back to the league,

302
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,310
= All-star Game =

303
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,060
we'll definitely support him.
= All-star Game =

304
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,400
= All-star Game =

305
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,890
In my opinion...
= All-star Game =

306
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,590
= All-star Game =

307
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,700
We don't know what's going on with Jia Shi and Ye Qiu.
= All-star Game =

308
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,940
We don't know what's going on with Jia Shi and Ye Qiu.

309
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,980
But as his friends,

310
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,180
we believe there must be some reason behind what he's done.

311
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,580
Every profession has its best skill.

312
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,660
The key is the person who's performing it.

313
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,200
Xiao Luo, on the weekend of All-star Game,

314
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,090
you were invited to be the live host.

315
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,100
Any inside information you can share with us?

316
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,820
Actually, nope. I was very surprised, too.

317
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,980
The Samsara Team planned to invite Master Ye Qiu as our VIP

318
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,440
to attend the live event.

319
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,300
But after the master retired,

320
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,860
all his contact info didn't work anymore.

321
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,580
We couldn't reach him and invite him to join us.

322
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,540
But I have a concern.

323
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,140
Why did Mater Ye Qiu announce his retirement suddenly?

324
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,300
Back then, Jia Shi announced the reason why Ye Qiu retired.

325
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,980
It was because his mental status was decreasing.

326
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,140
So he decided to stay behind the scenes.

327
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,180
Since he still could perform "Dragon Head Raising",

328
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,220
the "decreased mental status" seems not true.

329
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,620
What you just said sent a chill down my spine.

330
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,860
We know nothing about any inside info.

331
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,230
But what I do know is:

332
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,300
no one in media has an access to interviewing anyone in Jia Shi.

333
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,380
What's going on?

334
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,330
Let's wait for more first-hand information.

335
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,720
That's bullshit.

336
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,170
A chill down his spine?

337
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,640
It's a chill in my heart.

338
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,700
One minute Jia Shi kicked Master Ye Qiu out,

339
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,050
the next minute they replaced him with the rookie Sun Xiang.

340
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,240
What the heck?

341
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
Sun Xiang is quite competitive.

342
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,710
- After all... - Wait, wait...

343
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,350
Was that just a total coincidence?

344
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,480
A rookie replaced him like that.

345
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,420
Jia Shi must be calculating everything covertly.

346
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,140
Earlier on he didn't perform well in Yue Yun Team.

347
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,380
Going to Jia Shi will bring him a promising future.

348
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,140
Damn! A new talent?

349
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,900
No matter how competitive he is, he's at most a rookie.

350
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,470
How could he ever compare to Mater Ye Qiu?

351
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,380
You saw that, too.

352
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,940
He logged in Mater Ye Qiu's account.

353
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,880
Could he handle it?

354
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,780
He was defeated by Smoke Alone.

355
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,420
Right?

356
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,110
- You are new, right? - Yes.

357
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,850
- Just starting interviewing? - Yes.

358
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,860
When you are in this for long enough, you would know.

359
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,780
Rookies are laughing while retirees are weeping.

360
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,220
The laws of nature.

361
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,060
I only believe in my master.

362
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,580
Keep doing that.

363
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,700
Look! Look!

364
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,220
They are back!

365
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,980
Hurry up! Follow them!

366
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,810
I'll protect the master!

Don't come closer!

Please open the window! Please!

383
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,700
Mr. Tao!

384
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,460
Why could Ye Qiu perform Dragon Head Raising at All-star Game yesterday?

385
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,060
You were saying his mental status decreased.

386
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,350
But if it was not the story, why did he retire?

387
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,680
Captain Sun, as the account owner of Leaf of Autumn,

388
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,840
you don't have the skill of Dragon Head Raising.

389
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,340
Do you think you are under-qualified?

390
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,940
Captain Sun, any explanation?

391
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,620
Captain Sun, you...

392
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Who asked the question? Step up!

393
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,860
Shut up!

394
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,100
Watch out!

395
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,960
Thanks for your attention.

396
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,540
We'll hold a press conference soon.

397
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,630
All of you are welcome to come.

398
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,640
Thank you. Thank you.

399
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,180
Drive.

400
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,420
Don't go. Answer the question.

401
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,800
Boss, do you still need the exercise book on the front desk?

402
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,730
Is it so scary?

403
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,620
Dragon Head Raising!

404
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,620
Han Yanrou successfully performed

405
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,700
Master Ye Qiu's unique skill "Dragon Head Raising"!

406
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,860
The appearance of "Dragon Head Raising" has caused a sensation.

407
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,900
Players in other teams say they'll support Ye Qiu to come back.

408
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,220
The "Dragon Head Raising" event keeps heating up.

409
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,220
Today, lots of media flooded into Jia Shi Building.

410
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,340
See?

411
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,300
All the media are focusing on Jia Shi.

412
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,420
After your three successive championships,

413
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,280
you haven't seen such a big crowd.

414
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,180
You don't have to worry about the media.

415
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,100
I have sent someone from the public relations arena.

416
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,220
The reporters waiting at the gate won't stay for long.

417
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,020
Once the press conference is held, everything will go away soon.

418
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,620
Don't tell me you knew nothing about Ye Qiu showing up at All-star.

419
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,280
Ye Qiu...

420
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,500
He didn't show up at All-star.

421
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,040
Really?

422
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,740
So what the media said was fake news?

423
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,700
It could be true.

424
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,060
It could be fake.

425
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,420
Ye Qiu has never showed up in public.

426
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,890
No media took a single photo of him this time.

427
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,800
No one has ever seen who performed Dragon Head Raising.

428
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,160
So if we say it was not Ye Qiu, it's not hard to believe.

429
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,620
Mr. Tao, you're really something.

430
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,380
Being so calm when deceiving others as well as yourself.

431
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,770
It's Dragon Head Raising.

432
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,970
Only Ye Qiu can perform it.

433
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,750
The fans are not blind.

434
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
About all this,

435
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,220
you don't have to worry.

436
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,020
Just spend more money.

437
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,170
When the PR works,

438
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,450
I'll send someone to lubricate relations with fans.

439
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,760
Things are going to be different soon.

I care nothing about the media or the fans.

443
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,600
What I'm expecting is a good market valuation of Jia Shi.

444
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,340
It could make it possible for the next round of financing.

445
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,250
Mr. Tao, we are both clear eSports is just business.

446
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,540
I've invested in it because I can see its commercial prospect.

447
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,580
But a month ago,

448
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,690
the market valuation went down to the bottom of two years.

449
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,680
You said the key was to find a new talent.

450
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,280
You named Sun Xiang. Fine.

451
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,020
What now?

452
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,250
No improvement in market valuation.

453
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,480
Instead, Jia Shi has ruined its reputation.

454
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,870
Sun Xiang has more commercial value than Ye Qiu.

455
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,680
You and I both know it clearly.

456
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,360
They are just having a run-in period.

457
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,160
We need to be patient.

458
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,180
I'll try my best to deal with this emergency.

459
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,880
Hoping for a smooth transition.

460
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,730
Don't worry.

461
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,820
Jia Shi will bounce back soon.

462
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,460
Mr. Tao.

463
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,860
I hope you are not making empty promises.

464
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,180
Show me something real.

465
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,840
Or... With all the opportunities in the market,

466
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,300
I still could weigh my options.

467
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,460
Ye Qiu is really something.

468
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,540
Think about Dragon Head Raising.

469
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,860
Really interesting.

470
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,100
A single move of Dragon Soaring.

471
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,980
If you missed, you could reverse it.

472
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,300
Making a bad move doesn't matter.

473
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,660
A timely remedy would be good.

474
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,100
So in my eyes,

475
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,260
whether it's Dragon Head "Raising" or "Lowering",

476
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,944
it'll be a good move if you win.

Why is Guoguo avoiding you as she's avoiding virus?

487
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,860
I'd say she's encountered a big problem.

488
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,380
What's wrong?

489
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,340
She's being socially awkward.

490
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,290
For that reason,

491
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,580
we have to take "drastic" measures.

Though I didn't take any pictures of Sun Xiang,

494
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,340
I did get inside info.

495
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,460
Master Ye Qiu had left Jia Shi the day before the press conference.

496
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,780
Something fishy going on here.

497
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,340
Sun Xiang is just a small potato.

498
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,740
Who really matters is Master Ye Qiu.

Don't ... Director...

500
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,280
Why are you taking Jia Shi's side suddenly?

501
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,770
I'm not splitting hairs.

502
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
You've told us:

503
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,620
"News reporting must be true, objective and fair."

504
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,460
That's what I've been doing.

505
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,664
What about this?

506
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,740
Director, grant me some business trip fund.

507
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,460
I'll wait at Jia Shi's gate.

508
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,820
And I'll find Master Ye Qiu.

509
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,500
Then we can interview him.

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,340
I was attacking Night Evil Cat right here.

550
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,540
Everything was fine just now.

551
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,810
Turn over the screen.

552
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:44,880
Fixed.

553
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,580
You're in the same trade?

554
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,700
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =
A bottle of water, please.

555
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,180
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

556
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,190
I'll get it for you.
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

557
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,760
I'll get it for you.

558
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,860
Do you make good money in your net cafe?

559
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,020
Is it recruiting?

560
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm not in the same trade with you!

561
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,060
Was the day when Manager Ye first started working here?

562
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,750
Yes.

563
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,190
Exactly right!

564
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,660
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,300
I have an assumption.

566
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,880
Manager Ye could be Mater Ye Qiu.

567
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,490
How is it possible?

568
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,900
Listen to me.

569
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,390
According to my investigation,

570
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,700
the day when the 10th district of Glory opened,

571
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,180
Master Ye Qiu left Jia Shi.

572
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,940
Think about it.

573
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,900
When he left Jia Shi,

574
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,580
the master looked around.

575
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,180
He had nowhere to go.

576
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,140
So he crossed the street,

577
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
and walked in your net cafe.

578
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,060
He ended up being your network manager.

579
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,200
You're checking out?

580
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,620
I'm here for the job.

581
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,550
= Want Ad =

582
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,640
It's impossible.

583
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,570
Surprised?

584
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,940
I am, too.

585
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,180
But at one moment just now, it suddenly dawned on me.

586
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,020
My assumption is perfect.

587
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,940
How is it perfect?

588
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,060
Wait. Think about it.

589
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,700
The "lesser hermit" lives in seclusion in the country,

590
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,120
while the "greater hermit" does so in the city.

591
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,700
But unexpectedly, the master has been hidden here!

592
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,940
He seems to tell all:

593
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,380
"Look. I'll be back again.

594
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,420
I'm right here."

595
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,710
You're just hallucinating!

596
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,590
It's impossible.

597
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,980
But I do think what I said is quite plausible. Right?

598
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,100
You're Ye Qiu's fan, right?

599
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,880
I can tell it from what you do with the decorations here.

600
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,340
Think about it.

601
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,660
Look, our idol is in front of us.

602
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,250
Nobody else knows about it except for you and me.

603
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,780
Now we're kinda on the same boat.

604
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,660
Wait here. I'll do more investigation about him.

605
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,540
Don't stop me.

606
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,380
No way!

607
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:49,940
What?

608
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,780
He isn't Ye Qiu.

609
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,060
He isn't Ye Qiu.

610
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,660
Look at him.

611
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,370
He is mean and clumsy.

612
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,110
He knows nothing about handling things or casting accounts.

613
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,700
How could he be Ye Qiu?

614
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,540
Right?

615
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,220
Really?

616
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,370
Yes.

617
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,360
If it's true, why are you willing to keep him here?

618
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,180
None of your business.

619
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,580
Do you have an agenda?

620
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,700
Nope.

621
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,800
You know it's him.

622
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,740
So you want to keep him here.

623
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,590
False.

624
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,980
You kidnapped, threatened and house-arrested him.

625
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:24,990
Not true.

626
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,860
Then let me investigate him.

627
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:26,920
Thank you.

628
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,620
Stop!

629
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,710
Bro!

630
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,540
Bro! Bro!

631
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,680
Your boss gave me the consent.

632
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,180
I didn't!

633
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,970
You did!

634
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,570
Bro, are you doing well here?

635
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,500
I...

636
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,940
Meals, accommodation and network are included.

637
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,900
He's doing very well.

638
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Yes. My boss is right.

639
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,020
It's my dream job.

640
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,630
Bro!

641
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,020
Are you still doing the training regularly?

642
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,220
Cleaning tables, moving chairs and fixing computers.

643
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,980
He's doing the training every day.

644
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,360
- Is that right? - Yes.

645
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm the best network manager.

646
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,780
Do you still play Glory?

647
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,380
In which district?

648
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,780
Are you performing amazingly?

649
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,940
A rookie in District 10.

650
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,940
Just as a pastime.

651
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,340
- Amateur. - Yes.

652
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,960
Very amateur.

653
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,300
You are in District 10, too.

654
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,780
What is your user name?

655
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,570
Are you in any guild?

656
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,820
That's something private.

657
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,490
Bro!

658
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,790
Boss! Boss!

659
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,470
It's stuck. Come fix it!

660
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm Yue Zhongmian, the master of Yue Lun Guild.

661
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,740
It's you!

662
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,020
Bro, you've heard about me?

663
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,900
I was on the Record List!

664
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:43,710
No big deal.

665
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,180
You were on the Record List?

666
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,860
You are amazing!

667
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,500
Not bad.

668
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm a veteran in three districts.

669
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,780
Making some record is no big deal.

670
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,540
Wasn't it because someone helped you?

671
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,160
That's true.

672
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,300
But it's not important.

673
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,780
Bro, what profession do you have in Glory?

674
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,820
The battlemage?

675
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,220
I'm...

676
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,140
- Done. Sorry for that. - Thanks!

677
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,740
... the Freelancer.

678
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,220
What? The Freelancer?

679
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
What is it?

680
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,460
Stop it, Little Moon.

681
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,860
Little... Moon...

682
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,630
Are you Jun...

683
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,420
Your benefactor.

684
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,040
Jun Moxiao.

685
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,300
I've told you.

686
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,240
It's not him.

687
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,700
It's impossible!

688
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,010
It's not possible at all.

689
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,910
Sorry. I have things to do.

690
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,340
I need to go.

691
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,820
You think about it thoroughly.

692
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,580
- He's definitely not Leaf of Autumn! - He's gone.

693
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,540
Don't you ever expose your identity easily.

694
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,460
You are finally talking to me.

695
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,100
Boss.

696
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,060
Talking about what?

697
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,260
Go on working!

698
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,650
Due to our internal inspection,
= Termination Notice =

699
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,900
we'll close the net cafe from today.
= Termination Notice =

700
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,800
we'll close the net cafe from today.

701
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,900
If there is any inconvenience...

702
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,660
If there is any inconvenience...

703
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,540
= Termination Notice =
Do whatever as you see fit.

704
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:23,630
Guoguo.

705
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,630
What are you doing?

706
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,530
You scared me.

707
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,380
Why were you walking without any sound?

708
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,060
The net cafe will close suddenly.

709
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,020
What happened?

710
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,710
I'm worried something bad would happen.

711
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,970
Have you seen the reporter coming and going every day?

712
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,920
If he did the same again, what should we do?

713
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,950
The master would expose his identity.

714
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,640
If he did so,

715
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,830
he could not stay here anymore.

716
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,620
If he couldn't stay here, where would he go?

717
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,460
He'd be homeless.

718
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,340
No way.

719
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,540
I must keep him here.

720
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,500
I'd rather close the net cafe.

721
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,980
Closing it?

722
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,860
But have you ever thought if you closed it,

723
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,900
the reporter would be more suspicious.

724
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:19,780
Right?

725
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,140
Yes.

726
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,040
- I'd make a confession without duress. - Exactly!

727
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,660
Canceled your plan?

728
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Where is it?

729
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,360
What are you looking for?

730
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,380
If I can't prevent others coming in,

731
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,710
I need to make changes inside.

732
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,210
How many locks should I put on the attic?

733
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,500
What? Locks?

734
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,800
Or...

735
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,450
I could demolish the stairs up there.

736
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,720
He's indoorsy.

737
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,120
There should be no problem if he was up there for over 10 days.

738
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,380
Wait, Guoguo.

739
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,330
That's outrageous.

740
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,700
I'll deliver him his computer.

741
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,130
In his entire world, Glory is more than enough.

742
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,380
As long as he didn't show up, the reporter would never know.

743
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,140
Perfect.

744
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,190
How is it perfect?

745
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,340
Even though the reporter didn't come, the police would.

746
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,540
Seems nothing would work.

747
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,840
What should I do?

748
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm running out options.

749
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:35,920
Guoguo.

750
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,440
If you really wanna keep him here,

751
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,840
it's not very complicated.

752
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,500
How should I do it?

753
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,040
You're not suggesting I break his legs?

754
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,940
It could be one option.

755
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,220
He would only need his hands.

756
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,360
Of course not.

757
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
What the heck are you thinking?

758
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,380
I mean...

759
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,340
If you want to keep someone, win his heart first.

760
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,580
How?

761
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:13,900
Two words.

762
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,780
Spoil him.

763
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,130
Spoil him?
