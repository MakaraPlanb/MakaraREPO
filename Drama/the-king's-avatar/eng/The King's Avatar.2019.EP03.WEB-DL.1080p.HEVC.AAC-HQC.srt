=Episode 3

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
You can show it to everyone now.

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,840
OK

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,560
Wait

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Did I just

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Put my great god's lateral view in it.

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,160
No, no, no

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
I have to check again

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
What face do you see in the highlights of the competition?

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,760
What do you know

12
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
The match was well played.

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
It's just technical charm

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,080
And my great god

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
He also has charisma

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
Not really.

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
I remember I clearly

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
It's in this document

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Why can't you find it now

20
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
I decided

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
In order to reduce the possibility of being beaten by him

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
We took advantage of the time when he was running out of blood.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,640
Stab him

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Immune injury from teammates

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
What's the use of stabbing him?

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Will it be possible to move stones?

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
Stone's damage is a neutral damage

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
As long as the stone hit correctly

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
This injury is settled! go!

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Found it!

31
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
Now you can

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
What happened?

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
I forgot this TV set

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
can't read the disc

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
This TV set has a high-end interface, I remember

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
Can be connected to this computer

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,960
Can we finish the whole thing at once?

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
You are the boss? Or I am the boss.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,800
You are

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Then you do it

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520
You are a lazy thief!

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,720
I

43
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,440
come on, come on, come on

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
Sliding shovel

45
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
A 180-degree sweep

46
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Classics are classics and cannot be copied.

47
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,440
Come on

48
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
What the hell

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Come on, come on.

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
what?

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
Jun Moxiao?

52
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,840
This guy is going to revolt?

53
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Yes

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Sand throwing

55
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
gatling gun

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Floating air four-shot combo

57
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,960
Ye Qiu's style of play

58
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,400
Ye Qiu, Ye Xiu

59
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,320
He is not Ye Qiu, is he?

60
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Impossible

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
Chen Guo, what are you thinking?

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,640
Congratulations to the players

63
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,600
Jun Moxiao

64
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,080
Won't play!

65
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Handsome

66
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,120
Finish the first kill in the 10th district of Spider Cave.

67
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,680
It is a really simple

68
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
task

69
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
But I found the

70
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
long-lost passion

71
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
It's like being back in my youth.

72
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
One encourage, one smile

73
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
One goal

74
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,680
Will inspire the desire for victory.

75
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
I said you meant it

76
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Or deliberately

77
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Or is it intentional

78
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Boss, you don't have to say anything

79
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,600
Pick up your account book

80
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,920
You can deduct as much as you want.

81
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I have absolutely no opinion

82
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
You played too well. I'll tell you what

83
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,440
You just played Ye Qiu possessed

84
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
I am really happy.

85
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Yes, yes

86
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
It's really like Ye Qiu possessed

87
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
That was a good fight.

88
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
My network manager

89
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,840
Where is the copy just now?

90
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
He is just playing around

91
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,160
This is the hard-core fan of Ye Qiu you have found.

92
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
That was a good fight.

93
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
If you want to pass the probation period

94
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
Just cooperate with me

95
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
I love Ye Qiu. Ye Qiu loves me

96
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
Sometimes

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
I even think I am Ye Qiu himself.

98
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,960
You do have the style of Ye Qiu in those days.

99
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,560
I have

100
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
Wife of shop-owner has vision

101
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Nothing, nothing

102
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
About me

103
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,040
there are no requirements, just two

104
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,880
One has a name like Ye Qiu

105
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,680
The second is that plays glory like Ye Qiu

106
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
That's a good shot.

107
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,840
Come again next time.

108
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,520
The probation period

109
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Pass!

110
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Can I also make a discount on the money I owe?

111
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,800
Discount? Yes

112
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
Let me give you a 12% discount.

113
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
The arrears rose by 20%

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,080
Keep smiling or else

115
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,560
The probation period continues.

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Hold on

117
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
You wrote this

118
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,680
Although you are now an intern at the magazine

119
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,120
But as a future journalist

120
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
You must have objective consciousness

121
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
I am objective

122
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
This is clearly pointed out in your article.

123
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,000
Ye Qiu was forced to retire

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
It was Jia Shi's interest consideration.

125
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
They drove Ye Qiu away.

126
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Where is your evidence?

127
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
Ye Qiu loves glory so much

128
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,240
It is impossible for him to choose to retire suddenly.

129
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,080
As you know, Kasai is holding

130
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Ye Qiu and Leaf of autumn

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
But the benefits

132
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,600
But far more than a.

133
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,680
The captain of the second-tier team

134
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
I've heard people say before

135
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,080
Jia Shi's senior officials have long been dissatisfied with Ye Qiu

136
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,640
Is this, this

137
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
Can hearsay be regarded as news?

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,600
that

139
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I know you are a fan of Ye Qiu

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,480
But again how to fight for Ye Qiu

141
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
You must not forget that you are a reporter.

142
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
We should also stick to the bottom line of news.

143
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
You should learn from me

144
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,080
No matter the outside world put Ye Qiu

145
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,320
How do you portray it beautifully?

146
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
I only stick to one principle

147
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,440
Listen to him personally, writing is the only way to be divine.

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,320
Director Cao

149
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
Didn't you say you know Ye Qiu

150
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Then you can help me build the line

151
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,240
I went to interview him

152
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,760
After I checked with him

153
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't know whether the insider

154
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,120
Stop dreaming

155
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
I have known him for eight years.

156
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
Haven't met yet

157
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,440
Didn't you interview him before

158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
You don't know in this world

159
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,280
there is something called QQ?

160
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
What do you think of this form

161
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,240
This won't work!

162
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
This can't be done. Let me do it

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
You haven't demonstrated! how you know!

164
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,720
Really

165
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Try to pin the cannon on it.

166
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
You can demonstrate this cannon again

167
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,760
Why are you so good today?

168
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
After sweeping the floor and washing the clothes

169
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,240
You can't touch the computer until you have cooked the meal well.

170
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
My sister's instructions are imperial edicts, right

171
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
Who washed it

172
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,400
Me, me.

173
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
When did you wash it

174
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
I didn't wash it. Did you wash it

175
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
definitely!

176
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
Are you sure?

177
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,160
It must be me

178
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,000
It's definitely me

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,480
You

180
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Why do you want to wear black pants

181
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Mix and wash

182
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,560
Come on, what are you drawing

183
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,040
Let her change

184
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,760
Are you sure?

185
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
Don't worry.

186
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,840
We got you a T-shirt

187
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
This black stain

188
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,680
will be the most beautiful label of this T-shirt.

189
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,120
Unique T-shirt

190
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,440
To the one and only you

191
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
What exactly are you drawing here

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,640
It's one

193
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,320
Melancholy kitty

194
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
This way, please. This way, please

195
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Look at the camera, look at the lens.

196
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,560
Three, two, one

197
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Talking about the acquaintance with mu Qiu

198
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,320
Thanks to gravity

199
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
A lucky coin sent in

200
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,240
My lucky coin

201
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,320
You wait a minute

202
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,920
Don't

203
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
That's mine

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
What?

205
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,480
Lucky Coin

206
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,120
Isn't that just a video game coin?

207
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,520
It was a birthday present from my sister.

208
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Defeat me and I'll pay you ten

209
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
If you lose

210
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Think of it as a gift

211
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,680
Why are you still roguing me

212
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
The same preferences

213
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,160
Let's become good brothers sharing weal and woe.

214
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,480
My youth is frivolous and my ambition is full of pride.

215
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,080
All my glory is related to him.

216
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,520
I will take a thousand umbrellas with me.

217
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
Get to the top of glory

218
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
What's going on?

219
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
How did this happen on the stage?

220
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,960
I always thought that life

221
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
The only option is to win

222
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,640
So I don't allow mistakes

223
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,640
Don't admit defeat

224
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
Do not accept to start again

225
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,160
I will only choose to leave

226
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,080
Xiao Tang, I am reviewing my lessons

227
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,040
Not heard

228
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,160
If I get off the plane

229
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
On the way to the internet cafe

230
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,720
An interlude on the way to examination

231
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,560
It became the beginning of my friendship with Guo Guo

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
What are you doing

233
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,280
Why are we fighting?

234
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,360
Stop

235
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,120
Are you OK

236
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,800
Nothing

237
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,360
Get up

238
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,120
I have to go first. Thank you.

239
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,000
It's okay.

240
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,120
Your bag

241
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
A minor mistake

242
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,000
Give us the chance to meet again.

243
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,600
This Internet cafe was the only memory Guo Guo's father left to her

244
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,280
after his death

245
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
Finish father's job

246
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,080
Continue father's career

247
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,960
Becomes her life belief

248
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
And I became

249
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,040
The great devil who urged her to learn and improve.

250
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
The rules remain the same.

251
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
That still need to say

252
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I won't let the water out.

253
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
Come on

254
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
Xiao Tang, look at this

255
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,560
I really did everything. Look

256
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,200
This is the boss's best friend.

257
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,120
No

258
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,640
old enemy

259
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Understand! Old-enemy-like best friend

260
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,680
Boy!

261
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
The new webmaster, your old enemy, called you

262
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Come here

263
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
Just a little stupid

264
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Take the luggage up

265
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Xiao Tang, let's go

266
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,600
Don't worry.

267
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
And this

268
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,120
Do you mind joining us? It's very light

269
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
Do not mind

270
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,280
Go, Tang

271
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,640
Gone

272
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
What word set exercise book

273
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,040
I just had to mix it with the meal.

274
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,560
I tell you.

275
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,280
You give me a basin now

276
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
You give me a basin now

277
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,760
I can spit out full of ink for you.

278
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,760
It looks good.

279
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,520
Don, don't worry

280
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,880
This year, I will definitely pass it

281
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Fruit

282
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
This year's completion is not bad.

283
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Xiao Tang, you have left me

284
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
for 268 days

285
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,920
I have studied for 267 days

286
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Why is it one day missed?

287
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,440
The day is today

288
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
My little Tang is here

289
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,240
Then I must accompany her

290
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Xiao Tang, look at me

291
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,240
I told you there was a milk tea shop nearby.

292
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
Really popular on the Internet

293
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,400
There is a long queue every day.

294
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
Reasonable rest is called relaxation.

295
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Unreasonable rest is impudence.

296
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm not lazy. I am

297
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,480
Chen Guo!

298
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
Tang, you must believe me

299
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
Boss! I brought it up

300
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,160
he! it is him!

301
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
He is the culprit of my laziness.

302
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,120
Tang, let me tell you something

303
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
He just an ordinary network manager

304
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,920
but has won all over the world in Glory

305
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,960
I was beaten to death without the strength to fight back.

306
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,800
Well, I'm responsible for reading well

307
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,720
You are responsible for the challenge

308
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Beat this little network manager at one stroke

309
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,000
Regain prestige

310
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Boss, I have to go first

311
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's talk.

312
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
Why don't you go talk to Xiao Tang

313
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Just ten minutes

314
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
I haven't done a page of questions.

315
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,680
You give me some time to make it up

316
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Afraid of being injured by mistake

317
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,920
As long as you succeed

318
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
The arrears between us were written off.

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,640
What if it doesn't work

320
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
There will never be a quick day to turn over.

321
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
At this juncture of self-examination

322
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,840
No one can be a stumbling block to her.

323
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
I really don't want to play Glory with others

324
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,960
The boss is my best opponent.

325
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Why?

326
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,840
She has been losing and I have been winning.

327
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,760
What a feeling it is to play with such honor.

328
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,320
If she can beat me once

329
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
I wouldn't have bothered

330
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,240
Let her make my sandbag

331
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
Guo

332
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Take the card and play Glory

333
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,320
You will lose

334
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Will we continue?

335
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,520
It's not time yet.

336
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,880
It's just so boring

337
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
It's long overdue.

338
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,960
Done

339
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,680
This kind of confrontation is not boring, is it?

340
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,000
I finished today's review according to the regulations.

341
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,440
However, Xiao Tang seems to have encountered difficulties.

342
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,480
A lot of people will decide to continue

343
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,720
because of one thing can easily get started.

344
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
But Xiao Tang is the opposite

345
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,480
When she encounters something difficult to deal with

346
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
There is no need to say any more.

347
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
She will muster all her strength.

348
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,320
Rush up

349
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,560
The keyboard keeps ringing.

350
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
My little Tang

351
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
Does the heart of victory and defeat rise again?

352
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Such a simple thing

353
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,840
I can't lose

354
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,920
Absolutely can not lose

355
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
It can't be true

356
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Wait, another round

357
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,840
No, it's been ten innings

358
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
There is no point in continuing.

359
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,120
However, your operation is quite fast.

360
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
But the coordination between the left and right hands is in a mess.

361
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Adaptability and judgment to perspective change

362
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,600
are basically don't exsist.

363
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,080
The world of Glory is nothing much.

364
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,120
Want to win me? It will takes you another 100 years.

365
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,800
I said you were a little over the top.

366
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Sorry, it's a little too much.

367
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
A hundred years or something

368
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
It's just an exaggerated description

369
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
It doesn't really take that long

370
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,600
Off duty

371
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Xiao Tang

372
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,120
Don't be unhappy, smile

373
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,920
You leave him alone

374
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,040
He is a man with a cheap mouth.

375
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,560
Guo

376
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Open an account for me

377
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
What?

378
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
You sure?

379
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
I want to use what he is best at.

380
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,320
Defeat him personally.

381
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,720
this competition

382
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,640
I am sure to win.

383
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
OK?

384
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Come on

385
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,520
Come on

386
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,280
Zoom in

387
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,160
Wouldn't it be nice to enlarge it earlier?

388
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,720
Yeah

389
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Good Chairman, Good Chairman

390
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
President

391
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Coffee

392
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Since the opening of the 10th district

393
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,720
A total of 12 first-time killings were recorded.

394
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
In the thatched cottage and domineering figure won four respectively

395
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,680
And we Lanxi Pavilion

396
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,800
There is only one item for the time being.

397
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,240
The meeting

398
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,160
According to the current situation

399
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm afraid we are away from the target set by the team.

400
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,120
There is still a little distance

401
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,680
Tie a boat.

402
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,720
We can't really stand out alone, can we

403
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,560
Why don't you stick it all up

404
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,760
Why don't you stick it all up

405
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,120
But fortunately, rare materials are still rich.

406
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,080
And the number of members is also steadily rising.

407
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,600
There are 82 more members today than yesterday.

408
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,040
Do you know our Lan Yu team's

409
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
ranking in the league?

410
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Do you know the double-digit increase in membership

411
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,320
Sorry, our ace team

412
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
Do I have to do everything myself?

413
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,760
All have a good reflection

414
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
why on earth

415
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,520
It's time for the president to hold a meeting.

416
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,520
Wait a little longer

417
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
All of them are here.

418
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
On the Construction of the 10th District Association

419
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,360
What suggestions do you have?

420
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,400
President

421
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,680
There is a master named Jun Mo xiao in the 10th district

422
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,480
who took three first kills these days.

423
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
And he hasn't joined any guild yet.

424
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Do we want to solicit?

425
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,440
The meeting is ongoing

426
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,680
Solicit top players

427
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,760
Don't you all call yourselves masters?

428
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
How do you still need to recruit others to help

429
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,800
If there is a problem, don't look for the reason from yourself.

430
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
But thinking about looking for aid from outside.

431
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
What kind of mentality is it?

432
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,680
And this Jun Moxiao is a master?

433
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,400
He is just lucky.

434
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
Now to play Glory without joining any guild

435
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
only for two reasons:

436
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,320
One

437
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
you have technical problems, you can't play well.

438
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,360
Two, there is something wrong with his character.

439
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,400
The guild refused to take him

440
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,840
If there is no problem with either

441
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,000
That's spy!

442
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,440
Lanxi Pavilion

443
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,560
Turned out to be Lan Yu team guild

444
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,520
Finding materials for professional team every day

445
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
with enormous potentiality.

446
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
There must be a sufficient stock of rare materials.

447
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,560
My Rare Material

448
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,000
Soon will take the initiative to deliver the door

449
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,720
Jun Moxiao add me as his friend!

450
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,760
Jun, what the hell

451
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
Added

452
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,520
You just said he was a spy

453
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,640
Did I say that?

454
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
What about the meeting?

455
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,960
I just said this Jun Moxiao

456
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
Maybe is an spy

457
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,200
It means he may be

458
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,480
What about this result

459
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
We don't know until we have confirmed it.

460
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,200
generally speaking

461
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,680
You should all learn from me.

462
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,120
How can you just talk about attracting experts?

463
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,720
action

464
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
That is the best way to set up a guild.

465
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
The meeting rose.

466
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
Come in

467
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
I told you.

468
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,280
Take a look at this data

469
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,560
Why is it so mysterious?

470
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,920
So what enen he took three first kills?

471
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,480
Now, I'm still killing him and he can't fight back

472
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
You beat him in the battle?

473
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,240
I did beat him at a bargain.

474
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,920
jew

475
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,560
Soliciting masters should pay attention to strategies

476
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,600
First of all, you have to understand the needs

477
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,360
Hold the line again

478
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,600
No matter what kind of master

479
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,600
Can win at one stroke

480
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,560
I think so

481
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
You may be interested in soliciting the word

482
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,360
There is some misunderstanding

483
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,440
What's the matter?

484
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,080
At first it was clearly a good process of bringing in people.

485
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,240
You talked about it like

486
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
High-priced Employment Relationship Transactions

487
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,720
Look

488
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,560
Brother, there is no guild.

489
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,040
Do you want to consider joining our Lanxi Pavilion

490
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Not interested for the time being.

491
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,160
at the very start

492
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
You are still very clear about your purpose

493
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,440
But he refused you as soon as he came up

494
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,880
However, it has left behind a current contract.

495
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,200
Let you feel there is still a chance

496
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
Also

497
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
You have to understand before you can make a decision.

498
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,120
Well, we're going to the frost forest

499
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
There is a need for a great god like you, brother.

500
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,920
Do you want to feel it

501
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,680
The team atmosphere of our Lanxi Pavilion

502
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
You want to challenge the record

503
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Not that ambitious. give it a try.

504
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,840
You played the emotional card very tactfully.

505
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,960
To invite him to play together

506
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,200
Finally also did not forget to hold him as a master

507
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
So far

508
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,640
Both of them are perfect wooing processes.

509
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,880
But starting with this sentence

510
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
He was in charge.

511
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,480
If just a try, I won't be interested.

512
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,880
No, no, no, no, not just a try

513
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,960
As you know, brother

514
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,960
the ranking record of the new district

515
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,360
is very important to every guild.

516
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Of course we also want to break the record.

517
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,880
Unfortunately, I am not a member of the guild

518
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,440
I can't realize the importance you mentioned.

519
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,680
It doesn't matter if you can't realize the importance.

520
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
What is important is that

521
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
you know what you want.

522
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,880
If the record is broken, the purple dress is yours.

523
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,920
How about that?

524
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Not interested in equipment

525
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,320
Great God, what are you interested in？

526
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,240
Do you have any rare materials?

527
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,960
To challenge the record is clearly your inner voice.

528
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,680
But he was the first one to say it

529
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,240
This is to let you take off your guard

530
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
thinking you two are at an united front

531
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,640
But didn't expect the situation was going downhill.

532
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,520
His refusal upsetted you.

533
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
When you were in a panic,

534
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
you have already lost.

535
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,760
There must be. What do you want?

536
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
We have everything in Lanxi Pavilion.

537
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Thirty Powerful Spider Silk

538
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,840
Eight white wolves' sharp teeth.

539
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,920
Eight White Langhao

540
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,560
Brother, you're asking too much, aren't you?

541
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,320
Didn't you say you have everything?

542
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,520
Yes, yes, but you want these three things

543
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
It will take a lot of luck to get it.

544
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,400
You can only choose one of three.

545
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,520
Then the white wolves' sharp teeth.

546
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,200
A little strong spider silk.

547
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
How about 25?

548
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,040
I

549
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,880
He raised the price as soon as he came up.

550
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
Is deliberately giving you room to bargain.

551
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,040
It made you think you've taken advantage of it.

552
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
Later he chose

553
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
the cheapest white wolves' sharp teeth

554
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,440
to make you think he lost

555
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
You earned it.

556
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,960
It was better to take a weak stance further.

557
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,160
Let you spare some spider silk.

558
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,040
This is all his calculation

559
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
What you promised him

560
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,520
maybe are more than he wanted.

561
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,360
I'm still defeated.

562
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,560
The materials are still in our hands.

563
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,440
It's still our say.

564
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,040
You need to pay some of the materials to enter the copy.

565
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
What does this mean?

566
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,440
Pay a down payment now and pay the rest afterwards.

567
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Chairman, let's..

568
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Can't you have a hand injury for a while?

569
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,320
There are so many people in Lanxi Pavilion

570
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,560
Are we afraid of he ran away?

571
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,200
Everything is under my control.

572
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,320
Then you all listen to my command.

573
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,160
Good. good.

574
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,320
All right, let's get it

575
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,040
Great God, how are we going to fight later?

576
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,360
I understand the move of the great god.

577
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,920
The great god drew this circle

578
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,800
to represent our will to work together.

579
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,080
Inside the circle is the pure land, outside the circle is the battlefield.

580
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Is that what you mean?

581
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,840
I mean,

582
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,400
Stay in the circle.

583
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,080
This ..

584
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,080
What is he doing?

585
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,400
How dare he face the monster alone.

586
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,760
Is this he kills them

587
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,040
or they eat him?

588
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,520
I'll go and see

589
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,640
We need to give him a few more minutes.

590
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,280
A master has a master's strategy.

591
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,960
We must have our tolerance.

592
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,680
Then our tolerance is

593
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
Wait
