Bye!

-Drive. - OK.

5
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,100
Finally! He's left.

6
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,520
He's more difficult than you are!

7
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
Is my big brother really difficult?

8
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,540
Wait!

9
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,090
Are you Ye Qiu or Ye Xiu?

10
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm Qiuqiu.

11
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,930
Qiu...

12
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,720
If you were Ye Qiu, I'd be Ye Xiu.

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,546
Nobody's fool!

14
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,300
Smart girl.

15
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,970
Could he buy a new one?

16
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,050
Always fixing this old one.

17

It's pretty!

25
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,431
You're more thoughtful when growing one year older.

26
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,542
Mucheng, do you like it?

27
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,850
Look good on me, right?

28
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,170
It's like custom-made for you.

29
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,020
Very pretty.

30
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,017
Couldn't agree more.

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,410
It must be expensive.

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,410
It's OK. Got a New Year discount.

33
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,540
Three for 20 yuan.

34
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,330
Here, Mucheng.

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,180
It's for you.

36
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,130
Another one is for Tang.

37
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,560
I'll go working.

38
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,530
Wait.

39
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,690
Come here. This is for you.

40
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,800
Come here.

41
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,340
Three for 20 yuan? Scram!

42
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,560
Ok. Got it.

43
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:17,960
Don't worry.

44
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,746
I'll make sure he'll be at the celebration in 30 minutes.

45
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,280
OK.

46
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,662
Sun Xiang!

47
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,810
Sun...

48
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,090
The celebration is about to start.

49
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,204
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm busy.

51
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,260
Are you learning Dragon Head Raising?

52
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,130
I'll make it.

53
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,560
It's just a single move.

54
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,000
Is it very important?

55
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,530
I'll beat Ye Qiu with Dragon Head Raising.

56
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,810
Ye Qiu?

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,170
He's not even qualified to be your rival.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Think about it.

59
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,760
Nothing would happen if you beat him.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,380
I wanna tell people I own Leaf of Autumn.

61
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,250
It's yours!

63
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,010
Well...

64
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,690
Leaf of Autumn could be yours.

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,690
Or it could belong to others.

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,060
Whether you could use Dragon Head Raising or not isn't the key.

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,820
I am.

68
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,770
Understood?

69
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,810
In Jia Shi, it's not enough you can play Glory.

70
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,120
You need to understand my game rules.

71
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,330
The only thing you need to do is:

72
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,810
show me you deserve to be Leaf of Autumn.

73
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,490
Are you done?

74
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,490
May you leave?

75
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,730
In 20 minutes,

76
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,690
you'd better show up at the celebration.

77
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:23,990

79
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,410
What a pity!

80
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,180
Your opening means my leaving.

81
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,250
See you in a year.

82
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,200
Welcome come back in Spring Festival.

83
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,330
My contract will end in a year.

84
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,170
Will I have a position in your Xing Xin Team?

85
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,330
Not sure.

86
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,300
If you retrogressed, we'd have to look for another Launcher.

87
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,290
I'm the top Launcher in Glory!

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,020
In one year, my apprentices will be riding the whirlwind of Glory.

89
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,410
Watch your throne.

90
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,671
It might be stolen.

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Don't worry.

92
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,410
I've stuck my throne to the ground with Flex Glue.

93
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,850
No one could steal or rob it.

94
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,730
By the way, speaking of apprentices,

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,010
he's coming back today.

96
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,490
Who?

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,850
You know who.

98
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,850
Little Monster.

99
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,400
See you.

Solo! Solo! Solo!

101
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:27,315
Solo! Solo! Solo!

102
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,250
Kick off!

103
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,450
Move!

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,260
Hurry up!

105
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,490
A new rule has been added since last year.

106
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:49,620
Players in Team 2 can't hold ranking matches without permission.

107
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,740
But Captain Ye said players needed to improve themselves.

108
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,400
It's too long if there's only one ranking match each year.

109
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,520
If someone wasn't convinced, they could fight.

110
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,244
Then we could solo.

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,930
I'll go dismiss them.

112
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:04,488
Watch your back!

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,320
Remain calm.

114
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,970
- Let them finish this round. - Continue!

115
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:14,090
Dodge!

116
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,010
Use your skill!

117
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,177
Beat him!

118
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,137
Good job!

119
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:29,600
Great!

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,173
Nailed it!

121
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,280
You wanna solo with me?

122
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,690
Not convinced by my ranking?

123
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,370
If I were not the best, who would be?

124
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,170
I beat you in less one minute.

125
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,570
Am I right?

126
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,730
I know everything.

127
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,930
If you didn't lose Qiu's return materials,

128
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,970
you'd only be the runner-up on the Ranking List!

129
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,130
How boisterous!

130
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:07,770
I've heard someone else is on the top spot of Team 2.

131
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,490
= Li Rui =
I've heard someone else is on the top spot of Team 2.

132
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,850
Is Li Rui here?

133
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
He finished the test ahead of schedule unexpectedly.

134
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,850
Captain Ye asked him to train abroad.

135
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,690
He was unwilling to go.

136
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,080
Unfortunately, Captain Ye left.

137
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,210
Otherwise, he'd name Qiu Fei as his successor.

138
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,850
Weren't you training abroad?

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,610
Why come back ahead of time?

140
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,930
If I didn't come back now,

141
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,568
things would be totally different in Jia Shi.

142
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,450
Would Team 2 change its position, too?

143
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,170
Now what?

144
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,160
A round of solo.

145
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,840
Nothing more.

146
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,640
I fed you with skills in the last round.

147
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,850
Didn't see you improve more than last year.

148
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:31,650
Shut up!

149
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:32,800
Beat me first!

150
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,300
Vanishing Step? Impossible!

151
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,090
How could you use it?

= Glory =

153
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:04,631
Yeah!

154
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,044
Great!

= Qiu Fei =

156
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,970
Prepare a feast for me today!

157
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,490
My treat.

158
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,450

160
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,920
What a good apprentice Ye Qiu has got!

161
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,690
Players in Team 2 have been confirmed.

162
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,170
You prevailed over Li Rui just now.

163
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,570
He'd lose face. That's all.

164
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,490
Nothing will change.

165
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,960
Not happy after being kicked out from Team 1?

166
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,690
Chen Yehui.

167
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,420
You're right.

168
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,540
The pot calling the kettle black.

169
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,050
Others had built you up for years.

170
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,060
Then you suffered a disastrous decline.

171
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,810
What' more, you are labeled with...

172
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,330
Traitor.

173
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,450
Yes, you are a traitor.

174
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,170
I feel awful for you.

175
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,770
Cut the chase.

176
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,330
Beating around the bush makes me sick.

177
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,540
You know what I'm going to say.

178
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,760
Ye Qiu betrayed Jia Shi.

179
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,620
As his apprentice, you think Jia Shi won't kick you out?

180
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,970
If you were crawling your way out later,

181
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,290
no one would ever know I beat you up.

182
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,570
He has built another team.

183
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,890
He's going to revenge on Jia Shi!

184
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,210
So what?

185
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,290
Qiu Fei.

186
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,810
Ye Qiu has ruined your career in Jia Shi.

187
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,330
You can't join Team 1 as long as you're his apprentice.

188
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,800
Can you accept it?

189
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,570
Keep talking.

190
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,530
I can give you a chance.

191
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,130
It will dissociate you from him.

192
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,730
As long as you help us stop Ye Qiu from returning the league,

193
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,130
I'll recommend you to the boss tomorrow.

194
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,600
He didn't take you into account when he left Jia Shi.

195
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,020
Think about it.

196
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,650
He left like that?

197
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,330
But he meant everything for me...

198
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,610
...in Jia shi.

199
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,690
I told you I wouldn't go back.

200
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,410
If they want to divorce, fine.

201
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,530
They think it's shameful that their son is playing eSports.

202
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,130
Show your big brother some respect!

203
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,180
You don't want to see your younger brother, either.

204
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,810
As an overseas returnee,

205
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,890
you'll be very successful.

206
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,484
Just wait and inherit our parents' company.

207
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,250
Your brother will not seize power.

208
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,050
Say it again when you're capable of seizing power!

209
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,970
I'm a loser.

210
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,330
I'll never achieve anything.

211
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,130
Consider I'm not your family anymore!

212
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,170
Do you still have food?

213
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,730
Sorry. We are about to close.

214
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,730

219

Go after him!

220

Take your time.

221
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,700
Steady yourself.

No no no.

232

Da Jin, Da Jin.

Where did you go?

234
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,050
Everything is ready.

235
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,490
Wait for you to start Project BBQ!

236
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,890
What are you doing?

237
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,720
It's a crucial time!

238
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,970
Master! What about you?

239
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,860
You lost?

240
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,850
I won!

You won! You won!

00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,010
How amazing!

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,044
Amazing!

Good job!

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,970
Same time tomorrow.

246
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
OK. Thank you, Master.

247
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,010
Why do they call you "Master"?

248
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,720
- New here? - We could lose.

The elevator is at the door.

251
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,060
I'm new now. But I could be the captain next year.

252
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,250
You have good skills.

253
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,770
You should not work as a chef.

254
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,650
Stay with me.

255
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,810
You are the headwaiter here?

256
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,730
No wonder they all listen to you!

257
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,570
Wait. You did great when using Pseudo-join.

258
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,170
But others will dodge it when using Quick Standing.

259
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,290
What's your suggestion?

260
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,820
You're asking the right person.

261
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,330
Sky-strike him to the air first.

262
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,450
Then use Dragon Soaring.

263
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,610
Get the DPS first.

264
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,100
Let me tell you. When there's a chance, use Dragon Tooth.

265
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,650
Stiffness effect.

266
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,850
Wait. Speaking of the Circle Swing...

267
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,490
You used it too early.

268
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,250
Are you listening to me?

269
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,410
I'm the future captain of Jia Shi.

270
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,520

You don't believe me?

273
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,210
I didn't say it.

274
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:23,410
But Jia Shi values one's competence the most.

275
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,210
You'll have to prove yourself.

276
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,170
Then you can say that to me.

277
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,730
Say it again when you're capable of seizing power!

Chen Yehui didn't throw you out as if you were a psycho?

What a big heart he has!

Don't call me "psycho".

Agreed.

I'm the champion of Team 2.

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,490
Why would I do so?

313
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,330
You wanna be my master with your unpolished skills?

314
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,300
You wanna learn Pseudo-join from me last time, right?

315

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,860
I've told you I had nothing to do with the school incident.

375
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,290
I didn't start the fight!

376
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,515
Dad asks you to come back to make it clear...

377
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,040
I have nothing to say to him.

378
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,530
He always thinks I'm a loser, doesn't he?

379
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,450
He smashed my arcade game machine.

380
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,170
When I told him I was going to be an eSports player,

381
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,090
he even said I was a shame.

382
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,770
Don't say it to me.

383
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,330
Handle things by yourself.

384
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,810
I'm just telling you what Dad said.

385
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,586
If you don't come back, Dad will go find you.

386
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,330
Why?

387
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,210
Why would all of you want to control me?

388
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,050
Listen.

389
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,850
In about 2 years,

390
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,250
I'll make some achievement in Jia Shi.

391
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,010
I'll for sure get the championship in the Glory League.

392
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,090
Otherwise...

393
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,410

win this round first.

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,530
Qiu Fei is the most talented one among all.

He's tough and brave.

417
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,610
His style is much alike yours.

418
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm not as stupid.

419
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,340
If it were me, I'd break Zero Breakthrough's Ground Shaking Wave.

420
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,250
Sorry.

421
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,330

In the last round, Chen Yehui hit you with Frost Wave.

426

Why didn't you lose any HP?

What did you mean?

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,090
Please turn over your account card.

429
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,730
We suspect you were using tag-in services.

430
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,010
It'd injure the fairness of the game.

431
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,330
I have to check your account card.

432
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:38,970
To rival against him...

433
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,622
I didn't need to cheat.

434
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,690
He... was using tag-on services.

435
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,260
It's not true!

436
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,850
You set me up?

00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:03,013
Calm down!

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,760
Don't do it!

Calm down! What are you doing?

440

- Let go of me! - Calm down!

441
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,490
Now what? I was cheating, fine!

442
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,290
Throw me out!

443
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,730
Punish me!

444
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:24,930
So what? I'm a bad boy.

445
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,290
I haven't revenged enough.

446
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,570
What I want is expel Chen Yehui from Glory!

447
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,800
Glory is not your instrument of vengeance!

448
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,610
I don't care about all this.

449
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,973
What I do care is why you play Glory.

450
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,620
I want to show my dad.

451
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,250
I want to show you.

452
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,130
I want to show everyone that thinks I'd cheat and looks down on me!

453
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,530
If what you want is show to others,

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,170
you don't deserve to be part of Glory.

455
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,210
I won't throw you out.

456
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,370
You let yourself out.

457
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,693
Then tell me!

458
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,084
What should I do?

459
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,140
You could go on.

460
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,460
Or you could give up.

461
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,933
I don't even have a chance.

462
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,400
How could I go on?

463
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,050
You could because I'm your captain.

What you owe me is not just Glory.

468

Hui, Congrats! You've defeated Qiu Fei and joined Team 1.

469
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,490
Hui, will you live upstairs where Team 1 players live?

470
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,000
Yep.

471
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,210
I've heard they live in separate rooms.

472
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:14,890
Is it true?

473
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,650
Yep.

474
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:17,370
That's great!

475
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,170
OK. I know you'll miss me.

476
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,970
But we are still in the same building.

477
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,250
You can come visit me.

478
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:24,900
OK.

479
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,660
By the way, try your best.

480

You'll move upstairs one day.

481
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:29,970
Go for it.

482
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,610
Thank you!

483
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,450
We'll try our best.

484
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,370

You really hope Ye Qiu will be my enemy?

489
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,490
We shouldn't wait for Qiu Fei.

490
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,093
Maybe he's not coming.

491
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,010
Qiu Fei hasn't come. Cancel the plan.

492
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,320
It's meaningless.

493
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,490
You said...

In District 10.  His ID is Jun Moxiao.

498
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:22,800
Great.

499
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,910
You've made big progress during the half-year training.

500
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,680
None of your business.

501
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,050
Not good enough in predicting and judging the situation.

502
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,370
Saw me using Dragon Tooth, you shouldn't react with Chaser.

503
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,410
You've learned Vanishing Step, but it's not perfect.

504
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,690
That requires more experience.

505
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,355
Need more training and experience.

506
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:13,790
Good!

507
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,920
You've improved your Vanishing Step.

508
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:17,450
But did you miscount your Double Hit?

509
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,980
Are you done?

510
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,410
Since you have left Jia Shi,

511
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,680
save the crap for your new team players!

512
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,050
I never...

513
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,550
only looked you as a team player...

514
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,710
Then why did you desert from Jia Shi?

515
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,050
He gave up Jia Shi.

516
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,170
He also gave up everyone here, including you.

517
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,400
Even if we can understand what he's done,

518
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,250
what is he doing now?

519
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,390
He has betrayed Jia Shi.

521
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,346
He told us one thing before.

522
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,130
Glory should never be anyone's instrument of vengeance.

523
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,570
But he is taking advantage of Glory.

524
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,306
By establishing his own team, he's against Jia Shi everywhere.

525
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,570
He's in Xing Xin Net Cafe across the road.

We can go with you.

Won't you get tired for 10 more years?

You didn't mean it?

- Come and check! - Coming!

Just a sec.

Hurry up! I'm fighting against Boss!

I'm talking to you!

-Here you are. - Thanks!

548
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,097
You had a good life abroad.

Same old trick.

Speaking of the net manager...

554
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,666
I am one now.

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,570
It's not easy to save the ball...

559
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,706
If two balls in the same color are at the entrance,

560
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,730
you'll pot by pushing it with the ball behind.

561
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:44,390
But we have a difficult situation here.

562
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,890
Two balls do not belong to the same party.

563
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,250
If you want to pot...

564
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,622
you'll have to choose your own path.

565
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,980
I wouldn't join you if it was just pushing balls.

566
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,060
Look at the position.

567
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,730
If I can figure out my own path,

568
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,400
it'll be easy to save it.

569
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,810
You wanna try here?

570
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,140
Wanna stroke it with full strength?

571
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:18,530
Good plan!

572
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,330
They went different ways.

573
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,430
Everything in its place.

574
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,320
Good plan or bad...

575
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,777
Depends on where you aim.

576
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,490
Again.

577
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,650
Try here.

578
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,540
It's doesn't matter if you have a ball to push.

579
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,580
Focus on the present.

580
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,330
You'll see the future directions more clearly.

581
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,260
What...

582
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,173
What are your future directions?

583
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:56,430
I...

584
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,210
I just want to play billiards for now.

585
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:10,830
That's all I want, too.

586
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,770
Why are you working as a net manager in such a place?

587
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,850
If you want to start over,

588
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,380
you can pick any team.

589
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,170
Because there are people who love Glory.

590
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,130
Glory is their whole world.

591
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,000
What does this have to do with you?

592
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,980
I'm just one of them.

593
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,915
- We've passed! - Made it!

594
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:37,710
Great!

595
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:38,450
Good job!

596
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:39,480
Not easy!

597
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,777
Don't forget.

598
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:44,790
You were one of them before.

599
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,260
Captain...
