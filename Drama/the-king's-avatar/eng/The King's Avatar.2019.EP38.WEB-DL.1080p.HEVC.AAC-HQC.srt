= Xing Xin =

4
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:41,995
Leaping onto the wall,  Qiao launches a counterattack...

5
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,504
while Xiao is alternating his skill strikes.

6
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,765
Playing a Ghost who relies on tactics,

7
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:50,098
the choice of skills and its casting time are important.

8
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:05,918
But Arrays of Ice and Plague may not enough to turn the tide.

9
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,918
He should use more Arrays of Ghosts...

10
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,560
and cause high damage to enemy by the Feast of Ghosts.

11
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,677
What happened?

12
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,922
Why did Xiao rush in the opposite direction?

13
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,342
Tell us why, Captain Yu.

14
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,937
Director, please replay these frames.

15
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,269
Yeah, it's here.

16
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,022
Xiao was shooting with his rifle at the same direction,

17
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:42,276
then hit the air with his Mechanical Punch.

18
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,275
But nobody was here, Captain Yu.

19
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,013
Let's see from Xiao's view.

20
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:48,948
What...

21
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,551
Shaotian, have you seen it?

22
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,582
It must be an afterimage that looks very real.

23
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:00,725
It's not surprising that Xiao mistook it for Qiao.

24
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,955
But I think it must be a coincidence,

25
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:05,185
because a Ghost has no skill creating an afterimage.

26
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,494
So Xiao was just unlucky and fell into the trap for no reason.

27
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:15,854
I don't think so.

28
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,425
The afterimage just appeared in a right place at a right time.

29
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,781
It was Visual Deception.

30
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,059
Visual Deception?

31
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,296
What the hell is it?

32
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,662
These frames just frightened me.

33
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,399
Why was it so weird?

34
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:40,795
I don't know.

35
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,406
Ask Qiao by yourself when he comes back.

36
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,826
You don't know it?

37
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,809
You know everything on Glory, don't you?

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,206
You said that these kids could easily surpass us.

39
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,125
Qiao just did something amazing.

40
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,887
He's invented a new tactic for the Ghost.

41
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:02,054
Wei,

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,625
Rookies can't be underestimated.

43
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,018
The cooling time for his skill attack will be over.

44
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:32,493
My last chance.

45
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:34,881
= Equipment, Rucksack =

46
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,989
Wait! Xiao has cast the Mechanical Tracking before dying,

47
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,592
which is dodged by Qiao.

48
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,828
But Xiao's Bounding Mines are triggered.

49
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,503
When did he plant them? Wonderful!
= A draw =

50
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,898
This was an awesome game in the Arena Contest.

51
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,985
Jia Shi has eliminated another opponent. Congratulations.

52
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,001
Meanwhile, Xing Xin finally erased Jia Shi's best player.

53
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,294
Xiao fought back in despair,

54
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:22,230
so they both died.

55
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,261
But Xiao has eliminated three opponents.

56
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:27,516
- Long Live Captain Xiao! - You said you'd be low-keyed.

57
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,278
Doesn't matter. It's dark here.

58
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,523
= A Draw =

59
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,610
Thank you, sir.

60
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:06,733
Yifan has changed a lot.

61
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:09,534
He used to regard everyone as his teacher,

62
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,105
and always asked us for help.

63
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,803
Now he has invented a new tactic,

64
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,858
and scored a key point for his team.

65
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:20,151
In Yifan's eyes,

66
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,833
it can't be more normal.

67
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,873
Every game and every tactic all make him to enjoy Glory.

68
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:31,908
Xing Xin is really a miraculous team.

69
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,296
I don't think it's miraculous.

70
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,511
Every day, he practices 3 extra hours.

71
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:38,772
In every hour, he plays 2 extra games.

72
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,582
In every game, he tries to use a different tactic.

73
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:43,622
So...

74
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:45,914
Yifan is making progress,

75
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,811
but we're marking time.

76
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,398
Our captain said...

77
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,516
in eSports, there would never be a successive winner...

78
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,317
but people who never stop.

79
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:57,397
Do you mean we should go back to practice?

80
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,325
Because of Qiao's extraordinary performance,

81
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,640
Xing Xin has eliminated Xiao with 3 players...

82
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,014
- You're great! - Awesome!

83
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,165
Who will be sent from both sides to next game?

84
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,895
Will Xing Xin show its trump card?

85
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,919
We're looking forward to it.

86
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,085
Next game will be the match point of the Arena Contest.
= Jia Shi vs Xing Xin =

87
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,489
Can Xing Xin turn the tide?

88
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,956
The 4th player from Xing Xin is Ye Qiu,

89
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,488
former captain of Jia Shi,

90
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,806
and the leader of the first champion team in Glory's history.

91
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,735
The fateful game is about to begin.

92
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,536
- Awesome! - Captain.

93
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:31,226
- You can do it! - Captain! Captain!

94
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,289
- We'll win!  -  We'll win!

95
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:36,932
You can do it...

96
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,559
Captain, there is something on your hair.

97
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:42,629
Let your hair down!

98
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,573
I see, let my hair down.

99
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,461
- Come on, Captain. - You can do it.

100
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,707
The player from Jia Shi is...

101
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,039
Qiu Fei.

102
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,047
- It's him. - He may be not well known by everyone here.

103
00:07:57,126 --> 00:08:01,126
Qiu has been promoted from Jia Shi's second team this season.

104
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,054
What's interesting is that Ye used to be Qiu's teacher.

105
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:09,378
It means this will be a wonderful teacher-pupil fight.

106
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:15,139
Captain Yu, do you think whether Qiu can beat Ye today?

107
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:19,154
To beat a Freelancer, a Battlemage has to keep up with his speed.

108
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,280
Freelancer is very quick, but Battlemage...

109
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,494
Ye, I tell you this is the final.

110
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,327
You have to do your best to beat your pupil.

111
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,280
If you throw the game today, you'll cry tomorrow.

112
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:30,748
You have to beat... What?

113
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,628
Your advice may not be heard.

114
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,652
I just want to tell him.

115
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,087
= The 9th Challenge of Glory =

116
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:58,611
Everyone, Ye and Qiu are sitting down.

117
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,412
Their characters enter the map. The game is kicking off.

118
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:05,126
Both players are familiar with each other's style and details.

119
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,927
The game would go straight to the point without probing process.

120
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,204
Ye Qiu, my master.

121
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:12,299
What are you thinking?

122
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,323
How to defeat you.

123
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,053
Immodest.

124
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:20,187
Are you overjoyed to your first formal game?

125
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:23,980
Shall I let you hit me first? So you won't cry later.

126
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,678
Mr.Ye from Xing Xin,

127
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:29,305
your rubbish is useless for me.

128
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,384
Still an unpleasant kid.

129
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,605
As Captain Yu expected,

130
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,160
both of them rush directly to each other without any probing.

131
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,239
Because Jia Shi has 2 more players than Xing Xin,

132
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,024
Ye's task is very arduous.

133
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,508
He has to eliminate as many opponents as he could,

134
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,810
or Xing Xin is likely to lose the Arena Contest.

135
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:50,110
Shattering Palm-attack. Very fluent.

136
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,093
This is a basic connection between attacks.

137
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:55,109
But it's not easy to make a smooth connection like this.

138
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,209
Combat Form is launching Destroying the World,

139
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,058
and has precisely intercepted Ye's attack.

140
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:28,849
- Good job. - Awesome.

141
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:34,480
CF's control over the fight is beyond our imagination.

142
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,623
He is good at it.

143
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,734
Even the Master of Glory has no chance to escape now,

144
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,210
and has to wait passively.

145
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:42,566
...19,20,21

146
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,051
Qiu has given Ye 21 successive hits.

147
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,613
Both are attacking. Ye has disappeared.

148
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,438
Without target, Qiu is confused now.

149
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,622
But he is cautious and doesn't move around.

150
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,645
Where will Ye pop out from?

151
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:20,494
From the ground.

152
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:21,930
Ninja's Burrowing.

153
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,335
You let me see your weakness when you were hitting me.

154
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,999
You're not the guy who can erase me with one blow.

155
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,955
- Ye's Dragon Tooth repels Qiu's attack. - Too slow.

156
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,534
Impossible. With same DT, why could yours repel me?

157
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,272
Don't blink and take a good look.

158
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:45,430
Ye's DT strikes Qiao again.

159
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,231
Attacks are broken. Connect again.

160
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,786
Ye has controlled the fight completely.

161
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,254
Now it becomes the skill show of Freelancer.

162
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,483
In the air, Qiu can't escape.

163
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:58,046
Ye's Umbrella transforming and skill attacking are perfect.

164
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,585
= 15, 16 successive attacks =

165
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:04,839
At the middle of the DT attack,

166
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,035
he cancels the skill and casts it again.

167
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,828
The DT launched later strikes its target first.

168
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,772
Now, do you understand it?

169
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,263
20, 21...

170
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,167
The attacks are going on. 26, the last strike.

171
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,714
With 26 successive attacks, Ye has erased CF.

172
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,754
Congratulations to Ye. He has won the game.

173
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,206
Xing Xin has won another match.

174
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,603
Now it's 4:6 and Jia Shi is ahead for the time being.

175
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,742
If you love Glory,

176
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,749

177
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,361
love everything it brings you.

178
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,122
Whether it's pain, difficulty or sadness.

179
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,741
I can't be responsible for your life,

but I'd like to be...

= Ye Qiu =

181
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,271
= I have owed Qiu Fei a glory =
= Ye Qiu =

182
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,431
one of your choices.
= Blowing Wind =

183
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:52,089
= Blowing Wind =

184
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,707
Because our glory lies...

185
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:57,009
where our swords are pointing.

186
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,084
Thank you.
= Combat Form: Thanks. =

187
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:04,846
= Combat Form: Thanks. =

188
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:22,571
Good boy.

189
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,161
Nothing to tell me?

190
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,780
It's your turn.

191
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,248
What did you tell Su Mucheng just now?

192
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,089
Come on, you have to go.

193
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,922
Are you afraid you'll be defeated?

194
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,946
I'm not you!

195
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,715
You were beaten by Ye and decreased half of his Hit Points.

196
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,968
It's not honorable for me to defeat half of him.

197
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,261
But can you defeat half of him?

198
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,840
You'll see how I eliminate your teacher.

199
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,308
The 3rd player from Jia Shi is Captain Sun Xiang.

200
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,521
This is the first duel between two captains of Jia Shi.

201
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,132
The fight between the old and new master could be much fiercer.

202
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:11,219
Who will win? Let's wait and see.

203
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:12,861
In the 5th game,
= The 9th Challenge of Glory =

204
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,750
Sun, Jia Shi's Captain, will fight against Ye, Xing Xin's leader.

205
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,766
This is a fight between the new and old captains.

206
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,376
The character, Leaf of Autumn,

207
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:24,528
which used to be played by Ye for years,

208
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:27,385
now is played by Sun, is the opponent of Ye today.

209
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,542
I don't know how Mr. Ye's feeling now.

210
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,144
To fight against his former closest comrade,

211
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,740
what will he do?

212
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,430
We needn't probe each other.

213
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,263
Let's fight directly in the square.

214
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:40,668
A fight without a trick?

215
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,167
OK.

216
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,762
Let's fight directly.

217
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:45,754
The game begins.

218
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,333
Without any tactical movement,

219
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,435
Sun is rushing to the center of the map.

220
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,585
Fighting against Ye Qiu using LOA in formal contest,

221
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,505
is likely something he has been yearning.

222
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,211
- But Ye is approaching in a roundabout way. - Where are you?

223
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,131
No rush. I want to increase my HP.

224
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,822
Now, Ye's HP is lower,

225
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:04,695
so he doesn't want to fight fiercely at first.

226
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,536
What is it? Is Ye Qiu healing himself?

227
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,972
Increasing his HP before the duel,

228
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:14,345
Ye has gone too far.

229
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:16,638
Sorry.

230
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,066
Freelancer only has the ability to heal himself.

231
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,590
Can I take some time to do it?

232
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:21,764
I'll wait for you.

233
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,929
Cooling time will be longer because my skill level is lower.

234
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,238
Then I have to tell you,

235
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,356
how can you fight against me...

236
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,784
if you use all your Mana Points to heal?

237
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,046
Ordinary chopping?

238
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,173
You're right.

239
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:42,672
I’ve got only half MP.

240
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:44,465
Increase it.

241
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,099
Is Ye increasing his MP? That's over the line.

242
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:50,464
- Nobody will stop him? - What is Sun doing?

243
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,106
- Why isn't he attacking? - Attack him.

244
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:58,589
The captain is a real freelancer.

245
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,366
Brilliant tactic.

246
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,016
Unusual.

247
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,281
Shameless.

248
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,463
He deserves to be called Master.

249
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:18,272
Come on, Jia Shi! Come on, Jia Shi...

250
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:19,486
Now!

251
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:24,993
Long live Xing Xin! Long live Xing Xin! ...

252
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,668
OK, let's begin.

253
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,913
Is 70% enough for you?

254
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,762
It's not appropriate to keep you waiting for a long time.

255
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,222
In addition, 70% is enough to beat you.

256
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,530
I can't beat you embarrassingly easily.

257
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,553
That's what I want to tell you.

258
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,695
Are you giving me a sneak attack?

259
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,294
Dragon out of Sea misses hitting Ye.

260
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,548
Sun launches a lethal attack,

261
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:12,088
but unfortunately, it is dodged by Ye.

262
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,889
Only Ye Qiu can dodge the attack with his precise Z-movement.

263
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,491
Chaser attack?

264
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:22,641
These Chaser attacks are not lethal. They're useless.

265
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,562
It's Sun's tactic.

266
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,625
He didn't mean to show off his lethal skill, DOOS.

267
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,641
He wanted to cover the tracks of Chaser with the wave effect,

268
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,316
so our captain can't dodge his attack.

269
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:36,149
Using the lethal skill as a cover, attack with an ordinary one.

270
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,934
He's really getting smarter.

271
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:41,125
After a round of attacks, nobody can get the upper hand.

272
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,450
Another close combat.

273
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,997
Debris has triggered Landslide and its attack range is extended.

274
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,879
Ye is hit.

275
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:48,751
It seems that Ye is still a bit strange to LOA,

276
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,989
which is level 75 now.

277
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,211
I wonder how much advantage Sun can take from here.

278
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,791
You'll feel worse.

279
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,001
The speed of Sun's spear has been greatly improved...

280
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,659
when the weapon reaches level 75.

281
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,048
LOA's attacking speed...

282
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:22,017
now can catch up with the skill speed of Freelance,

283
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,023
It seems, besides the character's promotion,

284
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,245
Sun has become stronger.

285
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,999
The speed of the fight is getting faster.

286
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,261
This is actually an Action per Minute contest .

287
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:49,985
Attacking and defending, their APMs become faster and faster.

288
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,191
Have they reached their peak values of APM?

289
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,070
Our captain's APM is so fast.

290
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,467
Ye has no lethal skill now.

291
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,601
Captain shouldn't give up his advantage...

292
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,165
and contest APM with the Freelancer.

293
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:03,298
He is not acting on impulse.

294
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,822
He believes he can beat Ye in this way.

295
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,957
He's just carrying out his tactic.

296
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,988
Once the APM reaches the peak value, you'll become slower.

297
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:17,940
If he plays too fast now, how could he cope with the next game?

298
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,637
What if he hasn't peaked yet?

299
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,836
- Hasn't peaked yet? - You don't know...

300
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:31,113
how much effort Sun has put into preparing for this game?

301
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,349
Shattering Palm-attack. Ye is hit.

302
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,880
What problem?

303
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:44,642
It was obvious Ye could dodge the Palm-attack. Why did he fail?

304
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,427
He could have dodged it, but he didn't expect it.

305
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,212
Jia Shi has upgraded the equipment of LOA for the final game.

306
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:56,314
His striking range, speed, attack and defense are all improved.

307
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,179
That means Ye in fact doesn't know the present LOA at all.

308
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,209
It's very unfortunate for Ye.

309
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:08,446
Sir, why are you so weak now?

310
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:11,977
In this way, how can you beat me embarrassingly easily?

311
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,224
LOA has been attacking Ye Qiu,

312
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,979
who seems to be a little overwhelmed by his opponent's attack.

313
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,003
In this way, Ye will lose the game.

314
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,742
Now Ye's HP is very low,

315
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,837
and he can't make any counterattack.

316
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,122
Ye is in danger.

317
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,315
Just like a non-player character,

318
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,855
you should trigger Escaping when your HP decreases to 10%.

319
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,823
Bleeding Escaping?

320
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:41,267
Good idea.

321
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,670
It's a golden opportunity, I can't let you down.

322
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,272
Gatling Gun is shooting and forcing Sun to dodge.

323
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,668
Dodging the shooting, Sun tries to approach Ye's back.

324
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,604
Unfortunately, he is hit by a flying shuriken.

325
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,485
When did Ye throw the shuriken?

326
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:11,652
A flying shuriken.

327
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,676
Why didn't I just notice it?

328
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:30,901
My God!

329
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:34,440
What happened? Ye has turned the tables.

330
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:37,130
Your new equipment made a lot of troubles for me.

331
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:40,661
But a trouble doesn't mean it must be a bad thing, does it?

332
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,065
Your moving speed has increased by 3.

333
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:46,311
Attack range has increased by 5.

334
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,612
Physical resistance has increased by about 200.

335
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,691
Stiffness time has decreased by 0.01 sec.

336
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,195
Pretending to be weak, you're just looking for my weakness.

337
00:21:58,664 --> 00:21:59,878
I take back what I said.

338
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,949
It's really difficult to beat you, Sun Xiang.

339
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:04,314
But, from now on,

340
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,384
you'll have no chance.

341
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,391
Wonderful! it's a fight between gods.

342
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,017
Sun is launching Dragon Soaring, a decisive attack.

343
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,920
Ye has dodged it. Will the dragon's head raise?

344
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:23,243
Its head is turning!

345
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,306
Ye has been hit by the new attack from DS, Dragon Head Turning.

346
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,369
Jia Shi is really a top team.

347
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:31,305
It represents the highest level of Battlemage in Glory.

348
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:34,296
Captain, well done!

349
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,669
Game over.

350
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,851
Sun Xiang seized the last chance to...

351
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,391
= Mucheng =

352
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,888
- Come on! - Come on!

353
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:53,800
Ye Xiu.

354
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,902
What? The winner is Ye Qiu!

355
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,227
It's Ye who has finally won.

356
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:01,338
The result of the game was entirely unexpected.

357
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,798
Let's take a look at what happened.

358
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:08,321
Using the grabbing function of DS, Ye conveyed himself to Sun,

359
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,384
and gave Sun a Sky-strike when he was in the time of stiffness.

360
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,534
To be precise, just using his Blocking below level 20,

361
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,145
Ye took back his 0.03% HP.

362
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:21,049
With this 0.03% HP, he won the game.

363
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:23,390
It's really incredible.

364
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,318
It's really a wonderful game.

365
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:29,342
The 0.03% HP has determined the result of the game.

366
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,540
I declare that the winner of the game is Ye Qiu.

367
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,316
- Master! - Awesome!

368
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,474
Keep training, and keep breaking through your own limits.

369
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,497
Sun Xiang has become a real master now.

370
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,781
This time, I'm not only gonna beat Ye Qiu,

371
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,605
but tell everyone that I'm not relying on LOA.

372
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:11,829
Even if we're on the same starting line,

373
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,382
I'll finally win.

374
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:45,708
Jia Shi will win! Jia Shi will win! ...

375
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,384
I said you shouldn't be too proud.

376
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:04,312
Now LOA has lost to him.

377
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:08,464
Not LOA.

378
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:10,384
I've lost to him.

379
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,423
Today, I've realized...

380
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,272
I can't be made great by a character,

381
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:21,089
Instead, I should make the character great.

382
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,986
He's really awesome.

383
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:25,501
Of course.

384
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:27,786
Someday,

385
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,611
let's beat him.

386
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,723
Ye, why are you leaving? You've still got 0.03% HP.

387
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,913
Increase it. Anyway, you're shameless,
= Ye Qiu has given up the game. =

388
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:43,437
just do it again.

389
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:46,332
Or does it mean you want to give your rookies a chance?

390
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,483
Good job, Captain.

391
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:51,062
Because of his HP, Ye has given up the next game.

392
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:53,832
His substitute is Wei Chen, a newcomer.

393
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:54,958
Captain Wei!

394
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,791
He can't be called a newcomer. He's about over thirty, isn't he?

395
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,496
You were heard, bastard.

396
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,019
A newcomer doesn't mean a young guy.

397
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,542
And as far as the game is concerned, it's really new for you.

398
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,561
Cut your crap!

399
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:17,819
Now, give it up for Shen Jian from Jia Shi.

400
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,375
- Come on! - OK.

401
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:27,295
Shen Jian! Shen Jian! ...

402
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:30,796
Warm up?

403
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,010
For beating him?

404
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,295
I needn't warm up.

405
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll beat him. I promise.

406
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:41,755
ASAP.

407
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,318
In the 6th game,

408
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:47,571
the last player from Xing Xin is Wei Chen,

409
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:48,960
the Warlock Windward Formation.

410
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:51,293
The player from Jia Shi is Shen Jian,

411
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:52,729
the Striker Successive Strikes,

412
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:56,140
Will the veteran Wei beat two players and turn the tables?

413
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:57,427
Let's wait and see.

414
00:27:57,498 --> 00:28:00,140
Both characters have entered the map. The game begins.

415
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:04,870
For a Warlock, controlling and using the shooting distance...

416
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,829
is key to fight against a Striker.

417
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,392
Captain Wei knows Warlock inside out.

418
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,232
For a Striker, only by finding a chance to attack at close range,

419
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,693
can he defeat the warlock.

420
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,645
As expected, SS is rushing toward WF at first.

421
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,978
WF uses Magic Missile to interrupt him.

422
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,017
SS is approaching.

423
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,192
Jumping back quickly, WF locks him with Six-light Prison.

424
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:24,716
SS's HP is decreasing dramatically.

425
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,851
Though Wei is older, his attack is precise.

426
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,763
We all know the veteran Wei is good at draining his opponent.

427
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,667
But in this game, he is fighting quickly.

428
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:53,392
Bao Zi.

429
00:28:58,316 --> 00:28:59,164
What happened...

430
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:01,141
with Wei's hand?

431
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,885
Hand? Nothing happened.

432
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:09,258
Look, his Light-prison was cast precisely and securely, right?

433
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,514
Though his HP is low, SS is fighting aggressively.

434
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:22,467
He's looking for the chance to decrease WF's HP.

435
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:25,046
Approaching again. WF defends with Magic Mirror.

436
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:28,125
SS's High Kicking has hit WF again.

437
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,878
With little HP, SS is still rushing.

438
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:33,076
WF's Magic Missile. Good.

439
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,711
SS is dead.

440
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:38,812
= Xing Xin =

441
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,447
Xing Xin has won another game.

442
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:41,923
The veteran Wei is still powerful.

443
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,772
He has scored two points cleanly for Xing Xin.

444
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:47,335
See? He has won, hasn't he?

445
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:49,993
Nothing is wrong with Captain Wei's hand.

446
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:53,064
He can even beat three opponents. Trust him.

447
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:56,317
I have to admire Captain Wei for his ability.

448
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,340
Still powerful.

449
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,950
Facing the healthy opponents,

450
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:03,435
can he beat two of them and narrow the scoring gap with Jia Shi?

451
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,411
Let Wei abandon it.

452
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,712
Why? He has won.

453
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,014
How important are the hands of a player?

454
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,196
You should know it.

455
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,775
If he doesn't stop now,

456
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,512
his entire career could be ruined.

457
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:32,304
OK.

458
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:34,168
You're right.

459
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:36,469
Captain Wei...

460
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:38,936
His hand is still injured.

461
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:53,814
Wei's hand has never been completely healed...

462
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,456
since it was hurt when fighting against Zhu Xian.

463
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:01,480
The doctor said he had to rest for a period before competing.

464
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:04,115
Ignoring it, Wei was injected with anesthetic before the game,

465
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,344
and told me to shut up.

466
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,130
Captain Wei said that Xing Xin needed his help.

467
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,106
So he had to compete in the game and had to win it.

468
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:16,439
Because...

469
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,518
it could probably be his last game.

470
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,478
Either living with a regret,

471
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:25,382
or making a last attempt,

472
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:28,286
he has actually made the choice...

473
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,619
since the day he joined Xing Xin.

474
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:37,722
Wei.

475
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,341
Until we take the championship,

476
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,856
there'll be no last game.

477
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:47,386
In the last Arena game, the player from Jia Shi is Su Mucheng.

478
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:50,839
The best Launcher in League vs. the first Master.

479
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:53,616
That'll be a fight between magic and gunpowder.

480
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:58,575
Who will win the Arena Contest? This game will tell us.

481
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:03,615
Just a provisional tactical change. It's normal.

482
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,639
Don't be too surprised.

483
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:11,812
Wearing Jia Shi's uniform and sitting in its bench,

484
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:17,113
it means you're ready to do your best for Jia Shi.

485
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,044
Relax.

486
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,317
Mr.Tao.

487
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,285
You're putting Mucheng in a dilemma.

488
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,142
You can't send her in the last and sensitive game.

489
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:44,967
She would be suspected of having thrown the game,

490
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:46,395
even if she hasn't.

491
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:49,021
If she doesn't want to be suspected,

492
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:50,910
she'll do her best.

493
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:54,210
But in the competition,

494
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:59,886
any mistake you make would be interpreted as throwing the game.

495
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,909
She has only one choice:

496
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:05,766
she has to win.

497
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:08,440
Isn't it exactly what we want?
