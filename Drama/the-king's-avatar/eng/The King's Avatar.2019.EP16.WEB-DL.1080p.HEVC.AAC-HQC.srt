= Welcome Jun Mo Xiao to the Field of God =

2
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:09,096
I hope one day

3
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,816
A thousand-machine umbrella could be the top weapon in Glory

4
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:48,336
Got nothing better to do?

5
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,576
Sit around waiting for me?

6
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,656
I am on a full schedule ok?

7
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,336
Take that! Take that! Take that!

8
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,776
Accompany your captain to test the weapon?

9
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,056
Actually it's me to accompany Shaotian.

10
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:49,327
Come on,

11
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:52,456
isn't the welcoming ceremony too solemn?

12
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,376
Welcome? You are overthinking.

13
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,536
After admitting retirement is your own choice,

14
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,976
how could you expect someone lined up to welcome you?

15
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,336
Step aside. Step aside. Step aside.

16
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,376
I should be the first

17
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,656
to fight him.

18
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:14,256
Ye, I have a question.

19
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:15,176
Is it the final form

20
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,696
of your thousand-change umbrella?

21
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:17,536
Any new play?

22
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,016
Show me.

23
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,216
How could I let you guys see through me?

24
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:23,696
Class is over. Gotta go.

25
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,656
We haven't got down to business.

26
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,296
So many people are waiting for your answer.

27
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,616
You can't leave like that.

28
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:30,656
What's the real point of your statement?

29
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:31,416
Make it clear.

30
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,136
There's nothing to say.

31
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,656
I just don't want to let my old friend down.

32
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:41,496
Thanks for coming, guys.

33
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,176
It's time to leave.

34
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:45,736
With so many masters crowded in the Field of God,

35
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,416
a riot could be caused.

36
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:50,536
Someday we will meet at the battlefield.

37
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,016
Ye, you will come back, right?

38
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,416
Right? Right? Right? Ye!

39
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:58,856
That's my opponent.

40
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:09,576
Welcome back to the Field of God.

41
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,576
May Glory be with you.

42
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,216
May Glory be with you.

43
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:14,976
Welcome back to the Field of God.

44
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,136
May Glory be with you.

45
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:20,096
May Glory be with you.

46
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:40,096
I will be back. Won't be long.

47
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,936
Why did him return good for evil?

48
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:08,256
Let me tell you,

49
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,176
to observe a master,

50
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:10,576
you can't just focus on his bright image.

51
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:12,096
Underneath it,

52
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,056
could be an ugly heart.

53
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:17,296
What does he plan to do?

54
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,256
After leaving the old team,

55
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:20,856
he must join a new one,

56
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:21,816
finding a better choice.

57
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:27,376
But his best choice is himself.

58
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,856
Baozi, time to work.

59
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,336
Why do you take these things out?

60
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:34,646
Haven't you seen

61
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,456
our boss is sad for the unethical decision

62
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:37,416
that Ye Qiu made?

63
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:42,056
He plans to build his own team!

64
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:44,296
You want to build your own team!

65
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,096
Betray your team! Betray your fans!

66
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,016
Now even build your own team!

67
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:55,096
Boss, such a scum should be broken into pieces.

68
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:56,856
What are you doing?

69
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:58,896
No need to say. I get you.

70
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,536
I will throw it.

71
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:01,816
Out of sight, out of mind.

72
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,976
Do you know who is Ye Qiu?

73
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,576
Ye Qiu is of course no one else but Ye Qiu.

74
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,056
Don't tell me he is Ye Xiu.

75
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,776
Cap!

76
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:24,576
To observe a master,

77
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:27,176
you can't just focus on his bright image.

78
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,656
Underneath it,

79
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,936
coule be a brighter heart.

80
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:36,256
How dare a noob like me,

81
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,936
curse our cap,

82
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,376
say bad things about our cap...

83
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:41,896
It should be me

84
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,816
to be broken into pieces.

85
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,576
What can I do for him?

86
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:51,287
To be his team member?

87
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,336
Ahh I can be his boss.

88
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,256
Boss...

89
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,376
I think it's quite likely.

90
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,936
No, it's unlikely.

91
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:07,816
How could he

92
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,176
allow me to be his boss?

93
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,287
likely...

94
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,176
Still unlikely.

95
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,656
Shakespear Bao!

96
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,376
Boss, my bad!

97
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:23,336
Listen,

98
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,256
Your salary of this month, next month,

99
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,776
tll the end of this year is gone!

100
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,016
The photo is ready.

101
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:41,256
Let me see.

102
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,296
Manly style, you like it?

103
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,816
How about elegant style?

104
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,456
That's not me.

105
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,176
Of course it's you.

106
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,736
The teenager version.

107
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:01,647
How about this one?

108
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:03,896
Cute style.

109
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,616
Any other choices?

110
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,776
Emm...I pick the cute one.

111
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:17,776
So this one will be submitted.

112
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,376
For the Challenge, it's better to use the formal one.

113
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,256
So can we...

114
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:24,736
dispose of the left?

115
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,456
Whatever floats your boat.

116
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,656
I have a bunch at home anyway.

117
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:31,976
Whenever I need these photos,

118
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,576
I can print more.

119
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,336
There won't be such need.

120
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:37,576
Of course there is.

121
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:41,576
For example, when I want to tease you, satirize you,

122
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,936
and get back at you.

123
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:51,416
To get back to the League, a team is necessary.

124
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,936
To build a team, a guild is necessary.

125
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:56,056
To create a guild, enough members are necessary.

126
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:57,896
Are you sure you can handle all the stuff?

127
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,016
Not sure.

128
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,216
So?

129
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,216
I need a boss.

130
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,216
Have you found one?

131
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,696
I think I have a choice.

132
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,336
What advantages does this person have?

133
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:09,416
Been a boss before.

134
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:11,576
It doesn't count.

135
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:12,696
Practice makes perfect.

136
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,376
Have you asked this person?

137
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,776
Same position, same job,

138
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:17,696
of her interst.

139
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,256
There is no reason to say no.

140
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,056
Do you know what you look like now?

141
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:23,696
Blindly optimistic.

142
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,016
Daydreaming.

143
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:31,456
Ye Xiu,

144
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,656
a new year,

145
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,536
means a new start for both of us.

146
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,096
Look!

147
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,656
The world agrees with me.

148
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:54,456
New year, new start.

149
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:29,096
I am worn out.

150
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,376
Finally, the training is over.

151
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,816
We can have a rest now.

152
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,136
How do you feel recently?

153
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:35,696
Not bad.

154
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,416
Two glasses of juice, please.

155
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:40,776
Wei Cao Team is recruiting.

156
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,576
Yi Fan, the whole training is coming to the end.

157
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:46,056
Are you going back to Wei Cao?

158
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:52,816
I want to take more practice.

159
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,816
Yifan didn't attent

160
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,376
the test of our training camp at all.

161
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,576
Obviously my test matters more.

162
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,256
What did he get?

163
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,656
Below zero for Assassin and zero for Ghostblade.

164
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:18,936
Just zero.

165
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:20,776
Both of us,

166
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,896
also started from zero.

167
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,896
Zero is a new start.

168
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,176
That's why today you come to me.

169
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,376
Do you want Yifan to join you?

170
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,176
The wild flowers are so dazzling

171
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,496
that exactly blind your uneven eyes.

172
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,376
I will never pick the wrong flowers,

173
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,336
or wrong team members.

174
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:51,736
But still thank you,

175
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,776
for helping Yifan find his way.

176
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,896
It's easy to know where to go but hard to get to the end.

177
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:05,056
I will take care of it.

178
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:09,896
It's hard to get back to the League.

179
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,336
How about joining Wei Cao Team?

180
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,056
No problem, as long as I take the position of captain.

181
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:17,576
No problem,

182
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,656
as long as you switch from freelancer to Mage.

183
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:24,856
Nah, I am not a fan of WEICAO GREEN.

184
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,896
Don't tell me you are still into JIASHI RED.

185
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:29,336
I want my own colour.

186
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:31,296
What's your plan?

187
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:32,656
I already told you.

188
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,456
I am going to be a captain.

189
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:35,656
Of which team?

190
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,016
I will build my own team.

191
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,096
A team full of newbies... It's difficult to lead.

192
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:44,576
Easy tasks are never in my list.

193
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:49,176
That's right. You are already aged.

194
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,216
It's time for you to train your successors.

195
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,136
Don't worry,

196
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,656
retirement is close to you, too.

197
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,536
Senior first.

198
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:03,536
Before that, I will nail this competition.

199
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,736
No need.

200
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,096
Someday, the newbies will surpass all of us.

201
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,536
Newbies are the future of Glory.

202
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:17,376
Now I am curious about yours.

203
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,216
Okay,

204
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:21,256
let me show you

205
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:23,216
my place.

206
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,576
I don't like this interview to Jessie Wang.

207
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,176
Too official.

208
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:32,256
No point.

209
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,816
He said the goal of Wei Cao is to be the winner.

210
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:38,216
But it's same to all.

211
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:40,576
You make a good point.

212
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:41,856
Right?

213
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,816
You two look same.

214
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:58,336
Don't tell me...

215
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,456
This is the captain of Wei Cao Team,

216
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,616
Jessie Wang.

217
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,056
This is our...

218
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,296
Hi, I am the boss of this internet cafe,

219
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,216
Chen Guo.

220
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,456
How are you?

221
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,736
Our boss is just too friendly.

222
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:14,496
You will get used to it.

223
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,536
I will reflect on

224
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:19,176
what you just mentioned.

225
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,896
This is Tang Rou,

226
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,296
the owner of Han Yan Rou.

227
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:28,096
Your techniques are close to Ye Qiu's.

228
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:30,976
I am flattered.

229
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,016
But I am me and nobody else.

230
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,496
Let's go.

231
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:38,136
Have a look.

232
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,456
Tang, I think we should change the name

233
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:48,736
of our internet cafe.

234
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:50,336
Change to what?

235
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,536
the Field of God.

236
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,736
Cap Jessie already drop by,

237
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,616
then other masters will come here soon.

238
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:09,416
It seems they are old friends.

239
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:21,856
Could our cap be dragged to

240
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,696
Wei Cao Team?

241
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:30,016
No way! I need to stay around.

242
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,056
Ready to act your part?

243
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:34,176
I'll try.

244
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:39,976
Come here.

245
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:50,576
So this is the place you mentioned.

246
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:52,536
Right.

247
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,176
Everything is ready except the east wind.

248
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:56,096
What east wind?

249
00:16:58,376 --> 00:16:59,696
A capable boss.

250
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,096
It is hard to find a good one.

251
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:03,416
There is huge risk to build a new team.

252
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:04,576
I suggest you

253
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,096
give up this idea.

254
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,096
As I said,

255
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:08,936
easy tasks are never in my list.

256
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,256
Come on, join our Wei Cao Team.

257
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:12,936
It's impossible to be a captain,

258
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:14,616
but chances are to be placed in the starting lineups.

259
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:15,616
How about that?

260
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:16,496
I will think about it.

261
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:19,896
Your age is an issue.

262
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:21,336
Only a few years left for you.

263
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:23,296
Why do you make yourself overloaded

264
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,416
to build a new team?

265
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:29,536
I will think about it carefully.

266
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:31,176
Why not just hang around,

267
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,016
waiting for the retirement?

268
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:34,696
Wei Cao treats retiring team members

269
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:36,816
much better than Jia Shi Team.

270
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,536
Really?

271
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,096
I will think about it seriously.

272
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,216
What are you thinking about?

273
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:47,456
Why do you come here today?

274
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,056
Am I wrong?

275
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:53,736
Of course!

276
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:55,296
Isn't he old?

277
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,696
Isn't it too hard to build a team?

278
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,896
Isn't it a good choice to join Wei Cao?

279
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:01,736
Can he find a good boss?

280
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:08,696
Yes, he can.

281
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:09,776
Who?

282
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:10,296
Me!

283
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,616
Boss, are you kidding me?

284
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,736
It's not easy to build a new team.

285
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:20,576
I am not kidding.

286
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:24,736
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

287
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,136
I just afraid you don't think I am qualified.

288
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,496
A little bit.

289
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:37,376
To be the boss of a team, you need to have a high IQ,

290
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,096
and a high EQ.

291
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:39,656
Do you think you have them both?

292
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,896
It's not a game,

293
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,096
right?

294
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:46,496
Sure.

295
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:48,176
Don't make a hasty decision

296
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,176
just because of your sudden impulse.

297
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,616
Then,

298
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,736
there is no place to regret.

299
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,496
I will never give up.

300
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,816
I will never give up.

301
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,336
Never give up.

302
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,016
Is she really a good choice?

303
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,936
We all started from zero.

304
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,976
Things can't get any worse.

305
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:31,496
Did I play well?

306
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,816
Hmm...could be an extra.

307
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:46,976
Tang,

308
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:53,456
have you taken an IQ test?

309
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:56,096
Yep.

310
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:57,376
What score did you get?

311
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:58,656
One hundred and thirty.

312
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:02,816
One hundred and thirty.

313
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,656
Hmm it could be the same to me.

314
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:11,656
Do you think I have a high EQ?

315
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,496
Can you see through others?

316
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:22,576
I recogized the master as a go-for before,

317
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:24,336
so maybe I can't.

318
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,856
Can you control yourself?

319
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,776
I think I can.

320
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:38,616
Are you focused, patient and thoughtful?

321
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,456
I think I am.

322
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:48,736
Guoguo,

323
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:52,256
What we are talking about is something serious.

324
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,216
You can't take it too easy.

325
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:07,496
I think I am ready to build the team.

326
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,736
So how?

327
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,856
I have money, and passion.

328
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:15,376
Money and passion are not enough.

329
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,176
Can you take the burden, work overnight,

330
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:19,736
and deal with frustration?

331
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:20,576
Absolutely.

332
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:23,856
I don't buy it.

333
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:34,736
Put them away. They are quite worthy.

334
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:50,256
To build a team,

335
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:52,616
it's necessary to create a guild

336
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,136
and achieve the certification.

337
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,136
These two things are the prerequisite.

338
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,456
I will prove myself to you!

339
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,216
I am waiting.

340
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,256
Finally my dream could come true.

341
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,416
I start to make careful preparation for the coming challenges.

342
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:21,896
This time, I am definitely going to prove

343
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:23,256
I am qualified enough.

344
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:44,656
Still have analysis to read?

345
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:32,416
Rewards for scaning the code.

346
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,056
Relly? Let's have a try.

347
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,256
Welcome to Strong and Stunning Guild.

348
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:37,336
Rewards for scanning the code.

349
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:38,816
Let's have a try.

350
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,886
301,enough to advance to the next level.

351
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:01,727
= Let's summon the Guardian to develop the guild. =

352
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:07,176
Ok, all done.
= Are you going to take the Guardian mission? =

353
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,736
Go ahead.

354
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:29,616
The guild is ready?

355
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,856
Strong and Stunning.

356
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:33,576
Registered for the test?

357
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,576
The clock is ticking.

358
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,536
That confident?

359
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:38,736
Ready for whatever coming.

360
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:45,816
After I finish the test,

361
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,176
and you guys knock out the Guardian,

362
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,736
we can hold a party

363
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:51,896
and enjoy a big dinner.

364
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:54,856
The Guardian?

365
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:57,776
After we finish this mission,

366
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,536
our guild can upgrade.

367
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:01,016
With the member limit reaching 1000,

368
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,456
we can build a team.

369
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,616
When did you take this mission?

370
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:07,976
Just now.

371
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:11,736
Did you know

372
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:14,016
We have to finish this mission in two hours.

373
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:17,656
What if we fail?

374
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:21,976
The guild would be disbanded.

375
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:24,736
We only have two opportunities

376
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:25,696
to challenge the Guardian.

377
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,816
Now it's only one and a half hour left.

378
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,216
Get ready?

379
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,016
Ready.

380
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:57,896
It's Unicorn Guardian.

381
00:25:58,376 --> 00:25:59,696
We have to try our best

382
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:01,096
to defeat it within the limited time,

383
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:02,176
in order to keep our guild.

384
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,496
We have no choice

385
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:07,576
but to fight.

386
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:58,656
Boss,

387
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:07,136
If you want to help, just go upstairs.

388
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:09,696
I think I'd better leave it to them.

389
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:17,096
Chu, we will

390
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,576
get it through, right?

391
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,256
Sure, Ye is such a master,

392
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,616
so it shouldn't be a problem.

393
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:24,056
Exactly.

394
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:28,336
We still have a few good players

395
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,416
in our guild.

396
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,496
The mission is only a piece of cake.

397
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:33,776
Not to mention one and a half hour,

398
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,056
half an hour is enough for them.

399
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:38,216
Actually we all have confidence in Ye,

400
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,376
but you seem not.

401
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,496
Of course I trust him!

402
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:46,936
I am going to prepare food and drinks for them right now.

403
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:53,216
It's been a long time,

404
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
why does the HP remain the same?

405
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:55,896
They missed the target.

406
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:58,336
What the hell are these noobs doing?

407
00:27:58,616 --> 00:27:59,736
How could it happen!

408
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:00,816
Aren't they elite?

409
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,616
There are too many misses!

410
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:04,336
This is intentional.

411
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:47,136
Don't bother to chase. It's no use.

412
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,736
Why were there so many misses?

413
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,936
It seems our undercover plan works.

414
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:04,576
Obviously Ye wants to build a team

415
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:06,656
after creating the guild.

416
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,616
In future, he will not just be the opponent of Lanxi Pavilion,

417
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,896
but compete with Lan Yu Team.

418
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,496
I understand. Don't worry.

419
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:20,056
I won't be soft.

420
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:21,576
I will crush their guild

421
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:24,056
by hook or by crook.

422
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,816
The Guardian

423
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,176
is the largest barrier of upgrading the guild.

424
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:28,936
Now it's only one hour left.

425
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,936
If they fail again,

426
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,536
their guild will be disbanded.

427
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,776
I didn't expect they took this mission

428
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,616
without any preparation.

429
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,416
It will only embarrass themselves.

430
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,056
Their guild members are all noobs.

431
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:42,456
To knock out the boss,

432
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:45,976
we are the only reliance for them.

433
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:48,176
As long as we remain undercover,

434
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,856
even given two more hours, they still won't get it through.

435
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:10,976
I'm back.

436
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:28,416
Baozi, is it your mistake?

437
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,176
Did you do something stupid again?

438
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:30,936
Boss, I...

439
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:31,856
No one made mistakes,

440
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,296
except you.

441
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,576
We've been working our ass off,

442
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,816
to pay the price for your impulse.

443
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,376
Guoguo, this time you are too impulsive.

444
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,536
You really should ask us

445
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:46,816
if we could finish it

446
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,296
before taking this mission.

447
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:50,576
If we fail,

448
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:52,096
our guild will be disbanded.

449
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,256
It's not a big deal.

450
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:02,616
We can creat another one

451
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,336
in a few days anyway.

452
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:27,256
If you want to be build a team,

453
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,336
I won't stop you.

454
00:31:29,936 --> 00:31:31,016
But have you ever thought

455
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,496
if you are qualified enough?

456
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,416
To build a team, and create a guild,

457
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:51,216
a lot of people are better than me.

458
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,096
Compared with them,

459
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,896
I am truly unqualified.

460
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,056
The reason why they are better than you,

461
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:02,096
is not they are more intelligent,

462
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,096
or more capable.

463
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,496
It is simply that you forecast your failure

464
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,416
before taking actions.

465
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,176
Now that you hold this idea,

466
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,016
and they agree with you,

467
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:21,256
I could quit.

468
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:26,656
I give up to be the boss of this team.

469
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,896
Whatever... you always give up halfway.

470
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,016
Since you want to quit,

471
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:38,576
don't bother to push yourself,

472
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:41,896
and no need to take the coming test.

473
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:47,896
Alright!

474
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,976
Hurry up! Let's try again.

475
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:08,816
Although most of us don't have much experience,

476
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,936
we have been this dungeon once.

477
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:12,816
I think everyone is kind of familiar with it.

478
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,616
Just follow my lead.

479
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:19,416
I hope we could succeed this time.

480
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:22,776
Succeed? Are you kidding me?

481
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:24,696
It's all over.

482
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:26,576
Master Ye, this time I'm sorry.

483
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,416
Don't tell me you feel sorry for him

484
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,216
and are reluctant to play the tricks.

485
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,736
You are thinking too much. Let's get started.

486
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:38,896
Let's get started.

487
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,256
Feng Shu Yan Mu, shoot the Guardian at long range.

488
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,856
Feng Shu Yan Mu and I are in charge of crowd control.

489
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,176
Everybody else, fire.

490
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:49,376
And be careful when attacking at a high speed.

491
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:59,296
No wonder she is the top launcher.

492
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,256
Her Delivery Gun skill, is incredible.

493
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,216
Collective Delivery Gun!

494
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:10,536
The Guardian is under control.

495
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,536
Cap, you are amazing!

496
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:13,736
Fire.

497
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,416
Take that! Tyrannical Chain Punch!

498
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:43,696
What should we do now?

499
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:45,736
Keep attacking.

500
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:46,896
Just remember to miss the target.

501
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:47,656
There are so many people focusing this boss

502
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:48,616
that no one will find us.

503
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:49,976
Attack the wall.

504
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:50,976
Pretend we have missed attacks.

505
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,456
Be careful to avoid the boss.

506
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:07,127
There must be something wrong.

507
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:10,056
Why is the HP declining so slowly?

508
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:12,456
They have too many missed attacks.

509
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,696
What the hell are they doing?

510
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:15,896
The Guardian even stays still.

511
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:16,856
How could they miss the target!

512
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:18,936
Cap, what can we do?

513
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,696
Keep going.

514
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:21,456
Roger that.

515
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:40,056
No time left! No time left! No time left!

516
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,696
Don't stop. Keep going.

517
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:46,776
what's the point?

518
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,736
They are just grasping at straws.

519
00:35:50,296 --> 00:35:51,856
Everybody, it's close to the end.

520
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:52,856
Let's work harder,

521
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,016
and act our parts.

522
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:55,496
Don't make Jun Mo Xiao figure it out.

523
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,216
Let's focus the wall.

524
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:52,896
Wtf!

525
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,896
We did it!

526
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,096
Congratulations to Strong and Stunning Guild

527
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:12,216
on achieving Guard Power Buff.

528
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:15,616
Many thanks to all the undercover.

529
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,856
I appreciate your great efforts on attacking the wall.

530
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,056
Do you want me to kick you guys off?

531
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:30,936
Let's go. The meeting is about to start.

532
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,176
Why do you still stay in their guild?

533
00:37:38,576 --> 00:37:40,416
Hurry up. Our cap is waiting.

534
00:37:49,816 --> 00:37:50,696
Lan He?

535
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:56,696
We did such a great job!

536
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:58,736
I really didn't expect

537
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:00,696
the boss somehow suddenly died.

538
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:01,456
What do you think?

539
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,056
We are bloody lucky!

540
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,096
We are not lucky at all.

541
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:06,776
It is just a game of plot and counterplot.

542
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:10,536
Plot? What are you saying?

543
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:13,856
First, counterplot.

544
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:15,776
Then, exploiting the enemies' force.

545
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,496
Counterplot?

546
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:20,616
WHat did we exploit?

547
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:21,856
At last, weak willows binding bigger wood.

548
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:23,816
All the enemies are blinded.

549
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:24,856
I have to say,

550
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,416
the whole process is really interesting.

551
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,256
What?

552
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:31,416
What? What?

553
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,776
If you guys keep confusing him,

554
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:35,736
I guess Baozi would rather kill himself.

555
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:39,136
What are you talking about?

556
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:39,896
Thanks.

557
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,016
Those noobs,

558
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:43,016
are all undercover.

559
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:44,216
Undercover?

560
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:48,976
Ahh I see.

561
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:50,856
They all wear a mask

562
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,416
in our team!

563
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,576
How dare they do this!

564
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,576
Well, thanks for their efforts on the wall,

565
00:38:58,096 --> 00:38:59,136
we could

566
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:01,376
knock out the boss at the last second.

567
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,776
Cap, I guess

568
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,136
you figured out this way

569
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,816
after we failed first time.

570
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:08,536
That's why

571
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,256
you let them be in our second attempt.

572
00:39:11,536 --> 00:39:13,336
Am I right?

573
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:14,816
A half.

574
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:17,016
The person who got this idea is not me,

575
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:18,576
is Luo Ji.

576
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:20,096
If he didn't find out

577
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,536
the DPS of the crushing wall is 103245.6,

578
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,736
much higher than the sum of the DPS of the other eight,

579
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,576
I wouldn't give it a go.

580
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,296
Excuse me,

581
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,416
you forgot two decimal places.

582
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:33,896
It should be 103245.618.

583
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,696
Shut up.

584
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:37,336
Just be a lamb.

585
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,136
103245.618?

586
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:39,736
Right.

587
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:40,536
Ok, I got it.

588
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:43,016
Everything is under your control,

589
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:45,456
but you still made Guoguo upset.

590
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:50,096
Cheers, for our boss.

591
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:54,776
Good luck to her!

592
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,016
Or... wish her a miracle!

593
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,016
Sounds good.

594
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:00,216
Well,

595
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:01,256
cheers!

596
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:09,296
The reason why they are better than you,

597
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:11,096
is not they are more intelligent,

598
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:11,896
or more capable.

599
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,216
It is simply that you forecast your failure

600
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:16,096
before taking actions.

601
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:24,136
If you want to be build a team,

602
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,376
I won't stop you.

603
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:27,336
But have you ever thought

604
00:40:27,576 --> 00:40:28,816
if you are qualified enough?

605
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:43,096
Whatever... you always give up halfway.

606
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:45,256
Since you want to quit,

607
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:47,456
don't bother to push yourself.

608
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:13,267
# The road to the top is rough and long. #

609
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:17,987
# But walking with you, I will have infinite power. #

610
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:22,267
# Failure is like the dawn of victory. #

611
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:26,387
# So what if we start all over again? #

612
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:33,507
# Youth is a forever indomitable growth. #

613
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:37,747
# We are accompanied by confidence and strength. #

614
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:43,066
# Even if we flinch and bruise all over our body, #

615
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:47,227
# there will always be hope in despair. #

616
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:51,586
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

617
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:57,347
# We must do our best to win a battle. #

618
00:41:57,707 --> 00:42:02,427
# We laugh, we cry, we feel sad for failure. #

619
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:07,347
# We accompany each other to bloom in the transformation. #

620
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:11,507
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

621
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:17,267
# To fight for our dream, we should win beautifully enough. #

622
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:22,507
# We are hugging, cheering, and ecstatic with joy for our victory. #

623
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:27,347
# We spent countless shining times. #

624
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,387
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

625
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:37,227
# We must do our best to win a battle. #

626
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:42,387
# We laugh, we cry, we feel sad for failure. #

627
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:47,267
# We accompany each other to bloom in the transformation. #

628
00:42:47,427 --> 00:42:52,026
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

629
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:57,186
# To fight for our dream, we should win beautifully enough. #

630
00:42:57,427 --> 00:43:02,387
# We are hugging, cheering, and ecstatic with joy for our victory. #

631
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:07,267
# And we spent countless shining times. #

632
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:12,267
# This is the most glorious battlefield. #

633
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:23,227
# We spent countless shining times. #
