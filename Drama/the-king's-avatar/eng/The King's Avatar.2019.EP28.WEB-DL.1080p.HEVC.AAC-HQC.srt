I can't see through what's going on in his mind.

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,220
Let's see him in the game.

15
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,220
I am the top Scrap Picker of Glory.

16

Got an orange suit at the beginning.

He doesn't pick the equipment after kill someone?

23

Isn't he here to scrap-pick?

24
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,140
He'll lose badly sooner or later

25
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,740
if he still plays like that.

26
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,620
He might be training in this way.

27
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,380
But unfortunately,

28
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,500
it's a wrong way.

29
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,500

Are they here to help me?

Don't get us wrong.

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,540
You guys go on.

39
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,140
We are here to look around.

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,380
We won't disturb you.

41
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,700
They're just here to pick up the equipment.

42
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm gonna rush out by myself.

43
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,235
Prove to you guys that I can do it.

44
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,180
The Mechanic, you hit so soft,

45
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,580
you can kill him if you hit hard.

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,060
All of you think I'm not strong enough.

47
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,020
Attack him in the rear.

48
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
He's good at quiting game

49
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,060
while lose the upper hand.

50
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,780
This time, I won't run away.

51

Who fired just now?

53
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,580
It's OK that you lose,

54
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
you can leveling up by yourself,

55
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,180
But your equipment is our team's property,

56
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,020
It's a great lose if they are taken away.

57
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,940
They're with him.

58
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,340
Don't let anyone go. Go get them.

59

We are all in this trouble

60
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,380
because of you.

61
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,260
You have to take the full responsibility.

62
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,860
You go and protect An.

63
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,740
I'll leave the most value equipments of our team to you.

64
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,104
We don't need to play the Challenge if you lose them.

65
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,140
Copy that.

66
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,660
I'll take the responsibility of the trouble I made

67
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,180
all by myself.

68
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
I'll chase back the Frigid Defender.

69
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,820
I did it. I avoid it.

70
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,740
I didn't duplicate my last mistake.

71
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,060
Baozi, pay attention to your position.

72
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,300
You are in the way of Lao Wei's attack.

73
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,820
Boss, is my cooperation right?

74
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,340
What... What should I do?

75
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,740
Position.

76
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,980
Move three to five positions in the direction of three o'clock.

77
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,860
Consider your teammates' position.

78
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,180
Find a position that can assure your damage

79
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,860
and doesn't effect your teammates.

80
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,860
That's the position you belong in the team.

81
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,620
I have my own position.

82
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,780
He's pretty clever.

83
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,540
Because he belongs to my team.

84
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,580
Let's see the results.

85
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,500
Hello.

86
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,820
You've taken the equipment.

87
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,300
Don't be too greedy.

88
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,020
You are...

89
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,260
Right.

90
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,820
I'm the one that

91
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,260
killed your character during the game

92
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,220
you against Jia Shi last time.

93
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,020
So you...

94
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,940
I'm Feng Shu Yan Mu,

95
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,220
the one who was chasing you.

96
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,140
Everyone's acting good.

97
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,340
Of course.

98
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,500
You've paid all the intentions

99
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,860
to train the new guy.

100
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,180
Master,

101
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,060
call us if there's another

102
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,220
group performance like this.

103
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,860
Act better, talk less, and we brought our own equipment.

104
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,220
Boss, do I deserve an Oscar

105
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,620
for my acting just now?

106
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,500
I deserve it.

107
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,980
Look at me, skillful and idolized.

108
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,780
You are just shameless.

109
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,660
What did you say?

110
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,780
Shame on you.

111
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,460
Everyone's been stuck in the room for training lately.

112
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,900
You've been working hard and need to relax.

113
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,140
How about one-on-one?

114
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,140
One-on-one? Basketball?

115
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
We should give Xing Xian's new teammate

116
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,660
a welcome gift.

117
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,020
Is today's gift not enough?

118
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,860
Of course not.

119
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,860
But that basketball gym is hard to book,

120
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,060
It's hard to be solved, right?

121
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,060
Cure it.

122
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,460
Try to book it a week in advance.

123
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,340
Fine, I'll try.

124
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,580
There's an important position spot here.

125
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,340
Pay attention to this.

126
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,940
It can magnify HP and clear buff

127
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,300
after each cycle.

128
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,060
I'll give you the coordinate.

129
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,940
218 52 521, the first one.

130
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,340
081 603, the second one.

131
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,660
192 735, the third one.

132
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,180
We'd better stay

133
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,340
in these three coordinates

134
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,260
at the same time.

135
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,260
In this way,

136
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,620
it can improve the speed of movement,

137
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,500
and can also lengthening the speed

138
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,860
at around 2 seconds.

139
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,620
Moreover, there's an effect of refreshing skills.

140
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,740
I've mark the coordinates of its positions.

141
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,060
They're EBACD.

142
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,100
It can cause 300% of

143
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,300
its own damage.

144
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,460
It can lasts for 3 seconds.

145
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,180
See? Here.

146
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,540
This point here.

147
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
Right. Now its DPS is 1000,

148
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,260
move speed is 500, a little slow.

149
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,860
Is the DPS

150
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,740
a little weak?

151
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,900
The lenthening HP will be improved

152
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,420
after a circle.

153
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,580
This point. Look.

154
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,700
Stop wandering around. I'm dizzy.

155
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,460
Come and sit here with us.

156
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,820
2 o'clock.

157
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,380
I made an appointment to the basketball gym.

158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
You bastard.

159
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,580
Why don't you say it till now?

160
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,020
What time is it now?

161
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,260
Almost 2 o'clock. Let's go.

162
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,740
Go. Go. Go.

163
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,700
Come on.

164
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,700
Considering from the height, bouncing ability,

165
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,180
and other comprehensive qualities,

166
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,900
I think the winning rate is higher

167
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,460
if we are in captain's team.

168
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
That's not how it works.

169
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,860
Well,

170
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,780
I'll introduce you the rules.

171
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,740
First...

172
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
We're just playing casually.

173
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,220
We don't need any rules.

174
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,820
Right.

175
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,380
Fine.

176
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,940
Then let's play.

177
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Come on.

178
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,540
Shooting is so easy.

179
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,620
Just as same as throwing bricks.

180
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,020
Let me show you.

181
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,660
Watch out, Tang Rou.

182
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,340
That's a nice shot....

183
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,140
What are you doing?

184
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,180
I think there's no problem

185
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,460
winning him by 50:0.

186
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,540
That's not how it works.

187
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,220
Just playing casually.

188
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,620
We don't need any rules.

189
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,220
I'm on your side.

190
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
What's going on with the slippers?

191
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
They feel good.

192
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,260
Let's begin.

193
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,260
Here. Faster.

194
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,620
Slower.

195
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,300
Give me, give me, pass it to me.

196
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
I thought we're playing one-on-one,

197
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,660
why turn into a team competition?

198
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,780
Only this way can train their cooperations,

199
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
and only this way

200
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,420
can bring the team together

201
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,700
into a fighting team.

202
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,460
As a team's manager,

203
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,580
I have the obligation to motivate and guide teammates,

204
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,180
and guide them to establish an effective communication,

205
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,700
help them to improve their abilities.

206
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,740
Boss,

207
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,020
you're so professional now.

208
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,260
Thanks.

209
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,260
# The starry fireflies from the ordinary #

210
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,100
# sailing with the wind and converge into the Milky Way #

211
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,780
# standing on the top and claiming that #

212
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,940
# We will regain our glory #

213
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,300
# Push the clouds aside and shine the light #

214
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,820
An Wenyi, Baozi,

215
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,100
it's ok, take it easy.

216
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,860
Relax, take your time.

217
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,420
Baozi, you go up.

218
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,180
Mo Fan finally

219
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,100
shout out a voice of inspiration.

220
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,820
He can say it on his own initiative,

221
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,700
it means that cooperation has already

222
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,100
slipped into his consciousness.

223
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,260
We are not wasting our time.

224
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,340
# Composing the great song of battlefield #

225
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,020
# The only light during the long night #

226
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,940
# Is us from the ordinary life #

227
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,900
# Above the cloud, in the dust #

228
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,380
# We are the brightest fireflies #

229
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,380
# I came from the past and will write the furture #

230
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,300
# The rising wave of our ten years' effort #

231
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,740
A basketball game

232
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,700
help me realize the meaning of "team",

233
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,780
We need to be ourselves yet protecting each other,

234
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,660
we need to be independent yet rely on each other.

235
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,980
That's the meaning of us being together.

236
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,060
Of course I also let them know that

237
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,380
proper exercise is benefit to our health.

238
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,140
But as a eSports player,

239
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,740
we need to learn to protect ourselves,

240
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,740
no rushing and no hurting.

241
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,860
So...

242
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,060
Friendship first, competition second.

243
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,620
I'll let them win.

244
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,220
I'm here.

245
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Guoguo, let's go.

246
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,540
# We are the brightest fireflies #

247
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,500
# We are the brightest fireflies #

248
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,940
Today Thunderbolt Team lost again,

249
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,780
thus finished all the games in this season.

250
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,900
Ranking in 18th on the league table.

251
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,700
What's the feeling of leaving your old team?

252
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,140
Thunderbolt is not only

253
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
my old team.

254
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,420
I come from Thunderbolt,

255
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,140
That's my starting point.

256
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,100
But it's not your finishing point.

257
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,380
What do you think is my finishing point?

258
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,060
Win the championship trophy.

259
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,780
But everyone says that

260
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,180
transfer from league team

261
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,340
to demoted Jia Shi is not wise.

262
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,780
But you know that

263
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,220
Jia Shi is still the most ambitious and

264
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,900
powerful of Glory to win the championship.

265
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
That team and equipment

266
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,220
deserve your finishing point.

267
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,740
You know Jia Shi

268
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,180
better than you know me.

269
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,180
The 9th National Challenge of Glory

270
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,380
has announced the grouping of top twenty teams.

271
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,380
Scores will be ranked

272
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
in both team A and B this time.

273
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,380
Winners of both team will play in the final.

274
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Since the founding of league,

275
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,980
Jia Shi, which has been demoted,

276
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,900
is assigned to team A.

277
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Because of the existence of Jia Shi,

278
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,620
team A will be a team of accompany this year.

279
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,580
Xing Xin's lucky.

280
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,300
You are not in the same team with Jia Shi.

281
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,260
We won't meet before the final.

282
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,500
Then...

283
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,300
See you at the final.

284
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,340
From now on,

285
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,420
I'll abandon the identity of Thunderbolt's captain,

286
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,300
and win the championship with a new identity.

287
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,100
You, too.

288
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,300
Wait for me.

289
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,260
You want to give me gifts,

290
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,420
just go to the Net Cafe.

291
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Why here?

292
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
This is not a normal place.

293
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,060
This is an old place that you took me here

294
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,380
to see pentode stairs and found Easter Eggs.

295
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,420
It seems like you have an Easter Egg for me today.

296
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,220
This gift...

297
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,380
can't be counted as creative.

298
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,180
You buy me this every year,

299
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,500
I think it isn't qualified of Easter Eggs.

300
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,700
I've counted it.

301
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,900
There will be ten games

302
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
from now to the final.

303
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,740
Newcomer needs a new appearance.

304
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,100
I've prepared for you.

305
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,260
Ten masks.

306
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,460
You can choose...

307
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,780
not to wear it.

308
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,620
This is the place you told me that

309
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,260
my brother's map bug

310
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,700
has a surprisingly Easter Egg.

311
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
Some bugs will always exist

312
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,020
if we don't fix it.

313
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,300
But if you are willing to have a try,

314
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,820
maybe there'll be

315
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,460
a different Easter Egg reversal.

316
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,700
Easter Egg!

317
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,940
Leave us alone.

318
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,740
Nice. Give him another punch.

319
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,660
Did you see, grandpa? I take him down.

320
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
Stop playing. Let's go home first.

321
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,340
Let's play again.

322
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,220
OK. Grandpa, I'm sure I'll win again.

323
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,260
Grandpa,

324
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,660
I hope you can see the present me.

325
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,020
Excuse me, please pull over.

326
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,900
# Your old coat feels like an umbrella #

327
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,140
# Give me a blue sky #

328
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,620
# shield wind and rain for me #

329
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,860
# You'll share with me a bowl of instant noodles #

330
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,340
This place

331
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,780
holds the memory of me and grandpa.

332
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,380
Left, left, left. Right, right, right. Go up to the roof.

333
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,340
Good. Snipe.

334
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,060
That's right.

335
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,780
Right in the center.

336
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,420
Grandpa, you're so good.

337
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,620
Ten combos.

338
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,900
New record.

339
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,100
I told you that

340
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,980
my talent on the eSports

341
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,020
is inherit from you.

342
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,060
# not leaving regrets for me #

343
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,580
Master.

344
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,260
Guang.

345
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,460
We cooperate together,

346
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,860
and then be known as

347
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,700
Golden Partner.

348
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,020
God commanded, let there be light.

349
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,340
Two guns combine harmoniously will be invincible.

350
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,660
# To me #

351
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,060
# you are the best #

352
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,260
# Time sometimes flies so fast when we are together #

353
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,900
# Sometimes time becomes so slow #

354
00:23:59,580 --> 00:23:59,940
Dad.

355
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,660
Did you play the computer again?

356
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Such a wasting of time.

357
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,300
When will you guys grow up?

358
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,220
Where's the disk?

359
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,900
The disk, the disk.

360
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,780
The disk, the disk.

361
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,660
Grandpa is my first fan on my way to eSports.

362
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,460
Don't worry. I'll handle the Great Devil.

363
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,420
Grandpa,

364
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,980
I'll call you every day.

365
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,380
Have good games.

366
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,340
I'm waiting for you to win the championship.

367
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
I'll insist in the end,

368
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,460
I'll prove to my father that

369
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm not wasting time.

370
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,260
Well,eSports is a career.

371
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,780
Grandpa, goodbye.

372
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,220
Bye.

373
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,900
I almost forgot this.

374
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,900
This is the key to our home.

375
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,020
Come back if you want.

376
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,740
I'll go.

377
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,340
# You are my dearest in my heart #

378
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,820
# You are the pride of my heart  #

379
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,140
# and my warmth forever #

380
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,620
How dare him to join

381
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
the eSports game

382
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,140
without any authorization?

383
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,420
I allowed him to go.

384
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,620
Dad.

385
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,980
I know you're happy about him

386
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,460
playing computer games with you.

387
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,940
But you can't connive his

388
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,260
bad behavior like this.

389
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,420
Bad behavior?

390
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
Do you understand your son?

391
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,140
Why come back so soon?

392
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,060
Master?

393
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,820
Grandpa,

394
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,580
Are you OK?

395
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,660
I'm fine. You're Qiu.

396
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,540
Seems like my Guang

397
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,140
has gone out successfully.

398
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,100
# You cover your unwillingness #

399
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,620
# with a smile #

400
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,020
Master, master.

401
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,620
Guang's calling. Over.

402
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,300
Master copy.

403
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,340
The great devil isn't home,

404
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,940
the communication is safe.

405
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,860
Grandpa, I won the first prize in the game,

406
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,860
and met lots of expert there.

407
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,300
Besides,

408
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,700
I've met a friend that is thoughtful.

409
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,780
We decided to

410
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,500
do something big.

411
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,140
Remember to look after yourself

412
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,380
when you're away from home.

413
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,340
Have you found somewhere to live?

414
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,860
Grandpa, great news.

415
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,860
I and my friends are going to

416
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,900
hold the first Glory Professional Alliance.

417
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,180
Do you know what is Alliance, grandpa?

418
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,500
It means that we can literally

419
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,020
make games into a sport.

420
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,740
Guang is so great.

421
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,780
Grandpa is waiting to see you

422
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,740
in the arena.

423
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,060
Right,

424
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,660
have you found somewhere to live?

425
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,020
Grandpa, I have to attend

426
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,140
a very important examination in a few days.

427
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,580
If I pass,

428
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,940
I can be a real

429
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,660
professional eSports player.

430
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,100
I'm so happy for you.

431
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,660
Guang,

432
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,180
I can't find

433
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,500
the CD-ROM.

434
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,540
I'll ask the great devil

435
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,460
if he hides it.

436
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,900
and have you found somewhere to live?

437
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,940
# and my warmth forever #

438
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,660
# Let us stay together #

439
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,340
Can I help you?

440
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,740
Is CD-ROM provided here?

441
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
You seem like an old customer.

442
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,900
We did sell CD-ROM here.

443
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,740
But we don't sell anymore three years ago.

444
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,020
Young people are

445
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,940
playing Glory nowadays.

446
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,940
So we updated our product as well.

447
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
But we still retain the signboard.

448
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,100
Only this shop still exists after so many years.

449
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,220
I would have thought I went wrong

450
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,540
if not see this signboard.

451
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,180
One just recognize the way

452
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,220
by these familiar things.

453
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,500
Did you come back home from out in the field?

454
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,220
Back home.

455
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,780
Grandpa's funeral affairs have been taken care of.

456
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,740
You take a good rest these two days.

457
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,140
I believe that whether grandpa or me

458
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,340
wish to see you can

459
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,380
get back on track.

460
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,060
I've prepared the passport and luggage for you.

461
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,220
This is the information about that school.

462
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,300
Tell me if you

463
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,980
need anything else.

464
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,300
Dad, I don't want to go abroad.

465
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,700
Why?

466
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,220
Because I have a very good friend waiting for me.

467
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,860
We agreed to become

468
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,380
professional players together.

469
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,580
Professional players?

470
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,420
You want to  be a professional player by playing computer?

471
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,380
Haven't you recognize reality?

472
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,420
I thought your grandfather's death would

473
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,940
make you understand what's most important.

474
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm not asking you to be successful and glorify your ancestors.

475
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,180
But I don't want you to choose a career

476
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,820
that is doomed to failure.

477
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't want your life to be filled with regrets.

478
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,380
I don't want you to regret one day,

479
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,420
but there's no way back.

480
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,260
Dad,

481
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,740
I don't know if I'll regret it in the future.

482
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,540
But now

483
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,060
I want to try my best.

484
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,180
You are humiliating Ye family.

485
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,060
Stay as my son,

486
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,980
or never come back.

487
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,940
Dad.

488
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,980
From now on,

489
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,180
you have nothing to do with this family.

490
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,500
# You are as always #

491
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,260
# Keep calm even though I have to leave #

492
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,300
# I am as always, #

493
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,740
# writing an ending for the story. #

494
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,020
# Let me have a short break #

495
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,220
# The snow is heavy #

496
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,540
# I believe after frustration #

497
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,660
# One day my courage will create miracle #

498
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,780
# In the shadows cast by lamplight through leaves #

499
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,940
# My friends are waiting for me #

500
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,300
# I know I am never alone #

501
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,580
# We will go together and shake the world #
= Contact: Dad =

502
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,420
From now on,

503
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,700
you have nothing to do with this family.

504
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,220
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

505
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,380
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

506
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,740
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

507
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,660
# We are stronger when we used to be. #

508
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,980
# We go through deep and down. #

509
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,100
# We stand at the starry summit. #

510
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,460
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

511
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,060
# I have always been my own hero. #

512
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:01,980
# I have seen the legend before #

513
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:11,940
# I have seen the legend before #

514
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,260
Dad,

515
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,820
I was sitting here the day I left home,

516
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,180
you told me that

517
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,980
you don't want me to have no way back while I regret.

518
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,620
Dad,

519
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,100
I always want to tell you these years that

520
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,620
I don't need the way back at all.

521
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,740
Cause I never regret.

522
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,500
Noodles don't taste good after a long time.

523
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,020
I built a new team.

524
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,660
We're going to play the first National Challenge soon.

525
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,420
I hope

526
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,180
you can come and see my game.
