Check out.

5
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,880
Boss, come here.

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Come on, come on, come on.

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
You wait, wait, wait.

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
Why is this black screen again?

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Are you playing with Glory or me?

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Boss.

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Is that man playing with your number?

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
Will he steal your equipment?

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
Oh, no.

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
The smelly boy is looking for a job.

15
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
Win.

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
I just saw the PK begin automatically.

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
So I played a game for you.

18
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,680
How long did it take to win.

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Forty seconds.

20
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
This is awesome.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,480
I won.

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Beautiful.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,840
Boss.

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,120
You just said Glory is not just a game.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
What is the Glory.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Glory.

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,280
We all know each other by Glory.

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,920
Glory is the world for all of us.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Check out, right.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm here to ask for a job.

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
What's your name?

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
Ye Xiu.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Ye what?

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
Ye Xiu.

36
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Like our great god name so much.

37
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640
Interesting?

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Do you have experience in network management.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,600
No.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,320
Can you help the guest start the game?

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,760
No?

42
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Can you check the network operation?

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,040
No.

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
Can you maintain network equipment upgrade antivirus software

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,840
and detect unsafe information?

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
What the hell do you can do.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
I can.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Playing Glory!

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
You are hired.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's get this straight.

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
You don't know anything.

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
If the performance is not good

54
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,400
I can't leave you either.

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,200
After all, I am not a shelter here either.

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,520
This is another mess.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Not bad.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,040
This is too good for me.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
Sorry, you think too much.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
This is my room.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Your room.

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,960
There.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Right here.

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
This ..

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
There is a slight difference here.

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
However, the staff dormitory is full now.

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
It's okay. It's fine.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
All I need is a bed.

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
The quilt is at the head of the bed.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Do it yourself.

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Take it easy.

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Ok

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Stop

74
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Hello

75
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Change the light bulb.

76
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
Light bulb.

77
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
There.

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,880
Good.

79
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
What's going on?

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Check switch.

81
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
What about the instant noodles?

82
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,640
Coming.

83
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

84
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Coming.

85
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,000
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Sorry.

87
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,360
Gave me an extra hour.

88
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
Chu 24 table for another hour.

89
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll add some noodles to the net manager.

90
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right

91
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
I said can you hurry up.

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,280
What the hell.

93
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
What is the status of network management.

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Excuse me, excuse me.

95
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
Stop for half a day.

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
Sorry, come back tomorrow. Come back tomorrow.

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,680
Go home early.

98
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Sorry, come back tomorrow.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
For the first time I know

100
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
it turns out that installing bulbs is a technical job.

101
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,520
I'll get someone to fix it.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,640
Stop.

103
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's calculate the account first.

104
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Today's losses.

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,360
I will deduct it from my salary.

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
This is what you said.

107
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
The average employee's salary is 3,000 a month.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,680
You are now in internship.

109
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,600
Halve by 15.

110
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,720
Some guests did not pay the internet fee.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
It's 427.

112
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,160
The meal fee is 361.

113
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,640
There are also repair costs, 500, insurance, 32.

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Let's take a look.

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
This is today's loss.

116
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
So it seems at most a small mistake.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Boss, I'm busy.

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
I can only suspend business when this internet cafe is repaired..

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
So you have to be responsible for the delay.

120
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
And this month's salary.

121
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,920
You must have lost it.

122
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,840
Today's loss is.

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
9,892.5.

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,080
When I say bear the loss, I mean.

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll pay for the light bulb..

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
Then I'll help you take the change.

127
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,000
Nine thousand.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
9,892.

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
How are you going to return it?

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
Cannot tell.

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,960
Can't say words.

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
Then you have to listen to me.

133
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
Starting today.

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,320
You have to do the job of network management.

135
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
You have to do the cleaning work.

136
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
You also have to do coolie work.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,360
I can wrap you up.

138
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
But I can't give you a cent.

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Boss.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
What did you do to pay according to your work.

141
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
It's all deducted from your account.

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
Is there a problem?

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,920
I

144
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
No problem.

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Come on, dry up.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,360
Financial Crisis Caused by a Light Bulb.

147
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,240
Go, go, go, go.

148
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,120
Go, go, go.

149
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Get out! Get out! Get out.

150
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,720
Eldest brother.

151
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
The club does not welcome you as a reporter.

152
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,360
Brother, listen to me.

153
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Who does not know that you are an iron powder of Ye Qiu.

154
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,000
We've been snooping on gossip all day.

155
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,520
Don't let in, don't let in.

156
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
This was just fine.

157
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,360
Wait a minute. I'll do some research.

158
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,680
Soon, soon.

159
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
The screen turned around..

160
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,880
Okay.

161
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Peer.

162
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Get me a bottle of water.

163
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,880
I come.

164
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
What is the treatment of your internet cafe?

165
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,840
Still hiring?

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,760
Who is your peer?

167
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,560
Call me if you need anything.

168
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Or go to the new district to abuse a dish first.

169
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Have a good time.

170
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Be careful, everyone.

171
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,880
A person dozen strange.

172
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
A lot of good materials have come out.

173
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,440
I said, have you three ever played.

174
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,480
Isn't this just opened.

175
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
Not yet.

176
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,880
I was blown out as soon as I entered the copy.

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
As soon as I arrived, I met three little white people.

178
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
The three of you will be abused.

179
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,520
All right, you three will listen to me later.

180
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
Isn't it the night cat monster and the wild cat.

181
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,560
Pussycat.

182
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
The cat is bigger than the three of us together.

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,520
One paw took us flying.

184
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,280
That's because none of you will pull hatred.

185
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,760
It's me, for example.

186
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,640
I'll slap you now.

187
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,960
Do you particularly hate me.

188
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,760
To chase me back.

189
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Right.

190
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
Just at this time.

191
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,360
He slapped you ten more times.

192
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,400
Do you hate him more?

193
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,520
And chased him back.

194
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,080
Is it?

195
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
This is what hatred means.

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
Who did the most damage?

197
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,640
The monster chased the man and attacked him.

198
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,880
Other people also don't have to worry about being attacked by the blame.

199
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
If we go up and have a rough fight,

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
then hatred will be messed up.

201
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
The night cat monster should come fight with me.

202
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
The result is to beat others.

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
In the end, hatred got out of control.

204
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Got it?

205
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,640
Got it.

206
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,040
Understand.

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I've been talking for half a day.

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you pull people together?

209
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Did you shout?

210
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,640
I've just missed a treatment and got into the book.

211
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,520
I am now designing such a weapon.

212
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
I call this weapon a thousand-machine umbrella.

213
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
Yes, you.

214
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,880
It turns out that you have already thought it over.

215
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,040
Still keep it from me.

216
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
There are two materials left.

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
There are two forms.

218
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
There is no way to switch at will.

219
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
When I finish the design

220
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
Are you going to kill all sides?

221
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Shook the whole Glory.

222
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,960
Good.

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Then I will wait for you.

224
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
The day when the thousands of umbrella was formed.

225
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,960
My research failed.

226
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
I've sealed off a thousand umbrellas.

227
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,000
Is there not enough material?

228
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm going to brush a copy to make materials.

229
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
You wait for me.

230
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,520
Is there someone wants to form a team?

231
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
Are there any team members？

232
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Is there a shortage of therapists?

233
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,080
Count me in!

234
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
This is a good attack.

235
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,280
Should soon be able to pull hatred?

236
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,320
Let you be the first to be taken away.

237
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,240
This ..

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll let you make the package to take you to death.

239
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
The second guest.

240
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,600
You are the third.

241
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,360
Treatment, the last one to die.

242
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Forget it, forget it, die, die.

243
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
I am now in a bad mood so just let them die

244
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
Reward for this copy.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
Leave it to me to enjoy.

246
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Yes, go.

247
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
Found cat demon.

248
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,440
Knight buddy.

249
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Cut it down.

250
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,640
The sharpshooter opened fire.

251
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,280
Everybody, come on!

252
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,400
Thief buddy.

253
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Knight buddy carry it.

254
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,200
Add blood.

255
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
What happened to you? Didn't you see he was hurt?

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,200
The little thoughts of Moon are too obvious.

257
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,680
This Jun Moxiao.

258
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,440
I don't know whether he's playing dumb or really stupid.

259
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
Add blood.

260
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,520
Jun Moxiao! Add blood to the sharpshooter!

261
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
Add blood to the sharpshooter.

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
Jun Moxiao! What's wrong with you?

263
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Can't you see there's no blood left?

264
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,120
Add blood.

265
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,120
What the hell.

266
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,040
Brother, brother, add blood.

267
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
Can't add.

268
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,520
If I add the hatred will get out of control.

269
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
I'll let you add it.

270
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,640
What are you afraid of when I hate you?

271
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
But you need one hand to skate.

272
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Can't hold back hatred.

273
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Cat monster will turn to attack me.

274
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
Just like the three of them.

275
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Did you mean it?

276
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Do you want to pit me?

277
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
Take the reward yourself.

278
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,960
This is not your purpose.

279
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,040
The reward for customs clearance of duplicates is valuable.

280
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
Give a few in vain.

281
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,040
Is it worthy to take someone inexperienced with you?

282
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
So you decided at the beginning.

283
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Use them to lower the blood of the night cat monster.

284
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
Triggering the attack of the night cat monster.

285
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,680
Have to say

286
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
this is a clever move by you.

287
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,720
It's just the two of us now.

288
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
Why don't we kill the night cat monster together?

289
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
Give me half of your reward.

290
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,560
Half.

291
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
But I like to take it alone.

292
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,760
You're crazy. I'm dead. You can't live either.

293
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
The night cat monster has reached the stage of rampage.

294
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
You can't handle it alone.

295
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,800
When the time comes, nobody will get anything.

296
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,040
Idiot, you.

297
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
I remember you.

298
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
Do you know our moon association's ability?

299
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,080
You're done.

300
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,560
A man wants to kill the night cat monster alone.

301
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,280
With a skill of treatment.

302
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,240
I see how can you kill it.

303
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,640
Congratulations to players Yue Zhongmian

304
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,600
Jun Moxiao a shot through

305
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,360
Shield assassin.

306
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,680
Finish the first kill of Forest Green.

307
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
First kill, first kill, first kill.

308
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,000
First kill.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,040
Fighting God, I really want to meet you.

310
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
First kill, first kill, first kill.

311
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
All stood up and saluted the great god.

312
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
God's Operation, God's King.

313
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Impossible.

314
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Jun Moxiao!

315
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
Jun Moxiao!

316
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
Dare to rob my first kill.

317
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
Do you think bully me is easy?

318
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,520
Hey!

319
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,200
Hello, Director Cao.

320
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,960
Yes, it's me, Chang.

321
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Report?

322
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,360
The report will be sent to you tonight.

323
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,120
I have already settle the title.

324
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,880
Is...

325
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,200
Shocked! Jia Shi changed the color of their team uniforms!

326
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,120
Maple leaves no longer brighter than the flowers in February.

327
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,880
What do you think?

328
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,640
Not good!

329
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
Then there is a name.

330
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Why are flowers so red.

331
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,840
Because there are always green leaves to match.

332
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,360
Wei Cao will not be happy about that.

333
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,480
Then

334
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,360
All right, all right, I'll go back to the club now.

335
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,720
You wait for me.

336
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,960
Mu Qiu.

337
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
No matter how rare the materials are.

338
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
How difficult is it to upgrade.

339
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
I will do everything I can.

340
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
To revive your genius work.

341
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Take it.

342
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,560
Standing on the Top of Glory.

343
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
What are you doing?

344
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,280
Network manager!

345
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,840
Boss.

346
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,640
Smelly boy.

348
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,280
Can see the great god again.

349
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
He really retired like this.

350
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,720
There is no need to wait and see.

351
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
I mean, what if he comes back.

352
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,560
You don't believe in yourself.

353
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,680
Or don't believe me.

354
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,880
What should I say if people ask?

355
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
Say that there are some connection

356
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
between my coming and his leaving?

357
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,160
Say I drove out.

358
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,800
Said you drove out Jia Shi's hero.

359
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
Good.

360
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
Such praise.

361
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Why don't you hurry up and take it?

362
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
Is this praising me?

363
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,760
Can drive away the strongest .

364
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,080
That means you are better than him.

365
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
As long as most people approve of you

366
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,480
The opinions of a small number of people

367
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
are not important at all.

368
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,520
How many people do you think

369
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,240
will care about an old man?

370
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Will it be this smooth?

371
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
Why are you so nervous?

372
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,040
Is it because you think you are inferior to Ye Qiu

373
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,360
can't be the captain of jiashi?

374
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,920
Or feel youself unworthy of the account Leaf of Autumn?

375
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
The title of fighting god.

376
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,840
Who said that?

377
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Do you want to be commented like that？

378
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,840
Of course not.

379
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
If you don't behave well

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
this is what everyone will say soon.

381
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,720
If you don't want to do this

382
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,240
Then tell everyone with your capacity

383
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
You are the captain of Jiashi.

384
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Ye Qiu.

385
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
In less than a few months

386
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Who will remember a retired person.

387
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
Why are you again? Get out.

388
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,080
I am a reporter.

389
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,720
Get out.

390
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,600
Excuse me, excuse me.

391
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
The flowers will arrive soon.

392
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Who are you?

393
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
We are sending flowers to the leaders and really need to hurry

394
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,960
Go in.

395
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,760
Thank you.

396
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,040
What do you do?

397
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm here to send flowers.

398
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,320
The lead is waiting!

399
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,360
Hurry! Let me in!

400
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,960
Hurry up.

401
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,800
Okay, is everything ready?

402
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Three, two, one, go

403
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,200
Dear audience friends,

404
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Welcome to Jiashi club.

405
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,920
The scene of the press conference.

406
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
The next

407
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,600
let's give a big round of applause.

408
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,240
Welcome Tao Xuan, the boss of Jiashi club.

409
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Bring us a new round of strategic deployment.

410
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
Applause!

411
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Tao Xuan.

412
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
I'm very happy today

413
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,800
to be with so many

414
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
friends supporting Jiashi Team

415
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
to communicate together.

416
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Your enthusiasm

417
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,560
touched me a lot.

418
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,560
Meanwhile, it makes me feel a little ashamed.

419
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
Because today's press conference

420
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
I want to tell you one

421
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,880
sad story.

422
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,560
The textbook of Glory

423
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,560
our most beloved captain

424
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Ye Qiu

425
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Just a few days ago

426
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,360
made the decision to left the job of captain.

427
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,400
About Ye Qiu's Retirement as Captain

428
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
whether as his boss

429
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,440
He really left

430
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,640
We all know.

431
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
Now the Glory League

432
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
The level of competition is getting higher and higher.

433
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,120
The intensity of competition is rising.

434
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,960
Up to 80 hours of work training per week

435
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,200
It really exhausted the old players physically and mentally.

436
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
Great mental pressure

437
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,880
Club

438
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,600
Too much.

439
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
He also tried to persuade Ye Qiu

440
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
to act as the consultant to help the team.

441
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,360
Unfortunately, Ye Qiu's own will is strong.

442
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,640
We deeply regret his refusal.

443
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,720
But still,

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
will give Jia Shi old captain

445
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,760
100% respect and understanding.

446
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
Boss

447
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
I am deeply sorry for

448
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,720
not being careful just now.

449
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,280
The abominable act of sprinkling a few drops of water.

450
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,320
Exasperating.

451
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,960
Why don't you deduct another five yuan?

452
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,720
What's the use of money.

453
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
And can't change back to my great god.

454
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
As a veteran who has fought for ten years.

455
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,200
Ye Qiu accompanied with Glory.

456
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,640
It's been ten years.

457
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,360
For many people including me

458
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,400
Ye Qiu

459
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
is the legend of an era

460
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,840
I will never see that Ye Qiu again.

461
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,480
He brought glory to Jiashi's three championships.

462
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Strictly speaking

463
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
the retired one is Ye Qiu.

464
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
Leaf of Autumn

465
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
is still stay in Jiashi.

466
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,560
But the Leaf of Autumn without Ye Qiu

467
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,240
is like an empty shell without soul.

468
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,800
Ye Qiu's retirement is regrettable.

469
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
But Jiashi still has to move on.

470
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,400
Will I never see Ye Qiu again?

471
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,360
His departure

472
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,240
doesn't mean the legend will end.

473
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,440
You are the least qualified person to say this now.

474
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
He just give us the legendary baton in his hand

475
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,200
to our growing next generation.

476
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,040
We will take the baton from his hand.

477
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,000
You, you, get away.

478
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,040
Here comes the rookie king of our professional league .

479
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,000
Sun Xiang

480
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,040
Hi boy

481
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,360
Hand me the laptop.

482
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,080
Where?

483
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,240
Bar.

484
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,440
It's a rookie king

485
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,240
I can take the baton from Ye Qiu's hand.

486
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
This honor

487
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
as the captain of Jiashi

488
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,640
On the very day when Ye Qiu left office

489
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
Just a rookie king

490
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Want to replace Ye Qiu

491
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
It's still 800 years early.

492
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,880
What was given to me with the account number.

493
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,080
is the trust from the predecessor.

494
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you like e-sports.

495
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,320
What?

496
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,120
If you like it

497
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,320
Take all this as glory.

498
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,680
Rather than showing off.

499
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,680
It was said that all this was regarded as glory.

500
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Rather than showing off.

501
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,680
Then why are you showing off?

502
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
Quickly Formulate Operational Strategies.

503
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,160
In order to complete the transformation of the old and new Jiashi

504
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,280
in the shortest time.

505
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,200
I didn't have proper manner?

506
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
Then I'll show you.

507
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
what is it like when really lack of manner.

508
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,640
It's really a lot of comments.

509
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,040
The keyboard men is here.

510
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,960
Everyone is interacting with you.

511
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,760
Captain Sun.

512
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,480
You got the caption from Ye Qiu.

513
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,080
just now.

514
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,040
Do you think you have the confidence

515
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,680
that you are qualified for this position?

516
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
In other words,

517
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,280
Are you confident enough that you can be as good as Ye Qiu?

518
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,320
As good as Ye Qiu?

519
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
If that's all I want

520
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,280
at that time

521
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
I wwould not sign the contract

522
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,720
Ten years ago,

523
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
the biggest teams now didn't even have a prototype

524
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,120
at that time.

525
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Yes, yes.

526
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
That's why Jiashi has the title of

527
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
the first rich and powerful family in Glory

528
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,160
First

529
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
No, what I want to say is

530
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
If put the king of that year

531
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
into the current league

532
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,400
he might not even get a third place.

533
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,640
This is the reality.

534
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,280
Strong teams emerge in large numbers.

535
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,520
If you are still immersed in past achievements

536
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
then your path can only become narrower and narrower.

537
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
And finally get left far behind

538
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,680
Since I have chosen to accept this honor

539
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
as the captain of Jiashi,

540
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,000
I have only one goal:

541
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
From now on, when everyone talks about Jiashi

542
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
no longer talk about the Triple-crowned King of the year

543
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,560
but the current No.1 team

544
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,680
Leaf of autumn belongs to Ye Qiu!

545
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Good

546
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
This is beautiful

547
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,120
Great!

548
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,240
In fact, he is right.

549
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,520
What do you mean?

550
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,000
Old people will retire and new people will emerge in large numbers.

551
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,000
This is a natural law that no one can change.

552
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
You, you say it again

553
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,680
But ..

554
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
Old people are more than deserters.

555
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,800
The newcomers are not invincible.

556
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,960
In the world of Glory

557
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,000
There has never been any new or old people.

558
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,480
Yeah.

559
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,640
In the world of Glory,

560
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,880
only exsists passion and love.

561
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,840
There is no longer Ye Qiu in the league.

562
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,400
But Jiashi and Leaf of autumn

563
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,720
will still dominate the league!

564
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
I don't know unless I fight

565
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
Yes.

566
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
You don't know unless you fight.

567
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
Empty eyes and slow movements.

568
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
How long has it been since I saw you?

569
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,320
This is how you abandon yourself?

570
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,560
I finally found out that in this world

571
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,640
There are things that are more difficult than playing glory

572
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,440
So you are not abandoning yourself

573
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,240
but to make a new start?

574
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
This new start

575
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm afraid that it won't work.

576
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,800
What you haven't had time to take away

577
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,760
I brought you

578
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Did you watch the live broadcast?

579
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,400
Too angry to finish.

580
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,680
so shut it down.

581
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,200
Don't look at it anymore

582
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
Are you worrying that I can't stand it?

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm afraid Sun Xiang can't stand it anymore.

584
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,960
My comrades know me best.

585
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,120
The president took the first killing of the night cat monster yesterday.

586
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,960
When did the president become so powerful.

587
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,600
It seems that the president is using someone else's ability.

588
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,120
With the light of the great god.

589
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,560
Yes, everyone's dead.

590
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,360
He was the only one who stood firm until the end.

591
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,680
I heard that all depends on Jun Moxiao

592
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,240
One man killed the chief alone.

593
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
Jun Moxiao again.

594
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Who is Jun Moxiao on earth?

595
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,160
Another one like Sun Xiang.

596
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,440
The garbage who doesn't respect predecessors.

597
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
As a journalist

598
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,000
I have an obligation to unveil your ugly face.

599
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Jun Moxiao! Shameless!

600
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
In order to embezzle the hidden leader.

601
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,000
Deliberately not to treat the whole team.

602
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Attention, everyone.

603
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,520
Jun Moxiao! Shameless!

604
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,800
In order to embezzle the hidden leader.

605
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Deliberately not to treat the whole team.

606
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,880
Be careful, everyone.

607
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,160
Jun Moxiao! Shameless!

608
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,440
In order to embezzle the hidden leader.

609
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,200
Deliberately not to treat the whole team.

610
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Be careful, everyone.

611
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
Team up, team up.

612
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Team up!

613
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,000
We have fighting gods here!

614
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Team up, team up.

615
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,200
Team up!

616
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
We have fighting gods here!

617
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,000
What are you doing?

618
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,320
Because of you.

619
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
I can't even form a team now.

620
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,480
I know. New guy.

621
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,280
This matter is to tell you.

622
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,560
In the future, we should respect our predecessors.

623
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,800
Remember?

624
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
You are angery?

625
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Let's see

626
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,360
We know each other now

627
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
You take me in

628
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,240
How about a good cooperation?

629
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
I swear to abuse him

630
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
I think he wants to cooperate well

631
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
He said yes

632
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
The Sun Xiang also wants to surpass Ye Qiu

633
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,560
I knew about Ye Qiu's retirement

634
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,840
Your heart is on fire

635
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,600
Let him do it alone

636
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
None of us will help

637
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
Let the Spider Lord kill him

638
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,560
On condition that you attract the monster.

639
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,200
What are you waiting for?

640
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,560
Let's go

641
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,960
We're about to meet the Spider Lord.

642
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll drive the monster first.

643
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,400
Okay, we'll wait for you to stabilize the hatred.

644
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
Come and work

645
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,000
Come with me

646
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
What kind of trap is this

647
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,760
Is he off  the line

648
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,240
It's as simple as that

649
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
What do you think

650
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
To create the illusion of almost no blood

651
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,920
Let's be happy

652
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,720
And then smack us in the face

653
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,720
Looks like the last experience

654
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,200
impacted you a lot.

655
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
In this USB

656
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,880
is a collection of all the matches that Ye Qiu has done .

657
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,400
You go and show it to everyone now.

658
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,640
It's still working

659
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,280
Why can't it be used

660
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,520
Wait

661
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,320
Did I just

662
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,280
Put my great god's lateral view in it?

663
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,040
No, no, I have to check again

664
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,440
What face do you see in the highlights of the competition?

665
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,560
What do you know

666
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,120
The match was well played.

667
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,680
It's just technical charm

668
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,600
And my great god

669
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,600
He also has charisma.
