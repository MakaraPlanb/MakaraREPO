2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,340
It’s heavily guarded.

4
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,060
My power is too weak

5
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
to push in.

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,620
But if I throw this chance away,

7
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,620
I might not

8
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,020
have another one to get to
Purple Moon Spring.

9
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,660
So, the intruder
in the Purple Moon Spring

10
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,060
turned out to be Goddess Houchi
from the Qingchi Palace.

11
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,660
You are quite courageous, young Goddess.

12
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,780
Back then, your Qingchi Palace
provided shelter

13
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,260
for the Demon King’s foe
who killed his son.

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,420
Now you still dare to come to
the Xuanjing Palace?

15
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
He knows I’m from the Qingchi Palace,

16
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,980
but doesn’t show any hostility to me.

17
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,940
He can’t be Sen Hong,
the eldest Prince of the Demons.

18
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,140
May I ask who you are, Your Lordship?

19
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,580
I’m just a guest of the Demon King,

20
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,140
who’s now living in the Xuanjing Palace.

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,220
A guest?

22
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,900
You’re really calm
after knowing my identification.

23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,780
I’m impressed by your temperament.

24
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,860
I don’t like interfering
with others’ business.

25
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,940
What do the grudges
between you and the Demon King

26
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
have anything to do with me?

27
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,100
Why did you choose to save me?

28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,060
The business
of those who are good-looking

29
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,460
is also of my business.

30
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,340
His status in the Xuanjing Palace
must be high.

31
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,140
Thank you, then.

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,660
But don’t worry,

33
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,980
I came here without any ill intention.

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,780
I came here only to look for
an old friend.

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,100
And old friend?

36
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,140
While you’re staying in
the Xuanjing Palace,

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,780
have you ever seen Demon Lord Ziyue?

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,660
That guy?

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,540
He’s just a

40
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,700
nasty guy who wears a mask all the time.

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,260
Why do you look for him?

42
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,740
To be honest,

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,900
Demon Lord Ziyue is my... beloved one.

44
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,340
What did you call him?

45
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,580
My beloved one.

46
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,100
You ever saw him?

47
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,620
Long ago,

48
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,460
I followed my father
to the Xuanjing Palace.

49
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,740
I fell in love with him

50
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,420
at first sight

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,900
and have been missing him
for tens of thousands of years.

52
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,420
Really?

53
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,820
Really.

54
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,980
I don’t want to suffer
from the lovesickness anymore.

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,300
That’s why I came to the third heaven.

56
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,300
Could you please tell me

57
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,900
where Demon Lord Ziyue is now?

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,860
He’s in the Xuanjing Palace.

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,100
Do you really want to see him?

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,460
I do.

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,540
Would you like to help me with that?

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,380
If he and I form marital ties
in the future,

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,420
I promise I will requite your kindness.

64
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,140
I would. Of course I would.

65
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,340
As far as I know,

66
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,340
at this time every day, Demon Lord Ziyue

67
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,220
would be bathing
in the Purple Moon Spring.

68
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,140
If you go there now,

69
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,180
you will surely find him.

70
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,420
Thank you so much!

71
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,860
Never mind.

72
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,140
When you two get married,

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,220
don’t forget to invite me for a drink.

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,300
That’s very kind of you.

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,540
I feel deeply grateful.

76
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,180
May I ask your name?

77
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,180
I promise I will invite you
for a drink in the future.

78
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,820
No need to ask, young Goddess.

79
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,540
I’m sure we will meet again.

80
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,780
Master.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,380
From that young Goddess
from the Qingchi Palace,

82
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,940
I didn’t sense any air of Chaos
of Master Shanggu.

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,060
Besides, she didn’t recognize you.

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Is it possible that
she’s not the one we are looking for?

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,140
No matter who she really is,

86
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,820
I’m going to test her today.

87
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,340
Your Highness.

88
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,460
Your Highness,

89
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,620
I came here with my younger sister

90
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,740
for the peace talks
between the Immortals and the Demons.

91
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,180
Younger sister?

92
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,260
Oh, it’s Princess Jingzhao.

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,340
Sorry for my lack of manners.

94
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,140
You are Jingzhao!

95
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,580
Your whole family is Jingzhao!

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,220
But the Black and White Evils told me

97
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,540
that Your Highness came here alone.

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,620
So why has Princess Jingzhao

99
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,260
also come to the third heaven?

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
She loves to have fun.

101
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,380
Please forgive her, Your Highness.

102
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,460
Loves to have fun?

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,580
What if I don’t forgive her?

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,220
The third heaven
is a sacred place of ours.

105
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,940
Only powerful demon lords

106
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,140
can come here for cultivation.

107
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,020
This is not where
you can come to have fun

108
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,460
and then leave at will.

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,380
Then, I’d like to take the punishment
for my sister.

110
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,900
You can punish me as your rules.

111
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,380
You claimed in this letter

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
that as long as my father gave you
the Purple Jade Whip,

113
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,700
you would give us
ten blessed fairylands in return.

114
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,620
Is that true?

115
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,180
Apart from that,

116
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,740
we would like to
share out equally with you

117
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,980
the God vessels
reopened by the God Realm.

118
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,500
Just now I claimed

119
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,500
to punish Princess Jingzhao,

120
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,660
but that was just a joke.

121
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,580
Anyway, the peace talks
are of great importance,

122
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
which need my father’s decision.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,500
But he is cultivating himself
in seclusion right now.

124
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,900
I assure you
that when he is done with that,

125
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,420
I will pass him the message.

126
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,740
That’s good.

127
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,820
The Immortals and the Demons have been
warring for tens of thousands of years,

128
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,740
which harms both sides.

129
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,460
To have peace negotiations

130
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,540
is beneficial to both sides.

131
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,620
No, that can wait.

132
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,620
Your Highness, your eye...

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,140
What happened to it?

134
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,380
It was just a tiny accident

135
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,700
when I was playing with my sister.

136
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,020
It’s said that Princess Jingzhao
is gentle and graceful.

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,380
I didn’t expect that she also had
her pampered and willful side.

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Besides, after meeting her today,

139
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,180
I just have a sense of déjà vu.

140
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,260
Your Highness, I know
you are of great attainments.

141
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,420
I guess your sister

142
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,500
is just as outstanding as you.

143
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,580
So I wonder

144
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,260
if I have the honor to get to know her.

145
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,060
You’re flattering us, Your Highness.

146
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,940
She and I still have other things to do.

147
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,340
Excuse us.

148
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,020
Let’s go.

149
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,660
Why in such a hurry, Your Highness?

150
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,860
Now the renowned physician from
the Fox Clan, Beichi, is in our palace.

151
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,980
Beichi is Houchi’s assumed name.

152
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,260
She’s in the Xuanjing Palace?

153
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,420
Why don’t you let her

154
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,980
check your wound, Your Highness?

155
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,060
Excuse me.

156
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,260
Why hasn’t Houchi come back yet?

157
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,940
Master Beichi, are you in?

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,060
Who is there?

159
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,940
It’s you!

160
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,900
How come you have that power?

161
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,220
You are one of the Immortals, right?

162
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,420
Lady Fengran.

163
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,900
You have been absent-minded
all the way here.

164
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,460
What’s the matter?

165
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,900
It has nothing to do with you.

166
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,100
We are tied by the same Magic Rope.

167
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
Even we may not live and die together,

168
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,780
we are supposed to help each other.

169
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,540
Not to mention that you have helped me

170
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,500
come to the Xuanjing Palace
for the peace talks.

171
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,180
If you encounter difficulty,

172
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
I won’t stand by.

173
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
You are right.

174
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,620
We have to act together.

175
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,260
When it’s getting late,

176
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,260
enter the Xuanjing Palace with me again.

177
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,780
What for?

178
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,860
I’m afraid Houchi is in the palace.

179
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,500
Because of me, the Demon King

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
has a grudge against the Qingchi Palace.

181
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,140
If his men find out
Houchi’s real identity,

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,740
I’m afraid she will be in danger.

183
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,660
The Xuanjing Palace is well guarded.

184
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,540
Even though it’s the two of us,

185
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
we may not be able to break in.

186
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,540
Don’t worry. I have my way.

187
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Demon Lord Ziyue?

188
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,620
Come here.

189
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,420
Massage my head.

190
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,860
It doesn’t sound like him.

191
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
You little bowerwoman.

192
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,660
Why are you still standing there?

193
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Little bowerwoman?

194
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,180
If you manage to please a God like me,

195
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,380
I will allow you to stay and serve me.

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,220
God?

197
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,980
Sir,

198
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,580
how do you like the massage?

199
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,740
Not bad.

200
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,780
Go on.

201
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,780
Except for staying
in the Xuanjing Palace,

202
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,140
have you travelled across
the Three Realms?

203
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,460
Of course.

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Then have you ever been to
Mount Lookout?

205
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,980
It’s you!

206
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,540
What?

207
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,500
Aren’t you happy

208
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,740
to see your beloved one?

209
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,260
I thought

210
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,500
you would like me to dress like this.

211
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,980
How come it’s you?

212
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,780
Didn’t you come to the Xuanjing Palace

213
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,340
to see me?

214
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,020
This fan belongs to Demon Lord Ziyue.

215
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,380
Why did you go to the bamboo house
on Mount Lookout?

216
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,100
Do you know Boxuan?

217
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,140
Shanggu!

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,860
I finally found you!

219
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Please mind your conduct.

220
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,300
You must be drunk

221
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,140
and mistaken.

222
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,340
I’m Houchi.

223
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,580
Not Shanggu as you called.

224
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,180
You are her!

225
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,620
Let go of me!

226
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,980
Let go!

227
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,940
Shanggu!

228
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,260
Where is Houchi?

229
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,500
Could she be here?

230
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,140
Who’s that bold
to intrude into the Purple Moon Spring?

231
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,340
I am Nanmu, a physician

232
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,500
invited to the palace by Prince Sen Yu.

233
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,780
I came with my teacher
to diagnose and treat Li.

234
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,180
Bai...

235
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,020
Bai...?

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,220
You know me?

237
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,620
He doesn’t recognize me?

238
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,540
Master said he saw Bai Jue
in the Water Mirror.

239
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,900
But I don’t sense any air of God
from him.

240
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,420
Maybe he’s not Bai Jue.

241
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,740
But what if he hides his power
on purpose?

242
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,580
Won’t I offend him

243
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,740
by just standing like this?

244
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,220
Should I salute

245
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,420
or not salute?

246
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,380
But his spiritual power is so weak...

247
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,260
Qingmu!

248
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,100
Shang... Shang...

249
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,940
Let’s go!

250
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,580
Go.

251
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,860
Master.

252
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,940
Did that young Goddess
from the Qingchi Palace recognize you?

253
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,020
No, she didn’t.

254
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,940
I heard that Sen Yu

255
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,940
newly invited a renowned physician
from the Fox Clan here.

256
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,660
It must be disguised by Houchi.

257
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,260
The one who came along with her

258
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,140
looks extremely like True God Bai Jue,

259
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
but he also didn’t recognize me.

260
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,860
His spiritual power
is exquisite and pure.

261
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
But that’s not rare
among the best Lords.

262
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,340
Master,

263
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,060
what do you think
their true identities are?

264
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,260
Are they really the ones
you’re looking for,

265
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,940
or is this just a conspiracy
of Wu Huan and Muguang

266
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,540
aiming to take sounding?

267
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,140
No rush.

268
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,620
I still have many facts to find out.

269
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,420
But I’m very certain about the fact

270
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,660
that Houchi is Shanggu.

271
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,340
She is still wearing

272
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,580
the bracelet Bai Jue gave her as a gift.

273
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,660
Back then, True God Bai Jue

274
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,540
deliberately spared us
the last God breaths

275
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
so that we could survive.

276
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,420
Though we became much weaker,

277
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,500
at least we got the chance
to start afresh.

278
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,860
That hateful Ice Cube spared me,
so what?

279
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,580
He didn’t believe in me

280
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,500
and led to Shanggu’s death.

281
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,380
If I see him again,

282
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,820
I must dismember him into pieces

283
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,380
to have my hatred slaked!

284
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,620
Yeah!

285
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,420
That hateful Ice Cube
has disappeared for 60,000 years.

286
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,460
I bet he must get weaker.

287
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,220
- Watch your mouth!
- We...

288
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,580
Bai Jue was a True God after all.

289
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,660
How could you be that disrespectful?

290
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,860
I...

291
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,100
I was just chiming in with you, Master.

292
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,100
I can curse him.

293
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,340
You can’t.

294
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,420
Got it.

295
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,460
I know that nasty Ice Cube
is in the lower realm,

296
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,540
but I don’t know where exactly.

297
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,580
I once looked for him on Mount Lookout,

298
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,580
and found his trace.

299
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,140
Later however,

300
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,460
across the Three Realms,

301
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,260
I couldn’t sense his existence anymore.

302
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,980
So,

303
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
is True God Bai Jue already...?

304
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,380
If he can die so easily,

305
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,540
he’s not that Bai Jue I know.

306
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,540
Yesterday, Master Beichi only showed
her tender medical care

307
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,260
without showing any immortal power.

308
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,660
But earlier today, I paid her a visit

309
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,060
and accidentally find out she
and her apprentice’s hiding identities.

310
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,780
What did you say?

311
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,460
I couldn’t believe it at first either.

312
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,300
But Your Highness, think about it.

313
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,420
The Immortals haven’t come to
the Xuanjing Palace

314
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,540
for tens of thousands of years.

315
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,580
Why is Prince Jingjian suddenly here?

316
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,660
And think about the physicians.

317
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,900
Can it be that…

318
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,060
they want to collaborate from within
with forces from outside

319
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,940
and plot something unlawful towards
our Xuanjing Palace?

320
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,660
Your Highness.

321
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,620
Look at my wound.

322
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,660
It was done by an immortal.

323
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,620
This...

324
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,660
Those two from the Immortals

325
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,740
are looking down upon
our Xuanjing Palace

326
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,740
and playing tricks so pretentiously.

327
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,340
Guards!

328
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,820
Wait, Your Highness.

329
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,740
What do you want to say?

330
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,100
Just today, Prince Jingjian
and Princess Jingzhao

331
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,340
came to the Xuanjing Palace
for peace talks.

332
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,260
Whether His Majesty will accept
peace talks is still unknown.

333
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,700
I don’t think capturing the Immortals
in a big way

334
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,900
is appropriate.

335
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,460
I suggest

336
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,020
that we send someone secretly

337
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,340
to find out the truth first
and then act accordingly.

338
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,420
Those two disguise themselves

339
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,580
and act quite strangely.

340
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,540
Even if they are not under
Jingjian’s commands,

341
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,060
they must have some bad intentions.

342
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,340
Right now my father
is cultivating himself,

343
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,980
which makes it a critical time now.

344
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,580
If anything goes wrong,

345
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,340
who can bear the consequences?

346
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,300
Guards!

347
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,940
Gather our soldiers

348
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,340
and search the palace!

349
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,460
Yes!

350
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,780
Where did you go?

351
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,740
Why are your clothes wet?

352
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,540
I came across Demon Lord Ziyue
by the Purple Moon Spring.

353
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,060
I asked him if he knew Boxuan.

354
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,580
And then a small incident happened.

355
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,340
What was it?

356
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Did you get bullied?

357
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,460
No big deal.

358
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,780
But when he touched my bracelet,

359
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,180
there was this spiritual power

360
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,500
which made me leave there immediately.

361
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,820
I guess

362
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,460
there must be a connection
between him and Boxuan.

363
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,100
Did he find out your true identity?

364
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,460
Houchi,

365
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,660
we have to leave here immediately.

366
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,500
That Li acted quite weirdly.

367
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,260
Just now,

368
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,820
she attempted to enter your room
to murder you.

369
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,780
Fortunately, you were not there.

370
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,660
But my identity as an immortal
has exposed.

371
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,580
We have to leave right now.

372
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay.

373
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,180
Let’s leave immediately.

374
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,300
We need to find Fengran first.

375
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,060
Search there!

376
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,100
Come.

377
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,660
Hurry! Come on!

378
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,100
Something must’ve happened
to the Demons.

379
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,300
- Let’s go check.
- Let’s go.

380
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,220
Chang Qin.

381
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,100
I didn’t expect them to know each other.

382
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,340
Turns out though the Qingchi Palace
has declined,

383
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,900
it can’t be underestimated.

384
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,940
Why did you come to the third heaven?

385
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,220
Why can’t I?

386
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,340
This is...

387
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
No need to introduce him.

388
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,100
I know him. Prince Jingjian
from the Heavenly Palace.

389
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,740
Ten thousand years ago,

390
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,060
during the war in the Demon Region,

391
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
we met each other.

392
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,980
Cut it out. I don’t have much time.

393
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,940
What’s the matter?

394
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,820
I want to ask you

395
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
to take me to the Xuanjing Palace
secretly.

396
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,980
To the Palace?

397
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,180
Right now His Majesty
is cultivating himself in the Palace.

398
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,020
Once you show a little spiritual power,

399
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,340
he can sense it.

400
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,060
Do you want to seek your doom?

401
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,060
I know that of course.

402
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,260
It’s just that in order to meet
Demon Lord Ziyue,

403
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,300
Houchi is now in the Xuanjing Palace.

404
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,340
To save me, her father has already

405
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,820
had a grudge with the Demon King.

406
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,260
Now if...

407
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,460
I’m afraid it’s already too late.

408
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,500
What do you mean?

409
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,500
What you don’t know is that

410
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,460
something has happened in the Palace.

411
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,580
Sen Yu already ordered the soldiers
to search the entire Palace

412
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,820
for two undercover agents
from the Immortals.

413
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,820
I assume

414
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,740
Houchi is one of them.

415
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,180
What to do now?

416
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
If Sen Yu catches Houchi,

417
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,180
there will be a big trouble.

418
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,820
Lady Chang Qin,

419
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
the matter is of great importance.

420
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,820
I’m asking for your help.

421
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,580
If only Fengran and I
enter the Xuanjing Palace,

422
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,740
within less than two hours,

423
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,260
we will get Houchi out of there.

424
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,580
It’s not that I don’t want to help you.

425
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,500
It’s just...

426
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,740
Chang Qin.

427
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,180
Fine.

428
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,260
Make it one hour.

429
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,500
I will take you in there.

430
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Once you find Houchi,

431
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,900
get her out immediately.

432
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,820
Lord Chonghuo.

433
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,260
Lady Fengran from the Qingchi Palace

434
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,580
and Prince Jingjian from
the Heavenly Palace have intruded.

435
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,900
Prince Sen Yu has ordered you

436
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,500
to lead the soldiers to the Wujin Garden

437
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,260
to find

438
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,100
and kill her.

439
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,700
How bold is that Fengran!

440
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,540
She dares to intrude
into our Xuanjing Palace!

441
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,820
Is she looking down upon our soldiers?

442
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,420
Let’s go

443
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,940
and cut that phoenix into pieces.

444
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

445
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,180
Fengran came here to rescue me.

446
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,820
But she killed Sen Yu’s brother before.

447
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,180
They will kill her for sure!

448
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,020
I must go to the Wujin Garden
to save her!

449
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,980
I’ll go with you.

450
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,700
It’s the business of our Qingchi Palace.

451
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,940
As a Lord from the Heavenly Palace,

452
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,980
you don’t need to be involved.

453
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,700
Your Grace, don’t rush to refuse me.

454
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,540
It’s true that I’m not Fengran’s friend,

455
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,100
but Jingjian came with her.

456
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,460
I can’t let anything happen to Jingjian.

457
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Let’s go.

458
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,980
They live here.

459
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,340
Chang Qin?

460
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,940
Why are you with Fengran?

461
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,180
And why are you here?

462
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,500
Is it that... you knew

463
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,140
Beichi’s sinister plot long before?

464
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,660
The Feather Fire Whip?

465
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,260
I should’ve welcomed Lady Fengran

466
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,180
respectfully for visiting
our Xuanjing Palace, right?

467
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,260
Jingjian,

468
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,660
the Heavenly Emperor sent you here
for peace talks with us.

469
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,540
However, you are acting in collusion
with Fengran.

470
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,060
I wonder whether the Heavenly Emperor

471
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,020
asked you to play this double-game.

472
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,060
Your Highness.

473
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,540
I’m doing all this for a reason.

474
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,180
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

475
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,580
Forgive you?

476
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,780
Whoever teams up with Fengran

477
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,380
is an enemy of us Demons.

478
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,860
Fengran,

479
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,540
when you killed my younger brother
back then,

480
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
my father spared your life
for the sake of

481
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,940
God Gu Jun.

482
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,100
But now,

483
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,140
you still dare to
come to the third heaven?

484
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,700
Sen Yun not only killed my old man,

485
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,660
he also harmed the Human Realm

486
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,540
and bullied human beings.

487
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,780
Even if I hadn’t killed him,

488
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,220
many other righteous immortals would
for the peace of the Three Realms.

489
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,260
What did you say?

490
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,140
Sen Yu,

491
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,020
they’re here for a reason indeed.

492
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,740
Chang Qin,

493
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,740
Fengran killed the brother
of His Highness.

494
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,340
How could you have helped
Fengran and an immortal

495
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,580
to intrude into the Xuanjing Palace?

496
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,740
His Highness treats you so well.

497
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,180
You’re failing his trust.

498
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,740
This is between Sen Yu and me.

499
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,980
What’s it to do with you?

500
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,220
For what happened today,

501
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,660
I’m willing to ask for punishment
from His Majesty.

502
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,580
Whether His Majesty will punish me
or kill me,

503
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,580
I won’t complain a bit.

504
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
Qin, come here.

505
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,780
Sen Yu.

506
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,420
Since it’s me who brought Fengran in,

507
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,180
no matter what,

508
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,140
I must get her out safe and sound.

509
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,540
Chang Qin,

510
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,460
I appreciate your kindness.

511
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,860
But this is between me and him.

512
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,420
Sen Yu.

513
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,780
I will deal both the old and the new
grudges with you today.

514
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,620
You have allowed someone else
to bully and insult Chang Qin for years.

515
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,780
I’m going to

516
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,620
fix a heartless man like you for her.

517
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,620
Fengran!

518
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:44,900
Li!

519
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,500
Beichi?

520
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,220
I trusted you so much.

521
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,580
Yet you sneaked into the Xuanjing Palace
and cheated me.

522
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,300
Now you still dare to stand here?

523
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,340
If I didn’t come here,

524
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,220
I wouldn’t have had the chance
to see your sweetheart

525
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,140
attack by underhand means.

526
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,180
How deceitful and designing she is!

527
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,500
She was just on the spur of the moment.

528
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,780
On the spur of the moment?

529
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,140
Then let me ask you,

530
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,100
what spiritual power does Fengran have?

531
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,740
When you and Fengran are in a fight,

532
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,300
even it’s Jingjian or Chang Qin,

533
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,540
I bet they wouldn’t dare to interfere.

534
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,860
However, she beat Fengran off
with only one movement.

535
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,420
Given the profound
spiritual power she has,

536
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,220
you still need a renowned physician
to treat her?

537
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
How ridiculous that is!

538
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,860
Li,

539
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,860
how come you...?

540
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,460
Your Highness.

541
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,820
I was just worried about

542
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,260
that you might get hurt.

543
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,980
I didn’t consider much.

544
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
I didn’t expect that
I would hurt Fengran.

545
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,300
I only wanted to protect you.

546
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,780
But this woman. She’s up to no good.

547
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,740
She collaborates with the Immortals
and attempts to help Fengran.

548
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Don’t fall into her trap, Your Highness.

549
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,820
What a fragile

550
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,060
and pitiful girl!

551
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,300
Fengran is my fellow.

552
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,660
And I don’t have anything to do
with the Heavenly Palace.

553
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,980
I’ve been living on Qilian Mountains
for long

554
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,900
and feel bored.

555
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,900
I heard that the third heaven
was quite interesting.

556
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,340
So, I travelled here.

557
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,700
Fengran was worried about me.

558
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,500
That’s why she followed Jingjian here.

559
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,900
It’s all because of
my being excessively fond of play.

560
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,380
I caused this misunderstanding.

561
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,660
I apologize.

562
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,700
So, you are…?

563
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,580
Yeah, just like you have guessed.

564
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,500
This lowly fox

565
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,180
feared that I would expose
her dirty thoughts and fake looks.

566
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,540
So, she attempted to assassinate me.

567
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,460
Sen Yu.

568
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,620
Assassinating a Goddess

569
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,900
deserves death penalty.

570
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,420
If I kill this little fox now,

571
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,020
will you say no?

572
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,460
I heard that she once saved your life

573
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,740
and you must be grateful to her.

574
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,940
In this case,
I want to exchange her life

575
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,180
for Fengran’s life.

576
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Can I take Fengran away with me then?

577
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,700
Fengran, let’s leave here.

578
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,940
Impressive, Goddess Houchi.

579
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,020
Father.

580
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

581
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,100
Even Gu Jun

582
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,180
wouldn’t be so unbridled
in my Xuanjing Palace.

583
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,580
Your Majesty!

584
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,340
Fengran once saved my life.

585
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,500
I’m begging you to spare her.

586
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,620
Chang Qin,

587
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,220
your father and brother
sacrificed half of your clan

588
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,300
and saved me.

589
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,900
I’ve been treating you
as my own daughter.

590
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,860
And my three sons have treated you
as their own sister.

591
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,620
But now,

592
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,340
you’re pleading for mercy
for an outsider?

593
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,140
Have you forgotten
how Sen Yun got killed?

594
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,980
Houchi,

595
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,100
for the sake of your father,

596
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,500
I allow you to leave.

597
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,900
However, Fengran must stay.

598
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,620
Your Majesty,

599
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,500
as early as 10,000 years ago, Fengran

600
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,260
was sheltered by my father
in the Qingchi Palace.

601
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,740
You had a promise with him.

602
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,220
I guess you wouldn’t break it, right?

603
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,260
At that time, Gu Jun promised that

604
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Fengran would stay in the Qingchi Palace

605
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,740
and never set foot on the Demon Realm.

606
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,140
So, I spared her life.

607
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,060
But today, she not only
intruded into the Demon Realm,

608
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,500
but also went too far.

609
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Has she shown me enough respect?

610
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,980
Even if Sen Yun deserved death,

611
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,060
he was still the youngest prince
of my Xuanjing Palace,

612
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,540
and my... favorite son!

613
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,460
Your Majesty has a point.

614
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,500
But Fengran is a junior after all.

615
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,820
And she’s in charge of
the Qingchi Palace now.

616
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,580
If she gets killed by you today,

617
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,980
I’m afraid the Xuanjing Palace will be a
laughing stock across the Three Realms.

618
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,580
They will say that you bully the weaker.

619
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,140
Why don’t we wait for my father
to come back

620
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,300
and pay you a visit?

621
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,300
That will do both sides good.

622
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Well said.

623
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,980
But I wonder if your God power

624
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,700
matches your intelligence.

625
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,900
I heard that you gained
a good reputation on Mount Lookout.

626
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Today, I’d like to

627
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,460
test your cultivation for your father.

628
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,780
I want to see whether the fourth God
of the Three Realms

629
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,900
deserves the name Gu Jun granted you.

630
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,620
Your Majesty.

631
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,380
Though you’re the king of the Demons,

632
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,900
you’re only a Demigod.

633
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,180
You’re not qualified to challenge a God.

634
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,220
If you really want a fight,

635
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,260
fight with me.

636
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,180
Qingmu.

637
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,740
North Sea Lord?

638
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
I am.

639
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,620
Qingmu,

640
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,700
don’t get involved.

641
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,620
It’s not of your concern.

642
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,900
It’s the grudge between
the Qingchi and Xuanjing Palaces.

643
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,900
I must get involved

644
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,860
in your business.

645
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,420
Don’t be ridiculous!

646
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,500
North Sea Lord.

647
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,340
As a Lord from the Heavenly Palace,

648
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,700
are you sure you want to get involved
in other Palaces’ business?

649
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,700
Your Majesty,

650
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,700
you take your revenge

651
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
while I protect my man.

652
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,980
We’re both doing this
for personal relationships.

653
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
What personal relationship?

654
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,660
Don’t talk nonsense.

655
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,020
Your Majesty.

656
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,700
I’ve learned something today.

657
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
What is it?

658
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,940
They all say that the Demon King
is inferior to the Heavenly Emperor.

659
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,220
After meeting you today,

660
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,100
that saying has proved to be true.

661
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

662
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,340
Houchi.

663
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,180
You got your wild arrogance

664
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,140
from your father.

665
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,780
How am I inferior to that old dragon?

666
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,700
Back in the Qingchi Palace,

667
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,180
if a junior like Fengran

668
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,260
wanted to challenge me,

669
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,140
I would always grant them
some advantages,

670
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,900
such as wearing a blindfold myself.

671
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,900
Your Majesty, as the ruler of a realm,

672
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,260
though your God power is inferior
to the Heavenly Emperor’s,

673
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,540
you are one of the most powerful
Demigods after all.

674
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,060
If you use all your strength

675
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,420
to fight with a young Lord
who’s only a thousand years old,

676
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,620
and the words get out,

677
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,420
you will get laughed at for sure.

678
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,060
Houchi...

679
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,540
Goddess Houchi is right.

680
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
If my father were here,

681
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,580
I guess within three movements,

682
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,380
he would make
the North Sea Lord surrender.

683
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,540
However, Your Majesty is a Demigod.

684
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,060
I guess some ten movements

685
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,460
won’t be too many.

686
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,540
Goddess Houchi is resourceful.

687
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,620
She’s prodding Sen Jian into action.

688
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,700
Sen Jian will have to
accept the challenge.

689
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,620
Don’t forget that I taught her well.

690
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,460
Back then in the God Realm,

691
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,740
who could take advantage of her?

692
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,220
Qingmu,

693
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,980
I have no interest to bully you.

694
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,980
I will concede a few movements.

695
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,580
But I will still defeat and kill you.

696
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,220
You are generous indeed, Your Majesty.

697
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,740
If I can bear three movements of yours
by luck,

698
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,140
then all of them in this garden

699
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
can leave here with me.

700
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,980
Deal.

701
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,540
Father,

702
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,340
well...

703
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,020
Master.

704
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,580
It’s still unclear
whether Houchi is Shanggu.

705
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,340
If this North Sea Lord is Bai Jue,

706
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,300
then Houchi must be Shanggu.

707
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,900
I’m going to give Sen Jian a hand.

708
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,340
Let’s see if this Qingmu

709
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,700
can survive Sen Jian’s attacks
as a Lord.

710
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,660
Sen Jian.

711
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,420
Make him dead

712
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,780
within three movements.

713
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,980
Qingmu!

714
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,900
Are you all right?

715
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,540
I’m fine.

716
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,260
He can’t kill me that easily.

717
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,780
North Sea Lord, you deserve
your reputation.

718
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,940
I underrated you.

719
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,180
Let’s continue.

720
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,380
One last movement.

721
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,380
Your Majesty.

722
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,020
He’s badly injured.

723
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,940
Let me bear the last movement for him.

724
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,060
Houchi,

725
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,220
due to my respect to your father,

726
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,580
I’ve shown enough restraint.

727
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,900
If he can’t keep our deal,

728
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,100
I will have to show no more mercy.

729
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,780
Forget it.

730
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,780
There’s something

731
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,820
I have to tell you now
in case there’s no more chance.

732
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,020
Houchi,

733
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,700
I… I have lost my heart to someone.

734
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,940
Who is that person?

735
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,220
Just tell me.

736
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,180
I promise I will tell her.

737
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,580
If I die here today…

738
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,220
Don’t say inauspicious words.

739
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,220
You will get through this today.

740
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,740
After that,

741
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,780
I will grant anything you ask.

742
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,420
Really?

743
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,300
I mean…

744
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,340
I owe you on this today,

745
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,620
and I promise I will repay you
in the future.

746
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,620
Okay.

747
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,540
Demon King,

748
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,540
if you really want me dead,

749
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,380
I’m afraid you’ll have to
use more strength.

750
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,660
You overrate yourself.

751
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,420
Oh no!

752
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,100
His Majesty is using occult arts
of the Demons!

753
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,420
It’s my protective talisman.

754
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,020
It will protect you.

755
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,900
Father!

756
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,660
Qingmu!

757
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,780
It’s over.

758
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,820
Your Majesty, please keep your promise

759
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,700
and let Fengran and us leave.

760
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,220
Don’t, Father!

761
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,420
Sen Jian, let them leave.

762
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,140
Okay.

763
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,300
Fengran, you can leave.

764
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,060
If you intrude into
the third heaven ever again,

765
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,540
I will avenge my late son.

766
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,020
Houchi, let’s go.

767
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,140
Qin!

768
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,340
Is what Houchi said

769
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,740
true?

770
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,060
You…!

771
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,580
Master,

772
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,900
what’s that?

773
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,220
Such strong spiritual power!

774
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,940
The Taicang Spear!

775
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,420
The weapon of True God Bai Jue
reappeared in the world!

776
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,580
Hurry!

777
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,220
Take them to have a look
halfway up the mountain!

778
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,140
Yes.

779
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,060
Xianshan,

780
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,340
is that the Taicang Spear
once mentioned by Grandmaster?

781
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
Legend has it that Mount Lookout

782
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,260
used to be where True God Bai Jue
cultivated himself in the lower realm.

783
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,740
This spear is nourished by fire,

784
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,900
but still has such strong God power.

785
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,940
It must be the Taicang Spear!

786
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,380
The Taicang Spear finally reappeared
in the world.

787
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,260
According to His Majesty’s edict,

788
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,100
if we find weapons of Four True Gods,

789
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,300
we must send them back to
the Heavenly Palace.

790
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,700
You guys wait here.

791
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,620
Don’t come closer.

792
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,620
Xianshan!

793
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,100
Xianshan!

794
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,580
- The Fire Kylin!
- The Fire Kylin!

795
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,460
It’s the Divine Beast Fire Kylin!

796
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,420
The Fire Kylin...!

797
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,540
I’m Xianshan, an apprentice
of Lord Donghua.

798
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,420
I followed his order to come here
for the weapon of True God Bai Jue.

799
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,260
I don’t intend to offend
the Taicang Spear.

800
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,820
Please calm your anger.

801
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,980
Get lost!

802
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,180
Let’s go!

803
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,380
Let’s go back to report to Master.

804
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,540
Hurry up!

805
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,180
Greetings, Your Majesty.

806
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,300
Donghua,

807
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,780
what makes you so panic-stricken?

808
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,860
Your Majesty,

809
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,500
the Taicang Spear has reappeared
on Mount Lookout.

810
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,500
The Taicang Spear has reappeared?

811
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,500
That means we have the chance
to reopen the God Realm.

812
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Have you brought the Spear?

813
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,100
That’s what I’m going to
report to Your Majesty.

814
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,580
The Divine Beast Fire Kylin
appeared on Mount Lookout as well.

815
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,140
With the Fire Kylin guarding the Spear,

816
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,940
no one can approach a bit.

817
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,060
I have failed Your Majesty.

818
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,460
I didn’t bring the Taicang Spear here.

819
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,620
You mean Hongri also showed up
on Mount Lookout?

820
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

821
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,420
Since ancient times,

822
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,180
across the world,

823
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,580
God Hongri has been the only Fire Kylin.

824
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,180
So, I speculated the same
as Your Majesty.

825
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,060
But...

826
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,940
But what?

827
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,900
My apprentice, Xianshan, already
came to grips with the Fire Kylin.

828
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,140
He said that the Fire Kylin did have
extraordinary God power,

829
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,660
but much weaker
than that of Your Majesty.

830
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,980
Maybe it’s just the Fire Kylin’s soul.

831
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,700
How come?

832
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,020
At that time, Hongri and the other Gods

833
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,820
sacrificed themselves in the God Realm
when fighting against the Devils.

834
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,660
Now that his soul has appeared
on Mount Lookout,

835
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,380
it indicates Master Bai Jue

836
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,620
also left the God Realm

837
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,740
and once stayed on Mount Lookout.

838
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,300
Wait.

839
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,660
I have a very important matter

840
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,580
to ask you about.

841
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,980
May I have a word with you in private?

842
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,580
The appearance of that North Sea Lord

843
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,540
is so similar to that of Master Bai Jue.

844
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,980
And now the Taicang Spear
has shown up on Mount Lookout.

845
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,460
Perhaps there’s a connection
between the two...

846
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,500
Whatever the truth is,

847
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,380
the priority now is to get the Spear.

848
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,980
Mount Lookout is in the spotlight now.

849
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,060
The Demons may be attracted there.

850
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,520
Donghua.

851
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
Pass my edit immediately.

852
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,940
All Immortals and Lords
can join the scramble for the Spear.

853
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,820
Whoever can have the Spear under control

854
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,300
will be its owner.

855
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,340
But Your Majesty, if all the Immortals
and the Demons gather there,

856
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,660
I’m afraid there will be a disturbance.

857
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,660
Don’t worry.

858
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,660
I will also be there.

859
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,020
If any disturbance occurs,

860
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,900
I will personally handle it.
