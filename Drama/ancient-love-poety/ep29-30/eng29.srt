00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Qingmu,

4
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,160
do you think the True Gods really exist?

5
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,830
Sometimes, I want to ask them,

6
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,510
I didn’t do anything bad

7
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,360
during the 60,000 years,

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
but why people around me

9
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,040
left me one by one?

10
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,040
And my cultivation is failing.

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,520
You have to be saved

12
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,710
by the dragon core of someone else.

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,960
You’ve already done a good job.

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,590
You don’t need to comfort me.

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,590
It’ll be great if I can be a Goddess.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
In that case, I can hold power.

17
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
With great skills,

18
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,200
maybe there won’t be that many worries.

19
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,640
Houchi,

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,040
we don’t need to always aim high.

21
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,270
We envy the True Gods.

22
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,270
But the mortals envy us, you know?

23
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,000
What’s more,

24
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,550
you’ve absorbed the spiritual power
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,720
Becoming a Goddess
is just a matter of time.

26
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,830
In the future,

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,870
the name of Goddess Houchi

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,870
will be famed across the Three Realms.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
By then, thanks to you,
I can be haughty.

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you serious?

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,190
Of course.

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,640
But it’s a long time

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
before I become a Goddess.

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,360
I want to be haughty right away

35
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,550
and make a show of power.

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,640
No problem.

37
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,000
I will take you to travel
the Three Realms

38
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,360
after the Queen of Heaven’s birthday

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,830
to show all of them

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,470
the elegance of Goddess Houchi.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,270
Tomorrow, I will show all immortals

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,040
in the Heavenly Palace my elegance.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,790
You will go to the birthday banquet?

44
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,910
Why?

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,190
You don’t want me to go?

46
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,760
Are you hiding something from me?

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,120
Of course, I’m not.

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,320
If you want to go,

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I will go with you.

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,230
Don’t worry.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,870
After this is settled,

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,910
we will return to the Qingchi Palace.

53
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,640
Father and Boxuan love me so much.

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,270
I’m sure they won’t blame me.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,760
Houchi.

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,190
What will you do?

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,510
You mustn’t do stupid things for me.

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,320
I’m not stupid.

59
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,350
Trust me.

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,230
Your Grace, you haven’t recovered.

61
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,510
Please drink less.

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,400
It’s my own business.

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,560
How dare you try to intervene!

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
Why didn’t you stop her?

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,200
Your Grace.

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,280
Are you all right?

67
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,870
Just leave me alone.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,840
Your Grace.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,040
Go report to Her Highness
and His Majesty

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,430
that Princess Jingzhao is in a faint.

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,680
Her Highness knows

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,150
it’s not your fault.

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,320
You may leave now.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,350
Your Highness, please take it easy.

77
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,990
I didn’t use too much spiritual power.

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,590
Her Grace will be fine.

79
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,790
But I don’t understand

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
what you want to do.

81
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,790
Mother,

83
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,870
what happened...?

84
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,150
Jingzhao lost her dragon core

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,630
and her immortal power dispersed fast.

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,710
I’m afraid

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,630
she can’t hold her immortal body
for long.

88
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,400
Mother,

89
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,350
I’d like to transfer
some spiritual power to Jingzhao.

90
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,510
Spiritual power is not enough.

91
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,960
I’m afraid

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,070
Jingzhao won’t survive

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,400
without the dragon core.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
You may just leave.

95
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,720
I need to talk to your mother
in private.

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Yes.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,510
Huan.

98
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,510
I’ve been thinking for several days.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,120
Now I have a solution.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,630
If I give my dragon core to Jingzhao,

101
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,160
I’m sure the problem can be solved.

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
No way.

103
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,230
As the saying goes among the mortals,

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
“Parents are the bones on which
children sharpen their teeth.”

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Now she has become like this.

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,510
It’s because I didn’t teach her well.

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,630
Muguang.

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
You are the Heavenly Emperor.

109
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,230
If you lose your dragon core,

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,510
the Demons will cast covetous eyes on

111
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,230
the leaderless Immortals.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What will our Heavenly Palace face then?

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
What will all the immortals do then?

114
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,840
Have you forgot

115
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,160
Master Zhiyang’s entrustment?

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
We’ve been married for years.

117
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,470
After giving birth to Jingyang
and Jingjian,

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,280
I suffered a lot to have Jingzhao.

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,910
Do you remember that?

120
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,560
Of course.

121
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,560
I just conquered the Demon Realm.

122
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,510
Jingzhao was unborn.

123
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,600
It’s hard to build her Gold Dragon body.

124
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,000
You nourished her with spiritual veins

125
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,400
to keep her alive.

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,960
Jingzhao was being reckless,

127
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,560
which resulted in
the painful consequences.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,790
It’s indeed the bitter fruit
of her own doings.

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,030
But it’s urgent now.

130
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,560
She and I are linked together.

131
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
I can’t just watch her

132
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,400
getting weaker and weaker.

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Huan.

134
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,680
What are you doing?

135
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,720
I asked Lord Donghua about it.

136
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,190
He said the only way was

137
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,750
to let Qingmu suffer 49 thunder strikes

138
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,600
on the Green Dragon Platform.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,030
But in that case,

140
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,840
Qingmu will...

141
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
You are responsible for all beings.

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,310
You’ve always been fair.

143
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,030
You’ve never biased for
Jingyang and Jingjian.

144
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,280
I can understand whatever you do.

145
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,560
If you don’t want to be the bad one,

146
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,070
I will.

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,230
It’s my birthday tomorrow.

148
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,190
As your companion for so long,

149
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,790
this is my only request.

150
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,880
Jingyang.

151
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,280
Brother!

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,470
Don’t call me brother!

153
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,000
Jingyang,

154
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,910
I also feel sorry for Jingzhao.

155
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,190
But what is done is done.

156
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,030
It wouldn’t help
even if you killed Qingmu.

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Moreover,

158
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,750
he didn’t do that on purpose.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Why do you have to push so hard?

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,280
Because Jingzhao is my sister.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,910
It’s my responsibility to protect her.

162
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
But you.

163
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,750
You told Mother

164
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
that Fengran is the one you love.

165
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,070
Is it real?

166
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

167
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,960
When I was in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp,

168
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,160
if it were not Ziyuan who saved me,

169
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
I would’ve been killed by Fengran.

170
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
But you are in love with her.

171
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,400
Jingjian.

172
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,310
What on earth is on your mind?

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,960
If you still take me as your brother

174
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,160
and Jingzhao as your sister,

175
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,230
you should make a thorough break
with them.

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,120
If not, don’t take me as your brother.

177
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,630
I don’t have a brother like you!

178
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,070
I didn’t expect
though Houchi ignored her life

179
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,550
and forced her way into
the Pilgrimage Hall,

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,360
she was still late.

181
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,310
I felt worried when I heard

182
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,550
Mother was going to the Pilgrimage Hall.

183
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,960
So, I left Qingmu to Jingzhao.

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,550
But I didn’t expect that would happen.

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
I feel sorry for Jingzhao.

186
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,960
But I don’t want Qingmu

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
to be in a dilemma, either.

188
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,110
You feel sorry for your sister.

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
I also feel sorry for Houchi.

190
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
I know the consequences

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,110
of giving up the spiritual root.

192
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
But Jingzhao is really shameless.

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,800
Qingmu can’t return the dragon core

194
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
nor keep it now.

195
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,240
Only love can’t be required.

196
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,280
But Jingzhao just doesn’t understand.

197
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,720
Forget it.

198
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,190
It’s not your fault.

199
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,800
Seeing Houchi and Qingmu suffering that,

200
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,920
I hate myself for being unable
to do anything about it.

201
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,510
Lady Fengran.

202
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,550
There is a saying in the human world,

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
“Cross that bridge
when one comes to it.”

204
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,840
Maybe

205
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,360
there is a turn for the better.

206
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,310
I hope so.

207
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,800
Your Highness, do you have something
on your mind?

208
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,160
What do you mean by that?

209
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,190
When you feel happy,

210
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,550
you would call me Fengran.

211
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,190
When unhappy,

212
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,240
you would call me Lady.

213
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,190
You can’t hide your feelings

214
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,400
just like me.

215
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,600
I can’t believe Lady Fengran

216
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,960
observes me so carefully.

217
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,550
It’s because you saved my life.

218
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,240
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

219
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,160
Fengran is the girl I like.

220
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,750
Today, I don’t dare to let you in

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
and I can’t let you in.

222
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
She and I have

223
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,480
profound hatred.

224
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
But you are in love with her.

225
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Look. When you smile like this,

226
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,870
you are no longer a wood face

227
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,070
and look very nice.

228
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,040
Smile more.

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,870
Thank you.

230
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,720
For what?

231
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,870
We are good friends. Good friends.

232
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,720
Come on.

233
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,670
Cheers.

234
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,750
You are awake.

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,110
It’s you... who saved me?

236
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,920
Sure. Nobody else is here.

237
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,160
What’s your name?

238
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,750
How dared you break in
the Abyssal Ridge Swamp alone?

239
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,630
Do you want to die?

240
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,480
It’s not like you had a deadly sin.

241
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,280
Why?

242
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,160
Your family also abandoned you?

243
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,110
I...

244
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,720
Forget it.

245
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,430
Say no more if you don’t want to.

246
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,280
You are in this place now.

247
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,070
Learn how to protect yourself first.

248
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,630
Miss.

249
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,870
Please don’t worry about me.

250
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,070
Just go home.

251
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,920
I’m fine.

252
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,040
You are fine now

253
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,920
because I’m here.

254
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
But if I leave...

255
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,940
Look behind you.

256
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,280
You were scared.

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,670
You are too little

258
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,480
even to be their snack.

259
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,550
You actually smiled?

260
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,430
If a beast with greater spiritual power

261
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,550
comes to this wetland,

262
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,400
even I can’t protect you.

263
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,070
Miss.

264
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,430
Don’t worry about me.

265
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,720
It’s dangerous here.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
Go home as soon as possible.

267
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,480
Home?

268
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,480
Here is my home.

269
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,840
Forget it.

270
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,800
I’d take you to hide in the cave.

271
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,160
Let’s go.

272
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,430
If the old man knows

273
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,960
I saved an immortal,

274
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,110
he will scold me.

275
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,160
Oh no!

276
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
The old man wants me to be back.

277
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
What’s this?

278
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,550
It’s a phoenix feather.

279
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,480
The old man uses it

280
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,840
to carry the information.

281
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,280
I have to leave now.

282
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,510
Miss!

283
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,800
It’s urgent.

284
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,800
I have to leave now.

285
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,070
Be careful.

286
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,750
Miss, your...

287
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,870
Fengran, when will you know

288
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,360
that I’m the boy

289
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,990
you saved at that time?

290
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,360
Have you heard that

291
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,920
the one from the Qingchi Palace
would also come?

292
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,110
She made trouble at the birthday banquet

293
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,750
of Lord Donghua.

294
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,750
I wonder what will happen this time.

295
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,070
It’s been tens of thousands of years.

296
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,720
This is the liveliest feast.

297
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,840
The Heavenly Palace seems to
take it quite seriously.

298
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,800
What? You don’t like it?

299
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,920
Fengran prepared quite a lot of
garments for you.

300
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,990
Why did you choose this one?

301
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,630
After getting God power
of the Pilgrimage Hall,

302
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,670
I began to like the things

303
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,990
related to the God Realm more and more.

304
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,510
Fengran said the style

305
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,670
was handed down from ancient times.

306
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,360
I like it very much.

307
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,510
So I wear it.

308
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,400
What a coincidence!

309
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,240
We have consonance to each other.

310
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,430
Look. My garment

311
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,510
is really

312
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,110
well-matched with yours.

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,600
Don’t preen yourself.

314
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,280
It seems something is missing.

315
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,600
What is it?

316
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,510
It’s the first time

317
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I’ve seen a hairpin of this style.

318
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,870
It’s like one from the God Realm.

319
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,630
It matches your clothes perfectly.

320
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,040
You prepared it especially for me?

321
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,480
Come on.

322
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,790
How is it?

323
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,960
Do you like it?

324
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,880
You always cooked or gave me flowers

325
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,430
to please me before.

326
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,310
But why is it different this time?

327
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,520
I made progress.

328
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,310
Why don’t you praise me?

329
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,030
You made it by yourself?

330
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,030
Yes.

331
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,430
I don’t know why

332
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,670
I just wanted to

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,550
make a hairpin.

334
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,390
You seldom dress up.

335
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,720
So, you don’t know well
about what a lady may like.

336
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,310
However, this hairpin is very nice.

337
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,310
It’s better than those made by ladies.

338
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,910
How could it be?

339
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,790
It seems

340
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,480
your praise is weird.

341
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,550
What do you mean?

342
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,070
Nothing.

343
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,270
You learned how to make a hairpin.

344
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,670
I’m very pleased about it.

345
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,960
Let’s go.

346
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,550
Let’s go.

347
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,520
Happy birthday, Your Highness.

348
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,550
May you live happily
and as long as Heaven.

349
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,910
Please rise.

350
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,070
It’s the Queen of Heaven’s birthday.

351
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,550
We are happily gathering here.

352
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,310
You don’t need to mind the rules.

353
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
Just enjoy yourselves.

354
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,550
Goddess Houchi

355
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,720
and North Sea Lord Qingmu have arrived.

356
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,910
Houchi and Qingmu are here

357
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,670
to wish you a happy birthday,
Your Highness.

358
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,790
I’d like to tell all of you

359
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,390
that North Sea Lord Qingmu

360
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,240
and Princess Jingzhao were once in love.

361
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,310
That’s why Jingzhao gave Qingmu
her dragon core.

362
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,310
His Majesty and I

363
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,550
then granted them a marriage.

364
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,240
But things changed

365
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,150
after just a few days.

366
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,150
Qingmu,

367
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,030
now that you insist on breaking off
the engagement.

368
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,960
You should return Jingzhao
the dragon core.

369
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Your Highness, it’s ridiculous

370
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,550
for you to call white black.

371
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,790
Houchi.

372
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,910
Don’t be impolite

373
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,430
in front of the immortals

374
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,480
because you are in the name of Goddess.

375
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It’s the Heavenly Palace here,

376
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,310
not your Qingchi Palace.

377
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,550
Your Majesty and Your Highness,
I understand

378
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,310
you just want to protect your daughter.

379
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,000
So I won’t speak the truth here

380
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,390
to save your face.

381
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,670
My Qingchi Palace always repays

382
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,030
others’ kindness or debt.

383
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,910
Even if Your Highness

384
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,270
didn’t mention it, I would repay it.

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,670
Would you?

386
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,310
Then tell me

387
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,520
how.

388
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,550
My father, Gu Jun, has the body
of a flood dragon.

389
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,240
I should be the same.

390
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,760
Jingzhao gave the dragon core.

391
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,150
I will return her one.

392
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,520
Houchi.

393
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,960
Are you crazy?

394
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,880
How could you cultivate yourself
without it?

395
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,310
You will protect me.

396
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,390
I don’t have to cultivate myself, right?

397
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,240
After this is settled,

398
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,390
we will return to the Qingchi Palace.

399
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,240
Father and Boxuan love me so much.

400
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,030
I’m sure they won’t blame me.

401
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,240
Houchi.

402
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,550
What will you do?

403
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
You mustn’t do stupid things for me.

404
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,760
I’m not stupid.

405
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,270
You already made a plan.

406
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,790
Everyone knows the importance
of the dragon core.

407
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,880
Have you thought it through?

408
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,910
A dragon core.

409
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,070
A spiritual root.

410
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,910
I’m willing to use it
to settle the problem.

411
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,070
No!

412
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,000
We are a couple.

413
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,550
No matter what happens in the future,

414
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,310
we will face it together.

415
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,070
Houchi.

416
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,310
My dragon core?!

417
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,790
She is not Gu Jun’s daughter.

418
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,000
Houchi.

419
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,430
Who on earth are you?

420
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,310
His Majesty and every Lord have a core.

421
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,480
Gu Jun has the body of a flood dragon.

422
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,670
I have the body of a colorful phoenix.

423
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,480
If Houchi were really my daughter,

424
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,720
how could she not have a core?

425
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,720
In my opinion,

426
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,070
she must be a liar

427
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,670
who pretends to be a Goddess and
brings disaster to the Heavenly Palace.

428
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,000
Mother,

429
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,910
in this case,

430
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,550
we may wait for God Gu Jun

431
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,070
and make a decision after investigation.

432
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,000
Jingjian, are you crazy?

433
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,760
She doesn’t have a dragon core.

434
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,030
It’s unnecessary to investigate.

435
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,790
If I can’t

436
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,790
be fair in front of the immortals today,

437
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,670
there will be more people
trying to pretend to be Gods.

438
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,790
Qingmu.

439
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,430
How dare you wanton
in the Heavenly Palace!

440
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,390
If you want to condemn her,
you can always find a charge.

441
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,960
If I believe she is a Goddess,

442
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,000
then she is.

443
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,390
I don’t care what others say.

444
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,390
Enough.

445
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,550
It’s a birthday banquet.

446
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,790
The immortals are here to celebrate.

447
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,790
So, don’t make trouble.

448
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,720
Now you two

449
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,190
can return to the Qingchi Palace.

450
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,240
Muguang.

451
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,600
I said

452
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,670
enough.

453
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

454
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,070
But now, I

455
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,270
don’t want to leave.

456
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,270
Everything happened

457
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,760
because of me.

458
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,960
But it’s Houchi who got insulted.

459
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,480
If we just leave like this,

460
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,790
maybe everyone

461
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,840
will doubt her identity.

462
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,310
What do you want?

463
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,790
Goddess Houchi was right.

464
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
We owe you a dragon core.

465
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,760
Then we will return it.

466
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,030
Your Majesty,

467
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,030
all immortals,

468
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,270
I’ll accept the 49 thunder strikes

469
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,150
on the Green Dragon Platform

470
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,720
and then return Jingzhao

471
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,270
the dragon core.

472
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,070
Qingmu.

473
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,720
Houchi, have faith in me.

474
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,670
It’s not about faith.

475
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,720
The thunder strikes may kill you.

476
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,000
I don’t want to owe others.

477
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,600
I just want to be with you forever.

478
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,840
If being with you

479
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,070
will kill you,

480
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,120
I’d rather

481
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,240
not be with you.

482
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,310
Houchi.

483
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I won’t die easily.

484
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,240
Don’t worry.

485
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,430
Trust me.

486
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,760
Master.

487
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
What can I do for you?

488
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,430
I’ve got no news about Houchi for long.

489
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,360
I’m worried about her.

490
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,840
Gather men

491
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,520
and order them to go to the boundary.

492
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,070
You go to the Heavenly Palace with me.

493
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,310
If there is anything wrong,

494
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,880
we will attack
the Heavenly Realm immediately.

495
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,640
Master,

496
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
please calm down.

497
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,360
We are not fully prepared now.

498
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,270
If we attack Wu Huan rashly...

499
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,360
If anything bad happens to Houchi,

500
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,000
all I’ve done through the years

501
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
will be meaningless.

502
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,640
This time,

503
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,150
I won’t allow anything bad
to happen to her.

504
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,520
Qingmu.

505
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,600
Think it twice.

506
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,430
A few of the thunder strikes

507
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,240
will greatly hurt you.

508
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,070
Let alone it’s 49 of them.

509
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
I’m afraid you’ll be smashed to pieces.

510
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,120
It doesn’t matter.

511
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,550
Houchi!

512
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:16,910
Houchi.

513
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,190
Houchi,

514
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,520
what are you doing?

515
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,240
That’s...

516
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,720
Who has triggered the thunder strikes?

517
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,640
It’s...

518
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,240
It’s...

519
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,430
Houchi.

520
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,360
Just seven strikes

521
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,480
have hurt him so severely.

522
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,430
North Sea Lord is young and promising.

523
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
But sadly, you will die here today.

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,720
Houchi,

525
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,480
are you really willing to die with him?

526
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,190
Your Highness, please take it easy.

527
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,960
Even if I die here today,

528
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,190
I’ll have no complaints.

529
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,790
You’re asking for it!

530
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,550
Qingmu!

531
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,030
Jingzhao!

532
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,270
Qingmu!

533
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,670
Come out!

534
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,880
I won’t marry you.

535
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,670
And I won’t force you to stay in
the Heavenly Palace.

536
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,190
Come out now!

537
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,480
You will die if you get the
dragon core out!

538
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,150
Jingzhao!

539
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,030
Jingyang!

540
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,480
Please don’t stop me.

541
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,640
I must save him!

542
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,600
It’s too late!

543
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,520
The thunder strikes have been triggered.

544
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,120
The barrier won’t disappear

545
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
before 49 thunder strikes end.

546
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,670
Jingzhao!

547
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,960
How disgraceful you are being like this!

548
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,880
Jingzhao.

549
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,640
Qingmu.

550
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,840
Houchi,

551
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
it’s all because of you!

552
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,790
If it weren’t for you,

553
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,720
he wouldn’t have to die!

554
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,550
If it weren’t for you,

555
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,190
everything wouldn’t have happened!

556
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,960
Houchi.

557
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,390
Come on.

558
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,960
Jingzhao.

559
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,270
You saved Qingmu with your dragon core.

560
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
I’m grateful for that.

561
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,670
But he’s an independent man,

562
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,000
not a toy for you.

563
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,150
He has the right to make his own choice.

564
