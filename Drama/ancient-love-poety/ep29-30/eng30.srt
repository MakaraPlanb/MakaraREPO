2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,320
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,230
Come on.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,790
As long as I want to live,

5
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,660
even Heaven can’t take my life.

6
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,910
Who says no one can survive
challenging Heaven?

7
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,910
I will prove to the Three Realms

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,950
that I will win.

9
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,060
Qingmu is Bai Jue?

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,630
It’s impossible.

11
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,460
Is he going to...?

12
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,120
He’s drawing power from thunder

13
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,670
to rebuild spiritual veins.

14
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,100
So daring!

15
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,860
Is Qingmu taking God’s tribulation?

16
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,560
Is he going to

17
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,020
be the fifth God of the Three Realms?

18
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,340
He already took
49 thunder strikes before.

19
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,950
That was the tribulation for a God.

20
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,860
Now he’s taking another 32.

21
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,460
In all, it’s...

22
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,140
Eighty-one.

23
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,060
Who else except a True God

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,420
can trigger eighty-one thunder strikes?

25
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,670
Huan,

26
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,300
is he truly Bai...?

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,470
Demon power!

28
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,580
He possesses demon power!

29
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,000
The prime of Demigod.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,730
We finally got a Demigod for so long.

31
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,730
Were his core
and spiritual veins intact,

32
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,020
North Sea Lord would have

33
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,580
become the prime of God.

34
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,820
He’s fortunate to have such experience.

35
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,650
It won’t be long until he becomes

36
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,560
the fifth God of the Heavenly Realm.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,500
Houchi.

38
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,020
Jingzhao.

39
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,180
Houchi.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,290
Greetings, God Gu Jun.

41
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,660
Gu Jun?

42
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,070
Wu Huan,

43
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,980
if you hurt Houchi again,

44
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,340
I’ll tear your Heavenly Palace down.

45
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,620
Houchi.

46
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,750
Houchi.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,110
Muguang,

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
you’re the God of Heaven.

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,250
You promised me

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,380
to keep Houchi safe.

51
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,900
However, Wu Huan

52
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,260
intended to hurt her under your nose.

53
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,380
Are you still a man of your word?

54
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,480
Gu Jun...

55
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,660
Ridiculous!

56
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,900
She is a fake,

57
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,450
who has no dragon core in her body.

58
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,260
As a senior to her,

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,300
couldn’t I ask about it?

60
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,700
Wouldn’t I

61
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,380
recognize my own daughter?

62
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,730
She was fragile when she was little.

63
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,260
Her core was broken.

64
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,280
So I drew her core out

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,420
and had been reinforcing it
with my blood.

66
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,580
As her mother,
you never cared about her.

67
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,420
You’re also a fake.

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,100
So, forget it.

69
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,340
Gu Jun,

70
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,650
what do you mean?

71
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,780
Gu Jun,

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,810
you implied publicly

73
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,720
that I took her
as my daughter back then.

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,200
I didn’t refuse

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,610
for the sake of our past.

76
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,900
Now you regret it?

77
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,320
Yes.

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,020
I do regret it.

79
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,580
What can you do?

80
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,260
Today,

81
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,830
I’ll explain everything.

82
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,340
Wu Huan didn’t

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,500
give birth to my daughter, Houchi.

84
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,540
Sixty thousand years ago,

85
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,560
to make sure my daughter

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,180
has a rightful place
in the Three Realms,

87
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,020
I chose Wu Huan.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,940
However,

89
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,640
that was a mistake

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,100
which has led to such misunderstanding.

91
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,750
So now,

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,500
I’d like to make it clear.

93
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,060
Wu Huan is not Houchi’s mother.

94
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,020
Gu Jun,

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,170
whether I am or not her mother,

96
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,020
it’s all but your word.

97
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,660
How dare you insult me so!

98
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,550
My daring is not limited to this.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,050
For what you did today,

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,460
I would have killed you a hundred times.

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,930
Yet I chose to spare you for the sake

102
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,700
of the love we used to share.

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,960
You should reflect on yourself.

104
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,490
- You...!
- Gu Jun,

105
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,340
you’re a God.

106
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,950
Mind your tongue.

107
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,400
Sweetie,

108
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,930
I’m impressed.

109
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,740
You almost tore
the Heavenly Palace down.

110
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,490
Don’t be afraid.

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,020
Father is here.

112
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,710
We’ll talk when we’re back home.

113
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,140
Wait!

114
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,320
You people from the Qingchi Palace
can leave.

115
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,430
But Qingmu has to stay.

116
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,020
Wu Huan,

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,700
he doesn’t want to marry your daughter.

118
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,390
Why do you have to kill him for that?

119
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
Because he possesses demon power.

120
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,620
I must take his life today.

121
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,220
You’re just abusing your authority.

122
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

123
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,340
I’m doing this
for the sake of all immortals.

124
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,930
This young man

125
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,150
survived the Heavenly Thunder.

126
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,000
If he were a demon,

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,340
he’d have returned to his original form,

128
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,860
and you wouldn’t have the chance
to accuse him.

129
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,410
But he does possess demon power.

130
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,550
Right.

131
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,070
A small amount.

132
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,510
So what?

133
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,080
He withstood the torch of
Three-head Fire Dragon’s breath.

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,890
It’s normal he possesses demon power.

135
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,370
How could you declare

136
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,340
him a demon for that?

137
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,340
By the way, I heard

138
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,730
this young man

139
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,620
saved your son days ago

140
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,380
from the Three-head Fire Dragon.

141
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,900
Is that how you immortals

142
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,800
from the Heavenly Palace
extend gratitude?

143
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,710
How shameless

144
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,230
and virtueless!

145
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,820
Gu Jun, you’re wrong.

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,500
Qingmu did save Jingyang,

147
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,220
which is a great favor to us.

148
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,820
But it’s a matter that’s concerned about
immortals and demons.

149
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,170
His identity is suspicious.

150
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,410
It’s nothing wrong to question him.

151
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,060
Muguang, don’t forget

152
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,670
that when the God Realm existed,

153
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,390
immortals and demons were families,

154
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,020
not foes.

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,570
That’s right.

156
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,670
God Gu Jun made a good point.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Alright,

158
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,800
let’s put an end to it.

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,530
The doubt is yet to be settled.

160
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,060
We can’t jump to conclusions.

161
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,340
Your Majesty,

162
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,250
we can’t let them go

163
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,300
before everything is clear.

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,060
God Gu Jun.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,230
You don’t have to be so polite.

166
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,500
God Gu Jun.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,620
I, Qingmu,

168
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,200
would like to give my life

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
to Houchi and marry her.

170
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,110
Please give us your permission.

171
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,340
Young man,

172
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,570
why do you think

173
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,670
I would agree on this marriage?

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,780
Just because you survived
the thunder strikes?

175
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,910
My love for Houchi is as true as
the sun and the moon.

176
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,740
I’d like to swear in the name of Heaven

177
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,360
that as long as I am alive,

178
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,140
whoever in the Three Realms,

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,340
be it Gods

180
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,830
or demons,

181
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,670
I’ll kill them if they dare to hurt her.

182
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,940
If I fail,

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,990
let my heart rot and my soul vanish.

184
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,180
Nice try.

185
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,350
I’ll be in the Qingchi Palace

186
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,880
for the next tens of thousands of years.

187
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,070
If any of you run into trouble,

188
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,100
feel free to come to Qilian Mountains
for tea.

189
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,140
As for marrying my daughter,

190
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,070
no way!

191
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,050
Qingmu,

192
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,880
God Gu Jun is always like that.

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,570
You saw his attitude to them.

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,080
He’s already very nice to you.

195
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,010
Besides,

196
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,500
Houchi is the apple of his eye.

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,510
Your proposal was too casual.

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,510
How about this?

199
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,780
Give him a few more days.

200
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,360
Jingzhao,

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,540
as you could see,

202
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,580
Qingmu loves Houchi more than his life.

203
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,460
Stop tormenting yourself.

204
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,900
Listen to me.

205
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,990
Forget him.

206
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,070
I sacrificed

207
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,310
my spiritual root for him.

208
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,550
In the end,

209
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,740
it’s all in vain.

210
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,160
That’s love.

211
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,520
Though I had given everything for it,

212
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,020
I still couldn’t get it.

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,110
Jingjian,

214
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,460
I’m tired.

215
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,550
Jingzhao.

216
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,570
It seems I

217
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,170
underestimated that flood dragon.

218
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,390
Master,

219
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,620
now you’re regarded as
the God of Destruction.

220
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,350
Gu Jun is totally loyal to Her Grace.

221
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,280
I’m afraid it’s not easy for you

222
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,000
to take her away.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Shanggu’s future

224
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,460
is not in anyone else’s hand.

225
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,430
Wu Huan, you dared to hurt Houchi.

226
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,460
I guess being in power for too long

227
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,380
makes you forget who you were.

228
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,060
He’s Tianqi, the Demon God!

229
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,140
- Demon God?
- Your Majesty.

230
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,960
Hasn’t the Demon God

231
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,700
been killed by True God Bai Jue?

232
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,020
I have eternal life as Heaven does.

233
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,670
No one can kill me.

234
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,540
Muguang, it’s been sixty thousand years.

235
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,160
You’ve become such a foolish emperor.

236
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,340
The demons never offended you immortals.

237
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,450
Yet you sent your two sons
to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

238
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,740
and stop Three-Head Fire Dragon
from ascending.

239
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,370
So,

240
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,620
the God of immortals cannot
serve your greed

241
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,110
and you covet the Three Realms?

242
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,430
Demon God,

243
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,250
His Majesty was chosen by Master Zhiyang

244
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,300
as the God of the Three Realms.

245
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,070
Without the demons’ rebellion,

246
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
the Three Realms would’ve been in peace.

247
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,260
Don’t give a false account here!

248
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,930
You’re but a humble phoenix.

249
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,500
How dare you offend me!

250
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,080
You...!

251
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,900
Demon God, what’s the purpose

252
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,860
of your presence?

253
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,610
I have returned.

254
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,460
You immortals will pay the price.

255
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,480
I have no interest

256
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,570
in your bit of territory,

257
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,170
but if you encroach on any of mine,

258
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,350
I’ll make sure you all

259
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,620
be crushed

260
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,670
like the Green Dragon Platform.

261
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,060
Is he really Demon God Tianqi, Father?

262
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,700
Demon God has returned.

263
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,380
The Three Realms are in danger.

264
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,630
Jingyang,

265
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,360
ring the Green Dragon Bell.

266
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,910
Summon the immortal lords

267
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,400
to discuss a solution.

268
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes, Father.

269
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,820
It’s been so long.

270
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,680
Still no news about
Her Grace and the others.

271
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,530
Is anything wrong?

272
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,520
Jiaye.

273
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,160
Greetings, God Gu Jun.

274
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,550
You’re

275
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,840
finally back.

276
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,180
If you came back later,

277
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,190
the Heavenly Palace

278
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,200
would have trampled us underfoot.

279
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,180
Don’t worry.

280
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,560
No one will bully us ever again.

281
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,730
By the way,

282
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,350
why do immortal residences decline
so sharply on Qilian Mountains?

283
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,440
You were away for tens
of thousands of years.

284
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,720
The spiritual veins and power here
have weakened.

285
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,180
Some slow-progressing immortals

286
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,040
believed the Qingchi Palace dwindled

287
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,810
and moved away.

288
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,160
Imbeciles!

289
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,320
Tell those immortals

290
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,870
if they want to come back,

291
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,280
it won’t be easy.

292
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes, Your Grace.

293
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,310
Your Majesty, do you have a counter-plan

294
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,370
against the Demon God’s return?

295
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,120
Don’t panic, my lords.

296
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,900
He hasn’t gained full power of True God

297
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,040
since he was wounded by Bai Jue.

298
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,640
Otherwise, he would have

299
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,720
brought my palace to the ground,

300
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,800
instead of tearing down only one hall
before he left.

301
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,880
Your Majesty is right.

302
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,300
In my opinion,

303
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,080
the Demon God made such a scene
in the Heavenly Palace

304
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,360
just to bluff.

305
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,580
Your Majesty,

306
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,640
we can’t belittle him though his power
was weakened.

307
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,790
He intended to kill all beings
to be the Chief God.

308
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,380
When he gains full power
and remembers his goal,

309
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,900
there’ll be another turmoil.

310
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,260
Lordship Donghua is right.

311
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,580
Jingyang, lead fifty thousand troops to
the Demon Region

312
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,240
and guard the barriers against demons.

313
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,580
If you detect a move,

314
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,640
report immediately.

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,550
Yes,

316
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,600
Father.

317
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,910
The Demon God’s return

318
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,620
is a crisis of the Three Realms.

319
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,640
All immortals should work
in a concerted effort.

320
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,940
From now on,

321
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,000
I urge each immortal lord to be alert

322
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
and deny every chance for the demons.

323
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,240
Yes.

324
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,970
Your Majesty.

325
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,810
Gu Jun has returned.

326
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,350
So has the Demon God.

327
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,800
Counting in the Heavenly Palace,

328
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,910
we’re in another tripartite situation.

329
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,310
No one will yield.

330
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,200
If we don’t make a change,

331
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,590
what happened sixty thousand years ago
will repeat itself.

332
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,290
Your Majesty, we see demons as foes.

333
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,640
What should our attitude
towards the Qingchi Palace be?

334
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,820
Do you have any idea?

335
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,040
About what?

336
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,160
About why you hid a secret from me
for so many years?

337
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,920
Houchi isn’t your daughter.

338
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
Why didn’t you tell me?

339
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,370
I...

340
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,730
Over the years,

341
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,940
you never asked.

342
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,380
I thought you didn’t mind.

343
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,760
I don’t.

344
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
But have you been honest with me?

345
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
A mortal woman

346
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,350
would have told this to her husband,

347
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,040
instead of hiding it

348
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,080
like you did, which led to
the misunderstanding.

349
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,280
Have you ever considered my feelings?

350
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,520
I do care about your feelings.

351
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
We have three children.

352
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,510
I manage the chores in the palace

353
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,380
over the years as my duty.

354
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,840
How could you question my love

355
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,520
to you because of this?

356
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,710
All right, then tell me

357
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,720
what happened back then.

358
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,480
Back then, Gu Jun

359
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,590
was always away

360
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,360
and you often came by to visit.

361
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,240
So I married you.

362
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,720
I felt sorry for Gu Jun,

363
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,540
so when he came to me

364
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,080
with the unhatched egg,

365
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,100
I felt sorry for the poor child

366
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,320
and agreed to be her nominal mother.

367
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,800
I didn’t know

368
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,760
it’d lead to so many misunderstandings.

369
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,960
Huan.

370
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,360
Over the years,

371
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,200
who knows the pain in my heart?

372
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,000
It’s my fault.

373
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,320
I neglected your feelings.

374
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,690
The grudge with the Qingchi Palace

375
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,880
began with my love to you

376
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,040
which offended Gu Jun.

377
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,880
Let’s forget about

378
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,040
the bygones.

379
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,210
From now on,

380
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,510
leave Houchi and Qingmu

381
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,120
alone,

382
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,090
will you?

383
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,100
Your Grace, Jiaye has informed
all immortal establishments

384
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,060
that Qilian Mountains

385
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,120
aren’t somewhere they can come and go
at any time.

386
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,510
Those immortals are all snobs

387
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,840
who curry favor with those in power.

388
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,830
The Qingchi Palace has been neutral
in the Three Realms

389
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,880
and alienated from the Heavenly Palace.

390
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,160
Let’s give them a lesson this time.

391
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,520
Qilian Mountains will be in peace.

392
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,300
I think those immortals
must be regretting.

393
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,400
With you around,

394
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,060
no one would

395
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,480
dare to offend the Qingchi Palace.

396
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,560
Fengran, thank you
for keeping everything

397
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,950
in order in the Qingchi Palace

398
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,160
over the years when I was away.

399
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
You flattered me, Your Grace.

400
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,750
Were it not for your shelter back then,

401
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,220
I can’t even imagine where I’d be now.

402
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,520
Since I stepped into the Qingchi Palace,

403
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
it has been my home.

404
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,190
You and Houchi have been my family.

405
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,120
That’s what I should do.

406
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
It just surprised me

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,160
that Houchi isn’t the daughter
of the Queen of Heaven.

408
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,980
The scandal about her birth has caused

409
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,560
constant ridicule and grievances.

410
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,690
I feel sorry for her.

411
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,360
I had no other options back then.

412
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,920
I came back this time

413
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,340
and found that Houchi’s power

414
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,760
had improved a great deal than before.

415
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,540
I wonder

416
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,690
if it owes to the young man
on the Green Dragon Platform.

417
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,120
You noticed it?

418
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,070
On the Green Dragon Platform,

419
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,200
I had no chance to ask Houchi.

420
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,520
Tell me more details about him.

421
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,710
That immortal lord is from the North Sea

422
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,340
and exceptionally gifted.

423
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,550
He reached the top of immortal lords
within only one thousand years

424
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,590
which makes him famous among immortals.

425
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,100
The Heavenly Palace tried a few times
to draw him in.

426
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,380
He showed little interest,

427
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,420
but he’s deeply in love with Houchi.

428
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,760
In public, he defends for
our Qingchi Palace.

429
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,720
I think he and Houchi are a...

430
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,080
A what?

431
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,400
A perfect match.

432
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,400
Stop this nonsense!

433
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,000
Your Grace, as you saw
on the Green Dragon Platform,

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,260
he and Houchi have been through deaths

435
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,720
and have given their heart to the other.

436
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,030
Even if you want to stop them,

437
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,710
I’m afraid your effort will be futile.

438
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,510
And Lord Qingmu is a decent

439
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,600
and kind man.

440
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,230
He isn’t snobbish at all.

441
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,540
Such a virtuous man is rare
in the Three Realms.

442
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,790
- Why do you have to...?
- Stop.

443
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,940
I have to cook medicine for Houchi.

444
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,480
Her health matters more than anything.

445
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,540
Judging by His Grace’s attitude,

446
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,360
Houchi and Qingmu will have a hard time.

447
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,280
Master,

448
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
I never imagined

449
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,360
you’d fall in love with Houchi.

450
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,200
And you fell completely.

451
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,330
What should I do?

452
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,210
Father.

453
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,000
Sweetie,

454
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
you haven’t recovered

455
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,560
and shouldn’t have come out.

456
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,920
I’m fine.

457
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,220
I did transfer power to you
on the Green Dragon Platform,

458
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,570
but you’re still far too weak.

459
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,430
I picked those herbs

460
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,320
on the top of snow-capped mountains.

461
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,080
They’re the best for your health.

462
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Ask Chang Que to boil them for you.

463
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,100
Sweetie,

464
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,560
why is your power inside so robust?

465
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,790
Father, it was strange
at the Heavenly Palace

466
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,000
that I drew in the God power
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

467
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,440
Now I can help you
defend the Qingchi Palace.

468
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,600
Pilgrimage Hall?

469
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,920
What?

470
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,720
Sweetie,

471
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,400
why do you take such precious medicine

472
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,020
to me?

473
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,290
What a waste.

474
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,480
Father, stop pretending.

475
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,520
I can see it.

476
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,120
What can you see?

477
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,880
You’re wounded.

478
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,190
It’s nothing. Don’t worry.

479
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,540
Nothing?

480
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,930
Where have you been over the years?

481
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,720
I collected

482
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,790
those medicines one by one on the top

483
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,570
of snow-capped mountains.

484
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,880
Your foundation is shaky.

485
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,720
These are good for your strength.

486
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,040
You usually sent home letters
by instruction feather.

487
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,670
This time you went for so long

488
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,280
and sent no letter at all.

489
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,780
I ran into a few beasts
from the Shanggu Realm.

490
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,480
In the engagement,

491
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,050
my spiritual veins were wounded.

492
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,360
So, I had to meditate and heal.

493
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,380
And I woke up to find

494
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,960
it’s been tens of thousands of years.

495
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,920
Has your wound healed?

496
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,130
Your father is a God.

497
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,810
This is just an ailment.

498
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,060
Come on, my sweet girl,

499
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,640
drink the medicine.

500
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,280
Father,

501
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,680
the medicine is a gesture of my love.

502
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,090
Sweetie,

503
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,930
let me help you.

504
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,500
Alright, darling,

505
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,810
how about this?

506
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,460
You and I

507
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,800
both take a half.

508
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,760
Father,

509
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,340
you have no idea

510
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,950
how much I missed you

511
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,690
in the years when you were away.

512
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,280
Sweetie,

513
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,360
let’s go out for a walk.

514
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,280
Lord Qingmu, what are you...?

515
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,100
I’m here to visit God Gu Jun.

516
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
Please report it.

517
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,380
A moment, please.

518
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,210
I’ll report it to His Grace.

519
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,550
I’m sorry for what you had to face
over the years.

520
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,710
Don’t be, Father.

521
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,110
I’m the heiress of the Qingchi Palace.

522
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,880
It’s my duty to defend it.

523
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,640
My sweet girl has grown up.

524
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,600
I’m so happy.

525
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,930
Now I’m back.

526
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,910
I’ll see to it

527
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,090
that no one dares to offend us again.

528
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,310
Father, did you hear anything

529
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,480
about Boxuan on your trip?

530
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,000
No.

531
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,450
But according to the time,

532
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,640
Boxuan should have gone through
tribulations and become a God.

533
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
But he hasn’t come back.

534
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,630
Maybe he...

535
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,600
He won’t.

536
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,750
In the last tens of thousands of years,

537
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,920
no immortals have ascended to God,

538
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,150
but I believe Boxuan

539
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,640
wouldn’t fail the tribulation.

540
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,300
As long as he’s not found,

541
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,440
I believe he’s still alive in the world.

542
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,640
I was being reckless with my words.

543
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,720
I also believe

544
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,970
Boxuan is so powerful

545
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,520
that he’ll be safe.

546
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,960
Father, there’s another thing.

547
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,120
The man on
the Green Dragon Platform, Qingmu,

548
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,760
is honest about his love for me.

549
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,850
My love for him is also true.

550
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,880
You and he...?

551
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,710
We’ve promised ourselves to each other.

552
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,000
It won’t change for eternity.

553
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,040
Qingmu is a decent

554
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,360
and righteous man.

555
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,880
I can’t be wrong about him.

556
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,280
Your Graces.

557
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,000
Chang Que, what’s so urgent?

558
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,460
Your Grace, North Sea Lord is here.

559
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,600
He’s waiting at the gate to meet you.

560
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,300
He came just in time.

561
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
Lead him to the main hall.

562
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,960
Yes.

563
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,330
Let’s go.

564
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,150
Greetings, God Gu Jun.

565
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,000
No need.

566
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,200
I agree to meet you

567
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,760
to make something clear with you.

568
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,440
I’m clear of your affection

569
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,280
for Houchi,

570
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,400
but you will not

571
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,520
have my permission.

572
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,920
Father.

573
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,240
And North Sea Lord,

574
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,200
please do not come again.

575
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,530
Excuse me.

576
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,600
Father!

577
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,640
Houchi, calm down.

578
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,410
Why was Father so rigid?

579
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,070
Try to put yourself in his shoes.

580
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,230
You hadn’t met for tens of thousands
of years.

581
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,810
Well, just after you reunited,

582
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,640
Qingmu came to propose to you.

583
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,070
No father

584
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,760
would agree to give her daughter away.

585
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,150
But Father said

586
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,000
he didn’t want Qingmu to come again.

587
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
He doesn’t want him to come,

588
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,440
but he didn’t forbid it.

589
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,090
I think he still has a chance.

590
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,380
Right, Houchi.

591
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,920
I still have a chance.

592
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,520
I shouldn’t have come so soon

593
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,290
and overlooked your father’s feelings.

594
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,060
Don’t worry.

595
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,760
I won’t give up.

596
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,710
One day, I’ll make sure he accepts me

597
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,200
and believes I can take care of you.

598
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,690
Give him a few more days.

599
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,410
I think His Grace

600
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,360
is testing his son-in-law.

601
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,600
Testing me?

602
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,240
Master,

603
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,600
how dramatic fate is.

604
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,450
If you remembered everything

605
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,760
and were put in this situation,

606
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,080
how would you feel?

607
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,380
Houchi and Qingmu

608
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,090
are deeply in love.

609
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,450
But I don’t want

610
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,210
Houchi to be sad.

611
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,400
Father.

612
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,720
The princess has just recovered.

613
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,360
She can’t drink.

614
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,240
Is that how you serve her?

615
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,660
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

616
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,340
Her Grace insisted to drink alcohol.

617
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,520
We couldn’t stop her.

618
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,750
Please spare us, Your Majesty.

619
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,560
Never mind.

620
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,240
Leave us.

621
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,640
How is your health?

622
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,880
Almost fine.

623
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,370
When I found you lost the dragon core,

624
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,000
I was so worried

625
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
and I said something harsh.

626
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,930
The dragon core is your root.

627
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,080
Without a root,

628
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,360
you’re nobody.

629
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,280
I feel so sorry for you.

630
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,720
I was so stupid

631
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,320
to have done such a foolish thing.

632
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,560
You and Mother must be worried.

633
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
I’m sorry.

634
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,440
This isn’t all your fault.

635
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,400
If I knew Qingmu’s heart
was with the Qingchi Palace,

636
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,200
I wouldn’t have granted the marriage

637
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,720
and all this wouldn’t have happened.

638
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,640
I wanted that marriage.

639
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,290
But what happened

640
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,210
enables me to see many things through.

641
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,170
Darling,

642
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,330
your life in the Heavenly Palace

643
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,160
has been well provided.

644
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,570
We’ve all spoiled you.

645
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,880
Thus, you became proud and headstrong.

646
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,930
I thought it was good for you.

647
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,360
But love

648
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,440
cannot be forced.

649
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,360
Make sure

650
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,120
you learn the lesson from the pain.

651
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,600
I will, Father.

652
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,520
From now on, I’ll love myself

653
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,090
and try not to be willful again.

654
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,280
Good.

655
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,930
Though you’ve regained the dragon core,

656
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,670
losing it had caused great damage
to your spiritual power.

657
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,530
Why not spend some time in a retreat?

658
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,980
It’s immensely helpful

659
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,920
in rebuilding your strength.

660
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,720
All right,

661
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,570
you can’t stand in the cold wind.

662
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,640
Let me walk you to your bedroom

663
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,120
to have some rest.

664
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,570
Father.

665
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,810
You can cry if you want to.

666
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,360
I’m always here with you.

667
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,690
The Demon God has returned.

668
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,640
It won’t be long until the awakening.

669
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,880
When he becomes a True God,

670
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,480
he’ll come after me for Yuemi’s sake.

671
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,930
I won’t be able to meet his rage.

672
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,480
And Muguang

673
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,480
isn’t reliable.

674
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,360
I have to improve
my own spiritual power.

675
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,570
The time left for me isn’t much.

676
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,680
This bow is made of pure evil.

677
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,520
It will help you
improve your spiritual power.

678
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,040
Pure evil?

679
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,130
The grievances and malice of those
who died a wrongful death.

680
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,860
The anger in their heart

681
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,500
produced immense power.

682
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,480
So, this bow is infinitely powerful.

683
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,130
It’s been sixty thousand years.

684
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,090
I’m no longer the maid in the past,

685
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,610
but the Queen of Heaven,
a powerful Goddess.

686
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,650
Am I still not qualified to control

687
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,920
the weapon I couldn’t control
in the past?

688
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,280
Fengnyu.

689
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,680
Yes, Your Highness.

690
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,240
Master,

691
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,000
the immortals attacked
with missing soldiers

692
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,570
as their excuse lately.

693
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,460
We engaged a few times.
Both sides won and lost.

694
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,960
But the toll is heavy.

695
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,240
They won sometimes?

696
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,240
Do we have no military talent?

697
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,640
Pass my order.

698
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,040
Send Three-Head Fire Dragon
to the Demon Region immediately.

699
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,720
And there’s a Demigod.

700
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,560
Let’s see if they can win again.

701
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,520
Yes, Master.

702
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,700
I stayed up all night

703
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,520
and found no solution at all.

704
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,790
Houchi,

705
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,800
does your father like anything
particularly?

706
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,960
Aside from his sweet daughter,

707
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,160
His Grace values his armory the most.

708
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,420
I asked Chang Que about it.

709
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,310
He neglected the cleaning of it

710
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,120
while His Grace was away.

711
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,560
Good, it’s a test.

712
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,600
I’ll start from the armory.

713
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,760
Are you sure you want to tidy it up?

714
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,170
Those who already have everything

715
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,600
can be touched by sincerity.

716
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
Houchi, trust me.

717
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,630
I’ll show him my sincerity

718
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,480
and win his permission for our marriage.

719
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,480
What’s up?

720
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,000
Nothing.

721
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,680
I should go.

722
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,350
Sure, go.

723
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,480
I’m leaving.

724
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,720
Go.

725
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,700
(Qingchi Palace)

726
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,330
Your Grace.

727
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,200
Your Grace.

728
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,890
