3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
Over the past 60,000 years,

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,120
the God Realm has been silent,

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,440
and True Gods never showed up again.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Wars and natural disasters have become

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,230
the new norm in the Human Realm.

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,040
To stop innocent people from suffering,

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,270
I colluded with the Heavenly Empress

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,760
but turned out to be her tool.

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,630
Right now, death is inevitable

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,590
and I deserve it.

13
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,190
But my concern is that without me,

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,950
the evil force will gush out

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,440
and wreak havoc on humans again.

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,760
I totally failed True God Bai Jue.

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
I promise

18
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,720
that I’ll drive out the evil force

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,630
and protect the Human Realm

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,910
for the next 100 years.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,390
In 100 years, the Ghost Suppressing Tower
will be returned

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,550
to suppress the evil force.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,360
You are of great virtues.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
The Three Realms will be safe
under your watch.

25
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,910
You’ve guarded against evil force

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,670
for the past 60,000 years.

27
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,470
That’s something as great as

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,830
all the Gods did back then.

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,550
Young Goddess,

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,800
don’t waste time seeking justice for me.

31
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
After all, Prince Jingyang is
His Majesty’s son.

32
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,360
Knowing that you’ve forgiven me,

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,470
I’ll die with no regrets.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,360
I wish...

35
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,800
we’d come sooner.

36
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,390
Houchi,

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,270
don’t be too hard on yourself.

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,750
Jingjian.

39
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,600
Fengran.

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,160
Is everything all right?

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,390
I...

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,550
My brother was guilty,

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,000
but I didn’t have the heart

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,600
to turn him in to Father.

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
That wasn’t your fault.

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Don’t beat yourself up over it.

47
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,960
As a member of the Heavenly Palace,

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
I was born

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
to protect the people
and the Three Realms.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,390
But by doing that,

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,240
I’d lose my brother.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,190
If I chose to protect him,

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
what about other people?

54
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,720
Even if they all blame you,

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,670
you still have me. I...

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,830
You’re also one of the victims.

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Your foster father died due to him,

58
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,160
but I...

59
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,790
Truth is

60
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,200
I’m weak.

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
I don’t deserve you.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,270
Enough!

63
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,830
Is that your answer?

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,640
You mean it?

Lord Bi Xi’s merits are unrivaled

102
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,600
for protecting the Human Realm
for 60,000 years,

103

but none of them knows him.

if you’re going to the Heavenly Palace

to report Jingyang’s crimes,

109
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,350
I’ll go with you.

110
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
What’s the use of

111
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
impeaching him before His Majesty?

112
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,440
He wouldn’t bring his son to justice

113
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,000
for Lord Bi Xi.

114
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,640
I didn’t realize until now

115
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,760
that in the Three Realms,

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,720
the supremacy

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,510
all lies in power.

118
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
My reckless move

119
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,230
would only get the Qingchi Palace
and Father into trouble.

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,790
We must

121
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,790
think up a perfect plan

122
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,000
before taking any action.

123
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,600
Now that Lord Bi Xi

124
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,160
entrusted you

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,200
with the safety of the Human Realm
for the next 100 years,

126
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,550
I can’t sit by and do nothing

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,830
while you purify the evil force

128
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,720
on Hidden Mountain.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,640
You can count on me.

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
I’ll also try to locate

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,720
and get rid of it in the Three Realms

132
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,110
to make the Human Realm safer.

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Thank you, Qingmu.

Houchi,

135

if you’re dedicated
to protecting the Three Realms,

136
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,760

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,510

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,920
I think I’ve heard that before.

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,160

on Mount Lookout,

I’ve said that

a million times.

143
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,510
You simply didn’t take it to heart.

144
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Didn’t I?

145
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,760
Why is that sigh?

146
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,160
Are you mad?

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,270

I once heard

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,910
the Nine-tailed Fox had been sealed

213
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,030
on this Hidden Mountain
in ancient times.

214
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,670
The seal is still as overwhelming

215
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,230
as it was 60,000 years ago.

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,470
I’ve checked with Jingjian.

219
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Although the barrier here

220
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,790
keeps immortals and demons away,

221
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,790

Aren’t you deeply moved?

290
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,710
I’ve made it very clear yesterday

291
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,910
that I’m Houchi,

292
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,710
not some Shanggu you said.

293
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,080
Please stop messing with me.

294
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
I’ve already known that you had

295
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
placed the barrier here.

296
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,840
You’re free to come and go.

297
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,000
Please leave.

298
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,840
I’m here to receive punishment

299
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,320
and I don’t need your company.

300
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200

301
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,640

302
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,790
you’d say that.

303
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,590
But finally, there’s this place

304
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,110
that you can’t get out

305
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,550
and Qingmu can’t get in.

306
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
I’m staying no matter what.

307
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,550

308
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,030

309
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,200
Qingmu and I have already married...

310
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,960
Stop there.

311
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,080
Don’t get me wrong.

312
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
You’re all alone here.

313
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
I’m simply worried.

314
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Besides, this place has been
abandoned for 60,000 years.

315
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
You can’t find anything here.

316
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,840
If I leave,

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,710
how are you going to get by
the next 100 years?

318
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,960
That’s why you brought
the bamboo house here?

319
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,590
Smart move, huh?

320
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,670
Do you like it?

321
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,590
They stink!

322
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,640
Why do you need them?

323
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,640
Roast chicken is my father’s favorite.

324
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,960
Once I get out,

325
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,880
I can’t go home empty-handed.

326
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,150
Aren’t you thoughtful

327
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,310
and planning ahead?

328
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,110
Those chickens and ducks are smelly.

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,190
Their feathers are everywhere.

330
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
If they make you uncomfortable,

331
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,760
you are free to leave.

332
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,710
You know what?

333
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,680
I’ve been trying to make a duster,

334
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,950
and those feathers just come in handy.

335
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,230
Before Houchi left for the Mountain,

336
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,000
she asked me to tell you

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,640
that it’s up to you to
make Jingyang’s deeds public or not.

338
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,190
What does she mean?

339
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,430
Clearly,

340
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,350
she hopes you can
talk some sense into him

341
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
and stop him from
going further on the wrong path.

342
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,640
Bi Xi is gone.

343
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,680
Jingyang’s death won’t bring him back.

344
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,830
It’s better for him and everyone else

345
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,430
to redeem himself

346
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,710
by serving the public.

347
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Houchi is surprisingly lenient.

348
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,640
I’m so ashamed!

349
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,350
That’s my wife.

350
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,470
Qingmu,

351
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,680
I can’t tell my father

352
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,830
the truth,

353
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,920
but I’ll do my best to
persuade Jingyang

354
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,070
into righting his wrongs.

355
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Thank you for trusting me so much.

356
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,880
You should have this.

(Human Realm City Map)

358
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,920
I took this from the Heavenly Palace.

359
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,640
Ever since the evil force leaked

360
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,110
and polluted the Human Realm,

361
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,110
heavenly guards have inspected
the Human Realm

362
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,110
and marked every place

363
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,190
affected by the evil force.

364
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,680
Follow the map

365
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,590
and you can get rid of it.

366
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,470
Thanks.

367
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,470
Why are you following me?

368
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,800
To get rid of the evil force of course.

369
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,800
No need.

370
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,190
You should stay at the Heavenly Palace.

371
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,070
My brother

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,880
caused this huge mess.

373
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,470
I can handle it.

374
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,590
The peace talk between immortals
and demons is pending

375
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,950
among other important affairs.

376
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,310
His Majesty is going to need your help.

377
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,640
Your talents can be

378
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,040
put into better use here

379
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,400
than cleansing the evil force with me.

380
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,950
Just stay and assist His Majesty.

381
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,830
If I don’t do anything,

382
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,950
I’ll live with a guilty conscience.

383
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,110
Other things aside,

384
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,560
you should put more thoughts

385
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,190
into yourself and Fengran.

386
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,560
Jingjian.

387
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,190
I know you’re caught in a dilemma.

388
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,950
But if you keep running away,

389
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,040
you won’t get back what you lost.

390
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,950
It’ll be too late to regret it then.

391
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,190
Is that your answer?

392
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,040
Fine.

393
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,110
From this moment onward,

394
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,560
the next time we meet,

395
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,110
we’ll be just friends.

396
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,640
Your Highness.

397
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,950
Your Highness.

398
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,590
It’s been a while since you
came to our Palace.

399
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,950
I’ll go tell Lady Fengran.

400
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,400
That’s unnecessary.

401
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,470
I’m here for Qingmu...

402
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,280
What am I thinking?

403
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,430
He’s left for the Human Realm

404
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,590
to deal with the evil force.

405
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,350
I’ll drop by some other day.

406
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,400
Your Highness,

407
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,280
don’t leave so soon.

408
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Please come in for tea.

409
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,590
Lady Fengran will call me rude

410
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,590
if she knows you leave like this.

411
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,880
Sorry, I’m needed elsewhere.

412
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,310
I’ll visit her next time.

413
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,470
Good day.

414
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,470
Yes.

415
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,590
That was odd.

416
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,070
I know he didn’t come here
for Lord Qingmu,

417
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,310
but for Lady Fengran.

418
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,470
Wait.

419
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,430
I’ve got to report to her.

420
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,950
My lady,

421
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,880
ever since you returned
from the Human Realm,

422
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,350
you’ve been wielding
your sword every day.

423
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,110
I’m tired if you aren’t.

424
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,560
My lady!

425
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,470
My lady!

426
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,710
My lady, I saw Prince Jingjian outside.

427
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,880
Really?

428
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,070
Ask him to leave.

429
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,830
He already did.

430
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,830
He left?

431
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,160
Where did you see him?

432
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,110
He was outside the gate just now,

433
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,160
claiming that he was here
for Lord Qingmu.

434
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,800
I asked him to come in for tea
but he said no.

435
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,560
He’d come by another day.

436
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,190
According to Qingmu,

437
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,430
Jingjian would see him off today.

438
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,680
What a lousy excuse!

439
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,670
I hate the most

440
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,830
that he’s always shilly-shallying.

441
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,110
I won’t forgive him forever!

442
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,400
My lady,

443
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,160
so you fell out with him?

444
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,190
No wonder you’ve been practicing so hard

445
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,350
with no appetite for food or drinks.

446
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,950
Nonsense!

447
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,190
He and I are done.

448
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,680
Don’t ever bring up

449
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,190
his name again!

450
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,020
Listen, you two,

451
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,880
if you do that again,

452
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,710
I’ll cut off

453
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,430
your tongues!

454
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,640
Get out of my sight!

455
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,350
Yes.

456
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,310
Wait for me.

457
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,920
Let’s go.

458
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,470
Which daredevil

459
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,710
get on your nerves, Lady Fengran?

460
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,430
Your Grace.

461
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,710
Don’t make fun of me, Your Grace.

462
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,070
The Heavenly Palace is never an ally.

463
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,040
From now on,

464
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,950
all their members are unwelcome here.

465
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,680
I’ve never seen Jingjian

466
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,880
as one of them.

467
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,830
He’s upright and kind

468
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,280
with a lot of potential.

469
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,470
If he wants,

470
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,880
my door is always open to him.

471
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,870
Your Grace,

472
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,160
you know he isn’t what you said.

473
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,680
Upright and kind? No way!

474
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,070
He’s nothing but a liar

475
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,190
and a knucklehead!

476
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,640
Losing your temper
can’t solve your problems.

477
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,190
As the younger prince
of the Heavenly Palace,

478
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,430
he must be responsible
for all Three Realms.

479
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,470
He wasn’t born only to love

480
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,160
and be loved.

481
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,070
More importantly,

482
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,430
the Heavenly Palace and us
have never been friends.

483
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,070
You also have an issue with Jingyang.

484
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,310
Won’t it be reckless

485
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,230
and irresponsible

486
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,110
if he makes empty promises to you

487
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,110
regardless of his standpoint?

488
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,040
But he...

489
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,950
All right.

490
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,160
Trust me.

491
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,680
In my eyes, he’s thoughtful.

492
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,310
You can depend on him.

493
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,040
Think that over.

494
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
Until now,

495
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,000
you’re still turning the facts
upside down.

496
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,160
60,000 years ago,

497
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,160
it’s you who killed Yue...

498
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,310
The Demon God hasn’t regained
his power of True God,

499
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,110
but it’s only a matter of time
before he tracks me down

500
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,280
and takes revenge for Yuemi.

501
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,400
My only option is to become stronger!

502
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,110
Didn’t you call yourself a skilled cook?

503
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,310
Come on,

504
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,310
you almost burned down the house!

505
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,230
I wonder how your Xuanjing Palace
is still intact.

506
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,400
If this house is burned,

507
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I can make you another one.

508
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,920
Once the smoke is gone,

509
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,040
I’ll try again.

510
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,520
Again?

511
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,830
If you keep cooking,

512
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,560
I won’t make it to 100 years.

513
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
How could I give up?

514
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,710
I said

515
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,880
I’d take care of you.

516
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,590
Cooking you food is my job.

517
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,070
I’ll do it.

518
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,400
That’s not right.

519
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,040
I’m here to look after you.

520
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,350
You shouldn’t do anything.

521
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,810
I’m a genius!

522
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,810
Even Qingmu hasn’t tried

523
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,140
Houchi’s food.

524
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,740
I beat him to it.

525
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,290
I wonder what Qingmu is doing.

526
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,170
It’s you!

527
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,410
You’ve been following me around

528
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,860
in all six cities in the Human Realm?

529
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,640
Your Grace,

530
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,540
if you’re doing that for fear of
me telling on Prince Jingyang,

531
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,620
then you can stop now.

532
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,300
Houchi has made Prince Jingjian decide

533
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,100
what to do.

534
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
I won’t have any objections.

535
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,900
You should go back, Your Grace.

536
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,020
Qingmu, I...

537
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,180
I simply meant to thank you.

538
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,980
Are you telling me

539
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,420
that we can’t even be friends?

540
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,180
To me,

541
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,260
you are and will forever be
Princess Jingzhao.

542
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,900
Evil force is still around.

543
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,340
I must eliminate it as soon as possible.

544
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,540
Please leave me alone, Your Grace.

545
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,260
As powerful as the seal is,

546
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,460
heavenly herbs are all over
the Hidden Mountain.

547
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,860
I can bring them back
to Chang Que to make medicine.

548
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,860
That’s Dixiu, a heavenly herb,
dating back to ancient times.

549
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
The Classic of Mountains and Rivers says

550
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,020
Dixiu grows yellow followers
and bears black fruits.

551
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,020
It can allay anger

552
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,340
and concerns.

553
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,980
I want Qingmu to have it.

554
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,500
Is it his letter?

555
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,540
Dear Houchi,

556
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,580
how have you been?

557
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,660
(Bai’s Mansion)
We’ve been apart for two years.

558
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,060
How’s it going on Hidden Mountain?

559
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,700
Back here in Dibei Town,
it’s already late autumn.

560
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,900
Shuo is a big girl now.

561
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,620

when you mentioned Jingyuan
in your last letter,

566
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,980

the mighty Demon God

622

your fairness, Your Majesty.

623
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,980
There’s one more thing

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,740
that requires your decision.

625
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,460
Immortals and demons went to war
at the Demon Region earlier.

626
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,420
Demons accused us

627
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,060
of holding their members hostage.

628
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,900
At first,

629
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,020
I thought that was merely their excuse

630
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,500
to wage war.

631
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,100
However,

632
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,660
I accidentally found

633
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,620
those missing demons

634
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,380
who should’ve been
in the Heavenly Prison.

635
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,060
They all died horribly.

636
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,340
Energy dried up.

637
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,740

638
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,060
Devilish Energy!

639
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,700
The Devil God was eliminated

640
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,300
by Gods 60,000 years ago,

641
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,140
but resentment, hatred and evil

642
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,180
can all demonize humans.

643
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,780
If the missing demons

644
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,060
were set free deliberately,

645
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
whoever did that must be one of us.

646
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,940
Donghua, this is serious.

647
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,740
Keep it secret

648
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,980
before everything is checked out.

649
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

650
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,300
I won’t say a word to others.

651
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,780
Father.

652
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,580
What’s the emergency?

653
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Is it about the Demon Region again?

654
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,420
Don’t panic.

655
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,700
I didn’t summon you

656
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,180
for the war.

657
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,060
I need you to go to the Parasol Forest.

658
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,060
Parasol Forest?

659
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,220
Elder Feng Yun made your mother

660
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,780
Leader of the Feng Clan
before he passed away,

661
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,380
but as his successor,

662
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,340
she’s been stuck in
the Nether World for nearly 100 years.

663
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,580
The Feng Clan can’t be leaderless.

664
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,580
You’re her son,

665
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,860
hence the heir to her position.

666
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,180
But Father,

667
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,420
I’m still too young
and unqualified for it.

668
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,220
What’s more,

669
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,460
Mother will soon be back

670
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,620
from the Nether World.

671
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,500
I’ve made my decision,

672
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,180
period.

673
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,060
As my son,

674
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,700
you have nothing to worry about.

675
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,260
You may leave.

676
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,900
Yes.

677
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,220
What?

678
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,340
His Majesty entrusted Jingjian
with the Feng Clan!

679
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,540
Your Highness,

680
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,300
I know how much
the Feng Clan means to you,

681
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
but Prince Jingjian is your son.

682
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,340
What’s wrong with him
taking charge of it?

683
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,780
Sorry, I overstepped the boundary.

684
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,940
I don’t have to hide it from you.

685
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,340
There’s something

686
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,380
in the Parasol Forest of the Feng Clan

687
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,700
that I wish to keep from Jingjian.

688
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,780
What’s the status

689
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,340
of the demons that we need?

690
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,180
Everything goes as you planned.

691
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,340
Spiritual power of demons in this core

692
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,180
can purify the devil power
in your system.

693
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,380
If I had been more careful,

694
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,460
the devil power
wouldn’t have been in my system.

695
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,060
One misstep only leads to more.

696
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,460
At this stage, all I can do

697
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,580
is cleanse my polluted energy

698
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,340
with immortals and demons’ power.

699
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,220
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

700
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,980
I’ll bring you

701
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,180
as much as you need.

702
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,060
Since I became the Leader,

703
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,660
I’ve devoted myself to the Feng Clan.

704
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,100
Over the past 60,000 years,

705
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,540
the Parasol Forest has been
under my protection.

706
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,020
The whole clan puts me on a pedestal.

707
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,180
They owe me.

708
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,500
It’s time for them to pay me back.

709
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,140
Are you going to

710
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,020
sacrifice them?

711
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,060
The Feng Clan has been around
for hundreds of thousands of years.

712
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,700
No one has ever been near my level.

713
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,060
If I’m degraded to a demon,

714
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,340
that’ll bring the Clan down,

715
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,980
and destroy it eventually.

716
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,500
Hundreds of lives

717
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,860
are a small price to pay

718
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,020
for the sake of our honor.

719
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,340
Your Highness...

720
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,380
You’ve been with me for years.

721
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,300
If something bad

722
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,140
happens to me,

723
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,020
you can’t get away with it, either.

724
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,260
I understand.

725
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,660
How has Elder Danfeng been?

726
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
The same as before.

727
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,500
Acting crazy all day.

728
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,820
I heard death is only a matter of time.

729
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,620
I’ve attached my Spiritual Strength
on this instruction feather.

730
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,660
Go ahead

731
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
and bring it to Elder Danfeng.

732
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Are you going to...

733
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,940
That’s to purify my energy

734
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,940
and keep everything in the Forest safe.

735
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,780
I have no choice.

736
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,140
Yes.

737
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,020
Seriously?

738
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,340
I’ve made that dish more than once.

739
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,860
It’s not as good as yours,

740
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,380
but it can’t be that bad.

741
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,540
My fault.

742
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,340
I shouldn’t have

743
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,140
eaten that much in the morning.

744
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,260
I’m probably stuffed.

745
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,500
Here.

746
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,460
Try this fish.

747
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,460
Fresh from the water.

748
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,660
It’s the best.

749
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,300
Come on,

750
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,940
open your mouth.

751
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,140
Houchi,

752
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,660
I know you’re weak,

753
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,940
but still, you’re an immortal.

754
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,860
How come you’re acting like
a fragile human?

755
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,860
Are you coming down with...?

756
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,020
How does

757
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,100
my spiritual power become like this?

758
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,500
Silver and red power.

759
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,060
Houchi,

760
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,980
are you pregnant?

761
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,300
Houchi,

762
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,820
it’s the natural law

763
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,140
for men and women

764
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,340
and all beings to reproduce.

765
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,340
Although we’re different from humans,

766
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,660
you don’t need to...

767
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,380
Houchi.

768
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,540
Houchi? Houchi!

769
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,980
Let’s keep this secret

770
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,300
until we see Qingmu again.

771
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,060
How strange!

772
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,140
The Parasol Forest has never
been so quiet before.

773
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,820
What’s happening?

774
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,380
Oh, no!

775
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,260
The Feng Clan must be in trouble!

776
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,700
Fengran!

777
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,380
What are you doing here?

778
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,380
Yuck!

779
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,700
You seem fine.

780
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,820
Better leave now.

781
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,660
Something is happening in the Forest.

782
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,660
Lady Fengran, may I ask

783
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,660
about your source of information?

784
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,460
Drop that tone.

785
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,420
Don’t be pretentious.

786
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,140
Whatever.

787
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,540
I’m not as petty as you are.

788
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,380
See for yourself.

789
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,660
“My days are numbered.

790
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,660
I hope I can see you before I die.

791
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,180
It’s about your background.”

792
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,420
Your background?

793
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,620
Who wrote you that letter?

794
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,620
No idea.

795
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,020
All I know is it’s from the Feng Clan.

796
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,260
Feng Clan?

797
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,340
That handwriting seems familiar.

798
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,300
It looks like Elder Danfeng’s
of the Feng Clan.

799
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Elder Danfeng?

800
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,140
I must find him.

801
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,940
Qingmu, what are you doing?

802
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,500
What demon are you?

803
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,340
Remove your disguise!

804
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,340
Qingmu, are you out of your mind?

805
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,980
What demon?

806
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,860
I’m Fengran!

807
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,260
Are you demonized

808
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,620
that you don’t even recognize me?

809
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,580
Jingjian,

810
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,460
