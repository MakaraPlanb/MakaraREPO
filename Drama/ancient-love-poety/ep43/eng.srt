2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 43=

3
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,780
In others’ eyes,

4
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,220
I’m still the closest to you.

5
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,860
You’re straightforward.

6
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,070
Much better than finding excuses.

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,070
On today’s wedding,

8
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,260
I was already humiliated.

9
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,430
Master, please show some mercy

10
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,460
and don’t expel me from the Dome.

11
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,500
Discard you after making use of you...

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,630
I wouldn’t be so mean.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
As long as you behave yourself,

14
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,460
you’ll get the honor you expect.

15
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,110
Thank you, Master.

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,780
So, you agreed to marry me

17
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,220
for Goddess Shanggu.

18
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,040
Right?

19
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,670
You shouldn’t have asked.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,260
I don’t need to be taken care of
when I lock myself up.

21
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,390
Do as you like.

22
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,620
Shanggu,

23
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,390
I took away your memories
after you went to the Nether World.

24
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,700
Then,

25
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,910
you wouldn’t know
what the Tribulation of Chaos was.

26
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,550
Jingyang,

27
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,340
you started the war
between immortals and demons.

28
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,860
Go out and get twenty thunder strikes.

29
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,980
As for the Deicide Flower,
those heavenly guards

30
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,340
have been pacified.

31
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,340
Don’t bring it up ever again.

32
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,340
Yes, Father.

33
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,670
It’s a capital crime to kill Gods!

34
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,310
Do you want our children
to die with you?

35
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,620
If I hadn’t interceded with Jingzhao,

36
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,390
Jingyang would have been dead!

37
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,740
Where did you get the Deicide Flower?

38
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,780
Did you bring it back
from the Nether World?

39
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,900
You’re the Heavenly Empress.

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,710
Why did you do that?

41
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,390
What on earth do you want?

42
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,390
I killed Goddess Yuemi.

43
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,870
What did you say?

44
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,110
You killed my master?

45
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,020
I lied about it
for sixty thousand years.

46
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,270
Now,

47
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,670
I can’t keep it anymore.

48
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,300
That explains.

49
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,270
You started wars against demons
several times.

50
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,830
And just now, you insisted

51
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,900
on killing Houchi and the Demon God.

52
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,710
Punish me as you wish.

53
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,390
I’ll take it.

54
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,220
She’s my master!

55
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,020
How can I accept the truth?

56
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,740
How can I shield you again?

57
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,150
Sixty thousand years ago,

58
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,110
I had planned to stop the Demon God
from initiating the Destruction Formation.

59
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,900
I never expected Goddess Yuemi

60
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500
to rush out and protect the Demon God.

61
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,110
I wanted to stop the Demon God.

62
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,780
Unexpectedly, she...

63
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,150
Was that really an accident?

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,110
Goddess Yuemi was nice to me

65
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,620
and she’s your master.

66
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,900
She wasn’t my enemy.

67
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,710
Why did I have to kill her?

68
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,110
You know I had a humble origin.

69
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,780
By mistake,

70
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,710
Goddess Shanggu took me
to the God Realm.

71
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,950
Other gods didn’t say it,

72
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,060
but they despised my poor birth.

73
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,460
So, I wanted to prove I could help!

74
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,460
Then, I was eager to do something
to stop the Demon God.

75
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,950
Don’t be absurd!

76
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,710
It’s dangerous.

77
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,750
Go back.

78
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,710
I know I have weak power.

79
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,110
But I also want to fight

80
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,900
for Her Grace.

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,830
If I stay and do nothing,

82
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,620
how can I be relieved?

83
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,150
How can I stay in the God Realm?

84
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,270
To cover this up,

85
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,590
I kept starting wars.

86
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,340
I’ve been haunted
over the past hundreds of years.

87
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,900
I’m exhausted

88
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,670
and I can’t keep it anymore.

89
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,990
Today, after I take punishment,

90
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,430
I’ll be freed, too.

91
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,220
Do it.

92
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,870
We’re a couple.

93
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,150
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,780
If I told you,

95
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,460
you would have been implicated.

96
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,550
It was an accident.

97
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,180
But I indeed killed Goddess Yuemi.

98
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,830
I can’t get away from the crime

99
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,150
of killing a goddess.

100
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,900
The prestige of the Heavenly Palace,

101
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,740
your reputation,

102
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,300
our children...

103
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,110
All will be implicated.

104
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,670
Tomorrow, declare to the Three Realms

105
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,670
that I became a devil.

106
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,990
You and our children
can break off with me.

107
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,710
Only in this way will you
not be implicated.

108
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,830
It’s the only option!

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,340
What did you say?

110
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,180
Became a devil?

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,590
You’re also involved

112
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,670
in the slaughter of the Feng Clan?

113
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,110
Huan,

114
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,220
don’t make fun of the devil thing.

115
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,060
Since you knew

116
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,060
I killed Goddess Yuemi,

117
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,270
you’re looking at me

118
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,500
as if I were

119
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,430
a real devil.

120
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,670
My master died in an accident.

121
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,110
It wasn’t all your fault.

122
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,270
After I took one wrong step,

123
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,220
I kept doing wrong things.

124
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,390
In case the Demon God

125
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,030
told the secret to Master Bai Jue,

126
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,980
I went to the Nether World,

127
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
picked the Deicide Flower
and gave it to Jingyang.

128
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,790
What do I do?

129
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,270
Master Bai Jue has already suspected me

130
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,230
for being involved in the devil thing.

131
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,710
I’ll cover it up for you

132
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,980
to Master Bai Jue.

133
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,420
What you just said...

134
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,180
I’ll pretend I didn’t hear.

135
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,150
Muguang.

136
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,830
From this day on,

137
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,150
stay in the Heavenly Palace
and do good deeds

138
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,060
to atone for your crimes.

139
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,860
I’m guilty.

140
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,470
I won’t go anywhere.

141
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,390
From tomorrow on,

142
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,350
I’ll keep going
to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

143
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,390
and begging for my master’s forgiveness.

144
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,540
If Master Bai Jue

145
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,420
asks who is to blame,

146
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,710
what should we do?

147
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,660
Hope your credits can be paid
for your crime.

148
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,270
If they can’t,

149
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,540
I’ll take punishment with you.

150
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,950
You can help me for a while,

151
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,180
but not for ever.

152
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,030
I won’t stop practicing the devil power.

153
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,100
If Shanggu returns,

154
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Bai Jue gets back his power
and blames me too,

155
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,270
I’ll become a humble immortal again.

156
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,230
No.

157
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,540
I’ll be more miserable.

158
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,950
Still deny you’re Qingmu?

159
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,740
Poor Houchi.

160
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,910
Even when she died, she didn’t know

161
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,800
you were Boxuan.

162
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,620
(Tomb of Father Gu Jun)
When we fought, you hinted to me

163
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,540
that I stopped you, I would regret.

164
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,300
The very same thing.

165
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,660
I said it sixty thousand years ago.

166
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,270
So,

167
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,790
I went to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

168
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,910
where I found

169
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,150
the Tribulation of Chaos you sealed.

170
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,660
I thought only I would pretend to be evil
and take the Tribulation for her.

171
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,060
I never knew

172
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,030
you would do it too.

173
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,620
There’s something you’d better not know.

174
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,980
My plan failed sixty thousand years ago.

175
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,270
Yours may not succeed, either.

176
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,390
How about this?

177
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,950
Let’s exchange our missions.

178
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,950
I’ll go take the Tribulation

179
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,350
and you take care of Shanggu.

180
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,300
Zihan and Yuemi died.

181
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,030
I have no one to care about.

182
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
You and Shanggu are different.

183
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,790
You can get back to each other.

184
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,980
After Shanggu wakes up,

185
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,980
I don’t want to know
how much you love each other.

186
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,300
But if you quarrel,

187
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,910
you can tell me in front of my tomb.

188
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Do you have the Power of Chaos?

189
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,980
How did you get it?

190
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,350
Sixty thousand years ago,

191
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,180
I exhausted my Power
of the Original Being

192
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
and stuck the Tribulation of Chaos
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

193
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,910
so that it could be delayed.

194
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,620
After that,

195
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,230
I searched
for Shanggu’s lingering ghost,

196
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,390
and looked for the way
to get the Power of Chaos.

197
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,150
Air of demon?

198
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,740
After the Tribulation of Chaos,

199
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,620
I was working on this flower.

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,060
I found that

201
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,230
the Deicide Flower lives on
absorbing the air of demon

202
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,710
and the air of immortal.

203
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,030
Between the two kinds of air,

204
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,150
the air of chaos is generated.

205
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,710
So, I guess,

206
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,790
if I get full Demon Power
and the Immortal Power

207
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,660
and then mix them,

208
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,620
may I also get the Power of Chaos?

209
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,180
So, you suffered the pain
of splitting your Original Being

210
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,790
and made Qingmu’s body

211
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,620
so that he could fully absorb
the air of demon?

212
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,500
Right.

213
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,950
But when I was mixing with Qingmu,

214
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,180
something unexpected happened.

215
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,910
I failed to seal
his Power of Original Being

216
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,100
in the first chance.

217
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Then he had his own Spiritual Strength.

218
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,860
He grew up in the North Sea

219
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,270
and fell in love with Houchi.

220
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,660
All of this

221
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,590
went far away from my plan.

222
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,590
Do you know

223
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,060
you may easily die
when you split your Original Being?

224
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,300
Do you know

225
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,420
because of your craziness,

226
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,950
Houchi lived in grief and regret
even until she died?

227
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,120
I know.

228
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,540
Qingmu. Houchi.

229
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,230
And Gu Jun.

230
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,270
I’m sorry to them.

231
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,470
Many things

232
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,830
went beyond my expectation.

233
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,470
So, I won’t let anyone

234
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,620
influence me again
on taking the Tribulation for Shanggu.

235
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,060
Tell me.

236
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,100
How can I help you?

237
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,620
Wu Huan wants to kill you.

238
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,270
You must be very careful.

239
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,740
I’m afraid of her?

240
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,980
If it were in the past,

241
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,830
I would have led my troop
to massacre the Heavenly Palace

242
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,350
and split Wu Huan into halves.

243
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,390
What will you do now?

244
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,180
Wu Huan has managed the Heavenly Palace
for sixty thousand years.

245
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,300
She has strong power.

246
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,910
If I want to take her down,

247
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,420
I must have conclusive evidence.

248
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,350
Or I can’t convince everyone
in the Three Realms.

249
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,350
Right.

250
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,150
After all, you’re cursed
for destroying the world.

251
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,500
Teasing me?

252
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,180
You didn’t expose Wu Huan

253
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,270
for becoming a devil, did you?

254
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,060
She can hide her devil power
as she wishes.

255
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,350
We can’t underestimate her then.

256
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,420
Before we’re fully prepared,

257
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,030
we can’t act rashly.

258
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,860
Forget it.

259
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,830
Let her show off for a bit longer.

260
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,910
Compared to punishing her,

261
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,740
making immortals and demons
become friends again

262
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
and get recovered

263
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,350
matters most.

264
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,150
I promised Zihan that

265
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,230
I wouldn’t be reckless again.

266
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,950
If Zhiyang heard you,

267
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
he would be proud of you.

268
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,230
Yeah.

269
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,540
I miss him, too.

270
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,460
Bai Jue.

271
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,420
The boy...

272
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,540
I saw him secretly.

273
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,470
He’s much more lovely than you.

274
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,980
I’ve been bothered about his name.

275
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,950
What do you think?

276
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,500
He’s got a name.

277
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,300
Yuanqi.

278
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,420
His mother picked the name.

279
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,590
I shouldn’t have been bothered.

280
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,100
It’s also your son with Shanggu.

281
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,270
Ice Cube,

282
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,620
congratulations.

283
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,660
You’re a father now.

284
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,470
It’s not convenient for him
to live with me.

285
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Let him and his mother

286
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,500
stay in Qingchi Palace.

287
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,590
You’ve made up your mind?

288
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,830
He has the Power of Chaos.

289
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,660
I’m afraid Wu Huan may make use of him.

290
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,860
You.

291
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,420
Remember not to let him use his power
in front of others.

292
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,540
I’m certainly aware.

293
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,980
Don’t worry.

294
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,180
Before you turned up,

295
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,300
I had been very nice to him.

296
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,420
Tianqi,

297
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,230
don’t waste your time.

298
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,710
Get back your power carefully.

299
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,660
If there’s another Tribulation of Chaos,

300
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,020
it’s your turn to handle it.

301
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,140
I see. I see.

302
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,590
And the demons.

303
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,830
You’re taking care of them, aren’t you?

304
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,180
Ice Cube,

305
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,750
why can’t you ever change

306
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,660
your bad habit

307
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,900
of nagging and instructing others?

308
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,950
Zihan.

309
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,590
Will you restrain him or not?

310
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,630
Look at Yuanqi.

311
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,870
He wanted to know how birds fly,

312
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,870
and then he pulled off all the feather

313
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,510
from their wings.

314
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,510
He’s too powerful.

315
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,420
If you don’t instruct him,

316
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
we won’t defeat him.

317
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,230
As the saying goes,

318
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,710
a naughty boy is good

319
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
and a naughty girl is smart.

320
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,300
I think

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,180
he just wants to know everything.

322
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,950
That’s good.

323
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,380
Keep spoiling him.

324
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,750
Let’s see if Goddess Shanggu blames you
after she wakes up.

325
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,060
Ancestral Sword?

326
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,590
This sword looks so weird.

327
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,990
Want to run away?

328
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,590
I’ll take it to my yellow dog.

329
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
Where am I?

330
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,590
There’s no Devilish Energy at all.

331
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,180
Was I hurt

332
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,950
and taken out of the Nether World?

333
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,260
Boy,

334
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,300
why did you disassemble
my Ancestral Sword?

335
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,660
Don’t you know it is mine?

336
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,370
You’re awake?

337
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,180
I had thought you would never wake up.

338
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Who are you?

339
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,590
How rude you are!

340
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,060
You’re finally awake.

341
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,380
Don’t pretend you’re sad.

342
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,780
You disassembled my sword.

343
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,540
I haven’t cried yet.

Yes.

00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,710
The God Realm is closed.

376
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,060
There’s a Human Realm now.

377
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,750
Yuemi, Zhiyang, Gu Jun

378
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,540
and Zihan are maintaining the God Realm?

379
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,660
Muguang and Wu Huan
are managing the Immortal Realm.

380
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,060
They take care of the Human Realm, too.

381
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,020
So, Bai Jue

382
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,060
totally abandoned me?

383
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,230
He had a son with a female immortal

384
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,540
and then this female immortal

385
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,180
was dead?

386
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,590
Now, Bai Jue is living in the Dome,

387
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,830
and staying

388
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,060
with Wu Huan’s daughter,

389
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,180
Jingzhao?

390
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,140
Yeah.

391
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,510
I’ve been taking care of Yuanqi.

392
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,230
It’s too much information.

393
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,660
I can’t even believe it.

394
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,140
This boy is impolite.

395
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,590
Indeed, you brought him up.

396
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,470
I brought you up, too, didn’t I?

397
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,710
You remember Feng Yan and Wuxi?

398
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,470
This is their daughter Fengran.

399
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,540
She ranks as your junior.

400
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,140
But you’ll have a lot to talk about.

401
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,990
Greetings, Master.

402
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,950
Yuanqi,

403
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,060
what does your mother look like?

404
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,830
Exactly like you.

405
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,380
How dare you compare me
to a mere immortal!

406
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,180
You look exactly alike.

407
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,630
Didn’t we agree on what you should say?

408
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,470
What do you mean now?

409
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,540
You didn’t offer enough weapons.

410
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,590
I want the Purple Moon Whip.

411
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,230
You’re raising the price!

412
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,420
Will you give it or not?

413
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,630
Deal, then.

414
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,710
What are you whispering?

415
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,750
He wants to urinate.

416
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,660
Go alone.

417
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,660
Don’t break it.

418
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,050
Wait.

419
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,420
I want to urinate.

420
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,110
You said

421
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,420
I looked exactly like your mother.

422
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,020
Is that true?

423
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,630
In fact,

424
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,110
when I was born,

425
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,230
my mother died.

426
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,420
So, I never know

427
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,950
what she looks like.

428
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,750
May I go and urinate now?

429
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,380
You call Tianqi uncle.

430
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,510
Call me aunt, then.

431
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,230
It’s so nice of you, Aunt.

432
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,750
You missed a lot when you were asleep
for a hundred years.

433
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,260
Do ask Uncle Tianqi about it.

434
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,420
Yuanqi said I was asleep
for a hundred years.

435
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,300
But you said sixty thousand years.

436
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Explain to me.

437
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,630
You fell in sleep twice.

438
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,510
Sixty thousand years for the first time.

439
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,710
Only a hundred years
for the second time.

440
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,780
Twice?

441
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,260
Why don’t I have the memories
of the interval?

442
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,870
Why are you still fooling me?

443
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,750
Fengran.

444
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,260
Master, you just woke up.

445
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,180
You must be angry.

446
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,230
The porridge is being cooked
in the kitchen.

447
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,660
I’ll go have a look.

448
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,020
By the way,

449
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,630
Shanggu,

450
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,510
I’ve learned something new
in the past hundred years,

451
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,380
the pear cake.

452
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,470
I’ll go make some for you.

453
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,870
In the past sixty thousand years,

454
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,830
what on earth did I do?

455
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,420
Xuanjin Iron, Phoenix Feather,

456
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,950
Dragon Horn and Black Tortoise Shell

457
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,140
are Divine Beast from four directions.

458
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
They’re of the same origin.

459
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,350
Made of such four kinds of material,

460
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,660
the Ancestral Sword is powerful.

461
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,140
Xuanjin Iron is the bucktooth
of the Divine Beast White Tiger.

462
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,540
The Black Tortoise Shell

463
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,140
is the armor
of the Divine Beast Tortoise.

464
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,590
It could keep off everything.

465
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,020
So,

466
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,140
Xuanjin Iron is used for the sword.

467
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,020
The Black Tortoise Shell is used
for the scabbard.

468
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,020
One can pierce everything

469
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,020
and the other can keep off everything.

470
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,020
Uncle Tianqi,

471
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,540
if we pierce the Black Tortoise Shell
with Xuanjin Iron,

472
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,470
what will happen?

473
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,780
No one has tried this before.

474
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,830
Maybe both will be damaged.

475
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,590
I’ll try it, then.

476
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,740
Yuanqi,

477
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
if the material is ruined,

478
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,140
the Ancestral Sword will be scrapped.

479
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,510
It’s your mother’s treasure.

480
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,750
All right, then.

481
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,110
Yuanqi,

482
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,540
your mother just woke up.

483
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,350
I must tell you something.

484
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,750
Are you telling me what to say again?

485
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,830
Not really.

486
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,630
But...

487
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,540
Uncle Tianqi,

488
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,750
the other day, Fengran took me
off the mountain.

489
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,750
We met Xiaoba of Flower Demons.

490
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,540
Uncle Tianqi,

491
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,420
you know that.

492
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,630
Xiaoba is

493
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,180
even 50 years younger than me.

494
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,140
When we walked closer,

495
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,990
we saw him holding a dagger

496
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,540
carved with his birthdate.

497
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
We asked him and knew that

498
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,020
the elder of Flower Demons

499
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,470
gave it to him for cultivation.

500
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,590
Uncle Tianqi,

501
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,350
I’m a hundred years old.

502
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,060
But I don’t have a good magic weapon.

503
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,110
If I still don’t have any,

504
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,110
my friends will laugh at me.

505
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,300
Since you were born,

506
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,990
I’ve given you
at least hundreds of magic weapons.

507
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,380
But they belonged to others.

508
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,990
They’re not made for me.

509
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,020
They’re not peculiar.

510
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,020
Xiaoba is 50 years younger than you.

511
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,260
But at least,

512
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,830
he has a master
and cultivates himself seriously.

513
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,140
But look at you.

514
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,870
You haven’t started
your cultivation yet.

515
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,950
Why do you want a magic weapon?

516
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,660
I don’t care.

517
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,590
I want one.

518
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,470
Say no more.

519
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,990
You won’t get it.

520
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,020
Uncle Tianqi,

521
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,020
you didn’t see

522
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,540
how Xiaoba looked
when he was using his dagger.

523
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,900
So proud.

524
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,830
He didn’t even agree to lend it to me.

525
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,180
Lend it to you?

526
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,660
You won’t ever return it.

527
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
He’s not a fool.

528
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,110
Uncle Tianqi,

529
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,830
Mother has the Ancestral Sword.

530
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,230
You have the Purple Moon Whip.

531
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,380
Fengran has the Feather Fire Whip.

532
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,830
Every immortal on Qilian Mountains

533
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,140
has his own weapon.

534
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,380
Even the rat demon
who is shorter than me

535
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,750
has magic claws.

536
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,900
I don’t have any.

537
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,230
I don’t care! I must have one!

538
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,830
You can’t.

539
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,300
You’re going too far.

540
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,300
Why can you say I’m going too far?

541
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,060
Because I’m your uncle.

542
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,140
All right.

543
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,870
Forget it, then.

544
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,420
I’ll go make one for myself.

545
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,990
Yuanqi,

546
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,060
I promise you.

547
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,300
In a couple of years,

548
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,710
you will have

549
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,060
a unique magic weapon of your own.

550
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,830
It’ll be very powerful.

551
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,350
Much better than your friends’ weapons.

552
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,990
Are you sure?

553
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,350
You’re so smart.

554
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,540
How dare I deceive you!

555
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,180
What was I going to say just now?

556
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,950
You said you would go
and buy sugar-coated haws for me.

557
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,300
I want sugar-coated haws.

558
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,420
Well,

559
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,180
I can do this for you.

560
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,540
Strawberries at the foot of the mountain
are ripe.

561
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,990
Put them on a stick with haws

562
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,630
and wrap them with thick sugar.

563
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,750
They’ll taste very sour and sweet.

564
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,660
What a glutton!

565
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,900
Get me up.

566
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,830
Uncle Tianqi, where are you going?

567
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,420
Go make sugar-coated haws for you.

568
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,950
You’re the best to me!

569
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,420
By absorbing the evil force
over the past hundred years

570
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,870
I’ve gained much more devil power.

571
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,260
Even if I’m exposed someday,

572
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,110
I won’t be scared.

573
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,870
Your Highness.

574
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,140
Fengnyu,

575
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,110
you’re just in time.

576
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,510
Try the sweet juice.

577
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,540
What? You think I poisoned it?

578
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,540
I don’t dare, Your Highness.

579
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,870
It tastes so sweet.

580
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

581
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,590
How are you doing

582
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,830
with your mission?

583
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,230
Your Highness,

584
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,510
when I traveled
around the Immortal Realm,

585
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,260
I collected many Spiritual Strength
of immortals who died in injustice.

586
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,830
I’ve put them in the bottle.

587
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,590
The evil force in their Strengths

588
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,350
and the Devilish Energy
in the Nether World

589
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,110
will help you more with cultivation.

590
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,770
Fengnyu,

591
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,300
since I locked myself up,

592
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,350
there’ve been few visitors
to Fuyao Hall.

593
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,950
Only you never leave me.

594
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,230
I’m willing to do anything for you.

595
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,830
Don’t say thank you, Your Highness.

596
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,660
But there’s something

597
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,900
I want to ask you for permission.

598
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,540
What is it?

599
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,780
Feel free to tell me.

600
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,380
Before I came back,

601
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,140
I took a trip to the Parasol Forest.

602
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,870
Many baby phoenixes have hatched.

603
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,230
I want to...

604
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,830
Leave the Heavenly Palace?

605
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,420
The Parasol Forest is my hometown.

606
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,590
And we need to rebuild the Feng Clan.

607
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,350
But you know

608
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,870
I can’t do without you.

609
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,590
Even if I stay in the Feng Clan,

610
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,060
I’ll also take orders from you.

611
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,180
All right, then.

612
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,140
Now that you insist on leaving,

613
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,180
I won’t keep you.

614
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

615
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,300
All devils,

616
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,420
alive or dead,

617
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,300
take orders from me.

618
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,590
According to Tianqi,

619
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,180
in Qingchi Palace,

620
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,710
there’s not even
one complete magic weapon.

621
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,870
Why did you dismantle them?

622
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,590
I want to figure out

623
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,300
what it is in the weapon.

624
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,630
They’re rare weapons.

625
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,540
But there’s no mechanism in them.

626
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,140
I’m just confused.

627
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,870
Why do they have different power

628
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,300
when they’re assembled?

629
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,660
Why is every magic weapon

630
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,110
made of different material?

631
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,470
Your Ancestral Sword, for example.

632
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,900
It’s made of Xuanjin Iron,
Phoenix Feather,

633
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,230
Dragon Horn and Black Tortoise Shell.

634
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,590
Xuanjin Iron is used for the sword.

635
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
The Phoenix Feather is used
for the tail.

636
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,900
The Dragon Horn is used for the handle.

637
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,140
The Black Tortoise Shell is used
for the scabbard.

638
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,420
Why must we use
these four kinds of material

639
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,630
to make the Ancestral Sword?

640
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,110
All kinds of materials are hard.

641
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,060
Why can’t Xuanjin Iron
be used for scabbard?

642
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,950
Why can’t the Black Tortoise Shell
be used for the sword?

643
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,350
I’ve never thought about it before.

644
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,470
Even you don’t know?

645
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,860
You’re the Chief God.

646
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,070
I know.

647
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,310
But I was asleep for quite a long time.

648
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,900
I don’t remember much when I wake up.

649
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,660
Tianqi told me about you.

650
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,140
Your father looks cold.

651
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,510
But he’s always serious.

652
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,660
Unexpectedly, he’s even worse to you

653
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,340
than Tianqi.

654
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,620
From now on, stay with me

655
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,100
and let me take care of you
for your father, all right?

656
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,310
Your mother is an immortal.

657
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,790
But you’re the offspring of Gods.

658
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,990
As long as you behave yourself,

659
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,310
I’ll give you whatever you want.

660
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,380
All right?

661
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,140
Really?

662
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,470
I want my mother.

663
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,180
Have another wish.

664
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,230
For example,

665
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,230
shall I take you to see your father?

666
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,990
Why must I see him?

667
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,790
Tianqi told me that

668
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,140
he had never taken you to the Dome.

669
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,270
You look exactly like your father.

670
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,340
When he sees you,

671
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,580
he will like you.

672
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,180
He’s never come to see me.

673
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,860
Why must I go see him?

674
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,710
Besides,

675
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,420
he doesn’t have treasures.

676
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,750
I don’t want to go.

677
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,270
You want to see Bai Jue, don’t you?

678
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,900
We’re suffering the same.

679
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,550
We were discarded by him.

680
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,230
We should go and get even with him.

681
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,100
How?

682
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,470
Question him in the face.

683
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,550
Ask him why he changed so easily

684
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,070
and ignored others’ feelings.

685
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,510
If he dare talk back,

686
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,580
teach him a lesson.

687
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,580
I just learned the Power of Chaos

688
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,900
in the Nether World,

689
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,860
I can fight with him.

690
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,030
No way.

691
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,270
Why?

692
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
You don’t want me to hurt your father.

693
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,030
No!

694
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,140
It’ll be too easy for him.

695
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Why don’t we just burn the Dome?

696
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,550
We indeed think alike!

697
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,540
(Qingchi Palace)

698
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,070
Why do you have
bigger sugar-coated haws?

699
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,270
Uncle Tianqi made them for me.

700
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,310
I needn’t have bought any.

701
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,950
When did Tianqi learn to make them?

702
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,420
I forced him.

703
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,950
Let’s go.

704
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,470
I’ll lead the way.

705
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,420
You can fly on clouds?

706
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,620
Don’t use the Power of Chaos
in front of your mother.

707
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,510
Understand?

708
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,270
Here.

709
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,060
No.

710
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
I show you the way and you take me.

711
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,470
Hold me, then.

712
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,030
Hold me tightly.

713
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,070
If you fall,
I can’t take responsibility.

714
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,820
Hold it for me.

715
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,310
Diaphragm.

716
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,990
I should use my diaphragm
for the Power of Chaos.

717
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,470
I was too muddle-headed.

718
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,790
How do you know?

719
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
From books.

720
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,030
You’re indeed Bai Jue’s son.

721
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,510
You can instruct me
when you’re so young.

722
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,820
Let’s go.

723
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,820
It looks the same with Changyuan hall.

724
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,140
Let’s make a deal.

725
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,660
You can only look,
but can’t say anything.

726
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,820
Didn’t we agree to burn the place?

727
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,820
Burn the place?

728
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,510
I’m the Chief God of the Three Realms.

729
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,100
Isn’t it

730
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,140
very bad?

731
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,140
Wasn’t he bad

732
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,660
when he discarded us?

733
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,860
Be a good boy.

734
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,660
Good boy.

735
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,550
Are you not going to question him too?

736
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,660
It’s been sixty thousand years.

737
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,030
I don’t even remember much.

738
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,660
How shall I question him?

739
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,660
Shall we peek at him from the roof?

740
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,070
We...

741
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,140
We didn’t come in through the gate.

742
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,510
It’s already rude.

743
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,420
If I peek at him on the roof

744
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,270
and Bai Jue finds me,

745
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,660

Wasn’t he shameless

when he abandoned us?

Didn’t you say
you weren’t scared of him?

752
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,340
I’m not scared. It’s hard to explain.

753
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,340
All right, then.

754
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,310

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,340
Tianqi should have told me

766
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,070
so that I could visit you
in Qingchi Palace.

767
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,070
