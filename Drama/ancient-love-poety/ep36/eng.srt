00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:28,960
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,320
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,820
I’ll be in the Hidden Mountain
for 100 years,

4
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,290
which is not

5
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,140
over-long.

6
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,890
What’s worrying me the most is you.

7
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,780
No need to worry about me.

8
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,370
I’ll take care of Qingchi Palace
for you.

9
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,570
But

10
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,140
you’ll have no one to share feelings.

11
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,330
Won’t you feel lonely?

12
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,100
How could I be lonely?

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,060
I could read stories and play dice.

14
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,820
I’m pretty good at enjoying myself.

15
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,740
But now

16
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,180
whom will you share feelings with?

17
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,740
You read my mind?

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,460
We have been together
for ten thousand years.

19
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,820
Undoubtedly, we know each other well.

20
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,220
He’s Jingjian?

21
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,650
Am I wrong?

22
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,330
What do you think of him?

23
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,020
You mean Jingjian?

24
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,090
Do you think

25
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,330
he will treat me like Qingmu treats you?

26
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,420
You finally admit it.

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,330
Just go and ask him.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,690
Why bother asking me

29
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,970
to lose your elegance?

30
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,250
If it were someone else,

31
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,690
I would ask him directly.

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,420
But he is Jingjian,

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,300
the brother of Jingyang,

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,580
and the son of Heavenly Empress.

35
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,020
Jingjian is different from his family.

36
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,420
He can tell right from wrong

37
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,330
and is open and upright.

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,330
He has spoken out for Qingchi Palace
because of you.

39
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,690
In his heart,

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,810
no one is more important than you.

41
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,890
My feelings for Fengran

42
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,970
are my business.

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
It has nothing to do with her.

44
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,890
Do you remember what I told you

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,860
at the bottom of Huajing Pond?

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,450
If you treat me with sincerity,

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,780
I will repay you with sincerity.

48
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,420
Shoot!

49
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,610
His Grace asked me to buy something.

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,810
I forgot it.

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,780
Houchi,

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,610
thank you.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,970
I take my leave.

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,690
Did she get what I mean?

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,420
Why are you here?

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,500
Qingmu invited me here.

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,450
I got your medicine.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,890
Thank you.

59
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,940
You heard

60
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,860
what my brother said about you.

61
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,730
If you feel offended,

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,290
I apologize to you for him.

63
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,410
There is nothing else
you want to share with me?

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,290
No, there isn’t.

65
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,500
You’re a macho man.

66
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,660
Couldn’t you be straight with me

67
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,700
about whether you have a crush on me

68
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,410
or not?

69
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,330
I’ve made a breakthrough in cultivation.

70
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,610
- So I’m looking for a better magic weapon.
- Magic weapons.

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,960
Come and have a look.

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,700
Okay.

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,380
Why did you bring me here?

74
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,010
For shopping, of course.

75
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,570
Shopping?

76
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,980
The goods here are low-end.

77
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,260
If you want something,

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,100
go to get it at Zisong Hall.

79
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,380
You have no idea

80
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,730
how funny it is to shop here.

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,450
Anyway,

82
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,500
you upset me today.

83
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,540
You have to cover my expenses.

84
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,730
Okay.

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,940
I’ll buy

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,130
what you like.

87
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,220
Only two low-grade sacred beads.

88
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,780
It’s too expensive.

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,980
Miss, may I help you?

90
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,010
Sir.

91
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,170
How much are the red candles?

92
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,730
You have good taste.

93
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,730
Despite being plain and ordinary,

94
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,290
the candles were used

95
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,330
when the daughter of Qingqiu and
Immortal Gold Dragon got married.

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,610
The moral is happiness.

97
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,100
One top-grade sacred bead for the pair.

98
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,660
What a good story.

99
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,290
The immortal power
of the candles is gone.

100
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,570
It could only burn for a thousand years.

101
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,450
Even a low-grade sacred bead
is too much.

102
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,940
I didn’t expect you know the ropes.

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I’ll charge you a low-grade sacred bead.

104
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,610
Well...

105
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,130
We’re going to hold a wedding ceremony.

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,570
I pay you one low-grade sacred bead

107
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,380
for these two candles

108
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,290
and get this one, this one and this one

109
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,060
for free.

110
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,500
Is that Okay with you?

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,330
Miss,

112
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,380
you’re too stingy.

113
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,850
I can’t accept your offer.

114
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,380
Your offer is too low.

115
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,940
Hold on.

116
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,700
Two low-grade sacred beads?

117
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,500
Your offer is too low.

118
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,290
I can’t accept it.

119
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,500
Do something.

120
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,940
His Grace ordered me to make a purchase.

121
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,610
If I fail,

122
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,940
he’ll surely nag at me.

123
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,890
Sir,

124
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,330
you just said

125
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,330
these candles

126
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,010
were used at the wedding ceremony
of Qingqiu and the God Dragon of East Sea.

127
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,780
I happen to work in the Heavenly Palace

128
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,130
and know that

129
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,330
the marriage between immortal and demon
is prohibited.

130
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,010
As an immortal,

131
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,940
you possess prohibited items.

132
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,940
Sir, forgive me.

133
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,330
I won’t sell them.

134
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Is that okay with you?

135
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,700
I got so much good stuff
with one sacred bead.

136
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,570
Today,

137
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,500
I hit the jackpot.

138
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,100
Since you’ve got what you want,

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,780
could you forgive me?

140
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,850
You want to brush me off

141
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,730
with such a little stuff.

142
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,380
If I don’t use up your money,

143
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,010
I will not be Fengran.

144
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,660
Good.

145
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,420
(Qingchi Palace)

146
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,610
Houchi.

147
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,500
Why are you here?

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,540
Aren’t we allowed to see each other
before marriage?

149
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,290
Don’t worry.

150
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,610
Jiaye and others have been bribed.

151
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,980
I brought these for you.

152
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,700
They are...

153
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,850
The Hidden Mountain is dangerous

154
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,570
and barren.

155
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,450
There are lots of fierce beasts.

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,130
Though your spiritual power
has been improved,

157
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,610
it’s still not enough

158
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
to protect yourself.

159
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,980
I made these pellets

160
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,100
so that you won’t suffer.

161
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,700
All these are made by yourself?

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,260
These Spiritual Talismans

163
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,330
are made of Taicang Spear’s breath.

164
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,290
In moments of danger,

165
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,260
they can protect you.

166
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,540
You’ve considered everything for me.

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,260
It’s very nice of you.

168
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,700
But

169
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
why are all these for protecting me?

170
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,780
What if I feel lonely

171
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,730
and bored?

172
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,010
I’ve already come up with a solution.

173
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,890
What is this Spirit Beast?

174
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,660
So cute.

175
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,500
Lord Donghua

176
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,570
deceived me.

177
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,500
He said it’s a rare dog.

178
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,130
Turns out
it has no spiritual aura at all,

179
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,940
except being honest and adorable.

180
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,010
So it can amuse you.

181
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,410
Do you like it?

182
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,500
I like it very much.

183
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,330
This is the best gift
I’ve ever received.

184
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,060
This is nothing.

185
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,010
You’ll be the wife of North Sea Lord.

186
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,290
In the Heavenly Realm,

187
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,170
no matter what you like,

188
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
I’ll get it for you.

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,140
Huang,

190
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,060
if he fails me,

191
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,090
help me bite him.

192
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,820
Houchi.

193
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,410
I have another gift for you.

194
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,410
I’m sure you will like it.

195
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,340
(Dibei Town)

196
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,340
Dibei Town.

197
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,940
Goddess Houchi,

198
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,940
please follow me.

199
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,060
Sir, make a pot of tea.

200
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,770
Okay.

201
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,770
Did she learn from you?

202
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,290
Shuo has no spiritual root.

203
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,210
But after learning kung fu,

204
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,970
she can surely take care of herself.

205
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,290
Teaching a mortal child

206
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,380
must cost you lots of energy.

207
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,770
When did you teach her?

208
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,090
My sweetheart.

209
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,210
We haven’t got married.

210
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,900
Are you going to check up on me?

211
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,290
Immortal Miss.

212
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,140
There you are.

213
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,580
I thought Qingmu cheated me again.

214
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,730
Hey, girl.

215
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,340
When did I cheat you?

216
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,340
You’re much stricter than my father.

217
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,340
He also threatened me

218
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,090
if I didn’t practice well,
I would starve.

219
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,730
Bai Shuo!

220
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,850
But I asked to learn kung fu.

221
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,770
Mother said

222
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,900
I can’t depend on you for everything.

223
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,170
Father has passed away.

224
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,610
The Bai family will count on me.

225
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,770
You grow up.

226
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,380
Dibei Town

227
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,410
and your mother
will be protected by you.

228
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,170
Right!

229
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,460
It’s rare for you to come here.

230
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,460
I’ll let Mother cook for you.

231
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,900
My favorite osmanthus cakes

232
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,380
must be your favorite.

233
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,650
Goddess Houchi,

234
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,900
let me guess.

235
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,730
Are you going to thank me for Shuo?

236
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,970
The pure evil you absorbed is sealed
in Underground Palace.

237
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,770
You came to teach her kung fu

238
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,970
before recovery.

239
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,410
I’m very touched.

240
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,210
Such words are not enough.

241
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,500
You should thank me like this.

242
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,380
So sweet.

243
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,850
Sweeter than osmanthus cakes.

244
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,530
Aren’t we going to a wonderful land?

245
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Why are we in the Demon Realm?

246
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,850
Look!

247
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,460
You grew up at Heavenly Palace.

248
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,580
You must have never seen
such a beautiful sunset.

249
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,380
So I take you here.

250
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,770
Good wine is for beautiful scenery.

251
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,770
What a pleasure!

252
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,460
I heard the clouds
of Abyssal Ridge Swamp

253
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,650
after rain is wonderful.

254
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,730
Today, I found

255
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,020
it deserves its reputation.

256
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,090
I grew up in the Demon Realm

257
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,170
and always came here
watching the sunset.

258
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,380
My father always had to look for me.

259
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,850
When my father can’t find me,

260
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,460
he would call me with Red Feather.

261
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,020
I kept saying I would avenge him.

262
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,580
But I failed

263
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,940
till today.

264
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,410
If Jingyang were not your bother,

265
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,770
I would already kill him.

266
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,900
I didn’t mean that.

267
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,770
Fengran.

268
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,170
I can only make up for the mistakes

269
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,650
my family made to you
by treating you well.

270
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,170
You treat me just because of guilt?

271
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,140
Of course no.

272
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,170
Tens of thousands of years have passed.

273
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,970
The setting sun has not changed.

274
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,020
But the people who watch the setting sun
have changed.

275
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,290
I’m in a hurry.

276
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,260
I’m leaving.

277
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,650
Look out for yourself.

278
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,940
Take it easy.

279
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,090
No one takes your wine.

280
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,770
Fengran.

281
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,500
I was rude just now.

282
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,940
You know why I took you here?

283
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,500
Although the sunset is beautiful,

284
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,020
it’s short.

285
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,260
So is our life.

286
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,730
Despite being long,
it’s just a drop in the ocean.

287
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,210
We should cherish the present.

288
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,650
Do you agree with me?

289
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:15,970
Fengran.

290
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,340
Go back and have a rest.

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,220
to unseal the devilish energy

381
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,170
and cultivate my power,

382
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,740
maybe I can make a breakthrough

383
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,700
to be as powerful as True God.

384
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,370
Despite powerful,

385
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,060
it’s a devil weapon after all.

386
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,940
The danger is uncertain.

387
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,490
I’m afraid...

388
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,770
You’re afraid I will become a devil.

389
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,770
I also know it’s dangerous.

390
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,650
I tried my best

391
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,060
but still failed to destroy

392
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,220
Qingchi Palace

393
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,650
and disappointed Muguang.

394
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,770
If I don’t try again,

395
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,130
my position will probably in danger.

396
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,580
You are too serious.

397
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,890
It won’t be like this.

398
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,890
My grudges with True God

399
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,290
are more than that.

400
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,460
I will be careful when cultivating.

401
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,290
For the sake of my children,

402
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,770
I won’t allow myself to become a devil.

403
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,410
Your Highness...

404
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,060
Stop persuading me.

405
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,860
Go back.

406
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Tell Jingyang

407
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,860
to eradicate the cause of ruin.

408
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,370
And

409
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,770
take care of Fuyao Hall.

410
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,170
Yes.

411
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,460
Father.

412
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,940
If you’re here to plead for your mother,

413
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,340
just go back.

414
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,650
I’ve made up my mind.

415
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,010
I heard you feel unwell,

416
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
so I come to see you.

417
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,130
I won’t interfere in

418
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,580
Mother’s affair.

419
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,820
All is up to you.

420
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,460
Father.

421
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,700
Please try this supplement.

422
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,340
After so many things,

423
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,700
you become obedient.

424
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,700
It was my fault

425
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,370
before.

426
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,460
I often worried you.

427
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,700
From now on,

428
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
I’ll cultivate my mind

429
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,770
and won’t be arrogant and self-willed.

430
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,460
Father.

431
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,530
Take good care of yourself.

432
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,220
The Three Realms’ safety counts on you.

433
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,940
Lord Donghua has arrived.

434
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,220
Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Grace.

435
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,340
Donghua,

436
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,940
I want you to check
the Underground Palace.

437
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,290
Is it about the leakage of pure evil?

438
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,170
Pure evil is ravaging the mortal world.

439
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,220
Although it was caused by
Houchi seizing Ghost Suppressing Tower,

440
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,220
Bi Xi has been guarding the tower
for sixty thousand years.

441
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,820
With his spiritual power,

442
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,220
even the tower was lost,

443
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,340
he still could resist for several days.

444
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,060
I’m anxious about this matter.

445
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,010
Go to check it

446
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,530
to remove my doubts.

447
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,060
Yes. I’m going to handle it now.

448
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,770
Once finding any sign,

449
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,340
I’ll report it to you.

450
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,940
Thank you.

451
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,220
I’m off.

452
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,460
Master,

453
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,820
they go to get married
in the mortal world.

454
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,580
This is not what you wish.

455
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,410
In the past sixty thousand years,

456
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,700
I did what you said.

457
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,530
But this time,

458
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,460
I want to follow my heart.

459
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,460
Just blame me

460
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,290
if you want to.

461
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,860
Don’t blame Qingmu,

462
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,700
let alone Houchi.

463
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,700
In these years,

464
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,130
I have unconsciously

465
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,340
regarded Houchi

466
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,410
as my own daughter.

467
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,650
I only wish her happiness.

468
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,290
Even if it doesn’t

469
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,340
last long for her,

470
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,940
it’s extremely precious for her.

471
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,460
In this generation,

472
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,340
Houchi is too grievous.

473
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
After all,

474
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,100
we owe her.

475
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,620
Master,

476
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,940
seems you’ve recovered.

477
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,580
How is Houchi?

478
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,940
Her Grace...

479
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,370
She’s not bad.

480
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,490
Not bad?

481
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,940
For Boxuan, she caused an uproar.

482
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,490
She ended up giving up the throne,

483
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,940
and suffering at the Hidden Mountain
for 100 years.

484
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,980
Is this

485
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,490
what you said not bad?

486
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Master,

487
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,890
she is indeed not bad.

488
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,460
But what she considered not bad

489
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,530
is probably

490
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,340
bad for you.

491
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,130
Congratulations.

492
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,650
Be careful.

493
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,170
They’re coming.

494
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,890
Congratulations.

495
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,770
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

496
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,650
Be careful. Watch out.

497
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,010
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

498
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,770
Congratulations.

499
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,060
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

500
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,250
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

501
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,740
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,460
Love for all seasons.

503
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,370
Congratulations.

504
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,860
Well, Mrs. Zhang.

505
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,250
That’s not necessary.

506
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,620
Miss.

507
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,650
Brides are all dressed up like this.

508
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,980
You have to follow the rules.

509
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,250
Let’s keep things simple.

510
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,100
Houchi.

511
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,980
Marriage is an event

512
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,370
and comes once in a lifetime.

513
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,410
How could it be simple?

514
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,340
I’ve prepared everything

515
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,410
for you.

516
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,490
Everything is ready.

517
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,620
About marriage,

518
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,250
you’d better follow our advice.

519
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,010
That’s right.

520
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,650
Miss, you don’t know.

521
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,340
The higher your chignon,

522
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,220
the better your life.

523
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,370
Well, do you like

524
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,580
Lucky Lotus Crown

525
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,220
or Scarlet Phoenix Chignon?

526
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,460
I regret.

527
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,010
I should stay at Qingchi Palace

528
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,220
waiting for congratulations.

529
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,620
It’s your wedding day.

530
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,170
Don’t say such words.

531
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,740
You can’t regret today.

532
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,010
Take some sweetmeat later

533
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,220
for good luck.

534
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,620
(Bai’s Mansion)

535
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,490
The bridegroom’s coming.

536
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,220
Congratulations.

537
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,540
- Congratulations.
- Qingmu,

538
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,100
I’m tired.

539
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,010
What does that mean?

540
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,490
I heard in Dibei Town,

541
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,290
the bridegroom will be prevented
from entering the door.

542
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,290
So I join in the fun.

543
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,740
Who will you help?

544
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,170
Isn’t it obvious?

545
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,620
I’m a member of the bride’s family.

546
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
I dare not bother you.

547
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,490
Go inside and have a drink.

548
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,100
It won’t bother me.

549
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,940
We’re good brothers.

550
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,580
I’m sure your wedding will

551
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,100
be full of ups and downs.

552
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,170
Qingmu,

553
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,700
are you scared?

554
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,490
Of course no.

555
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,100
Well,

556
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,770
just tell me

557
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
how I could go in?

558
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,700
As per local rules,

559
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,620
you should allocate lucky money.

560
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,700
How hard is it?

561
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,250
What do you say?

562
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,340
Pick them up.

563
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,410
Come on.

564
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,370
You barely passed it.

565
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,490
Can we let him go inside?

566
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,290
- Let him go.
- Let him go.

567
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,500
(Bai’s Mansion)

568
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,130
The first pass is too easy for you.

569
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,410
It won’t be that easy next.

570
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:56,980
Please!

571
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,170
Let’s go.

572
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,490
Congratulations.

573
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,540
(Double Happiness)

574
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,650
What does this mean?

575
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,290
It’s your big day.

576
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,890
It will be improper

577
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,290
to have a magic art competition.

578
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,340
How about playing a game?

579
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,490
If you win,

580
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,740
you could marry Houchi.

581
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,290
One of the four brides

582
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,650
is Houchi.

583
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,290
You have to identify her
without touching them.

584
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,340
If you’re right,

585
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,290
you’ll win.

586
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,460
Otherwise,

587
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,340
your wedding will be canceled

588
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,650
and your wedding night
will be postponed.

589
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,860
Help me.

590
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,980
Bro, I can’t.

591
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,940
You’re on your own.

592
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,370
Look carefully.

593
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,010
Sweetheart?

594
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,580
Honey!

595
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,820
It’s not her.

596
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,650
So careless.

597
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,100
Look carefully.

598
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,370
So pretentious.

599
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,490
She is not Houchi.

600
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,650
I’m so tender and soft.

601
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,460
How could you say I’m pretentious?

602
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,370
Turn your back quickly.

603
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,220
At the thought of what you said,

604
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,060
I’m even more disgusted.

605
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,580
How could Houchi’s waist

606
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,490
be so thick?

607
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,650
Scoundrel!

608
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,940
How dare you!

609
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,060
Watch your language!

610
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:51,820
Crap!

611
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,620
How dare you deceive me!

612
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I’m not allowed to touch.

613
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,250
No one said I can’t talk.

614
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,410
You’re so tricky.

615
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,860
What are you

616
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,860
messing around

617
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,490
on the big day?

618
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,130
Please forgive us.

619
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,220
We won’t do it again.

620
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,010
Qingmu, you’re cheating.

621
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,340
How could you cheat?

622
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,580
You also cheated.

623
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,620
I was told one of you is Houchi.

624
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,010
Where is she?

625
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,130
All right.

626
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,700
Every minute of the wedding night
is precious.

627
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,170
He must be in hurry.

628
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,490
The bride is waiting for you.

629
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,410
Let’s welcome the bride.

630
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,650
Who is he?

631
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,250
Jingyuan.

632
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,490
Without my permission,

633
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,940
how dare you marry Houchi?

634
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,060
Houchi’s father approved the marriage...

635
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,860
Shut up!

636
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,130
Jingyuan.

637
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,130
Our marriage is witnessed
by heaven and earth.

638
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,340
We follow the etiquette
of the mortal world.

639
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,460
What’s it got to do with you?

640
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,860
Immortal brother,

641
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,290
why are you also wearing
wedding clothes?

642
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,250
Are you going to get married too?

643
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,340
What a brilliant girl.

644
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,460
Right.

645
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,060
I’m here to kidnap the bride.

646
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,100
What a handsome man!

647
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,770
That’s right.

648
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,170
Everyone,

649
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,980
my master is wealthy.

650
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,220
He is sincere

651
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,620
to marry Houchi.

652
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,010
Come on.

653
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,820
Fellows, help yourselves.

654
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,890
Today,

655
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,130
let’s see

656
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,700
who will be the bridegroom.

657
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,370
Right! That’s right.

658
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,220
He’s really nice.

659
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,820
Jingyuan.

660
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,100
Qingmu,

661
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,340
stay calm.

662
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,890
Not only Houchi’s father

663
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,770
but also Houchi herself
agreed to the marriage.

664
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
I’m afraid it won’t change.

665
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,700
Houchi agreed?

666
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,980
She is always not clear-headed,

667
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,460
and fails to separate good from bad.

668
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,650
She must be cheated by someone.

669
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,860
What did you say?

670
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,820
What are you doing?

671
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,010
The propitious time has come.

672
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,820
Why don’t you greet the bride?

673
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,490
Why are there two bridegrooms?

674
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
It’s their business.

675
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,530
Let’s leave it to Houchi.

676
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,410
Jingyuan.

677
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,580
Yes.

678
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
Thank you for supporting me all the way.

679
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,410
I’ll never forget

680
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,060
your kindness.

681
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
I’m getting married today.

682
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,170
Please go to the side hall

683
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,530
and drink some wine.

684
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,290
Houchi. Tell me,

685
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,130
are you serious about marrying him?

686
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,290
Yes.

687
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,980
What if I insist on stopping you?

688
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,340
Master Jingyuan,

689
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,980
you know I’m not her.

690
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,100
I’m Houchi.

691
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,250
You treat me well because of Shanggu

692
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,770
but not Houchi.

693
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,770
From now on,

694
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,410
don’t take me for her anymore.

695
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,340
Okay?

696
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,700
Jingyang.

697
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,220
Jingzhao.

698
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,650
Why are you here?

699
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,580
I’ve been looking all over for you.

700
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,620
Father has suspected
the invasion of pure evil.

701
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,290
You can’t go down that road any further.

702
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,100
Go to confess your guilt to Father.

703
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,290
He’s sure to forgive you.

704
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:30,860
No.

705
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,530
It involves Mother.

706
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,860
I can’t let Father know.

707
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,170
I’m going to kill Bi Xi.

708
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,860
Only when no one knows the truth

709
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,650
will Mother come back earlier.

710
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,460
Master said

711
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,340
he’s upset

712
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,650
and will not come.

713
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,820
Since childhood,

714
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,940
Your Grace can’t follow your heart.

715
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,940
Today, it’s up to you.

716
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,130
Father.

717
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,170
Please accept...

718
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,130
Please accept...

719
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,490
My respect.

720
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,250
My respect.

721
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,890
Pay respect to Heaven and Earth.

722
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,770

Qingmu,

744
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,820
see how impatient you are!

745
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
Can’t you play it cool?

746
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Why should I?

747
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
I’ve always wanted
to call her sweetheart.

748
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,180
From now on,

749
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,900
Houchi will be my wife.

750
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,100
Jingzhao.

751
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,690
It’s not a place for you
to run wild today.

752
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,900
Don’t get me wrong.

753
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,450
I didn’t know they get married today.

754
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,450
Houchi. Qingmu.

755
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,970
I need to leave early.

756
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,580
Jingjian,

757
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,010
what happened?

758
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,180
Do you need any help?

759
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,580
It has something to do with Houchi.

760
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Jingzhao.

761
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,060
Shut up!

762
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,380
Everyone,

763
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,140
thank you for attending our ceremony.

764
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,970
The banquet is ready.

765
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,620
Please go to the side hall.

766
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,450
Immortal Miss.

767
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,340
Ms. Bai and Shuo,

768
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
help me entertain everyone.

769
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,820
Please rest assured, Miss.

770
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,380
It’s my mother who instigated Bi Xi

771
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,660
to identify Houchi.

772
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,380
For fear my father knows the truth,

773
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,690
Jingyang has gone to kill Bi Xi.

774
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,250
That’s the way it goes.

775
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,820
Bi Xi is in danger.

776
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,860
Let’s rush to the Imperial Mausoleum.

777
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,820
No.

778
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,620
You two haven’t finished the ceremony.

779
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,250
Anyway, your wedding is delayed
by the Heavenly Palace.

780
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,490
Qingmu.

781
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,250
Houchi.

782
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,930
I appreciate your kindness.

783
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,620
It’s me who made trouble for you.

784
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,820
Don’t make me feel sorry.

785
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,250
It’s because of me after all.

786
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,490
How can I shirk responsibility?

787
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,970
Houchi is my wife.

788
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,290
So it’s also my business.

789
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:31,770
Let’s go.

790
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,730
It’s urgent. Let’s hurry up.

791
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,380
You came at an inopportune time.

792
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,970
I just want to save Jingyang.

793
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:51,020
(Imperial Mausoleum)

794
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,490
You’d better surrender.

795
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,420
Why bother struggling?

796
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,290
Because of a wrong move,

797
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,770
I got blood from a stone

798
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,180
and end up like this. I deserve it.

799
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,660
But Your Highness,

800
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,290
if I die,

801
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,420
the seal of pure evil

802
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,820
will surely disappear over time.

803
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,420
If pure evil comes out,

804
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,690
there will be no more peace.

805
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,860
I can’t manage other things.

806
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,140
If you do not die,

807
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,180
my mother will be in danger.

808
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,660
I have no choice.

809
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,490
Bi Xi. I’m sorry.

810
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,940
(Imperial Mausoleum)

811
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,180
Stop.

812
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,490
Jingzhao.

813
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,660
Jingyang. Stop.

814
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,860
Jingjian,

815
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,490
how dare you hurt me.

816
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
Jingyang, don’t repeat mistakes.

817
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,860
Follow me to apologize to Father.

818
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,340
Jingzhao.

819
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,290
You don’t want him to repeat mistakes.

820
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,620
Why do you stop me again?

821
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:47,730
Jingjian,

822
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,970
I used to think so.

823
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,900
But if Father looks into this matter,

824
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,690
Mother will be involved.

825
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,450
If others know

826
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,210
Mother asked Jingyang
to release the evil,

827
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,770
she will...

828
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,620
Jingyang released the evil

829
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,820
to kill colleagues.

830
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,820
His crime endangers the Three Realms.

831
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,140
How could we indulge him?

832
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,140
Even it involves Mother,

833
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,970
I won’t practice favoritism.

834
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,730
Three Realms.

835
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,620
Three Realms.

836
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,900
You and Father only know
the Three Realms

837
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,970
but not our family.

838
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,730
Mother has been dispelled
to the Nether World.

839
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,930
Hasn’t she suffered enough?

840
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,660
If father knows it,

841
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,420
Jingyang will be in danger

842
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,580
and Mother will never come back.

843
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:31,820
Jingjian,

844
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,820
you can’t tell it to Father.

845
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,380
You also need to ask Qingmu and Houchi
not to do so.

846
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,060
Otherwise,

847
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,490
our family will break up.

848
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,010
Jingzhao.

849
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,420
Out of family affection,

850
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,140
I’ve already practiced favoritism.

851
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,340
How could you force others

852
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,490
to cover up our family?

853
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,820
God and Goddess.

854
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,340
Don’t waste your spiritual power.

855
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,900
I can’t make it.

856
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,180
It’s all my fault.

857
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,970
If it hadn’t been for me,

858
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,690
nothing would happen today.

859
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,210
Don’t blame yourself.

860
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,180
Everything has its own destiny.

861
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,490
For sixty thousand years,

862
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,660
the God Realm has been sealed

863
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,250
and there is no true god.

864
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,770
Disasters struck

865
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,770
in the mortal world.

866
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,580
I couldn’t bear people’s suffering

867
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,690
and colluded with the Heavenly Empress.

868
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,420
Unexpectedly, I was used by her.

869
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,180
Now,

870
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,210
I deserve to die.

871
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,860
But after I die,

872
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,420
there will be no one guarding here.

873
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,900
The mortal world must suffer.

874
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,100
I failed True God Bai Jue’s trust.

875
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,060
Don’t worry.

876
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,530
In the 100 years to come,

877
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,530
I will wipe out pure evil

878
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,820
and protect the mortal world.
