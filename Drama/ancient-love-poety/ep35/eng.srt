1
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:28,300
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 35=

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,280
Tied.

4
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,210
Unexpectedly, your skill in chess
is so superb.

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,850
I don’t usually play chess.

6
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,960
I’m not a good player.

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,530
That should be your talent.

8
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,280
I’ll go to the Qingchi Palace

9
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,000
to play chess with you again
when I have time.

10
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,380
Sure.

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,170
That would be nice.

12
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,090
Were you letting me win?

13
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,560
How come?

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,000
I drank the tea

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,880
and played chess with you.

16
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,090
I should go back to the Qingchi Palace.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,770
Sure.

18
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,170
It’s really late.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,570
Do you want to leave after dinner?

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,290
After dinner, would you say that

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,130
it’s late at night

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,880
and ask me to stay for a night?

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,650
Why do you think so?

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,440
This is how it’s performed
on the stage in the human world.

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,050
I haven’t watched one.

26
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,440
I’ll take you to the human world
to watch it when I have time.

27
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,770
Great.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I really have to go.

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,850
I don’t know if Houchi and Qingmu

30
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,050
have got the Spirit Gathering Bead.

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,650
I am very concerned about that.

32
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,680
Okay.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,650
Report!

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,850
Your Highness,

35
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,320
the Demon King is leading his army alone

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,290
and asked to see Your Highness
and Lady Fengran.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,010
How does he know I’m here?

38
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,800
Things that should come
will always come.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,130
You have expected that

40
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,130
and let me stay on purpose?

41
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,050
You took away the treasure
of the Demons.

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,410
They won’t let you off easily.

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,490
But I can be by your side

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,440
and protect you.

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,060
(Imperial Mausoleum)

46
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,160
I have informed the Heavenly Palace.

47
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,440
The reinforcements will arrive soon.

48
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,240
Demon King,

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
are you sure you want to start a war?

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,520
As long as you hand over
the Demon Gathering Streamer,

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,050
I will immediately withdraw my troops.

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,050
Demon King,

53
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,050
didn’t God Zihan tell you?

54
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,850
Tell me what?

55
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,050
He lent the Demon Gathering Streamer
to the Qingchi Palace.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,520
Ridiculous!

57
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,850
It is a treasure of us demons.

58
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,120
How can we lend it?

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,880
If you don’t believe me, ask him.

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,810
Then why didn’t you go back
to the Qingchi Palace

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,650
but go to Jingjian’s camp?

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,930
And you stayed there for four hours.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
It’s none of your business.

64
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,810
Fengran and I are old friends.

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
She asked me to have tea and play chess.

66
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,810
It has nothing to do with
the Demon Gathering Streamer.

67
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,250
Why bother explaining so much?

68
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,090
Demon King.

69
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,650
Our Qingchi Palace borrowed the Demon
Gathering Streamer to save someone.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,050
Thanks to the grateful heart
and generosity of the Demon God.

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,120
If you don’t believe me,

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,770
send an instruction feather to ask him.

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
Your Highness,

74
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,250
for these years,

75
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,280
the Demons have been weaker
than the Immortals.

76
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,970
We have been oppressed.

77
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,370
Finally, the Demon God waked up.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
We thought he could revive the Demons
to unify the Three Realms.

79
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,930
Unexpectedly,

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,530
while our soldiers
are risking their lives,

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,970
the Demon God has

82
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,970
shaken the morale of the Demons
for that Houchi of the Qingchi Palace.

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,530
Now he’s even given the treasure
of us Demons

84
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,440
so casually to Fengran.

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,530
If this continues,

86
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,370
the Demons will be in danger

87
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,050
even before the Immortals’ attack.

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,050
Shut up!

89
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,880
He is the Demon God.

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,650
The God of us Demons!

91
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,600
Who gave you the courage
to talk like that?

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,400
Father.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,930
This can’t be easily let off.

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
We can leave
the Qingchi Palace’s affairs aside.

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,370
But now, it’s an emergency.

96
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,720
If the Demon Gathering Streamer

97
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,650
falls into the Heavenly Palace,
that will be terrible.

98
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,000
Even if the Qingchi Palace borrowed it
from Master.

99
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,000
It’s been four hours.

100
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,600
You should return it.

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,090
The Demon Gathering Streamer
isn’t with me.

102
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,000
I already gave it to Houchi.

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
If you have the ability,
go to the Heavenly Palace to take it.

104
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,050
Set an array!

105
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,000
Protect His Highness!

106
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,160
How is it like this?

107
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,090
Isn’t the evil force sealed
in the Underground Palace?

108
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,490
We are still late.

109
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,530
It’s all my fault.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,090
I was too hasty in

111
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,280
taking away the Ghost Suppressing Tower.

112
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,400
Bi Xi and Wu Huan have colluded.

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,090
It’s not your fault.

114
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,000
It is.

115
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,320
To save Boxuan,

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,930
I implicated the whole human world.

117
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,530
Even if I have to use up
my whole life’s cultivation,

118
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,090
I will seal the evil force

119
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,370
in the Underground Palace again.

120
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,090
I’m gonna lay the protective barrier
with my spiritual power

121
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,370
at the highest point
of the Imperial Mausoleum

122
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,810
to trap the evil force.

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,600
You divide and cleanse it

124
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,440
so we can remove the evil force
in one fell swoop.

125
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,370
Okay. Let’s do it.

126
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,490
Oh, no! The bracelet has lost
all its spiritual power.

127
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,650
With my spiritual power,

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,280
I’m afraid I can’t support
this protective barrier.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
Houchi, you’re risking your life!

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,600
Don’t care about me!

131
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,690
Go cleanse the evil force!

132
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,160
Fengran.

133
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,210
Considering God Gu Jun
and Goddess Houchi,

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,930
I treat you politely.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,970
If you still don’t know the manners,

136
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,000
we’ll end our old grudges today!

137
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,050
Jingyang!

138
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,840
Why did you come so late?

139
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,880
It happened suddenly.

140
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,120
I was delayed halfway.

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,560
Fengran!

142
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,050
God Gu Jun.

143
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,210
The evil force of this place
has just been completely cleansed.

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,880
And you want to start a war?

145
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,970
Sen Jian.

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,650
You complained to me that

147
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,770
the Immortals oppressed the Demons.

148
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,050
But today,

149
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,880
do you really want to
see the Immortals and the Demons

150
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,280
fight against each other

151
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,440
and fall into a hopeless situation?

152
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,970
Fengran stole a treasure of the Demons,
the Demon Gathering Streamer,

153
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,970
and she is close to Jingjian.

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
I’m worried that the Streamer
will fall into the Heavenly Palace,

155
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,770
which will do no good to the Demons.

156
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,000
So, I came here
to ask for an explanation.

157
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,050
Is that true?

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,720
Boxuan’s spiritual sense dissipated

159
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,250
and the Demon Gathering Streamer
is needed to save him.

160
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,400
It’s the Demon God who lent the Streamer
to our Qingchi Palace.

161
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,250
The reunion of spiritual sense

162
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,690
can’t be done only by
the Demon Gathering Streamer.

163
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,050
What else did Houchi take?

164
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,450
The Spirit Gathering Bead
and the Ghost Suppressing Tower.

165
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,840
Where is she now?

166
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,760
The Heavenly Palace.

167
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
I’ve figured out what’s going on.

168
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,050
Sen Jian,

169
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,690
go back to your Xuanjing Palace first.

170
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,450
Later,

171
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,200
I will give you an explanation.

172
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,130
Yes.

173
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,280
I’ll do the Qingchi Palace
a favor today.

174
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,570
Withdraw!

175
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,370
Thanks for the help, God Gu Jun.

176
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,080
It’s all because of her!

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,370
Jingjian,

178
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
you still want to be with her?

179
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,330
Jingyang!

180
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
I have to return to the Heavenly Palace.

181
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,010
Excuse me.

182
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,930
Wait.

183
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,690
The mess started
because of the Qingchi Palace.

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,570
I will go with you.

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,130
What?

186
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,810
I can’t go there?

187
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,370
In that case,

188
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,250
Your Grace,

189
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,810
please.

190
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,890
Qingmu!

191
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,960
Are you all right?

192
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,250
I’m fine.

193
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,690
How can you be fine
with evil force inside your body?

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,160
I don’t know when the evil force
started leaking.

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,050
I’m afraid quite a lot has leaked
to the human world.

196
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,810
I will seal the evil force
which got inside my body just now

197
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,160
back to the Underground Palace.

198
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,130
That can reduce your guilt.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,250
But in the future…

200
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,490
I’ll be fine.

201
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,450
Trust me.

202
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,370
I have the Taicang Spear’s help.

203
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,130
My spiritual veins won’t get hurt

204
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,370
if I suppress the evil force in my body.

205
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,130
Don’t lie to me.

206
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,080
I don’t want to lose anyone.

207
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,280
When did I lie to you?

208
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,080
Even the thunder strikes
on the Green Dragon Platform

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,840
couldn’t hurt me.

210
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,810
Let alone the evil force
in the human world.

211
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,010
You underestimate the best Lord
of the Immortals.

212
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,450
You hurry to the Heavenly Palace

213
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,690
and tell the Heavenly Emperor
about the leak of evil force.

214
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,960
I’ll go there to meet you
after I seal the evil force.

215
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,010
Let me seal the evil force instead.

216
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
You go back to the Heavenly Palace
to report.

217
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,130
Silly.

218
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,250
The evil force is inside my body.

219
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,600
You want to seal me along with it?

220
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,050
Hurry.

221
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,930
Time is running out.

222
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,810
We have to go back to the Qingchi Palace
to save Boxuan.

223
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,690
Don’t get hurt anymore.

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,890
See you in the Heavenly Palace.

225
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,600
Houchi.

226
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,570
I’ve made up my mind to be with you
since on the Green Dragon Platform.

227
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,490
No matter what happens in the future,

228
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,080
I will always be with you.

229
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,890
I have troubled you

230
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,370
owed you too many times.

231
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,250
When this matter is over,

232
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,450
I will give you all the blessings
of my next life.

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,280
Okay. How will you give them to me?

234
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,520
Go.

235
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:28,960
Father.

236
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,250
Due to the sudden incident,

237
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,760
I had no time to mobilize
the armed forces.

238
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,570
So, I had to fight a lone battle

239
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,520
which eventually brought damage
to the Immortals.

240
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,130
Please punish me, Father.

241
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,450
Your Majesty.

242
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,330
The Demons killed our soldiers.

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,520
Please don’t be merciful, Your Majesty.

244
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,640
Please severely punish the Demons,

245
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,960
attack the Xuanjing Palace

246
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,010
and revenge
for the dead soldiers and generals!

247
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,720
The Demon King suddenly led his troops
to crush the border

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
and fought with you?

249
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,890
Jingyang.

250
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,960
Framing God will be a serious sin.

251
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,160
Talk about it after thinking it through.

252
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,330
Fengran was instructed by Houchi,

253
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,370
stealing the Demon Gathering Streamer
from the Xuanjing Palace

254
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,810
and hiding in the camp of Jingjian.

255
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
The Demon King was afraid the Streamer
would fall into the Heavenly Palace.

256
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,690
He initiated the war to snatch
the Demon Gathering Streamer back.

257
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,840
Jingjian.

258
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,370
Is this matter true?

259
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,370
Father.

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,570
Fengran did take away
the Demon Gathering Streamer

261
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,520
and went to my camp.

262
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,450
But she…

263
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
When we were surrounded by the Demons,

264
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
fortunately, God Gu Jun arrived in time

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
and saved our lives.

266
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,450
Please render fair judgment, Father.

267
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,010
The Demon Gathering Streamer
is indeed in Houchi’s hands.

268
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,330
But it was not stolen by Fengran.

269
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,490
The Demon God was

270
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,160
willing to lend it
to our Qingchi Palace.

271
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,930
The Demon King didn’t know the truth,

272
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,930
so they took the army
to ask for an explanation.

273
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,330
I have settled the matter with him.

274
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,200
As for the heavenly soldiers
who died in this battle,

275
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,450
my Qingchi Palace
will give their families

276
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,690
an explanation.

277
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,960
Father.

278
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,720
I really don’t understand.

279
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,690
The war is coming.

280
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,450
The Demon Gathering Streamer
is very important to us.

281
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,440
But…

282
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,330
But how could Master lend it to Fengran?

283
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,640
I know

284
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,400
all the demons worship
the Demon God as the God.

285
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,890
But if he ignores our safety,

286
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,600
why should we serve him as our God?

287
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,810
Stop talking!

288
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,050
Your Majesty.

289
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,160
Master is out.

290
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,640
He invites you to go to
the Purple Moon Spring for discussion.

291
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,760
Fengran.

292
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,690
I went to the Heavenly Palace.

293
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,330
They said you were suppressing
evil force in the human world.

294
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,400
I went there late.

295
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,250
Some of the evil force has flowed
into the human world.

296
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,890
I’ll go to the Heavenly Palace
to ask for punishment now.

297
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,010
Bring these three treasures
back to the Qingchi Palace

298
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,330
and ask my father to reunite
the spiritual sense of Boxuan.

299
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,370
Master is in the Heavenly Palace now.

300
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,760
Why is he in the Heavenly Palace?

301
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,080
Something happened in the Demon Region.

302
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,490
The Demon King initiated an attack
in the Demon Region

303
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,570
with the excuse that
the Demon Gathering Streamer was stolen.

304
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
The Immortals suffered heavy losses.

305
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,010
Your father needs you to go back to the
Qingchi Palace with the treasures now.

306
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,080
Then seal the monastery
and don’t come out.

307
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,280
He will bear all the guilt for you
in the Heavenly Palace.

308
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,890
Gu Jun.

309
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,160
The Demon Gathering Streamer is
an essential treasure for the Demons.

310
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,250
Why did the Demon God give it
to your Qingchi Palace?

311
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,690
I have lived for sixty thousand years

312
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,400
without telling a single lie.

313
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,570
Believe it or not.

314
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,130
I’m afraid God Gu Jun’s words

315
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,720
won’t convince the Three Realms.

316
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,010
Father.

317
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,200
I can prove that

318
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
the Demon Gathering Streamer is indeed
a gift from the Demon God to Houchi.

319
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,080
Jingjian.

320
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,250
How can you prove it?

321
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,810
Did you witness that?

322
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,520
He really can’t prove it.

323
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,200
But I can.

324
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,330
Zihan?

325
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,490
My master

326
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,370
let me bring a message to the Immortals.

327
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,280
The Demon Gathering Streamer
was lent by Master to Goddess Houchi.

328
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,960
It was not stolen by the Qingchi Palace.

329
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,050
As for the military disaster
in the Demon Region,

330
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,690
the Qingchi Palace
should be responsible.

331
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,640
But isn’t there any responsibility

332
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,810
for the Heavenly Palace
and the Xuanjing Palace?

333
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,760
The Demons and the Immortals
have fought for sixty thousand years.

334
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,960
The grievance is deep.

335
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,250
Even if there were no misunderstandings,

336
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,720
the war would still be inevitable.

337
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,810
God Gu Jun.

338
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I would like to ask that

339
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,690
what the relationship between
Houchi and the Demon God is.

340
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,840
The Demon God did not hesitate
to give her the Demon Gathering Streamer

341
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,890
and even specially sent Zihan here

342
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,840
to prove her innocence.

343
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,890
Is it because the personal relationship
between Houchi and the Demon God?

344
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,010
Or is it because the Qingchi Palace and
the Demons have long been in collusion?

345
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,840
Will you believe me

346
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,050
if I explain it to you?

347
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,840
Then why didn’t you

348
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,250
believe me just now?

349
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
Since no one believes me,

350
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
why should I bother saying something?

351
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,050
If Your Majesty still have questions,

352
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,330
please go to the Xuanjing Palace
to talk with the Demon God.

353
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I need to go back to the Qingchi Palace

354
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,090
to help the soldiers who died
in the battle with the aftermath.

355
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,240
Excuse me.

356
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,730
Your Majesty.

357
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,450
Although it is clear now
that the Demon Gathering Streamer

358
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,280
was not stolen by Goddess Houchi,

359
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,610
according to the information
from the lower realm,

360
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,810
with the missing
of the Ghost Suppressing Tower,

361
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,120
evil force is ravaging the human world.

362
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,930
Houchi, as a Goddess,

363
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
didn’t care about the common people.

364
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,520
Your Majesty, please

365
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,280
punish Goddess Houchi severely!

366
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,640
Didn’t Bi Xi say that

367
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,520
the evil force in the human world
could be sealed for a few days?

368
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,000
Why is the human world still suffering?

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,570
Your Majesty.

370
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,640
After all, this matter has something
to do with Goddess Houchi.

371
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,360
If everyone follows
the example of the Qingchi Palace,

372
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,970
how can the Three Realms be safe?

373
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,930
Your Majesty, please punish
Goddess Houchi severely

374
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,730
and get back
the Ghost Suppressing Tower.

375
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,360
When is it necessary
for the Heavenly Palace to dictate

376
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,280
how my Qingchi Palace takes action?

377
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,690
The Heavenly Emperor had already decided
on the matter of the Tower.

378
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,570
If you still want to
get entangled in it,

379
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,280
I won’t mind

380
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,930
clearing this place.

381
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,450
What?

382
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,120
Gu Jun.

383
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,450
Father!

384
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,880
Father, I’m sorry.

385
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,690
I troubled you again today.

386
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Don’t worry.

387
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,880
As long as I’m here,

388
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,240
I won’t make you feel wronged at all.

389
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,810
Father, didn’t you teach me that

390
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,050
we could make mistakes,

391
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,570
but we must admit it
if we make a mistake.

392
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,810
I did make a mistake.

393
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,760
Though I am your daughter,

394
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,280
all of this

395
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
should be borne by me.

396
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,810
As a Goddess,

397
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
though knowing the importance
of the common people,

398
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,640
I disregarded all beings

399
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,880
because of selfishness

400
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,880
and implicated others.

401
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
It’s all my fault.

402
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,120
Your Majesty’s punishment on Houchi

403
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
is a righteous move.

404
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,210
Even if I was punished,

405
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,810
I would be ashamed
of the True God’s entrustment

406
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,810
and all beings.

407
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,570
So now, in front of the immortals,

408
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,640
I am willing to

409
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,050
punishment myself more severely

410
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
to serve as an example.

411
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,730
Punish yourself?

412
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,280
How will you punish yourself?

413
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,690
I stole weapons

414
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,810
and did harm to all beings.

415
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
I know the sin is great.

416
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,730
So,

417
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,120
I’m gonna hand in
my throne of Goddess today

418
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,050
and plead guilty to Heaven.

419
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,570
I’m willing to

420
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,240
stay on Hidden Mountain
for a hundred years

421
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
to eliminate the evil force there

422
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,760
and confess my fault.

423
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,280
Houchi,

424
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,480
do you know how heavy
this self-punishment is?

425
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,730
I only wish Your Majesty

426
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,570
can save Qingmu from all the punishment.

427
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,000
I will bear all the blame.

428
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:49,810
Okay.

429
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,810
I accede to your request.

430
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,760
Father, I’m sorry.

431
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,810
I know that I was too impulsive
in the Xuantian Hall.

432
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
But I couldn’t bear to see
the Qingchi Palace being criticized.

433
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,930
So, you chose to leave me

434
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,760
and Qingmu behind,

435
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,970
and chose self-exile?

436
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,400
Father,

437
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
there is no plan which satisfies
both sides in this world.

438
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,690
In order to save Boxuan,

439
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,760
I implicated Qingmu

440
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
and harmed the human world.

441
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,450
This is my fault.

442
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,570
I should be punished.

443
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,400
As long as there is a glimmer of hope
for Boxuan,

444
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
I am willing to bear

445
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,570
all of this.

446
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,930
Let me ask you.

447
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,480
If one day,

448
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,570
Boxuan wakes up,

449
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,050
but he is no longer who he used to be,

450
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,570
won’t you regret it?

451
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,570
I wouldn’t.

452
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,570
As long as he lives in peace,

453
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,450
it’s enough.

454
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,930
Sometimes,

455
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,640
destiny is crueler than you think.

456
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,360
It’s not that all your wishes
can be fulfilled.

457
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,120
You have made up your mind.

458
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,360
I won’t stop you.

459
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,930
But everything has its destiny.

460
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,210
Instead of reminiscing about the past,

461
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,850
it’s better to cherish the present.

462
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,850
Qingmu!

463
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,970
Why do you look so weak?

464
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,810
Where is Houchi?

465
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,120
I’m caring about your health.

466
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,360
Thank you, Your Grace.

467
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,810
When I return to the Qingchi Palace,
I will heal myself.

468
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,730
Qingchi Palace?

469
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,610
Whose Qingchi Palace
are you going back to?

470
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,520
Houchi has already admitted all crimes
in the Xuantian Hall.

471
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,210
My father spared you the punishment.

472
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
You don’t need to go back
to the North Sea to reflect on your sin.

473
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,880
What?

474
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,240
What about Houchi?

475
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,480
How did the Heavenly Emperor punish her?

476
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,280
She handed in her throne of Goddess

477
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,610
and exiled herself to Hidden Mountain
for a hundred years.

478
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,330
Have you decided?

479
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:40,970
Yes.

480
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,210
With all immortals as witnesses,

481
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,450
I won’t change my mind.

482
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,610
Okay.

483
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,450
Then I won’t go back to the North Sea.

484
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,050
I will accompany you to Hidden Mountain
in three days.

485
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,610
Qingmu,

486
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,730
you can’t go to Hidden Mountain with me.

487
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
What did you tell me in the
Imperial Mausoleum of the human world?

488
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
Don’t you want to be with me
for the rest of your life?

489
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,480
Your promise to me

490
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,610
is not worth mentioning?

491
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,810
It’s not like what you think.

492
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,480
A hundred years later,

493
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,090
I will be with you.

494
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,280
Can you wait for me
for another hundred years?

495
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,160
A mortal has at most a hundred years
for a life.

496
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,480
Do you think a hundred years is short?

497
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,000
Or in your heart,
I’m not that important?

498
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,640
I am sorry.

499
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,050
I said the wrong thing.

500
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,240
Qingmu.

501
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,000
You are the person
I want to cherish the most.

502
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,690
How can I abandon you?

503
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,640
It’s my fault

504
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
that I didn’t protect you well.

505
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,970
Qingmu, this is my own sin.

506
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,450
I should make up for it myself.

507
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,240
I promise you

508
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,610
that during the 100 years,

509
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,850
I will think of you

510
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,090
and miss you every day, okay?

511
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,850
If you didn’t think of me or miss me,

512
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,970
who else would you think of and miss?

513
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,730
I’m just thinking

514
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,760
that I don’t know how to spend

515
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,610
the one hundred years without you.

516
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,810
In that case,

517
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,450
are you willing to make the vow
of not leaving me

518
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,480
in front of me, my father,

519
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,450
Heaven

520
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
and the earth?

521
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,760
How difficult is that?

522
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,160
I…

523
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,480
Houchi.

524
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,520
What do you mean?

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,050
North Sea Lord Qingmu,

526
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,570
that day you said on the Green Dragon
Platform that you wanted to

527
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,640
marry Goddess Houchi
from the Qingchi Palace.

528
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,760
After this thunder strike,

529
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,690
we will return to the Qingchi Palace.

530
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,210
We will enjoy the spring scenery there.

531
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,280
We will watch the flowers
all over the mountains.

532
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,880
God Gu Jun.

533
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,280
I, Qingmu, would like to give my life

534
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,850
to Goddess Houchi and marry her.

535
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,540
♪Look up at the meteor
across the darkness♪

536
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,360
God Gu Jun.

537
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,930
I love Houchi deeply

538
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,810
and sincerely hope

539
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,360
I can marry her.

540
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
Maybe Houchi and I

541
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,570
will both be replaced by the True Gods,

542
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,640
but the affections between Houchi and me
are sincere,

543
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,090
and even more important than my life.

544
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
If I give up now,

545
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,810
I’ll surely regret it one day.

546
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Please agree to our being together.

547
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,330
We’ll get married soon.

548
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,760
So, of course, I can decide.

549
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,400
Qingmu.

550
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,000
You’ll get married?

551
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Did Gu Jun agree?

552
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,210
Of course,

553
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,210
Gu Jun has agreed
the marriage of Houchi and me.

554
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,090
Does it still count?

555
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,820
♪For a little talk♪

556
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,450
Yes!

557
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,760
Of course!

558
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,210
♪Hope♪

559
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,360
I, North Sea Lord Qingmu,

560
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,930
love Goddess Houchi,

561
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,160
and I am willing to marry her

562
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,810
and grow old together!

563
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,850
Put me down.

564
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,760
You still have injuries.

565
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,610
I am dedicated to the Demons.

566
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,880
I made no mistake!

567
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,840
Sen Yu!

568
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
Master, please show mercy!

569
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,850
Sen Yu is still young.

570
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,880
Please give him another chance.

571
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,970
Sen Hong died in battle.

572
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,210
Sen Yun died in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

573
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,730
He’s the only son being with me now.

574
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,570
Hope Master will forgive him again

575
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,930
for the sake of my loyalty

576
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,930
all these years.

577
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,970
What if I don’t forgive him?

578
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,450
Sen Jian will never

579
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,450
go against

580
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,330
Master’s command.

581
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,970
Remember what you said today.

582
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Within the Demons,

583
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,730
everything is determined by me.

584
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,240
If anyone hurts or affects Houchi again,

585
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,730
I will never show mercy again.

586
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:38,480
Yes.

587
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,930
Father.

588
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,330
Mother.

589
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,330
I’m gonna kneel
outside the Xuantian Hall

590
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,810
and plead with Father
to change the edict.

591
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,400
Jingyang.

592
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,280
Father is determined this time.

593
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,240
Even if you kneel for a few days,

594
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,000
he still won’t see you.

595
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,000
But the Qingchi Palace and the Demons
are not clean indeed.

596
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,330
What Mother did was for
the overall situation of the Immortals.

597
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,480
Why should Father punish her?

598
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,880
In this way,

599
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,050
who else would respect
the Heavenly Palace

600
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,610
and Mother?

601
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,570
Father is confused!

602
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,690
Jingyang, be careful with your words.

603
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,520
Jingyang.

604
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,730
All things are blessed by His Majesty.

605
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,160
Since your father has ordered,

606
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,480
I will just go to the Nether World.

607
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,610
It is my incompetence.

608
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
I was not able to protect Mother.

609
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,000
Good boy.

610
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,000
I know your filial affection.

611
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,690
After I leave,

612
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,640
you must take good care of Jingzhao.

613
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,360
Don’t let her be bullied.

614
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,520
Mother.

615
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,690
Remember that

616
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,690
if anything happens,

617
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,610
use the instruction feather
to inform me.

618
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,330
Kill Bi Xi.

619
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,520
Never let others know

620
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,810
the evil force thing in the human world.

621
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,280
Rest assured, Mother.

622
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,360
I will let this matter go down forever

623
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,280
and never let Father know.

624
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,850
Boxuan.

625
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,520
A hundred years later,

626
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,240
we can see each other again.

627
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,090
Boxuan.

628
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,450
I hope you can rest in there peacefully.

629
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,360
If one hundred years is not enough,
then stay there for two hundred years.

630
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,810
It’s better to be there
for three to five hundred years.

631
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,240
No, no.
Tens of thousands of years is the best.

632
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,210
What are you mumbling?

633
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,970
You also have something to tell Boxuan?

634
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,330
No, no.

635
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,930
Seeing you so happy,

636
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,050
I am happy for you, too.

637
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,690
When Boxuan is awake

638
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,970
and see that I have you,

639
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,730
he will be happy for me.

640
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,810
Mother was demoted
to the Nether World by Father.

641
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
But you are sitting
in the Zisong Hall peacefully.

642
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,400
Jingjian,

643
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,730
what on earth is on your mind?

644
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,760
Mother was way too much.

645
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,050
If Father really wanted to punish her,

646
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,450
he would have removed
her throne of Goddess.

647
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,810
Father made the decision
for Mother’s good.

648
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,970
Everything Mother did

649
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,730
was for the Heavenly Palace.

650
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,210
You would rather plead
for the people in the Qingchi Palace,

651
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,090
than say something nice for Mother.

652
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,640
Don’t forget Mother gave birth to you!

653
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Because of that low phoenix, right?

654
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,520
Earlier in the Demon Region,

655
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,480
you and I almost died because of her!

656
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,000
The Qingchi Palace is a scourge.

657
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,880
They are all scumbags.

658
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,850
My feelings for Fengran

659
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,280
are out of my free will.

660
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,610
They have nothing to do with her.

661
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,610
I should have understood long ago that

662
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,520
your heart was taken away
and hollowed out

663
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,280
by that wild phoenix.

664
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
From now on,

665
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,280
it’s either her

666
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,850
or me!

667
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,090
Jingyang!

668
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,210
Jingyang...!

669
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,680
Your Grace.

670
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,890
Although Her Grace is going
to Hidden Mountain

671
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,890
to be punished for a hundred years,

672
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,760
a hundred years is just like a second

673
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,960
for an immortal.

674
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,610
Her Grace has a happy marriage now.

675
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,650
After Lord Boxuan wakes up,

676
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,850
the Qingchi Palace

677
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,680
will be livelier and more prosperous
than before.

678
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,090
Why is Your Grace still frowning?

679
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,130
After Boxuan wakes up,

680
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,960
will he still treat Houchi well
as always?

681
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,960
Of course, yes.

682
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,130
Lord Boxuan has always
treated Her Grace kindly.

683
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,520
You worry too much.

684
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,280
I heard that there’s a rule for marriage
in the human world.

685
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,810
For fair auspices,
newlyweds should not see each other

686
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,650
before they get married.

687
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,440
Qingmu and Houchi’s wedding

688
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,440
will follow this rule.

689
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,650
Your Grace.

690
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,090
Her Grace will only stay in the Qingchi Palace
for three days before leaving.

691
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,760
With two days minus,

692
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
it will be too cruel
for North Sea Lord Qingmu, right?

693
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,650
He caused the trouble himself.

694
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,850
Who else can be blamed?

695
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:44,680
Yes.

696
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,050
His Grace has ordered

697
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,090
that before the wedding,

698
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,130
we mustn’t let Her Grace
and North Sea Lord

699
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,920
meet in private.

700
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,520
Don’t worry, Jiaye.

701
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,130
We guarantee that

702
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,810
even a fly can’t sneak into
Her Grace’s room,

703
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,570
let alone a big living person.

704
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,920
Hey, you tell me.

705
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,130
Is His Grace so picky?

706
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,850
A handsome son-in-law

707
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,130
like Lord Qingmu

708
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,610
with great spiritual power,

709
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,440
it is really hard to find another one.

710
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
But he still insists on doing this.

711
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,650
There is another one actually.

712
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,090
Isn’t it Lord Boxuan
lying at the bottom of the pond?

713
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,960
Stop talking nonsense.

714
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,890
Lord Boxuan wears a mask all day.

715
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,850
He’s cold.

716
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,570
He ignores everyone except Her Grace.

717
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,960
How could he be good for her?

718
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,050
If we really compare them,

719
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,650
Lord Qingmu must be the better one.

720
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,890
But I heard from Chang Que that

721
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,090
Lord Boxuan has great spiritual power.

722
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,130
Wherever he goes,

723
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,050
no grass grows.

724
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,610
And he is so low-key and humble.

725
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
He is the mildest.

726
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,890
So what?

727
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
No matter how good he is,

728
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,280
he is still fainting, right?

729
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,170
All right.

730
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,170
Why compare them?

731
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,570
Most men in the world are the same.

732
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,090
To please the woman,

733
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,760
they would either send some jewelry

734
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,170
or give some clothes and cosmetics.

735
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,410
If you ask me,

736
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,650
the one who can catch the eyes
of Her Grace

737
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,090
is the better one.

738
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,650
Why are you laughing?

739
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,920
If you keep laughing,
believe it or not, I will burn you!

740
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,130
Still laughing? I’m gonna burn you.

741
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,760
Lord.

742
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,650
You heard it all?

743
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,280
Heard what?

744
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,170
Were you talking about Boxuan?

745
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,920
I’ve heard that.

746
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,170
You were right.

747
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,680
Boxuan’s more attractive

748
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,410
than me.

749
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,680
These…

750
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,050
These are just some vulgar things
I just found at the roadside.

751
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,810
They are not for Houchi.

752
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,130
I have something else to do.

753
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,130
Excuse me.

754
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,850
What made you call me

755
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,850
in a hurry?

756
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,240
Houchi and I are getting married.

757
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,170
Right now?

758
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,440
All right. It’s great.

759
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,130
You two have the same minds.

760
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,890
Although it’s a little rushed,

761
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,090
it’s a satisfactory result.

762
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,000
Qingmu, congratulations.

763
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,610
What are you doing?

764
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,200
It’s not easy for me and Houchi

765
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,650
all the way.

766
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,130
Thanks for your help and support.

767
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,720
I am deeply grateful to you.

768
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,440
Don’t need to be so polite.

769
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,720
You called me today

770
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,370
not just to thank me, right?

771
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,000
I really don’t have much experience.

772
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,720
So, I want to ask you.

773
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,650
Before getting married,

774
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,370
what gifts should I give to Houchi?

775
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,520
She grew up in the Qingchi Palace.

776
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,890
Some treasures of the Qingchi Palace

777
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,370
are even better
than the Heavenly Palace’s.

778
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,480
I’m afraid it’s useless for you
to give her any gifts.

779
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,920
What to do then?

780
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,330
You two have experienced life and death.

781
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,000
Why bother giving those fancy things?

782
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
It’s marriage after all.

783
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,890
It’s a life event.

784
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,920
It must have a sense of ritual.

785
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,090
Vulgar things can’t do.

786
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,610
How about a living thing?

787
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,130
Think about it.

788
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,720
What thing can be taken with her
to Hidden Mountain?

789
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,330
Yeah!

790
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,650
I got it!

791
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,890
Thank you, brother!

792
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,130
You are much luckier than me.

793
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,650
I’m afraid my sincerity and feelings

794
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,650
can’t even be expressed.

795
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,570
Since we came back
from the Heavenly Palace,

796
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,200
you’ve been frowning all the time.

797
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,850
It’s not like that.

798
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,810
I’m going to stay on Hidden Mountain
for a hundred years.

799
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,920
It’s neither long

800
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
nor short.

801
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,050
You are the one I worry about the most.

802
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,520
You do not need to worry about me.

803
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,850
I will help you
guard the Qingchi Palace.

804
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,170
But

805
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,760
no one else knows your mind.

806
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,090
Won’t you feel lonely?

807
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,810
How come I will feel lonely?

808
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,650
You see. I can read novels
and play dice.

809
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,370
I’m pretty good at having fun.

810
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,410
But at this moment,

811
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,570
who should you tell your mind to?

812
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,570
You know it?

813
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,200
You and I have stayed together
for thousands of years.

814
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,480
We know each other the best.

815
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,760
Is it Jingjian?

816
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,130
I guessed wrong?

817
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,760
