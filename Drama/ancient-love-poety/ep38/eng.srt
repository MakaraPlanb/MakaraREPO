00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,320
=Episode 38=

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,890
Qingmu, what are you doing?

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,770
Who are you?

5
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,530
You dare not show your true face.

6
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,680
Qingmu, are you nuts?

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
What did you say? I’m Fengran.

8
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,490
Are you possessed?

9
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,770
Don’t you even recognize me?

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,850
Jingjian.

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,450
Don’t be fooled by her.

12
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,810
For the sake of Houchi,

13
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,490
I won’t fight you.

14
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,600
If you go too far,

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,400
don’t blame me for falling out.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,810
When I married Houchi,

17
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,850
what did I say to you?

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,450
Houchi

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
has a thick waist now.

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,200
You said I had a thick waist.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,170
You are Fengran.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,610
Qingmu,

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,920
you acted like that.

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,330
Is there anything wrong?

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,090
Early this morning,

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,530
I suddenly felt the strong
pure evil in the human world.

27
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,090
I followed it all the way,

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,000
but found it originated
from the Feng Clan.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,450
I wanted to ask
the elder of the Feng Clan,

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,760
but I didn’t expect...

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,250
Here is the Feng Clan.

32
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,720
I came with Mother.

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,810
Qingmu,

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,000
let me go in with you.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,530
The pure evil here is strange.

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,720
Jingzhao.

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,610
Leave here.

38
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,560
Don’t follow me.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
This is where birds pay homage
to the phoenix.

40
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,000
What happened here?

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,050
The smell...

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,170
Well...

43
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,330
I’m afraid many Feng people died here.

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,530
Qingmu,

45
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,280
how could this happen?

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,810
Who’s there?

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,330
Qingmu.

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,450
Jingzhao.

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,920
Fengran?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,530
You mean the Feng Clan
was exterminated by

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,330
a woman in disguise of Fengran?

52
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,840
Yes.

53
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,890
We also came across
the black spiritual aura

54
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,450
you just mentioned.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
It’s very strange.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
We’ve never seen it
in the Heavenly Realm.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,530
It’s kinda like Devilish Energy
mentioned in ancient books.

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
Didn’t the Devils disappear

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,530
in the war between Gods and Devils
60,000 years ago?

60
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,690
No matter whom they are,

61
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,330
Jingzhao is in their hands now.

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
We may know the truth

63
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,050
when we find Jingzhao.

64
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,410
Parasol Forest has a complex formation.

65
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,480
By midnight,

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,530
there will be many obstacles.

67
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,690
Let

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,250
the three of us split up

69
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,170
while it’s still light.

70
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,410
In case of danger,

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,560
inform each other
with instruction feather.

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,360
OK?

73
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,440
Qingmu.

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,970
If something happens to Jingzhao,

75
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,290
I will be punished
by the Heavenly Palace.

76
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,640
It’s OK for me.

77
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,690
But Houchi is in the Hidden Mountain.

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,690
I can’t make her worry.

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,010
Alright.

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,810
Don’t worry.

81
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,850
I promise you,

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,970
I’ll be fine.

83
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,290
Qingmu. Qingmu, I’m here.

84
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,730
Qingmu.

85
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:54,970
Jingzhao.

86
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,970
Oh, no.

87
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,880
It’s midnight and obstacles appear.

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,690
Qingmu.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,810
Qingmu.

90
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,200
You’re here. Save me.

91
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,160
Qingmu.

92
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,570
Qingmu.

93
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,360
Qingmu.

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,130
I didn’t know

95
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,440
my Power of the Original Being
is Demon Power.

96
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,600
Boxuan.

97
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,410
You are Bai Jue, right?

98
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,130
I can’t resist

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,690
my fate.

100
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,850
But it’s less than 100 years,

101
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,730
and Houchi hasn’t returned.

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,130
After a hundred years,

103
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,760
remember to take me home.

104
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,970

And we may have a lot of children.

120
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,800
I teach them to kill demons.

121
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,490
You teach them music, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,680
From now on,

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,320

I think there’s something wrong tonight,

146
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,120
and something big will happen.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Master Bai Jue,

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,050
please treat Houchi well!

149
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
In a hurry,

150
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,560
I only recovered 40 percent of my power.

151
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,410
You

152
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,640
often purify too much pure evil,

153
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,240
causing your own losses,

154
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,050
so now you feel worried

155
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,200
and uneasy.

156
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,120
If only you could be the same as before.

157
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,170
How is her life in the God Realm?

158
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,440
Of course, she grew up in a pampered

159
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
and carefree state.

160
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,440
And she has a good friend named Yuemi,

161
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,000
who indulges her most.

162
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,930
They made a lot of mistakes together.

163
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,760
Just like me and Fengran?

164
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,370
Yeah.

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,170
If only it could be
like this all the time.

166
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,410
Jingyuan.

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,970
Houchi.

168
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,490
Have you ever thought about

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,730
why Boxuan

170
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,200
sealed another Spiritual Strength
in your body?

171
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,730
If he really cares for you,

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,930
he should give you the highest status,

173
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,200
the most powerful power,

174
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,120
just like Chief Goddess Shanggu,

175
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,530
who has a high status

176
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,050
and is respected by all.

177
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,880
People’s heart doesn’t lie.

178
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Boxuan is honest with me.

179
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,410
I can feel it.

180
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,970
Treat you with sincerity?

181
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,560
I’m honest with you, too.

182
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,930
But you never see me.

183
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,090
Jingyuan, thank you.

184
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,320
But my heart has a place

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,930
for just one person

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,800
in this life.

187
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,170
Enough.

188
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,680
I don’t want to hear that.

189
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,970
Anyway,

190
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,240
Boxuan is

191
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,930
an ordinary immortal saved
by my father.

192
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,760
According to my father,

193
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,640
Boxuan just obeyed his order to seal me.

194
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,320
Ordinary immortal?

195
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,000
According to Gu Jun,

196
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,760
he never does anything without a reason.

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
What are you muttering about?

198
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,610
I’m muttering

199
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,240
what I should make for you tomorrow.

200
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,490
Your Highness.

201
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,120
It’s all my fault.

202
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,050
I wanted to kill them all

203
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,760
when my spiritual power was strong,

204
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,440
but unexpectedly made Bai Jue awaken.

205
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,440
Bai Jue?

206
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,200
Do you mean True God Bai Jue?

207
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Moreover,

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
do you remember

209
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,290
the portrait at the bottom of
Huajing Pond in Qingchi Palace?

210
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,850
I saw with my own eyes.

211
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,120
The man in the portrait today
is Bai Jue.

212
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,730
He even separated his original being
and created Qingmu.

213
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,930
Qingmu’s Power of the Original Being
is not immortal power,

214
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,050
but powerful demon power.

215
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,440
In those years, Bai Jue
lived in Qingchi Palace.

216
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,800
And Houchi looks so similar to Shanggu.

217
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,800
Is she really Shanggu?

218
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,560
But why did Bai Jue create Qingmu?

219
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,560
What on earth does he want to do?

220
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,880
Has he seen through your identity?

221
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,120
I changed into Fengran
by Devilish Energy,

222
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
and took Jingzhao away.

223
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,490
He would never suspect me.

224
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,850
But due to my carelessness,

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Elder Danfeng escaped,

226
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,490
which will lead to great trouble.

227
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,200
Your Highness.

228
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,090
Your Highness.

229
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,490
Your Highness!

230
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,560
Fengran.

231
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,680
Fengran.

232
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,370
Fengran.

233
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,090
Fengran.

234
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,880
It is said that there is
a forbidden area in the Feng Clan.

235
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,290
Did Fengran and I

236
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
fall there?

237
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,410
Wuxi.

238
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,170
Feng Yan.

239
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,440
Sounds familiar.

240
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,560
Fire Phoenix?

241
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,250
It has never appeared in the Feng Clan.

242
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,520
I am about to die.

243
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,520
I hope to meet you before I die

244
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,010
and tell you about your origin.

245
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,250
Your origin?

246
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,560
Queen of Phoenix.

247
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,250
It doesn’t mean phoenix.

248
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,970
I see.

249
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,280
Star Lord.

250
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,680
Last night, the stars shifted

251
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,520
and Heaven and Earth changed color.

252
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,610
What happened?

253
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,200
Your Majesty.

254
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,730
When I was on duty last night,

255
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,250
I saw the fire over

256
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,010
the Parasol Forest of the Feng Clan.

257
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,160
I was afraid that something might happen

258
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,850
and harm the world.

259
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,650
So I specially dispatched
Dubhe, Alkaid and Ascella

260
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,490
to guard the northeast

261
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,800
to hold back the fire.

262
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,010
Fire?

263
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,920
Lord Donghua,

264
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,610
what do you think of it?

265
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Your Majesty.

266
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,650
The power of fire is very pure.

267
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,130
It’s most likely the fire
of True God Bai Jue.

268
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
I dare to

269
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,200
ask Your Majesty to go have a look.

270
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,680
I’ve been trying to reopen
the God Realm all these years.

271
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
Even if it’s not True God,

272
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,010
it must have something
to do with the God Realm.

273
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
It’s important.

274
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,250
I’m going to see it myself.

275
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,890
We’re willing to go with Your Majesty.

276
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,890
You’re awake, Qingmu.

277
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,970
I am Bai Jue.

278
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,370
Bai...

279
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,200
Only one person in the Three Realms
may use this name.

280
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,250
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

281
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,970
You saved me?

282
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,320
Master,

283
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,090
you were badly injured

284
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,440
and fainted in the Parasol Forest.

285
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,320
I’m sorry to

286
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,680
offend you, Master.

287
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,650
Gold Dragons.

288
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
What’s your relationship with Muguang?

289
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,850
He is my father.

290
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,800
My name is Jingzhao.

291
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,800
Your mother is...

292
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,010
Goddess Wu Huan.

293
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,370
Who is Qingmu?

294
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,200
Qingmu... He is...

295
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,610
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

296
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,730
Please come to the Qingchi Palace.

297
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,610
Qingchi Palace?

298
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,370
Why not go to the Pilgrimage Hall?

299
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,320
Pilgrimage Hall...

300
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,650
The God Realm has been closed.

301
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,400
Don’t you remember, Master?

302
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,440
I slept for a long time

303
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,320
and I can’t remember many things.

304
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,090
Now I’m awake.

305
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,730
I want to have a good rest.

306
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,490
You may leave.

307
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,010
Yes.

308
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Since Master woke up,

309
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,400
have you been at his side?

310
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,440
Yes.

311
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,890
The Parasol Forest was full of
Devilish Energy last night.

312
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,680
I was held by Devilish Energy.

313
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,890
Qingmu came to save me.

314
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,650
But when I woke up...

315
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,920
Qingmu.

316
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,920
Qingmu.

317
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,970
I found the awakening Master.

318
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,490
Why does Master lose his memory?

319
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,250
Don’t lie to me.

320
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,200
God Gu Jun.

321
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,890
I will never hurt Qingmu.

322
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,650
And now he has awakened
and becomes Master Bai Jue.

323
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,010
He has slept for thousands of years.

324
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,250
It’s normal

325
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,490
to wake up with a loss of memory.

326
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,800
Father.

327
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,440
Qingmu has awakened.

328
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,130
He is Master Bai Jue.

329
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,440
I am Muguang.

330
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,970
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

331
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,650
We haven’t seen each other
in 60,000 years.

332
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,250
Are you alright?

333
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,490
Come in alone.

334
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,130
I’d like to ask you something.

335
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,610
Yes, Master.

336
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,850
Master Bai Jue has returned.

337
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,730
Immortals would no longer
fear the Demon God.

338
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,010
They may capture the Demon Region

339
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,370
and unify the Heavenly Realm.

340
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
It turns out that
Lord Qingmu is Master Bai Jue.

341
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
No wonder he is powerful
at such a young age,

342
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,560
and subdued Taicang Spear
at the Mount Lookout.

343
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,730
So it is.

344
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,490
I heard that Lord Qingmu

345
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,730
has married Houchi.

346
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,610
Qingchi Palace will be on the rise.

347
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,730
Master only meets His Majesty,

348
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,370
but not God Gu Jun.

349
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,040
I don’t think it’s that simple.

350
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,920
You finally wake up.

351
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,040
I’m worried sick.

352
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,370
You worried about me?

353
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,090
When the Parasol Forest Formation
changed yesterday,

354
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,440
you fell into a trap

355
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,920
and then passed out.

356
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,680
Where is Qingmu?

357
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,090
I don’t know.

358
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,890
When the Formation
changed again this morning,

359
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,650
I carried you out of the cave,

360
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
and never saw anyone else here.

361
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,770
The Parasol Forest is weird.

362
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,610
What happened yesterday
was no accident.

363
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
When you get better,

364
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,250
I’ll go back to the Heavenly Palace
and report it to my father.

365
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,320
Seize her!

366
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,490
What happened?

367
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,090
Your Highness.

368
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,890
She attacked Master Bai Jue

369
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,090
in the Parasol Forest yesterday.

370
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,520
Master and His Majesty

371
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,010
suspect that she is related
to the Devils,

372
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,970
and ordered us to take her back.

373
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,010
Father.

374
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,400
This is a misunderstanding.

375
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,010
Fengran and I went into
the forest together.

376
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,610
She could never be an attacker.

377
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,920
Please investigate it carefully.

378
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,010
Jingjian.

379
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,010
Watch your manners.

380
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,650
Don’t answer before Master asks you.

381
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,010
Master.

382
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,160
Jingzhao.

383
00:24:59,130 --> 00:24:59,890
Yes.

384
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,850
Tell us

385
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,890
what you saw yesterday.

386
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,010
Yes.

387
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,610
At noon yesterday, I and...

388
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,520
North Sea Lord found the pure evil

389
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
was strange in the Human Realm.

390
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,920
So we followed it to the Parasol Forest.

391
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,250
We saw blood everywhere,

392
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
and found Devilish Energy.

393
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,200
All the immortals of the Feng Clan
were imprisoned,

394
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,970
lost their spiritual aura and died.

395
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,560
I saw with my own eyes that

396
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,440
Lady Fengran killed the immortals

397
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,800
and trapped me with Devilish Energy.

398
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,090
If North Sea Lord
hadn’t come to save me,

399
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,010
and Master Bai Jue had awakened,

400
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,250
I would surely have been killed by her.

401
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,160
Are all your words

402
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,650
true?

403
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,890
Master,

404
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,920
I dare not lie to you.

405
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,520
If there is a lie,

406
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,920
I’m willing to suffer
from Devilish Energy.

407
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,920
Fengran.

408
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,090
What else do you have to say?

409
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,400
I went to the Parasol Forest
for private affairs.

410
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Their death

411
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,090
has nothing to do with me.

412
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,130
A verbal statement is no guarantee.

413
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,200
Do you have any proof?

414
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,010
So is Jingzhao.

415
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,920
Does she have any proof?

416
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,650
I’m impartial.

417
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,680
You may pretend not to know,

418
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,400
but Qingmu will not.

419
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,520
I’m upright

420
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,650
and never lie.

421
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,040
If I had killed them,

422
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
I would have admitted it.

423
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,650
But it’s clear that
someone impersonated me

424
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,970
and framed me up.

425
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,770
I can’t accept it.

426
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,010
Master, you were also
in the Parasol Forest yesterday.

427
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,920
If Fengran had Devilish Energy,

428
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
how could you not see it?

429
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,040
Many people in the Feng Clan

430
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,680
have the power of the Lord.

431
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,920
It’s clear that Fengran was framed up.

432
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,650
After sleeping for 60,000 years,

433
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,800
can’t you even see it through?

434
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,890
Gu Jun.

435
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,490
God Gu Jun.

436
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,680
You are so rude.

437
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,890
Master.

438
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,010
I have no intention of framing her.

439
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,890
It has something to do with the Devils,

440
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,040
and must be severely punished.

441
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,770
Put Fengran in prison

442
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,490
and torture her.

443
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,890
Yes.

444
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,560
Master.

445
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,610
Fengran is weak

446
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,370
and can’t stand any torture.

447
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,520
No matter you are

448
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,920
Bai Jue

449
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,730
or Qingmu,

450
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,770
if you let Houchi down,

451
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,730
I will never forgive you.

452
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,040
Take her away.

453
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:35,920
Yes.

454
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,800
Qingmu

455
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,610
is just an incarnation.

456
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,130
From now on,

457
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,680
I don’t want anyone
to mention him again.

458
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,370
Yes.

459
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,320
I’ll issue an order.

460
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,890
The Devils were exterminated by Gods.

461
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,730
The one I fought

462
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,370
is not the remnant of the Devils.

463
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,370
Master, you mean...

464
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,320
Fengran didn’t do it.

465
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,490
I was just worried about
alarming the enemy,

466
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,730
so I put her in prison.

467
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,680
When this matter is settled,

468
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
you can release Fengran.

469
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,970
Master, you are considerate.

470
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,730
Do you have the killer in your mind?

471
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,970
Just some clues.

472
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,650
Though she has mighty Devilish Energy,

473
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,200
her instruction feather is immortal.

474
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,890
She is an Immortal.

475
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,160
Muguang.

476
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,970
You’ve been in charge of
the Heavenly Palace for 60,000 years,

477
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,520
and know the Immortals very well.

478
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,890
By your guess,

479
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,560
who do you think

480
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,200
is possessed

481
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,250
by the Devils?

482
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,010
I’m sorry.

483
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,680
Please punish me for negligence.

484
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,680
Wu Huan was

485
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,250
appointed by Shanggu
as the Leader of the Feng Clan.

486
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,890
And now she is the Heavenly Empress.

487
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,800
The whole Feng Clan was exterminated.

488
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,560
Why didn’t she show up?

489
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,400
Master,

490
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,850
I’ve punished her to the Nether World.

491
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,280
The Nether World?

492
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,250
What for?

493
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,520
Some trivial things.

494
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,440
Trivial things?

495
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,280
Master.

496
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,770
Thought I’ve punished her
to the Nether World,

497
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,800
she’d never be possessed by the Devils.

498
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,890
Moreover,

499
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,440
the killer took Jingzhao away.

500
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,040
Wu Huan loves her most.

501
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,010
How could she

502
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,730
have Jingzhao suffered?

503
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,010
You’re too serious.

504
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,770
Sit down.

505
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,400
Wu Huan is Shanggu’s people.

506
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,090
I believe in her.

507
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,400
Let her handle the matter
of the Feng Clan.

508
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,520
Yes.

509
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,440
I have just awakened,

510
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,010
and need to regain my God power.

511
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,890
I will go to the Sky Land tomorrow.

512
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,730
You are still in charge of

513
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
the affairs of the Heavenly Palace.

514
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,560
Now that you are back,

515
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,650
of course you are in charge.

516
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:07,770
This...

517
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,800
I’ve made up my mind.

518
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,130
No need to say any more.

519
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,610
When the God Realm was closed,

520
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,650
God Hongri passed away.

521
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,770
You are now alone.

522
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,680
I’m afraid

523
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,090
it’s inconvenient for you.

524
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,730
Father.

525
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,370
I’d like to follow Master

526
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,090
and take care of him.

527
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,090
You?

528
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,560
You are spoiled.

529
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,130
How do you take good care of Master?

530
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,090
You may go.

531
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,770
Jingzhao is your daughter.

532
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,920
She saved me in the Parasol Forest.

533
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,440
I

534
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,970
owe her a favor.

535
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,440
If you’re willing,

536
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,970
you can follow me.

537
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,890
It’s good for your practice.

538
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,440
And I can return your favor this way.

539
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,730
Master, thank you.

540
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,770
I knew you’d come.

541
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
The matter of the Parasol Forest

542
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,400
has been decided.

543
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,850
I came here

544
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,890
not for Fengran,

545
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,490
but for my best friend,

546
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,890
Lord Qingmu.

547
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,130
Master, please tell me

548
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,440
where his Spiritual Strength is.

549
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,610
What can I do

550
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,850
to get him back?

551
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,800
I have awakened.

552
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,610
Qingmu will not exist in the world.

553
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
No matter what you do,

554
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,400
he won’t come back.

555
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,040
Impossible.

556
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,090
Qingmu is strong and competitive.

557
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,370
His Spiritual Strength
couldn’t collapse.

558
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
He will find a way...

559
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,560
Enough.

560
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,560
He is just an ordinary Immortal.

561
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,800
I said

562
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,370
no one should ever mention him again.

563
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,200
Do you really think

564
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,520
the life of an ordinary Immortal
is just like an ant?

565
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,770
Your Highness.

566
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,370
His Majesty ordered you
to leave the Nether World.

567
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,010
What?

568
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,200
He ordered me to leave here?

569
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,370
I heard it’s True God
Bai Jue’s decision.

570
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,130
I’m seriously injured.

571
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,800
I’m just a low-level God now.

572
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,520
I haven’t fully absorbed
the Devilish Energy.

573
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,280
If I leave now,

574
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,130
I’ll be hurling myself into a net.

575
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,520
Your Highness, if you disobey,

576
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,280
you will be suspected.

577
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,090
Everything

578
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,200
is providence.

579
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,280
Your Highness.

580
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,970
What do you mean?

581
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,130
Overlord Xuanyi

582
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,650
was Chief God of Chaos
created by Ancestral God.

583
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,560
But he became a Devil

584
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,520
and changed the spiritual vein.

585
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,920
God power and devil power

586
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,680
are of the same origin.

587
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,560
Xuanyi could do it.

588
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,090
I can do it, too.

589
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,680
Do you want to transform
God power into devil power?

590
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,010
No!

591
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,730
Tell me,

592
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,200
what should I do?

593
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,370
As long as I transform
all spiritual power from the Feng Clan

594
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,400
into devil power,

595
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,320
I can make rapid progress,

596
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,610
hide my Devilish Energy

597
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,730
and return to the top of Gods.

598
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,920
Look,

599
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,610
Deicide Flowers are blooming.

600
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,160
It seems to be providence.

601
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,320
You know,

602
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,200
I care about the Heavenly Palace

603
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,850
and my children.

604
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,930
Even if I have devil power,

605
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,040
I should not be a Devil, right?

606
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:35,930
Jingjian.

607
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,610
Fengran.

608
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,760
Fengran.

609
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,960
Go.

610
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,560
Are you alright?

611
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,610
Are you feeling better?

612
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,370
Much better.

613
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,280
Then leave here.

614
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,040
I’m not leaving.

615
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,720
I haven’t cleared my name yet.

616
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,610
If I leave,

617
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,320
you’ll become
an accomplice of the Devils.

618
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,040
I know very well

619
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,130
whether you are guilty or not.

620
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,720
You can count on me.

621
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,560
I’m not leaving.

622
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,520
If I leave,

623
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,130
what would you do?

624
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,410
I am Prince Jingjian.

625
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Father will not punish me

626
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,170
severely.

627
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,930
I don’t want to owe you.

628
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,090
We owe you.

629
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,320
What do you mean?

630
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,560
Fengran.

631
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,040
I release you

632
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,560
as instructed by God Gu Jun.

633
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,210
He asked me to tell you that

634
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,800
if the Heavenly Palace
finds out you’re gone,

635
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,560
it’ll send people to the Qingchi Palace.

636
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,930
So go to Hidden Mountain

637
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,890
to find Houchi.

638
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,090
What if Houchi asks about Qingmu?

639
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,450
Your Highness,

640
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
how can you release her?

641
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,000
Fengran, leave!

642
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,850
Or it will be too late.

643
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,720
Ice Cube,

644
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,040
you finally woke up,

645
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,170
but at a bad timing.

646
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,520
If Shanggu knew it,

647
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,610
she would scold you for being ruthless.

648
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
You should stay in bed.

649
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,800
What are you doing here?

650
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,850
Take care.

651
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,520
Sit down.

652
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,280
I’ve been in bed

653
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,850
for three months.

654
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,090
It’s so boring.

655
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,170
So I want to pick some buds

656
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,320
to make pear flower cakes for you.

657
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,720
Just leave it to me.

658
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:33,560
Here.

659
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,370
I made the jujube soup for you.

660
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,890
Try it while it’s hot.

661
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,320
You

662
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,760
spoil him now.

663
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,480
When he is born,

664
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,520
how will you spoil him?

665
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
He will come
to this world under my care.

666
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,090
So it’s undisputed for me

667
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,370
to spoil him.

668
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,560
However, it’s been a long time.

669
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,650
Why don’t you look pregnant

670
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,280
at all?

671
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,170
I’ve never seen any other

672
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,370
pregnant immortals.

673
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,520
But we’re connected by blood,

674
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,800
so I can feel that he’s very healthy.

675
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,130
Maybe

676
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,090
it’s lack of spiritual power here.

677
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,720
He doesn’t absorb enough spiritual aura,

678
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,760
so he grows slowly.

679
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,480
I hope so.

680
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,850
How about I ask Chang Que

681
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,210
to give you a good check-up?

682
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,480
Jingyuan.

683
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,760
I haven’t heard from Qingmu
for a long time.

684
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,370
He doesn’t do this for nothing.

685
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,370
Did something big happen
in the Three Realms?

686
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,720
Something big?

687
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,320
I didn’t hear of that.

688
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,850
Immortals and Demons dispute again?

689
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,610
I’m here every day
to study recipes with you.

690
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,000
I have no time for the outside.

691
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,480
Houchi.

692
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,370
How do you make pear flower cakes?

693
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,370
You can teach me later.

694
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:50,800
Jingyuan.

695
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,090
I can’t leave here.

696
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,320
Can you go out and find Qingmu for me?

697
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,650
The barrier is shaking.

698
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,210
Someone’s trying to break in.

699
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,760
Stop!

700
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,090
Goddess Houchi.

701
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,850
We’re ordered to arrest the criminal.

702
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,280
Please don’t make trouble for us.

703
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,320
Ridiculous!

704
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,130
When did Fengran

705
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,450
become a criminal?

706
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,130
She exterminated the Feng Clan

707
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,240
for private affairs.

708
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,610
His Majesty ordered us to

709
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,800
take her back to the Heavenly Palace.

710
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,130
The Feng Clan was exterminated?

711
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,210
Nonsense.

712
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,090
She would not

713
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,720
do such a thing.

714
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,650
I’m here.

715
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,000
No one can touch her.

716
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,240
Goddess Houchi.

717
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,650
Let alone you,

718
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,850
even God Gu Jun cannot save her.

719
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,450
Guards, catch her.

720
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,280
Jingyuan.

721
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:51,800
Demon God.

722
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,480
Get out of here!

723
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,690
Demon God.

724
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,560
Master Bai Jue has returned
to the Three Realms

725
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,130
with invincible might.

726
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,560
You can’t be arrogant for long.

727
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,040
Bai Jue?

728
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,090
So what?

729
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,320
I wasn’t afraid of him then.

730
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,610
And I’m not afraid of him now.

731
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,850
Get out!

732
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,320
Did you know

733
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,000
Bai Jue had returned
to the Three Realms?

734
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,450
He is...

735
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,280
Yes.

736
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,690
Houchi.

737
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,800
Qingmu is Bai Jue.

738
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,040
I thought

739
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,090
both of you could enjoy

740
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,320
some time together.

741
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,320
But I didn’t expect...

742
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,610
This day came after all.

743
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,520
Houchi.

744
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Since Bai Jue has awakened,

745
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,240
Qingmu will not exist in the world.
