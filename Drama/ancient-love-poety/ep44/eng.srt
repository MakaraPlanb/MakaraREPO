=Episode 44=

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,680
He’s got your look.

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,310
How could you

5
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,800
leave him in the Qingchi Palace alone?

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,080
You can keep him if you want.

7
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,230
If not,

8
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,040
just ship him off to get trained.

9
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,550
Ship him off?

10
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,310
You know

11
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,270
he’s going to hate you

12
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,480
once he grows up.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,510
Let me tell you something.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
You’re bad enough

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
in his eyes.

16
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,630
Are you done?

17
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,720
It’s only been 60,000 years.
How did you...?

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,040
I want a new life.

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
How’s that wrong?

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,550
Do you have anything else to say?

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,040
I had

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,830
but not anymore.

23
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,960
What’s so funny?

24
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,800
I’m just glad

25
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,600
I left you 60,000 years ago.

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,160
Don’t come to the Dome again

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,720
unless necessary.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
I’m satisfied with the life I have now.

29
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,470
Let bygones

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,000
be bygones.

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,550
That was quick.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,320
Where did you go?

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,670
I’m new here and I’m hanging around.

34
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,880
That Ice Cube has changed tremendously!

35
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,550
What did I say?

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,190
You shouldn’t have wasted time on him.

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,910
I regret it.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,030
Regret what?

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,000
That I didn’t burn down this place.

40
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,360
How many times have you done this?

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,830
What do you mean?

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,080
I came to bring those
two sugar figurines.

43
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,600
You’ve sneaked in more than once.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
Stop making excuses.

45
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,750
I’m not blind.

46
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,240
Ice Cube,

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,030
you’re playing with fire.

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,440
Aren’t you afraid of
being caught by Wu Huan?

49
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,910
Shanggu went to the Dome earlier.

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
I know that.

51
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,630
Why didn’t you stop her?

52
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,270
She couldn’t give you up

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,270
and neither could your son.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,720
There was nothing I could do.

55
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,910
I can’t sleep.

56
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,910
Fine, fine, fine.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,910
You can see them one last time.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,720
Be quick.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,390
I’ll be outside.

60
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,550
Thanks.

61
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey,

62
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,160
I heard

63
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,670
something juicy just now!

64
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,040
What is it?

65
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,160
Stop messing around! Enough!

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,640
Listen,

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,720
you know the three True Gods, right?

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
Back in ancient times,

69
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,670
Master Tianqi wielded
the Purple Moon Whip

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,830
just like this...

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,320
Really?

72
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you done with your work?

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,920
Master Shanggu is still weak
and she needs to rest.

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,230
You guys just get back to work.

75
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,600
Go.

76
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,230
Yes.

77
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,640
Yes.

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,830
You stay right here.

79
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,110
- Jiaye, do you want to be punished?
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

80
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,920
Only you have a big mouth here.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,950
You never stop talking!

82
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,760
I’m sorry.

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,640
It’s my fault.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,950
You say one thing and do another.

85
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,550
You’ve never learned your lesson.

86
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,070
You must be punished.

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,720
I won’t do it again!

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,670
I’ll stop!

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,350
Ow! It hurts!

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,110
I just heard some gossip.

91
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,760
Will you beat me if I tell you?

92
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,880
Was that what you were talking about?

93
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,880
No.

94
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,720
It’s about the three True Gods.

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,350
Is your information reliable?

96
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,550
It sounds convincing.

97
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,760
You wouldn’t believe

98
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,600
what stupid things Master Tianqi did!

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,270
I’m not interested in him.

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Since the God Realm fell apart,

101
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,040
there isn’t much left about it.

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,230
Where did you get your information?

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
Just hear it for fun.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,550
Punish me all you want

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
if it’s bad.

106
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,200
Alright.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,790
Tell me everything you know

108
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
about the three True Gods.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,350
Don’t leave anything out.

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,760
I wouldn’t dare.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,110
Master.

112
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,920
Fengran,

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,040
I’m glad you came.

114
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,040
These are all Shanggu’s favorite.

115
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,200
Help me pick some.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,350
How thoughtful you are!

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What’s that smirk for?

118
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,510
I learned about rumors
about the God Realm.

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,510
More precisely, the love triangle among

120
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,350
True God Bai Jue,
Master Shanggu and you.

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Immortals gossip about
Gods all the time.

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,670
It’s nothing new.

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,790
But I’m pissed that they spread

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,760
your scandals all over the place.

125
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,950
My scandals?

126
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,670
Like the fire in Taichu Hall.

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,550
How ridiculous!

128
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,830
It’s a Master’s sanctuary.

129
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,510
How did that happen?

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
There’s more,

131
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,480
such as faking an illness for love,

132
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,670
and being jealous.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,270
I haven’t got to the worst part.

134
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,160
The worst part?

135
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,720
I don’t get it.

136
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,110
Why did others tell such lies?

137
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,950
They made you look bad on purpose.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,600
What about Bai Jue?

139
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,550
What did they say about him?

140
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,000
They said he’s charismatic.

141
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,270
He and Master Shanggu
are meant to be together.

142
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,070
I’ll stop there,

143
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,200
or I’m afraid you’ll be mad.

144
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,270
They’re all rumors.

145
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,550
Not true at all.

146
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,830
Don’t believe such things.

147
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,880
If you say they’re rumors,

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,830
they can’t be true.

149
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,640
Who told you all that?

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,670
Jiaye.

151
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,270
That rabbit has such a big mouth!

152
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,670
I’ll shut him up

153
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,550
to stop the rumors.

154
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
You said it yourself it’s not true.

155
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,550
Why are you so nervous?

156
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,830
It’s all hearsay.

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
Stop spreading it.

158
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,920
I’m fine with whatever they say,

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,440
but the God Realm isn’t
something to make fun of.

160
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,400
How about this?

161
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,030
I’ll tell Jiaye

162
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,910
to ask Master Shanggu about it.

163
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,350
As she’s also involved in the rumor,

164
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,400
she can clear your name.

165
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,550
No! Don’t do that!

166
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,200
Well...

167
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
Don’t ask her or do anything for me.

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,230
Relax. I was joking.

169
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,640
I promise

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,280
all your secrets are safe with me.

171
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,440
I’m simply surprised

172
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
that you were a bit flighty

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
but cute

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,520
60,000 years ago.

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,440
Zip Jiaye’s lips,

176
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,550
and all the rumors will stop.

177
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,910
I’ll

178
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,200
bring that rabbit to you.

179
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,000
Those rumors are nothing new.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Don’t take them seriously.

181
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Got it, got it!

182
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
They aren’t true at all!

183
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,910
How dare you!

184
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,230
Blasphemy is a felony.

185
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,840
It’s my fault.

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,790
I believed such hearsay easily.

187
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,400
I made a mistake.

188
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,550
Please forgive me.

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Master was lenient enough

190
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,590
by only muting you.

191
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,590
If it were me,

192
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,710
I’d rip off

193
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,910
your ears!

194
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,710
Do you think

195
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,400
there’s any difference

196
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,550
between Bai Jue

197
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,030
and the one in the Dome?

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
They’re incomparable.

199
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
The one in the Dome

200
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,000
isn’t likable at all.

201
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,640
What about me and Bai Jue?

202
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,960
Who’s better?

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Of course you’re way better than him.

204
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,520
Yes.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,590
Master is

206
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,470
a hero and a loyal friend,

207
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,840
completely different
from that clown in the rumor.

208
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,670
That’s right! I agree!

209
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,840
Master, you’re charming

210
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,000
and highly respected.

211
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,150
Am I right?

212
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,350
Of course! Absolutely!

213
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,710
In that sense,

214
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,710
that Ice Cube is much worse than me.

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,640
Rise.

216
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,150
I’ve forgiven you.

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,350
Thank you, Master.

218
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
I’ll be careful with my words

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,880
and won’t believe
such ridiculous rumors again.

220
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,880
What you said

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,960
has reminded me

222
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,520
of those stupid things I almost forgot.

223
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It’s been 60,000 years.

224
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,150
Come to think of it,

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
they’re quite fun.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Are those rumors...?

227
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
Master, I almost forgot

228
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,280
Jingjian had invited me
to the Human Realm.

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,840
It’s about time.

230
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
I’m leaving.

231
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,080
Let’s go. Come on.

232
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,470
Let’s go. Let’s go.

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,960
Your Majesty, you’re too busy

234
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
to come back and rest for days.

235
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,640
I’m here to check on you.

236
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,110
The murder in the Parasol Forest
100 years ago is still a mystery.

237
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I can’t eat or sleep at all.

238
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,880
That murderer killed the Feng Clan

239
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
and injured Jingzhao.

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,520
I implore you to get to the bottom of it

241
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,150
and bring the killer to justice.

242
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
I won’t let the Devils

243
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,200
off the hook.

244
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,200
Lord Donghua’s birthday
is a few days away.

245
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,400
I’ll give away 1,000 years of power
to nourish Mount Lookout

246
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,030
as my gift to him.

247
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,520
Don’t do that again,

248
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,550
or I’ll get worried.

249
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
I can’t forgive myself

250
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,550
for what I did in the past.

251
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,840
1,000 years of power is nothing.

252
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,790
Come here.

253
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,230
You must be bored

254
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,030
being stuck in the Palace.

255
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,080
I’ll never get bored

256
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
as long as I’m with you.

257
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,760
Over the past 100 years,

258
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,470
Master Bai Jue has never come at you.

259
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,710
Neither has Demon God
left the Qingchi Palace.

260
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,000
I’m too busy lately.

261
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,760
You can attend Donghua’s banquet for me.

262
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,000
Since you’re occupied,

263
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,000
I’ll go to Mount Lookout.

264
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,350
Appreciated.

265
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,470
Mother.

266
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,000
Jingyang,

267
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,470
your spiritual vein is damaged.

268
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,000
Don’t practice too hard.

269
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,590
Mother,

270
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,080
I’ve already recovered.

271
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,520
100 years ago,

272
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,790
I asked you to kill Demons
with the Decide Flower

273
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,230
which got you 20 thunder strikes.

274
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,790
Why did you bring that up again?

275
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,200
It’s over.

276
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,590
Don’t blame yourself for it.

277
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,030
The thought of

278
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,520
your scream
on the Green Dragon Platform

279
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,470
gives me endless pain.

280
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
Just forget about it,

281
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,280
or I’ll feel guilty.

282
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,230
Fine.

283
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,280
Jingyang, is the Demon Region stable?

284
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,670
Jingjian and I take turns to guard it,

285
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
plus we have Master’s protection.

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
Nothing bad will happen.

287
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,640
Demons are cunning.

288
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,230
You must be careful.

289
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,790
Are you turning us
against each other again?

290
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,710
I’m concerned about you and Jingjian.

291
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,710
I didn’t mean to start another war.

292
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,910
Those words came out wrong.

293
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,790
Please forgive me.

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,640
Never mind.

295
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,790
It’s fine.

296
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
Since I recovered,

297
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,110
I’ve been practicing hard

298
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,150
without resting for a day

299
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,910
in case another war breaks out.

300
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,280
I sincerely hope I’ll never need

301
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,670
to wield my weapon.

302
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,350
Master is right.

303
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
The world will be safe

304
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,640
with no war.

305
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,590
I heard a new play is going to

306
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,470
meet the public in the Human Realm.

307
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,640
Why don’t we...?

308
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,830
Shanggu has woken up.

309
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,400
The Qingchi Palace needs me,

310
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,920
so I may not have too much time for you.

311
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,470
I guess so.

312
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,110
Since Master Shanggu came back,

313
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,950
I haven’t paid respects to her.

314
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,160
We can go now.

315
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,190
Yuanqi.

316
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,920
Why did you come to see Fengran again?

317
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,520
She’s busy.

318
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,160
Let’s go.

319
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,760
Tianqi, when will the God Realm reopen?

320
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,710
I want to go back.

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,350
I miss Zhiyang and Yuemi.

322
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,590
And,

323
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
I plan to bring Yuanqi back.

324
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,950
I miss them, too.

325
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,800
Shanggu, trust me,

326
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
now that you’re back,

327
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,590
it’s only a matter of time

328
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
before the God Realm reopens.

329
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,070
Yuanqi is a poor boy.

330
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,230
He looks naughty,

331
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,710
but he isn’t a bad boy.

332
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,520
I wonder

333
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,160
what changed Bai Jue so much.

334
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,590
Why can’t you let that go?

335
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,710
Other than him,

336
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,590
many others are no longer themselves.

337
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,190
Wu Huan is one of them.

338
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,830
She’s completely different.

339
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,800
What do you mean?

340
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,310
You’ve seen Fengran.

341
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,070
Aren’t you curious about

342
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,520
where Wuxi and Feng Yan are?

343
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,590
Aren’t they living in seclusion?

344
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,070
Living in seclusion?

345
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,160
Wu Huan killed...

346
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,590
That’s why Fengran grew up

347
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,470
like an orphan.

348
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,470
Did she do it to be
the Queen of Phoenix?

349
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,190
Yes.

350
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,560
Everything went off track eventually.

351
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
I never expected
Wu Huan to be so heartless.

352
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,680
I was wrong about her.

353
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,310
She will pay

354
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,190
for their deaths.

355
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,400
Master,

356
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,830
let me introduce someone to you.

357
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,680
I, Jingjian,

358
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,710
pay respects to you.

359
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,310
He’s my partner, Jingjian.

360
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,070
Heavenly Emperor’s second son.

361
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,830
Isn’t Wu Huan his mother?

362
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,830
Why are you being with him?

363
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,520
He’s nice

364
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,560
and kindhearted.

365
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,830
I’m curious.

366
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,590
Didn’t she try to tear you guys apart?

367
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,000
She was fuming,

368
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,070
but there was nothing she could do.

369
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,520
I took joy in her anger.

370
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,800
She can do anything she wants.

371
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,000
He seems fine.

372
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,230
You’ve said hello. Now, get out.

373
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,280
I’ll come again some other day.

374
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
My aunt needs Fengran.

375
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,190
Don’t show up again.

376
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,830
Goodbye.

377
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,590
Haven’t you taught him

378
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,000
to be polite to guests?

379
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,590
Master,

380
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,430
we couldn’t do anything about him.

381
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,920
Yuanqi,

382
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,590
have you got an issue with Jingjian?

383
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,680
Of course.

384
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,920
I’ll marry Fengran once I’m old enough.

385
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,920
But he’s taken her away from me.

386
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,560
Thank you.

387
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,000
Now that Jingjian has a competitor,

388
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,680
he’ll feel threatened.

389
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,310
You’re welcome.

390
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,400
Yuanqi, you’re still young.

391
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,430
You don’t know
how serious marriage is.

392
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,280
Don’t say that again.

393
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,110
Why didn’t Bai Jue
treat his marriage seriously?

394
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,880
He got married so easily.

395
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
Why can’t I?

396
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,710
I’m marrying Fengran!

397
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,070
Why do you like her so much?

398
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,350
She always takes me to the Human Realm,

399
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,470
teaches me mahjong,

400
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,430
treats me to feasts,

401
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,470
flies kites with me

402
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,230
and helps me beat up bullies.

403
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,590
I can’t be happier

404
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,520
whenever I’m with her.

405
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,110
You’re lying!

406
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,280
Master, I didn’t...

407
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,830
I wouldn’t blame you.

408
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,190
I also had such a friend

409
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,110
hanging out with me.

410
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,560
I’d appreciate it

411
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,310
if you could continue
keeping him company.

412
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,350
Master,

413
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,110
Donghua is celebrating
his birthday today.

414
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,760
We’ve been invited

415
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,110
to Mount Lookout.

416
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,070
Let’s pay him a visit.

417
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,880
Who’s Donghua?

418
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,000
A kind immortal.

419
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,590
It’s said he’s been
in the Immortal Realm

420
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,800
since ancient times.

421
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,070
Aunt, I want to go there.

422
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,190
It’s my favorite place.

423
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,800
Let’s go.

424
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,880
Tell Donghua

425
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,800
we can’t make it.

426
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,310
Yes.

427
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,880
There must be girls and fine liquor

428
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,800
at his birthday banquet.

429
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,470
Are you really going to miss all that?

430
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,760
I’m comfortable here

431
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,350
and I don’t like a big crowd.

432
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,310
Master Tianqi doesn’t like a big crowd!

433
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,040
If that got out,

434
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,590
all the Gods would
laugh their heads off.

435
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,590
Why aren’t we going?

436
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,350
How could we not go?

437
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,880
We aren’t going, period.

438
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,680
Fengran,

439
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,070
Uncle Tianqi is such a dictator!

440
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,310
He’s way above me

441
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,430
and much stronger than me.

442
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,000
Aunt,

443
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,950
they all call me

444
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,280
an orphan.

445
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,710
No one will marry me.

446
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
I guess they’re right.

447
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,470
Even Fengran isn’t on my side.

448
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,950
Aunt,

449
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,110
take me to Mount Lookout!

450
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,190
Don’t use my trick against me.

451
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,880
What’s new do you get?

452
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,640
Look at him.

453
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,880
He changes his attitude so quickly.

454
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,110
Thanks to your Father’s teaching
and help,

455
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
I could get hold of the Power of Chaos.

456
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,400
I’ll teach you everything I know

457
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
to return his favor.

458
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,160
That way,

459
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,590
Bai Jue and I will be even.

460
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,710
A man like Bai Jue

461
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,920
would teach others?

462
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,280
Back then, he was charming

463
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,640
and erudite.

464
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,590
Countless girls were attracted to him,

465
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,760
including me.

466
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,560
But he couldn’t care less about me.

467
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,800
No way!

468
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,070
Your uncle didn’t tell you?

469
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,190
I don’t want to hear anything about him.

470
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Now, he’s become cold and heartless.

471
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,680
I find his manner off-putting.

472
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,070
What happened to him?

473
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,110
I wish I knew.

474
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,830
Why am I not refreshed at all

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,950
after drinking so much tea?

476
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,190
The tea leaves must’ve gone stale.

477
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,310
I’m sleepy and going to bed.

478
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,470
Aunt,

479
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,040
he just woke up.

480
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Are you drinking alone?

481
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,040
Why didn’t you invite me?

482
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,430
Uncle Tianqi.

483
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,160
One must’ve gone through major setbacks

484
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,950
before changing dramatically.

485
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,710
That’s some strong liquor.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,040
I’m getting dizzy.

487
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,590
There’s a scar on Bai Jue’s chest

488
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,640
left by a sword.

489
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,640
Was he in any sort of trouble?

490
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
I have no idea.

491
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
We’ve seldom met these years

492
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,830
and have drifted apart.

493
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,560
Uncle Tianqi,

494
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,310
why didn’t you tell me all that?

495
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,310
You weren’t interested in it, were you?

496
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,830
Stop messing with me.

497
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,920
Why do you seem more impatient than me

498
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,430
whenever you bring him up?

499
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,110
Does Bai Jue

500
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,800
have any secrets?

501
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,470
Uncle Tianqi,
you’re hiding something from us.

502
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,230
Do you guys often meet in secret?

503
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,520
That’s your guilty face, Uncle Tianqi!

504
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,920
- Tianqi!
- Uncle Tianqi!

505
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,700
- Tianqi!
- Uncle Tianqi!

506
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,440
- Tianqi!
- Uncle Tianqi!

507
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,310
- Tianqi!
- Enough!

508
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,350
I don’t know anything about Bai Jue.

509
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,350
Leave me alone!

510
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,070
I’m going to start my closed training.

511
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,710
Am I good?

512
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
You’re amazing!

513
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,310
Don’t use...

514
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,430
Your tricks against you.

515
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
Glad you know that.

516
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,710
Let’s go.

517
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,470
We can’t be late.

518
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,920
How could those two

519
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,280
trick you so easily?

520
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,070
Why are you here again?

521
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,110
I have something for Yuanqi.

522
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,470
Now that Shanggu has woken up,

523
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,310
don’t tell me you’ll come every day.

524
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,350
This is the last time.

525
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,640
Don’t let others see them again.

526
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,710
When you come next time,

527
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,830
I'll be mad!

528
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,280
You played the bad guy,

529
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,710
and now, you want to be the good guy.

530
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,280
What exactly do you want?

531
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,040
What was he thinking?

532
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,880
Thanks.

533
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,310
Xianzhu,

534
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,070
shouldn’t you be inside

535
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,000
serving the Heavenly Empress
and Princess Jingzhao?

536
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
Why are you out?

537
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,190
Don’t get me started.

538
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,880
It’s Lord’s once-in-a-century birthday,

539
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,040
but they’re inside
flattering Princess Jingzhao

540
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,590
as if she’s the birthday girl.

541
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,310
I had enough

542
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,280
and came out for fresh air.

543
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,190
Since she was married into the Dome,

544
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,560
she’s become...

545
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,040
No one married her.

546
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,880
You know

547
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
the wedding didn’t complete.

548
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,350
Besides,

549
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,640
the Qingchi Palace suffered so much

550
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,430
all because of her and her mother.

551
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,000
They were like bandits.

552
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,280
Over the past 100 years,

553
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,070
Heavenly Empress
has done numerous good deeds.

554
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,950
Maybe she’s changed.

555
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,760
Or His Majesty
wouldn’t have let her out.

556
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,680
She hasn’t changed a bit!

557
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,430
She acts like she’s above everyone else.

558
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,350
Isn’t her diligent husband

559
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,830
afraid of being called partial?

560
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,710
Mr. Xianzhu,

561
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,400
Her Highness and Princess Jingzhao
get thirsty

562
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,160
when enjoying flowers in the back yard.

563
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,760
Go get some Jade Dew

564
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,760
for them.

565
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,110
But...

566
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,230
Ms. Shaoyao,

567
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,950
it takes the Jade Spring 100 years

568
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,350
to fill up a pond.

569
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,280
That spring is for our members
to build foundations,

570
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,590
not for drinking.

571
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,430
I don’t care.

572
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,070
You should be honored

573
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,400
that Princess fancies that drink.

574
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,040
Mr. Xianzhu,

575
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,230
she’s here for Master.

576
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,800
Upsetting her

577
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,800
is upsetting Master.

578
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,400
But...

579
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,430
Ms. Shaoyao,

580
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,800
I’ll go get it.

581
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,880
You can come with me.

582
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,310
Is that boy

583
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,110
really Bai Jue’s son?

584
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,000
He’s never said anything,

585
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,350
but anyone who sees that boy

586
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,560
can instantly tell their relationship.

587
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,830
That’s his son after all.

588
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,680
How could he be so indifferent to him?

589
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,590
I’ve tested his power.

590
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,190
It’s weak.

591
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,070
Maybe he got that from Houchi.

592
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
Master is probably ashamed of him.

593
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
And...

594
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,640
And what?

595
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,710
I was hard on him more than once.

596
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,470
Master didn’t intervene.

597
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,830
Does he still have feelings for Shanggu?

598
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,800
The past 100 years

599
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,640
hasn’t turned Houchi into Shanggu.

600
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,400
Hasn’t he ever said to you

601
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,680
about Shanggu’s awakening?

602
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,950
No.

603
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,310
He owes the Qingchi Palace so much

604
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,350
and Houchi stabbed him.

605
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,160
I’m sure they’re completely over.

606
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,070
Really?

607
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,520
He’s never been to
the Qingchi Palace again?

608
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,230
Mother,

609
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,950
I noticed nothing strange about him.

610
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,310
He’s quiet

611
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,110
but his attitude towards that boy

612
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,040
has said it all, right?

613
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,560
Jingzhao,

614
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,280
when you’re with him,

615
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,560
be extra careful.

616
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
For someone who’s so coldblooded

617
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,880
to his own son,

618
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,470
how could he always tolerate you?

619
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,000
Don’t worry, Mother.

620
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,830
Our wedding got interrupted.

621
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,040
We both know what we’re doing.

622
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
He respects me

623
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,590
in front of everyone.

624
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,760
Looks like the failed wedding

625
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,430
does you more good than harm.

626
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,000
Right now,

627
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,830
I’m no longer walking on eggshells

628
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,190
but living the way I please.

629
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,040
Do you have other concerns?

630
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,040
You can tell me.

631
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,040
Jingzhao,

632
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
do you still

633
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,640
love Bai Jue or Qingmu

634
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,470
after so long?

635
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
Qingmu and I are never meant to be.

636
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,470
Master doesn’t care about me at all.

637
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,350
Were I still obsessed with them,

638
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,830
wouldn’t I be an idiot?

639
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,430
I’m glad to hear that.

640
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,280
Mother,

641
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,040
Father has forgiven you.

642
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,590
From now on, we’ll be
the noblest Ladies

643
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,310
in all Three Realms.

644
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,280
To make that happen,

645
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,470
we can only rely on ourselves.

646
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,000
Aunt,

647
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,590
why are we here?

648
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,640
I came before

649
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,640
and only found a hovel.

650
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,560
This is where I activated my God vein.

651
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,110
Relax.

652
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,280
As shabby as it looks,

653
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,110
it means a lot to me.

654
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,040
So it’s like a monument.

655
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,070
You could say that.

656
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,310
Back then, your Father
scolded me all the time.

657
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,110
Even so,

658
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,040
you still liked him?

659
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
I was young and stupid

660
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,640
and was attracted to his good look.

661
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,230
He was good-looking?

662
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,950
It was 60,000 years ago.

663
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,590
What about now?

664
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,000
True Gods never age,

665
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,430
but Bai Jue’s look

666
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,190
back in the Dome

667
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,040
pissed me off.

668
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,830
I wish I could knock his teeth out

669
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,950
for both of us.

670
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,430
Yuanqi,

671
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,430
are you happy with me?

672
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,590
Of course.

673
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,950
Promise me

674
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,190
that you won’t lie to me again.

675
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,070
I’ve never told lies.

676
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,040
I’ve checked with Fengran repeatedly.

677
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,070
She said she didn’t teach you mahjong,

678
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,830
fly kites with you

679
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,760
or beat up bullies.

680
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,880
She lied to you.

681
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,560
I know I didn’t.

682
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,000
Aunt,

683
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,680
you know,

684
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,880
I’ve been to
the Dome myself many times.

685
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,920
Yuanqi...

686
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,000
I’m not there to see Bai Jue

687
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,040
but to give him a hard time

688
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,920
and make him uncomfortable.

689
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,350
However bad he is,

690
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,560
he’s still your Father.

691
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,160
Why should I be nice to him

692
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,640
after he abandoned us?

693
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,430
Never mind.

694
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,000
Forget it.

695
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,680
Your candied haws are melting.

696
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,310
Eat them quickly.

697
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,950
I’ll treat Bai Jue

698
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,310
the way he treats me.

699
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,190
Yuanqi,

700
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,310
you’re a man.

701
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,590
Don’t be petty.

702
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,230
You can’t

703
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,680
lose your temper easily,

704
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,310
understand?

705
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,230
I’m sorry.

706
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,800
The bigger man you are,

707
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,000
the pettier he looks.

708
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,760
That way, he’ll become a laughing stock.

709
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,920
Really?

710
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,590
I’m always on your side.

711
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,070
I’ll consider it

712
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,230
for your sake.

713
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,110
As long as you behave yourself,

714
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,710
I’ll get you anything you want.

715
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,560
I want some music.

716
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,760
And I’ll make you a feast.

717
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,190
Aunt,

718
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,310
I need to pee.

719
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:09,950

This Spiritual Spring is sweet

735
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,710
with a lingering taste.

736
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,190
It’s powerful enough
to build foundations.

737
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,470
Don’t tell Princess

738
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,040
what I did.

739
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,760
Or...

740
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,430
What... what did you do?

741
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,630
What’s wrong?

742
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,870
You can’t drink too much of this Spring

743
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,950
or pee into it.

744
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,710
I’m sorry. My bad.

745
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,520
I thought it was a wild spring.

746
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,800
Who are you?

747
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,630
How dare you pee next to the Spring?

748
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
Who are you?

749
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,430
How dare you drink it
without permission?

750
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,950
I’ll teach you a lesson!

751
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,360
How rude!

752
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,760
Did you get hurt?

753
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,800
Her Grace asked me
to fetch this spring water.

754
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
She’ll punish me

755
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,950
when I go back empty-handed.

756
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,150
I’m so sorry, Miss.

757
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,390
I apologize.

758
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,800
What’s the use of that?

759
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,150
It’s all your fault!

760
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,710
How could I not be mad?

761
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,360
I’ll explain to her

762
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,040
and she can punish me.

763
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,910
How does that sound?

764
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,360
You’d do that?

765
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,710
My aunt

766
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,870
told me to be a bigger man.

767
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,870
Lead the way.

768
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,520
Ms. Shaoyao,

769
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,910
he’s a kid.

770
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,230
What if Princess insists
on punishing him...?

771
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,190
I’ll take full responsibility.

772
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,520
Your Grace, he peed in the Spring

773
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,390
and ruined your mood.

774
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,670
But he’s just a little boy.

775
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,910
Please be lenient with him.

776
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,040
It’s you!

777
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,840
The homewrecker who seduced my father!

778
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,280
Mother,

779
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,760
he’s Master’s son.

780
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,150
How dare you

781
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,280
insult a princess!

782
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
You slapped me?

783
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,430
I won’t be easy on you!

784
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
You’re so unruly.

785
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,000
Aunt!

786
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,430
Relax. I’m here for you.

787
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,520
Wu Huan,

788
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,040
it’s been a while.

789
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
You immortals are
so into grand gestures.

790
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,470
How should I greet you

791
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
to show my respect?

792
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,280
There are eyes everywhere.

793
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,080
It’s not the perfect timing.

794
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,710
Wu Huan,

795
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,910
stay calm.

796
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,520
I, Wu Huan,

797
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,150
pay respects to you, Master.

798
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,190
Greetings, Master.

799
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,430
Greetings, Master.

800
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,430
You’ve indeed changed so much

801
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,710
that I barely recognized you.

802
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,150
Wu Huan shall stay.

803
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,360
The rest of you may leave.

804
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,150
Mother!

805
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,320
Aunt, let me stay.

806
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,390
Xianshan told me

807
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,670
you polluted the Spiritual Spring.

808
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,150
You made a mistake

809
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,040
and should apologize to Lord Donghua.

810
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,040
Alright.

811
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,320
Go ahead.

812
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,840
Let’s go.

813
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,630
Why is she so quiet?

814
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,760
Isn’t she here to confront me?

815
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,800
Wu Huan,

816
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,320
don’t you have anything to say to me?

817
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,670
Master,

818
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,560
I swear I had no idea

819
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,470
that you were in Houchi’s body.

820
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,760
I was being disrespectful
to you more than once.

821
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,150
You can punish me all you want.

822
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,360
Houchi?

823
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Who’s that?

824
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,150
I woke up

825
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,390
and found that
all Three Realms had changed.

826
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,430
My memory stopped in the Nether World.

827
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,000
The Nether World?

828
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,740
It’s been so long since we last met,

829
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,870
but you didn’t even

830
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
ask about my condition out of courtesy.

831
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,600
I apologize.

832
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,840
Master, you’re fresh out of a coma.

833
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,870
How do you feel?

834
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,190
All my power is back.

835
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,910
I’m full of the Power of Chaos.

836
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,670
Enough about me.

837
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,000
We’re no longer the same as before.

838
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,190
Let’s talk about something else.

839
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
Have you been
the Leader of the Feng Clan

840
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,910
over the past 60,000 years?

841
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,670
Master, you might not know

842
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,600
that back then,
the God Realm was collapsing,

843
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,360
leaving the Feng Clan in panic.

844
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,230
When Elder Feng Yun made me Leader,

845
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,320
I couldn’t say no to him

846
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,150
and I had to take over the Clan.

847
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,520
All Three Realms know that.

848
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,840
If you don’t believe me,

849
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,560
ask other immortals.

850
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,800
As Leader of the Feng Clan,

851
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,320

Wuxi and Feng Yan killed?
