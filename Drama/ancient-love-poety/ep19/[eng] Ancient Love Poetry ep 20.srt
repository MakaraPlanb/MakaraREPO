00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,320
<i>Pleasure House</i>
I’ve admired this place for long.

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,550
I must get in.

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
If you don’t like it,

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,310
go back and wait for me in the inn.

8
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,840
After I have enough fun,

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,310
I’ll go back to you.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,390
Wait.

11
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,390
What?

12
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,600
Do you need me

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,200
to walk you back to the inn?

14
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,440
No.

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,230
I just don’t understand.

16
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,550
It’s a place

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
for men.

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,870
Come in.

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
What fun can you have?

20
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,790
Or do you

21
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,630
simply want to get rid of me
by getting into this place?

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,630
You’re poorly informed.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,910
There’re female demons in it,

24
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,470
as well as male demons.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,450
What?

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,310
When males can come,

27
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,270
females can’t?

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,840
Well, Lord Fengran,

29
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,310
please kindly enlighten me tonight.

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,790
After you.

31
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,150
There you are.

32
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,360
I’ve been missing you.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,590
Come in.

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,160
That is Xuanjing Palace,

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,000
where Demon Lord Ziyue is.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
It’s heavily guarded.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,910
We can’t force in.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
You quit muscling things out now?

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
When did I ever muscle anything out?

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
You’re impulsive

41
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,510
and have a bad memory.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,870
Yesterday, you had a fight.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,400
Whenever I rectify injustices,

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,270
Jingjian will call it heroic.

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,800
Why do you sound the opposite?

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,910
Well, please use your brain

47
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,270
and find us a safe plan.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,830
Perhaps,

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,800
we can muddle through
disguising as guards.

50
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,630
The guards are from one garrison.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,480
What do you say the possibility of them

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,510
not knowing each other?

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,720
Right.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
That was ill-considered.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
You should muscle this out.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,080
Hey! Qin!

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,630
What can I do for Your Highness?

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,360
Qin,

59
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,080
take the badge back.

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
By returning the badge
to command all troops,

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,750
I meant to resign.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,080
From now on, Xuanjing Palace and I
are no longer related.

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,960
Are you going to

64
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,240
force me to stay by your rank?

65
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,190
You resigned knowing that

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,600
I don’t want you to leave.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,960
Qin,

68
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,960
is there no way

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,630
for us to reconcile?

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,600
Li.

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,670
Li, why did you come out?

72
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,880
Didn’t I tell you?

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Your spirit is weak

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,630
and could catch cold.

75
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,470
Qin!

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,520
Qin!

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,880
Qin!

78
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,750
Qin!

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,520
Qin!

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,520
Don’t go, please.

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,440
Isn’t this Prince Sen Yu?

82
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,550
It’s the demons’ rules

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,910
that the strength has the say.

84
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,440
Since you don’t let me go,

85
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,750
then fight me.

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,830
If I win,

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
no one from Xuanjing Palace

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,630
can stop me from leaving.

89
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,320
Qin,

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
don’t be ridiculous.

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Sir, sunflower seeds hot from stove.

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
Speaking of snacks,

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
nothing produces the same lingering taste
as walnut-flavored

94
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,750
sunflower seeds from Dibei City.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
If immortals in Heavenly Palace

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,270
see you like this, they’d shed

97
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
tears of disappointment.

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
What’s the problem with it?

99
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,800
Too worldly.

100
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
I eat grains.

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,910
That makes me an ordinary man.

102
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,520
Besides,

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,910
only True Gods and Goddesses
can be abstinent from food.

104
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,520
In these poor

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,550
immortals’ eyes,

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,320
you’re a cool god free of worldliness.

107
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,320
They shed their tears for nothing.

108
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,720
I hate my cool face

109
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,270
for those unnecessary attention.

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Alright.

111
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,550
I know you’re not pretending.

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,510
The man down there

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,160
is the second demon prince, Sen Yu.

114
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,550
The girl is Chang Qin, the fox princess.

115
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,550
They were a demon couple

116
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,830
engaged for marriage

117
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,670
thousands of years ago.

118
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,440
Then why are they fighting?

119
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,000
The story began from the war
between immortals and demons.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Sen Yu was severely wounded

121
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,000
and saved by a fox.

122
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,950
The fox

123
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,200
gave her demon core to him.

124
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,390
Thus, she could never
transform to human.

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,070
Sen Yu took her back to Xuanjing Palace

126
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
and promised to look after her

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,670
for her lifetime.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,880
The fox princess

129
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,440
is proud.

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,320
She would not swallow the insults.

131
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,160
In anger, she broke their engagement

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,510
and insisted on leaving the third heaven

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,230
and back to her kind.

134
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,640
It’s common that affection disappears.

135
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,320
Why such a fuss?

136
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,320
That’s very hypocritical.

137
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,950
Sen Yu is a man.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,670
Don’t all men in the world

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
want everything to be perfect for you?

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Not the man you’re looking at now.

141
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,720
Forget about what I said.

142
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,880
Lord Qingmu.

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,920
Call me Qingmu.

144
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,200
Qingmu,

145
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,830
why do you possess Demon Power?

146
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,200
It’s fine if you don’t want to tell.

147
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,640
To us from Qingchi Palace,

148
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,790
immortals and demons are equal.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
And I will not disdain you for that,

150
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,950
or tell your secret to the immortals.

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
No secrets

152
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,350
between you and me.

153
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
The Demon Power has been there

154
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,000
since the earliest of my memory.

155
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,350
It doesn’t show usually.

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,550
But when I perform great power,

157
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,830
it would spiral out of control.

158
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
Immortal and demon powers coexisting?

159
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,830
It’s never been heard of.

160
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,230
Yes.

161
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,670
So I want to find Boxuan fast

162
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,950
and ask about my past.

163
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,510
It’s odd.

164
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,600
They should be neck and neck
in strength.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
How did Sen Yu make such great progress?

166
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,920
Chang Qin must have regressed.

167
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,480
She’s too weak to power this move.

168
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,040
Are you hurt?

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,270
Qin,

170
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,230
you know

171
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,790
Li has always been fragile,

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
- so I have to...
- I have no interest

173
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,350
in your business.

174
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,200
Without my order,

175
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,270
no one would let you leave.

176
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,790
Your Highness.

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
This female demon is troublesome.

178
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,760
If she’s not well,

179
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,790
she should stay in
and get herself a physician,

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,550
instead of coming out here.

181
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
What did you say?

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
She is troublesome.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,600
The last part.

184
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,600
I know a way to get us in.

185
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,830
What is this?

186
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
You let her come out

187
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,720
knowing that she’s weak.

188
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,880
I asked you
to find a physician yesterday.

189
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,160
Where is the physician?

190
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,830
Pardon me, Your Highness.

191
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,040
I’m a physician.

192
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,640
What are you doing?

193
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,390
I got this.

194
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,070
Your Highness,

195
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,440
I’m Beichi, a fox

196
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,350
who excels in treating diseases
for foxes.

197
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,550
I can see you’re greatly concerned
of Miss Li.

198
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,830
Why don’t you give me a chance?

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,920
You’re from Mount Jingyou?

200
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,920
Which clan?

201
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,670
I’m one of the black foxes.

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,710
Elder Chang Mei is my master.

203
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,710
This is my apprentice, Nanmu,

204
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,590
a roan fox
who just transformed to human.

205
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,910
Elder Chang Mei’s disciple

206
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
must excel in medicine.

207
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,840
Come.

208
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,590
Take a look at Li.

209
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,590
Fortunately that Fengran

210
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,110
told me all sorts of bizarre stories,

211
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,710
so I know Sen Yu and Chang Qin,

212
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,710
and the gossips about the families

213
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,790
in the Three Realms.

214
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,470
The Spirit Reviver is of no use to me.

215
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,470
It’s the fox’s lucky day.

216
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,790
You’re truly skilled.

217
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,150
I’m impressed of
Elder Chang Mei’s disciple.

218
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,080
Why don’t you

219
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,400
come with me to Xuanjing Palace

220
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,840
as a guest?

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,320
Is it good?

222
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,470
My master asked me to travel around.

223
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,960
I can’t be a trouble to you.

224
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,230
Yes, Master Beichi.

225
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,110
Elder Pinghui of the flood dragon clan

226
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,200
is waiting for us to treat him.

227
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,440
We can’t stay.

228
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,710
Young master,

229
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,590
you can cure flood dragons’ diseases?

230
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,590
Marvelous!

231
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,440
Come to Xuanjing Palace.

232
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,840
You’ll be my honored guest.

233
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,960
Alright.

234
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,230
I gave Elder Pinghui some magic pills.

235
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,710
I suppose he’s recovered.

236
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,400
Miss Li has been suffering for long.

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,670
Her affliction is more pressing.

238
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,080
Let’s stay a few days in Xuanjing Palace

239
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,030
and look after Miss Li.

240
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,590
Great!

241
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,150
This way, please.

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,520
My apprentice,

243
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,030
take my medicine chest

244
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,590
and follow me.

245
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,200
There are restrictions everywhere.

246
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
Demon Lord Ziyue is an eminent figure.

247
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,230
I wonder where he lives.

248
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,350
Master Beichi,

249
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,520
how is Li?

250
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,550
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

251
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,280
I’m about to give her treatment.

252
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Houchi, Houchi.

253
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,880
The fox lost her demon core.

254
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,830
Her power is drained

255
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,960
and her soul fragile.

256
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,880
Even the Heavenly Emperor

257
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,960
can’t cure her.

258
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Can you?

259
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,230
My power is not strong enough,

260
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,520
but I learned all sorts of skills.

261
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,400
If anything goes wrong,

262
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,790
make an excuse and run.

263
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,520
I’ll take the blame.

264
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,640
Look at yourself.

265
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,910
Don’t give us out.

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,350
Take care of yourself.

267
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,790
Young master,

268
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,230
how did it go?

269
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,470
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

270
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,350
Li!

271
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,400
Li.

272
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,200
Your Highness.

273
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,110
You can transform to human.

274
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,080
I...

275
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,670
Miss Li lost her demon core.

276
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,710
It’s difficult to transform.

277
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,230
Acupuncture can only

278
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,350
keep her form for a few days.

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,230
But don’t worry, Your Highness.

280
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,520
Miss Li’s affliction is hard
to be cured,

281
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,000
but I know it well.

282
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,960
In three days with acupuncture,

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Miss Li can gather power in her body

284
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,230
and cultivate without a core.

285
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,550
Then she can transform to human.

286
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,470
Is it true?

287
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
Thank you, Master Beichi.

288
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,230
Servants!

289
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,840
Take the young master to change

290
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,960
and ready the feast.

291
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,200
I’d like to extend my gratitude.

292
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,200
No, no, no.

293
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
My master doesn’t drink.

294
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
That’s not necessary.

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,710
You have no manners as an apprentice.

296
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,760
I’m talking to your master.

297
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,960
How dare you interrupt me?

298
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,640
You’re right.

299
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,000
I’ve been admiring

300
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,840
Xuanjing Palace since I came.

301
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,520
There are so many questions to ask.

302
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,670
Master.

303
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,400
Please make sure my apprentice

304
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,640
is taken to somewhere he can rest,

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,150
in case he makes any trouble.

306
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,150
Of course, young master.

307
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,150
You demons

308
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,030
do know how to enjoy life.

309
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,840
Well,

310
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,200
thank you for saving Li.

311
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
This is to you.

312
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,670
It’s what I do.

313
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,470
Don’t mention it.

314
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,110
Your love to Miss Li is deep.

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
I’m impressed.

316
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,200
I lived in Mount Jingyou all year long

317
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,230
and never knew a place

318
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,150
with such grandeur as Xuanjing Palace.

319
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
The purple moon hanging above

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,230
close to the front gate

321
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,000
is brighter than anywhere else.

322
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,710
You may not know.

323
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,230
Demon Lord Ziyue

324
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,110
is currently in Xuanjing Palace.

325
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,150
The purple moon you saw

326
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,960
is the incarnation of his power.

327
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,230
Surely the moon here
is unusually bright.

328
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,640
When did Demon Lord Ziyue

329
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,080
come to Xuanjing Palace?

330
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,150
Almost ten thousand years ago.

331
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,230
Ten thousand years ago?

332
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,760
Your Highness,

333
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,590
I greatly admire Demon Lord Ziyue.

334
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,590
Do I have the honor to meet him?

335
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,470
I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.

336
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,880
Demon Lord Ziyue is withdrawn.

337
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,470
He wears a mask all day long

338
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,550
and keeps away from others

339
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,150
by the Purple Moon Spring in the back.

340
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,710
Even I seldom see him.

341
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,840
Withdrawn, wears a mask,

342
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,150
came here ten thousand years ago.

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Sounds like Boxuan.

344
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,670
I beg your pardon.

345
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,790
Nothing.

346
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,550
Well,

347
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,200
Your Highness,

348
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,150
another toast to you.

349
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,320
Are you feeling well?

350
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,200
Take it easy.

351
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,470
It’s a pity

352
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,710
that the donkey, Qingmu isn’t here

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
and couldn’t see the grandeur.

354
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,710
What’s wrong with me?

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,030
Why am I thinking of him?

356
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
Are you drunk already?

357
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,000
Cheers!

358
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,280
<i>Pleasure House</i>
Sir, it’s been a long time.

359
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,960
Come in.

360
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,150
Your Highness, bottom up.

361
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,790
Your Highness,

362
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,670
let me fill it up.

363
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,080
Your Highness, another cup.

364
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,880
No,

365
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,000
I can’t drink anymore.

366
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,790
I’m a little dizzy.

367
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
I understand.

368
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,880
But you must

369
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
drink this up.

370
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
You won’t turn me down, right?

371
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,030
Your Highness.

372
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,710
No.

373
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,670
I really can’t drink anymore.

374
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,280
Come on, drink.

375
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,110
Here is more.

376
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,230
Young man,

377
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,470
when I was shouting orders
at Abyssal Ridge Swamp,

378
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,040
you were still a kid.

379
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,830
Hey,

380
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,350
weren’t you drunk?

381
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,160
Where are you going,

382
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,000
Lord Fengran?

383
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,160
I...

384
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,400
Didn’t we agree

385
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
to get loaded together?

386
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,640
I...

387
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,160
Come on now.

388
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,280
Let’s drink.

389
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,590
Put it away. Let go of your hand.

390
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,560
Magic Rope?

391
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
You tied me up with the rope?

392
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,470
Jingjian, loose the rope.

393
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,350
Jingjian, Jingjian!

394
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,710
Free me, Jingjian!

395
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,470
I’m worried about her safety,

396
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,830
however she

397
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,230
is fraternizing with the demons

398
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,760
like they’re a family.

399
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,520
It’s late.

400
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,230
Why hasn’t she come back?

401
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,470
Miss, be careful.

402
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Miss, watch your steps.

403
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,880
The wine in Xuanjing Palace

404
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,950
is fabulous.

405
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,230
Careful.

406
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,160
It makes people drunk faster than mine.

407
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,760
Master Beichi, you’re back.

408
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,710
Lord Qingmu,

409
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,950
you should go to your lover
in the Heavenly Palace.

410
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,470
The Heavenly Palace?

411
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,310
Why are you in my dream?

412
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
You’re drunk, master.

413
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,560
The Heavenly Palace? Lover?

414
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,520
Those stories in novels are not real.

415
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,000
Actually,

416
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,110
you do have a handsome face.

417
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,350
If Jingzhao didn’t have a crush on you,

418
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,560
I would have...

419
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,400
I would have been nicer to you.

420
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,280
You’re drunk, master.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,640
Let me take you in.

422
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,400
I’m not drunk.

423
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,950
You are.

424
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,000
Well...

425
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,800
Master Beichi...

426
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,230
Don’t interrupt them.

427
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,640
The apprentice is so good-looking.

428
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,070
We should leave them alone.

429
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,590
I want five more bottles of wine.

430
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,230
You’re a girl,

431
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,640
and you drank too much.

432
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,470
What if your identity is exposed?

433
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,110
If you run into a pervert,

434
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,640
your reputation will be ruined.

435
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,110
If you want to drink again,

436
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,160
take me with you.

437
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,950
Do you hear me?

438
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:55,004
Sub by WeTV & Ripped by skysoultan

439
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,830
What are you doing?

440
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,070
Shanggu has changed.

441
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
She won’t travel around
and play with you.

442
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,160
What are you doing here?

443
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Shanggu has been upset

444
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,350
since she came back
from the Nether World.

445
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,590
I want to cheer her up.

446
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,880
Shanggu is so ungrateful.

447
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,040
You should have seen this coming

448
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,470
when you brought Master Bai Jue back.

449
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,470
Hold on.

450
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,230
You address Bai Jue by master.

451
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,800
But why do you address me as oi or hey?

452
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,640
Sometimes you call me by my full name.

453
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,640
Do you need a title to add
to your majesty?

454
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,230
Well, no.

455
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,470
I’m a talented and carefree man

456
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,280
who’s close to everything.

457
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,280
I don’t need these titles.

458
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,070
Then why did you ask?

459
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
We keep distance from Bai Jue

460
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,470
because we’re in awe of him.

461
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,110
But you’re different.

462
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,880
We grew up together.

463
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,310
In my heart,

464
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,680
you’re not an august True God,

465
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,470
but someone to share my thoughts with.

466
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,920
You’re so sweet.

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,040
My temperament

468
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,920
is way more friendly than the Ice Cube.

469
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,280
Are those for Shanggu?

470
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,070
It’s been a while.

471
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,920
They’re no longer fresh.

472
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,920
Come with me to pick

473
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,280
the most beautiful herb
in the Three Realms.

474
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,070
Really?

475
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,920
Come on.

476
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,680
It’s desolate here.

477
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,880
Fending off wind with magic
weakens the place’s power.

478
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,350
But we’ve walked a mile,

479
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,760
and we didn’t see one flower.

480
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,590
Are you fooling me around?

481
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,110
You have no idea.

482
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,190
The south of the demon land
is abundant with blooms.

483
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,680
But the most precious one

484
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,070
is Purple Woolly growing

485
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,560
on cliffs in the north.

486
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,880
Purple Woolly?

487
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,590
Yes.

488
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,950
It’s a prickly herb

489
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,000
that’s not easy to pick.

490
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,110
It implies the most beautiful blessings.

491
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,280
As for its character,

492
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,590
it’s aloof and condescending.

493
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,040
I’m eager to see it.

494
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,830
Lead the way.

495
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,190
I’ll pick some for Shanggu.

496
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,680
Aren’t you tired after walking

497
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,590
a mile away?

498
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,280
I can go another mile.

499
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,350
We’re almost there.

500
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,310
Help!

501
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Anybody?

502
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,520
Let’s take a look.

503
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,710
Help! Anybody?

504
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,950
Help!

505
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,680
Thank you, miss.

506
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
I’m Sen Jian, a tiger.

507
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,950
I wanted to pick this herb
on this spring day,

508
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,470
but I fell off the cliff.

509
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,520
Know how much you can chew
before you bite.

510
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,280
Don’t take such risks again.

511
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,950
Do you hear me?

512
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,400
I’ll keep it in mind.

513
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,470
Well,

514
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,110
we’ll have to go empty-handed.

515
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,400
What do you mean?

516
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,110
Is the herb

517
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,880
in his hands the one?

518
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,680
Forget it.

519
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,430
Shanggu has seen
all kinds of good stuff.

520
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,430
She’ll know

521
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,590
we care about her.

522
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,920
Let’s go back.

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,640
Goddess,

524
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,640
my mother told me,

525
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,710
we must do something in return
for others’ kindness.

526
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,590
Do you have any wishes yet to realize?

527
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,400
Give the herb to me then.

528
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,040
Are there any other things I can do?

529
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,000
I’ll complete it for you,

530
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,470
even it’s something dangerous.

531
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,760
But the herb...

532
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,400
I think you’re just saying

533
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
about doing something in return.

534
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,310
Let me explain.

535
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,590
My mother has been bed-ridden for years.

536
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,430
I can’t do anything for her

537
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,520
but to pick this herb

538
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
for blessing.

539
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,950
And I’m serious about

540
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,110
paying back.

541
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,470
Could you please tell me your name?

542
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,040
When I become a lord someday,

543
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,040
I’ll repay your favor.

544
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,800
You’re quite

545
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,560
an ambitious young tiger.

546
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,470
Goddess!

547
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,430
That boy is honest.

548
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,760
He has potential.

549
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,000
Do you want me to make him

550
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,830
your Divine Beast?

551
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,350
No.

552
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,430
I don’t want him to feel restrained.

553
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,520
Besides,

554
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,400
if I take him,

555
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,590
maybe I’ll be the one
who feel restrained.

556
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,520
And

557
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,190
I don’t want to be followed around

558
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,070
and called goddess.

559
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,350
I know you don’t.

560
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,230
Don’t worry.

561
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,470
That boy is a loving son.

562
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,230
I’ll ask Zihan to look after him.

563
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,280
You’re so wise.

564
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,880
I admire that.

565
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,430
Are you teasing me?

566
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,760
Well,

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,160
I’m going to the peach woods

568
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
and empty your wine jars
buried down the trees.

569
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,560
Don’t you dare?

570
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
I kept those for Shanggu.

571
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,160
Master, are you missing Goddess Yuemi?

572
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,070
Don’t blame yourself.

573
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,280
What happened then...

574
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,160
Don’t.

575
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
I’ll never do enough

576
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,280
to atone for my crime.

577
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,470
Miss her?

578
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,590
I don’t deserve to.

579
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,280
I just found

580
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,560
the moon so beautiful tonight

581
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,190
that I should

582
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,000
have a drink.

583
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,640
By the way, Master,

584
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,800
the scouts you sent out days ago

585
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,520
brought back a message.

586
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,350
They found a goddess

587
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:17,980
who resembles

588
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,760
Her Grace a lot at Mount Lookout.

589
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,640
However,

590
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,070
the only comparison is a portrait.

591
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
They can’t be sure.

592
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,110
Have they looked into her background?

593
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Rumors say she’s from Qingchi Palace.

594
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,470
Mount Lookout is in Bai Jue’s domain.

595
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,190
And Qingchi Palace is in Gu Jun’s.

596
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,880
Interesting.

597
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,040
Her Grace is blessed.

598
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,350
Even with the tribulation,

599
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,640
she will come through.

600
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,640
Perhaps we’ll find her in a few days.

601
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,800
Zihan,

602
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,590
thank you

603
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,040
for the last sixty thousand years.

604
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,350
I asked you to look for Shanggu

605
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,470
because of my stubborn belief.

606
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,830
Shanggu is the Chief God.

607
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,830
Even if her soul dispersed,

608
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,190
there have to be something left,
some traces.

609
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,710
Right.

610
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,560
As long as you maintain the belief,

611
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,430
Her Grace will come back to you.

612
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,520
Master,

613
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,590
I truly,

614
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,350
truly believe Her Grace is still alive.

615
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,590
Alright.

616
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,760
You’re right.

617
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,830
What do you mean?

618
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,590
Have you sensed her power?

619
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,520
No.

620
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,800
I met a girl who also

621
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,190
resembles Shanggu a lot today.

622
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,830
Moreover,

623
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,070
her companion is a man

624
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,800
who looks a lot like Bai Jue.

625
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,710
And now

626
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,110
they’re also in the Demon Realm.

627
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,520
Are you sure?

628
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,640
It coincides with your message.

629
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,430
The eclipse eases at night.

630
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,920
Shanggu,

631
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,190
will we meet again?

632
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,310
Houchi.

633
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,040
Houchi.

634
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,280
Houchi.

635
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,800
No.

636
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,470
No.

637
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,760
No.

638
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,710
No.

639
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,160
No!

640
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,420
<i>Pleasure House</i>

641
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,070
Jingjian, you get up.

642
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,560
What’s going on?

643
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,280
What else do you want?

644
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,560
Get out!

645
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,430
Forgive me.

646
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,470
I told you last night
I can’t drink much.

647
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,350
You urged me to drink.

648
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,040
In the end, we were both drunk.

649
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,110
I did that to...

650
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,800
To make me drunk

651
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,560
and get rid of me?

652
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,710
Yes, so what?

653
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,950
You knew I didn’t like you around me,

654
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,830
yet you had to stick with me.

655
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,350
You enjoy the leisure,

656
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,880
but I don’t have time for this.

657
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,190
To keep me with you,

658
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,880
you tied me up with the Magic Rope.

659
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,190
Now I see,

660
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,310
you immortals

661
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,760
from Heavenly Palace are all snakes.

662
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,640
Forgive me.

663
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,280
I was so drunk last night.

664
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,760
I don’t remember

665
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,280
tying you up with the Magic Rope.

666
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,640
I can swear

667
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,350
in the name of Heavenly Palace...

668
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,070
Save it.

669
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,760
Untie the rope.

670
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,400
The rope is my father’s halidom.

671
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,230
I can’t untie it.

672
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,040
What?

673
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,710
Show yourself!

674
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,760
Let me explain.

675
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,430
This halidom of my father’s

676
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,830
is forged by the essence

677
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,560
of plants in the East Wasteland,

678
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,470
the spirit of iron in the West Heaven,

679
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,470
the breath of flames in the South

680
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,430
and the core of ice in the North Sea,

681
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,280
by means of magic arts.

682
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,830
No one can break

683
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,760
or untie it.

684
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,560
Once tied,

685
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,310
it links two hearts for eternity.

686
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,760
Jingjian.

687
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,230
I shouldn’t have

688
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,830
drunk that much last night.

689
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,160
The demon maids are so thoughtful.

690
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,070
It’s you.

691
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,040
Where is Qingmu?

692
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,710
The demons love meat,

693
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,310
while the buns are vegan.

694
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Did

695
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
Qingmu make them for me?

696
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,040
Clever man.

697
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,680
Is he serious?

698
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,160
About the master and apprentice thing?

699
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,760
It feels so good to have an apprentice.

700
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,760
He wants me to wait here?

701
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,350
What is he up to?

702
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,920
When I finish breakfast,

703
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,470
go out with me for a walk.

704
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,640
Well, I’ll go on my own.

705
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,800
I don’t know if she likes the buns,

706
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,310
but I’m sure
she’ll like the peach ratafia.

707
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,110
Houchi.

708
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,400
Hou...

709
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,800
Where is she?

710
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,710
She left me out

711
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,670
and flied solo again.

712
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,710
Master,

713
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,710
that girl is one of the black foxes.

714
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,080
Her name is Beichi,

715
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,950
Elder Chang Mei’s disciple.

716
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,080
Did you see her face?

717
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Without your order,

718
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,190
I did not appear in front of her.

719
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,280
I showed the portrait

720
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,430
to a maid.

721
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,280
She also said

722
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Beichi resembles Her Grace a lot.

723
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,230
Beichi?

724
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,710
What about the man?

725
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,910
He’s her apprentice.

726
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,470
Apprentice?

727
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,670
A roan fox,

728
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,910
named Nanmu.

729
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,470
Beichi, Nanmu?

730
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,760
Must be their aliases.

731
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,710
Beichi went alone to Sen Yu’s banquet

732
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,080
last night.

733
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,000
Her apprentice had porridge
in his bedroom.

734
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,910
They’re playing a duet.

735
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,840
They must have known each other
for long.

736
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,670
Master,

737
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,950
are they after something in the palace

738
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,840
under the disguise of physicians?

739
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,670
After what?

740
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,910
They can’t be after me.

741
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,520
Master,

742
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,800
I don’t mean to put a damper,

743
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,710
but...

744
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,000
But you haven’t sensed

745
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,120
a tiny bit of their power till now?

746
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,230
Yes.

747
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,670
If they are Her Grace
and Master Bai Jue,

748
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,870
power should well up in Xuanjing Palace

749
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,520
right now.

750
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,560
Not to mention you,

751
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,280
even I

752
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,600
couldn’t sense any of their power.

753
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,040
But it can’t be a coincidence.

754
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,230
Do you have a plan?

755
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,560
Either they are or not,

756
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,520
we’ll prove it today.

757
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,540
Cheers!

758
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,950
I missed a hearty drink.

759
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,670
Let me be clear.

760
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,800
Sen Yu killed my brother.

761
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,280
You insist on going to Xuanjing Palace
with me.

762
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,560
If anything goes wrong,

763
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,800
don’t blame me.

764
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,760
Rest assured.

765
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,080
I’ll handle everything properly.

766
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,000
I’m curious

767
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
how you’re going to do that.

768
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,800
This truly is a great sword.

769
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,000
Sure.

770
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,150
I stole half of

771
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,000
my family treasures

772
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
to get this sword forged
by a master blacksmith.

773
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,360
It sure is one of the best.

774
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,430
Wouldn’t your brother take you back

775
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
to Mount Jingyou for stealing?

776
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,320
I left a letter for my brother.

777
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,520
I told him I’m getting married

778
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,800
and I’m not going back.

779
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,600
Qin,

780
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,470
you...

781
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,910
you accept my proposal?

782
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,760
Qin,

783
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,190
when I come back from the war,

784
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,430
we’ll get married.

785
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,040
Qin,

786
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
how did we

787
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,430
end up like this?

788
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,120
Your Highness,

789
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
are you thinking about Chang Qin again?

790
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,870
The fox physician is good at her trade.

791
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,150
You’ll be cured in a few days.

792
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,800
Then you can start cultivation

793
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,600
and regain a demon core.

794
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,840
Years of suffering is finally

795
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,390
coming to an end.

796
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,430
Your Highness,

797
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,470
do you really want me to go?

798
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,430
Why?

799
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,390
I remember what you did for me.

800
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,630
And I’ll repay your favors.

801
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,080
It’s heavily guarded.

802
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,910
My power is too weak

803
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,150
to push in.

804
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,360
But if I throw this chance away,

805
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,280
I might not

806
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,840
have another one to get to
Purple Moon Spring.
