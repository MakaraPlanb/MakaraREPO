=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,140
Hongri!

4
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,550
That is not Hongri.

5
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,870
But... How come?

6
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,470
It’s Hongri’s spiritual aura.

7
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,950
It’s just his remaining soul.

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,230
How dare you humble beings

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,230
intrude into the cultivation place
of True God

10
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,740
and offend him!

11
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,950
Leave immediately!

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,390
Your Lordship,

13
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,310
it’s not our intention to offend
True God Bai Jue.

14
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,350
The Taicang Spear’s reappearance

15
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,790
is crucial for all beings
of the Three Realms.

16
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,670
I’m here to take the Spear
for the Heavenly Palace.

17
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,900
Please do not stand in my way.

18
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,900
Imbecile!

19
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,990
The Taicang Spear
is the Weapon of True Gods,

20
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,670
which chooses its own master.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,420
Hearing rumors

22
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,990
that the Kylin reappeared,

23
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,900
I thought he was really alive.

24
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,670
The Fire Kylin and the Taicang Spear

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,830
will give me an answer to

26
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,380
whether Qingmu is Bai Jue or not.

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,060
Master,

28
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,460
you’re not here for the Spear,

29
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,780
but to...

30
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,950
They’re so foolish.

31
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,750
The Weapon of True Gods

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,460
is too much for the mediocre to handle.

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,220
Weapon of True Gods?

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,710
The Shanggu  God Realm
has been closed for years.

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,180
All realms bow to the Heavenly Palace.

36
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,710
Fire Kylin,

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,390
if you hand over the Taicang Spear,

38
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,580
I may spare your life,

39
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,180
so that you can live out
your last years here.

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,500
The daughter of a Gold Dragon
and a Phoenix,

41
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,180
mind your tongue!

42
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,670
You are by no means

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,670
the master of the Taicang Spear!

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,950
Have you found anything?

45
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,430
He’s not Boxuan.

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,750
It is you.

47
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,670
Sixty thousand years have passed.

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,260
The God Realm has gone,

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,350
while you’re still alive.

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,710
Oh no!

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,820
The Taicang Spear’s power is too much

52
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,950
for Qingmu’s spiritual veins.

53
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,860
He’ll be...

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,580
Houchi!

55
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,190
Are you all right?

56
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,190
Fengran,

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,390
we need to find a way

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,700
to separate him and the Spear,

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,700
or Qingmu’s body will explode.

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,580
But no one is more powerful

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
than that Spear.

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,910
How could we break them up?

63
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,910
Jingjian,

64
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,700
do something and help Qingmu.

65
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,910
If he dies,

66
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,060
I’ll not live alone in this world.

67
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
Qingmu is a close friend of mine.

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,030
I don’t want him to hurt, either.

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,780
But how can we suppress

70
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,140
such immense power?

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,550
Houchi, look.

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,140
Qingmu looks a little better.

73
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,470
The Spear is True God Bai Jue’s weapon.

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,500
The Kylin has been guarding it.

75
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,860
No one can come close to him

76
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,500
except True God Bai Jue himself.

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,910
Is Qingmu...?

78
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,940
The view remains the same,

79
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,940
but where are you,

80
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,380
Shanggu?

81
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,740
Hongri,

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,870
the God Realm is closed now.

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,430
I brought a piece of your soul here.

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,740
From now on,

85
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,940
please guard the Spear

86
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,630
and Mount Lookout for me.

87
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,380
I’m going to get her back.

88
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,820
Whether it’ll take tens

89
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,020
or hundreds of millions of years,

90
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,710
one day,

91
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,270
the God Realm will be restored.

92
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,590
And I

93
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,100
will find her.

94
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,380
Shanggu.

95
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,100
Master Bai Jue.

96
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,190
What’s going on?

97
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,500
Houchi,

98
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
what is he murmuring?

99
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,710
Something about the God Realm, I think.

100
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,990
Master,

101
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,060
why doesn’t this man

102
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,310
have Master Bai Jue’s memory?

103
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,380
The four of us were born with Heaven.

104
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,620
Even after death,

105
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,430
we’ll be reborn at
the Heaven and Earth Platform.

106
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,990
Were it waking up from a long nap,

107
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,100
he’d have the spiritual root inside.

108
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,750
There must be something else.

109
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,540
When the God Realm was closed,

110
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,990
how did he manage

111
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,310
to find himself an immortal lord’s body?

112
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,220
Look.

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,940
That cheeky man’s power darkens.

114
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,500
Is the Spear going to choose him?

115
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,990
Fellows,

116
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,310
if the Spear chooses a master,

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,590
we’ll have no chance to get it.

118
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,150
My lords,

119
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,470
we cannot allow

120
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,430
the demons to get the Spear.

121
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,030
Yes.

122
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,460
Jingzhao!

123
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,620
Then what should do now?

124
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,380
To fish in troubled water,

125
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,940
we must churn the pond first.

126
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,500
Only when Qingmu gets the Taicang Spear

127
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,380
can we have our answer.

128
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,460
Feather Umbrella!

129
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,060
Foolish beast!

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,820
Qingmu’s energy is restless in his body.

131
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
It must be

132
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,060
fusing with Taicang Spear’s power now.

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,940
He’s out of danger.

134
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,540
Fengran,

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
we need to protect Qingmu.

136
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,940
When he gets the Taicang Spear

137
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,940
and wakes up,

138
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
let’s get him away as fast as we can.

139
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,260
Whoever is your concern,

140
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,500
I won’t let any harm get near him.

141
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,100
I’m not concerned about him.

142
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,860
He did me a favor.

143
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,220
I just want to help.

144
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,380
But if we help him,

145
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,460
our Qingchi Palace

146
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,060
will be unable to stay neutral anymore.

147
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,100
No time to worry about that.

148
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,860
Let’s just protect him.

149
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,860
It’s time

150
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,370
to remind them what we can do.

151
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,100
Jingzhao!

152
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,740
You dare hurt me, beast?

153
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,540
I’ll knock your soul out.

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,380
Jingzhao,

155
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,540
the Kylin is tough.

156
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
We’re no match for it.

157
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,540
Don’t worry, Jingjian.

158
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,180
I have Mother’s Feather Umbrella.

159
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,100
It’s invincible.

160
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,140
Jingzhao!

161
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,260
Jingjian.

162
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,020
Master, this is the end for me.

163
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,940
I failed you.

164
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Forgive me.

165
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,500
Who did it?

166
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
Demons and immortals

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,660
made a tremor fighting for the Spear.

168
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,260
It’s not them.

169
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,140
Your Majesty?

170
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,740
True God’s power can rock the earth.

171
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,020
That was True God’s power.

172
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,620
Houchi, why don’t you feel the impact?

173
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,940
You’re powerful, Goddess!

174
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,540
Please protect me.

175
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,380
Qingmu,

176
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,380
the Spear has chosen you as its master.

177
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,780
Soon, you’ll become a God.

178
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,820
It took me a lot of effort

179
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,460
to deal with the Fire Kylin for you.

180
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,900
Jingzhao, stop!

181
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,140
You intruded into my retreat

182
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,140
and killed my guarding beast.

183
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,700
Unpardonable.

184
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,900
Jingzhao!

185
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,540
He must be a piece of soul

186
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,260
to converse with Qingmu subconsciously.

187
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
But he’s still too strong

188
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,900
to be provoked.

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,140
I have to risk it.

190
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,740
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

I’m back.

Are you hurt?

197
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,470
Do you know me?

198
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,950
Do I know you?

199
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,350
We’re friends as old

200
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,390
as the sun, the moon, and the earth.

201
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,590

I’m an irresponsible father.

207
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,550
It’s my children’s fault
to hurt Hongri’s soul.

208

the Taicang Spear has chosen its master.

226

This is over.

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
Go back to your retreat, my lords.

228
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,360
As for the demons,

229
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
you cannot stay in the Immortal Realm.

230
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,560
Yes.

231
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
Jingjian, take Jingzhao back.

232
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,520
Yes, Father.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,680
Your Majesty,

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,520
is Lord Qingmu...?

235
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,160
He doesn’t have

236
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Master Bai Jue’s spiritual root.

237
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
Just someone who looks like him.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
The last time we met,

239
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,480
you were still a little girl.

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,800
I can’t believe you’re already a lady.

241
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,680
When your father comes back,

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
he’ll be delighted.

243
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,520
I got gifts from the Heavenly Palace

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
on each ten-thousand-year birthday.

245
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
It’s not that hard to believe.

246
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,680
What Your Majesty said is pointless.

247
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,800
And,

248
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,040
my father’s reaction

249
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
has nothing to do
with the Heavenly Palace.

250
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Houchi.

251
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,000
It’s your mother’s birthday
in a few days.

252
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,200
Now that you’re out of
the Qingchi Palace,

253
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,320
why not come to

254
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,560
her birthday party
at the Heavenly Palace?

255
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,200
No, thanks.

256
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,240
I don’t have a mother.

257
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,840
All right.

258
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
When your father comes back,

259
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
I’ll pay a visit to the Qingchi Palace.

260
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
My father is nowhere to find.

261
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
He won’t stay long even if he is back.

262
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
I’m afraid you won’t see him.

263
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
The conflict with demons has lasted
for sixty thousand years.

264
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Now all I want is a truce.

265
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,560
If only I listened to your father then.

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,680
Now it’s almost impossible

267
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
to restore peace between us.

268
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,320
I’ll tell my father you said that.

269
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,160
Let’s go, Fengran.

270
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,960
Master,

271
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
now that we’re sure

272
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Qingmu is Master Bai Jue,

273
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,560
shall we remove him from existence

274
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
for what he did?

275
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,280
When did I ever say

276
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,680
I want him dead?

277
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
It has been a pet phrase

278
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,360
since you woke up.

279
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,320
You said it days ago

280
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,480
and wrote it down.

281
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
I have the note with me.

282
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,440
All right, stop.

283
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
I do hate Bai Jue,

284
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,680
for not trusting me back then

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,320
and drawing his spear against me.

286
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,120
For that,

287
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,160
I will make him pay sooner or later.

288
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Generous and kind?

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
I’m all that.

290
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,960
Surely to meet Houchi

291
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,520
at the Qingchi Palace

292
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,400
and make her fall in love with me again.

293
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,480
Master, what are you looking at?

294
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
I’m admiring Mount Lookout.

295
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,360
In the past,

296
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Master Bai Jue chose to guide immortals

297
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
at Mount Lookout

298
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,000
for its picturesque view.

299
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,320
Breeze rising from the valley

300
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,200
disperses all your sorrow.

301
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
It’s a shame

302
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,440
that such tranquility won’t last long.

303
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Master,

304
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
Master Bai Jue’s soul is dispersed.

305
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,840
But Mount Lookout is intact,

306
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,720
and full of power and energy.

307
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,200
Why the deep concern?

308
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Fengran, I don’t understand.

309
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Why is his breath so weak?

310
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,480
His wound was not healed before.

311
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,800
Fusing with the Taicang Spear damages
his spiritual sense.

312
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,160
I’m not curious about his condition.

313
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,680
This is North Sea Lord, Qingmu?

314
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,280
Chang Que,

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,240
go fetch some medicine

316
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
that strengthens souls.

317
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,400
It has to be vintage.

318
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
It’s a god’s wound.

319
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
Ordinary medicine won’t work.

320
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,680
What are you waiting for? Go!

321
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,800
Your Grace,

322
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,040
Qingmu is from the Heavenly Palace.

323
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
Let’s leave him be.

324
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,600
Besides, God Gu Jun would be

325
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,400
unhappy if he found out.

326
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,040
Chang Que,

327
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,400
you’re so noisy.

328
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
Don’t you listen to Her Grace now?

329
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,240
Houchi,

330
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,200
keep an eye on him.

331
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,960
I’ll fetch the medicine for you.

332
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Come, Chang Que.

333
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
A thousand years ago,

334
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,880
I woke up at the North Sea,

335
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,920
with no idea who I am.

336
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
All I found with me is a bracelet.

337
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Nothing else.

338
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I began to travel around,

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,120
trying to find out who I am.

340
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
But I hate to be in others’ debt.

341
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,680
I’m used to those condemnations.

342
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
In the future, don’t bother...

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,760
But I care.

344
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
It hurts me when you’re condemned

345
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,320
and bullied by others.

346
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,320
It hurts me you pretend nothing happens

347
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,400
when you’re obviously upset.

348
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,160
As long as I’m by your side,

349
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,720
I will make it right for you.

350
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,360
Because I...

351
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,240
I have lost my heart to someone.

352
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,480
You were wounded because of me,

353
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,480
so I won’t sit by.

354
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,000
Rest assured.

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,760
The Qingchi Palace will keep you safe.

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,760
Lady Fengran.

357
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
He claimed the Taicang Spear.

358
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
Trouble around him is yet to come.

359
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,720
If we keep him here
at the Qingchi Palace,

360
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
we’ll undoubtedly get involved.

361
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,360
All right, Chang Que,

362
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,760
you know Houchi’s personality.

363
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
Would someone as cautious as her

364
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,320
neglect that?

365
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
And she insists to save him.

366
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,920
You know what it means?

367
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,760
What?

368
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,920
It means

369
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
soon

370
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
Lord Qingmu will probably

371
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,920
become a family.

372
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,920
But he’s tens of thousands of years
younger than her.

373
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,440
The most beautiful love

374
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
is always regarded
as impossible at first.

375
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,920
You see how Houchi is worried about him.

376
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,680
Anyone who has a brain can see it.

377
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,760
She just hasn’t found out herself.

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,680
But it’s still up in the air.

379
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,400
Lady Fengran,

380
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,160
how can you be so sure?

381
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
We’ll see.

382
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
So much sweat.

383
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,920
Looks like Chang Que’s medicine
is working.

384
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
It’s stuffy in the room.

385
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I should open the windows.

386
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,160
Do I know you?

387
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
We’re friends as old

388
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
as the sun, the moon, and the earth.

389
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,080
I’ve never forgotten you for a second.

390
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,160
Master Bai Jue possessed Qingmu

391
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
for the Taicang Spear.

392
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,640
But he said he knew me.

393
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,240
I don’t understand.

394
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
Boxuan has a lot of bamboo slips
missing from the God Realm.

395
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,680
I should skim through.

396
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
I came by sunrise. Now the moon is up.

397
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
What took you so long?

398
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
Demon Lord Ziyue?

399
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,640
What are you doing here?

400
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,760
I miss you.

401
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
So I came by.

402
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Father set God’s barriers
around the Qingchi Palace.

403
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,840
He can get through with ease.

404
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
So he must be more powerful than Father.

405
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,480
What’s in your mind?

406
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,160
Wait.

407
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,240
Let me guess.

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,520
You saw so much at Mount Lookout today

409
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,000
and heard Bai Jue call you Shanggu.

410
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,440
So right now,

411
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,960
you must be confused.

412
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,240
How do you...?

413
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
How do I know he called you Shanggu?

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Think about it.

415
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,520
What did I call you that day

416
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,440
by the Purple Moon Spring?

417
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Shanggu,

418
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
I finally found you!

419
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,160
Shanggu.

420
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,000
Exactly.

421
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,720
I came today

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,160
to tell you everything.

423
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Good for you, Houchi.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
Even Demon Lord Ziyue falls for you.

425
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
Sadly, he’s one of the demons,

426
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,600
and has a connection
with the Demon King,

427
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
unlike Qingmu

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,200
who’s neither a demon nor an immortal,
clean and clear.

429
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
What’s wrong with Demon Lord Ziyue?

430
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,600
He’s powerful

431
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
and has all demons on his back.

432
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,720
Lord Qingmu is nothing for him.

433
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,520
Who are you?

434
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,320
When did you get in?

435
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,080
I’m Zihan.

436
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,120
I came with Demon Lord Ziyue

437
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,160
and ran into

438
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
His Lordship woos the young Goddess.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,040
I can’t miss this.

440
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,040
Likewise. I’m Fengran.

441
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,160
Hold on.

442
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,120
You’re on the Demon Lord’s side.

443
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
We’ll not be allies.

444
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,280
I don’t know a gossiping girl

445
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,360
can be so faithful to principles.

446
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,280
That’s for sure.

447
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,000
Your Majesty,

448
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,600
it was so imprudent of North Sea Lord

449
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
to have hurt Jingzhao so severely.

450
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,720
Why did you let him go unpunished

451
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,400
and take refuge in the Qingchi Palace?

452
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,720
What do you suggest we do about him?

453
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,360
The one who hurt Jingzhao

454
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,920
is Master Bai Jue,

455
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
not Qingmu.

456
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,080
Moreover,

457
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,320
the Taicang Spear has chosen Qingmu
as its master.

458
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
We can’t punish him.

459
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,280
Master Bai Jue?

460
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,920
No one has heard from him

461
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
since the God Realm was closed.

462
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,640
Qingmu has no parents

463
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,640
and no root.

464
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,400
Is Master Bai Jue

465
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,800
somehow related to Qingmu?

466
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
I supposed so.

467
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
But I tried to find
his spiritual sense today.

468
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,960
No sign of the Master’s spirit
or original being.

469
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Just a piece of soul
attached to the Taicang Spear,

470
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,360
I guess.

471
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,760
You should have taken him back here.

472
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,520
If he pledges allegiance
to the Qingchi Palace,

473
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,280
we’ll lose the upper hand.

474
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,400
Your worry is unnecessary.

475
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,760
Qingmu has been used to
the solitary life.

476
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
He won’t be drawn in easily.

477
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,040
Your Majesty.

478
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
All right.

479
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,640
Whether Qingmu is Master Bai Jue or not,

480
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
I’ll treat him with respect.

481
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,560
I found Jingzhao is unusually
good to him.

482
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
It’s a good thing.

483
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,920
Let’s keep our hands off it.

484
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,040
Right, Your Majesty.

485
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,960
Don’t go.

486
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,200
What are you doing?

487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,560
Shanggu!

488
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,640
Don’t go!

489
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,880
Don’t.

490
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,040
Shanggu, don’t, please!

491
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Don’t go.

492
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,120
Don’t go!

493
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,720
Shanggu!

494
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,480
I forced you to become the Chief God

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,920
and led you to the abyss of hell.

496
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,920
Bai Jue,

497
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,160
the Three Realms

498
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
are your responsibility now.

499
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,400
Shanggu.

500
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,280
Shanggu!

501
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,680
This is the Qingchi Palace.

502
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,120
Houchi.

503
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,640
Your Lordship,

504
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,160
are you saying

505
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,360
that I was...?

506
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes.

507
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,280
You were the Chief Goddess of Gods,

508
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,840
Master Shanggu.

509
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,960
Well, her maid actually.

510
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,400
I know

511
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
it sounds absurd to you.

512
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,080
But every word I said is true.

513
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,720
Houchi,

514
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,720
you’re the love bird I’ve been
searching over the years.

515
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
And that rascal, Qingmu,

516
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
is the one

517
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,120
who separated us in the last life.

518
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,400
No wonder.

519
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,560
I was wondering

520
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,320
why we were tangled up.

521
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,320
That is the reason.

522
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,480
As a result,

523
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
you cannot be with him.

524
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,200
You don’t remember.

525
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,440
In the last life,

526
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
he was far more hideous.

527
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
His love to you was unrequited,

528
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
so he turned evil

529
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,360
and set me up.

530
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,960
And you,

531
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
deeply in love with me,

532
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,480
killed yourself.

533
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,160
So in this life,

534
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
I swore I’d find you whatever it takes

535
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,680
and revenge the harm he did to me.

536
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,160
Your Lordship, stop.

537
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,520
I must be crazily bored

538
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,040
to have listened to your story.

539
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,360
Your Lordship should go.

540
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,560
Our Qingchi Palace is too humble

541
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,680
to host an honorable guest like you.

542
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,920
You don’t believe me?

543
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,680
Come on, try it.

544
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
What do you mean?

545
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,560
Kiss me.

546
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,840
Trust me.

547
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,320
When you kiss me,

548
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,880
you’ll feel the same heartbeat

549
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,200
you had in the previous life.

550
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,080
Maybe you’ll remember more.

551
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Your Lordship!

552
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
Don’t call me lord.

553
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,600
It’s Jingyuan to you.

554
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,080
This is the Qingchi Palace.

555
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,480
Mind your manners.

556
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Are you feeling shy?

557
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,440
All right.

558
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,360
Then a hug.

559
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,400
I’m a handsome man.

560
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,160
I don’t mind you take advantage of me.

561
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,710
You...!

562
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,880
Qingmu, you’re awake.

563
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,440
It’s cold at night. Don’t catch a cold.

564
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,640
It’s ill-mannered to visit at night

565
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,000
without invitation.

566
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Please go.

567
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,360
Who is this?

568
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,680
It’s Lord Qingmu

569
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,520
who was wounded during the day.

570
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,400
If I’m right,

571
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,680
you have nothing to do
with the Qingchi Palace.

572
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,520
I can come and go whenever I want.

573
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,400
It’s not your place to interfere.

574
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,800
A demon intruded the immortals’ domain.

575
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
Sure it is my place to step in.

576
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
Since you know who I am,

577
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,920
leave immediately.

578
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
If you harass Houchi again,

579
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,320
we will exchange more than words.

580
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,320
Show me

581
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
what you’re going to do.

582
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
Are you sure you want to fight me?

583
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,800
Good.

584
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,280
I just got the Taicang Spear.

585
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,720
Let me try it.

586
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,560
A worthless spear.

587
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,800
I also have a weapon.

588
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,880
Let’s fight.

589
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,000
Save your nonsense.

590
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,080
Are you done?

591
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,240
One of you is a gate-crasher,

592
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,240
and the other a wounded man.

593
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
This is the Qingchi Palace,

594
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,600
where your recklessness is not allowed.

595
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,640
As for you

596
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,320
who just survived death,

597
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,360
stop making a scene.

598
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,960
Did you hear her?

599
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,360
Without her protection at Mt. Lookout,

600
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,680
your life would have been gone.

601
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Grow up, boy.

602
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,280
To be my rival in love,

603
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,640
you need tens of thousands
of cultivation to fill up.

604
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,080
Your Lordship, will you be quiet?

605
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,730
Look,

606
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
my lord is marvelous.

607
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,720
Lord Qingmu is sulky.

608
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
I can’t agree with you.

609
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
He’s like an obedient servant

610
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,840
in front of Houchi.

611
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,200
I think he has a long way to go

612
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,040
to defeat Qingmu.

613
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,400
Your Lordship,

614
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,680
I have to ask you to leave.

615
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,000
We’re occupied at the Qingchi Palace.

616
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,760
Excuse me.

617
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,080
All right.

618
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
I’ll drop by in a few days.

619
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,560
Let’s go out for some liquor and views.

620
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
Since my birth at
the Heaven and Earth Platform,

621
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,360
I’ve never taken an upper hand over him.

622
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
His sulky face makes me feel

623
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
amused.

624
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,320
Good.

625
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,440
Why did you get away so fast?

626
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,200
Whatever I do for you is worthless

627
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
compared with sweet talks.

628
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Why should I get in your way?

629
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,920
He’s a demon

630
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
and a powerful one.

631
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,200
I have to treat him with respect.

632
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,840
Why did you start a fight with him?

633
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
Do you think I want that?

634
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,880
I was just...

635
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,400
What?

636
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,600
Worried that you’re unwary

637
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,640
and would fall into his trap.

638
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
We didn’t meet for long,

639
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
but I can tell if he’s honest with me.

640
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,240
He’s nothing like that.

641
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,240
Yes.

642
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,400
You’re grateful to anyone else but me.

643
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
It’s so hard for me to get close to you.

644
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,840
If you don’t like what I did,

645
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,960
I should go.

646
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,630
You...

647
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,960
You’re wounded badly.

648
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,880
Where are you going?

649
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
To the North Sea.

650
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,320
To the Heavenly Palace.

651
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,720
Did I owe you in the previous life?

652
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
Do you think I want that?

653
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,560
I was just...

654
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,200
What?

655
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,600
Worried that you’re unwary

656
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,680
and would fall into his trap.

657
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,560
You’re grateful to anyone else but me.

658
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,560
It’s so hard for me to get close to you.

659
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,580
Where are you going?

660
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,520
It’s not a good day.

661
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,840
No training for today.

662
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,600
Your Grace, you’re working hard.

663
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
It’s not like that.

664
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,080
I understand.

665
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
These are...?

666
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,640
These are the finest dresses
I can find for you.

667
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,120
Pick your favorite.

668
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
As a Goddess,

669
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,680
you have no style at all.

670
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,640
That’s unacceptable.

671
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,760
You should know
both demons and immortals

672
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,800
care about females’ appearance.

673
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,400
Look if you like any.

674
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,240
Take them.

675
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,200
I don’t mind.

676
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,360
Am I ugly?

677
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,440
I won’t say ugly,

678
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
just a little sloppy.

679
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,200
Compared with Jingzhao?

680
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,960
You and she are two different types.

681
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,000
But there’s one thing in you

682
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,680
she doesn’t have.

683
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,440
Your tolerance and generosity.

684
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,160
She’s nothing of that.

685
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,600
Don’t compare me with her.

686
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,840
You asked about it.

687
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,000
Did you have to answer?

688
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,440
As the chief of Qingchi Palace,

689
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,440
you put so much effort

690
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,080
in shallow stuff instead of cultivation.

691
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,240
How could you make any progress?

692
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,560
These dresses are forfeited.

693
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,520
Reflect on your behaviors.

694
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,280
I...

695
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,440
Unbelievable woman.

696
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,600
Wait for me.

697
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,200
(Always Acquire New Knowledge)
Will it work?

698
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,080
All right. By your words.

699
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,690
Do it.

700
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It’s my fault.

701
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,200
I’m sorry.

702
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,960
I shouldn’t have made Houchi angry.

703
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,160
I shouldn’t have been jealous.

704
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,080
My fault.

705
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,160
Stop slapping me.

706
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
Even if... you didn’t punish me,

707
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I’d punish myself.

708
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,080
It’s my fault.

709
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,800
I’ve learned the lesson

710
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,600
and won’t make the same mistakes again.

711
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Forgive me.

712
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,680
You don’t have to do that. I’ll...

713
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,960
Punish yourself to win my sympathy?

714
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,400
Will you try harder?

715
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,200
Does the wound pain again?

716
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,600
No.

717
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,320
Houchi,

718
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,040
I’m here to apologize to you.

719
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,680
I accept your apology.

720
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,800
You forgive me?

721
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,640
I am not angry with you at all.

722
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,560
You’re gorgeous today.

723
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,960
Where are you going?

724
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
I invited Her Grace to go out for liquor

725
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
in this spring day.

726
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
You again?

727
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,080
That’s impossible.

728
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,520
Houchi wouldn’t go on a spring outing
with you.

729
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,680
You don’t believe it?

730
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,960
Ask her.

731
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,520
It’s such a good day.

732
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,200
I’d like to go out with you two.

733
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,880
You can’t.

734
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,200
Why not?

735
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,440
Your body is weak.

736
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,200
And you can’t drink.

737
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,960
You’re dazzling today, Your Grace.

738
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
You remind me of an old friend.

739
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,680
Houchi,

740
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,640
don’t go out with this despicable man.

741
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
What’s that smell? The sour of jealousy.

742
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,200
How annoying!

743
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,560
The Qingchi Palace
has always been neutral.

744
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,800
As a demon, Lord Ziyue,

745
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,440
you should keep your distance from us.

746
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
If we’re found out together,

747
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,560
it’ll be regarded as
colluding with demons.

748
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,240
It’s well known that the Qingchi Palace
is independent of the Heavenly Palace.

749
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,840
And you were conferred
by the Heavenly Palace.

750
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,840
So you’re no better than me.

751
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,880
You...!

752
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,200
What are you doing?

753
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,200
Let go of me!

754
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,240
- Your Lordship,
- Let go...

755
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,040
the feast is ready.

756
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,560
Please.

757
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,220
After you.

758
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,200
Houchi.

759
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,920
Houchi, you can’t go with him.

760
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,080
Houchi!

761
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,560
Jingyuan, let me go!

762
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Jingyuan!

763
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,200
You’re happy

764
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,120
that he’s jealous?

765
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,880
I’m not.

766
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,240
The fruit and snacks are all delicious.

767
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,960
Try some.

768
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,560
You dressed up like this

769
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
to impress him, right?

770
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,680
You’ve seen a lot of men.

771
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Do you know a man called Boxuan?

772
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,880
Is that why you agreed

773
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,240
to come out with me?

774
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,160
Boxuan?

775
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,200
You asked about him
at the Purple Moon Spring.

776
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,640
You went to Mount Lookout

777
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,680
and found my fan there?

778
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,560
Yes.

779
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,680
What does Boxuan have to do
with the bamboo hut?

780
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
When I was little,

781
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,240
he often took me there for fun.

782
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,000
Thousands of years ago,

783
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,920
I went there for I missed a friend.

784
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,680
I was drunk

785
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,560
and spent the night over there,

786
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,200
where I lost my fan.

787
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,360
That led you to me.

788
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,040
But I don’t know

789
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,960
a man called Boxuan.

790
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,680
I’d been retreating in the palace
for years

791
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,800
and know little about the new lords

792
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,040
of demons or immortals

793
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,040
over the years.

794
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,520
Did anyone live

795
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
in the bamboo hut
thousands of years ago?

796
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,600
It’s messy.

797
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,600
It probably has been deserted
for tens of thousands of years.

798
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,400
Who is Boxuan to you?

799
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,440
Family.

800
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,240
What about Qingmu?

801
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,760
Please do not make such jokes.

802
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,240
That fool

803
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,360
is still locked in the barrier.

804
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,920
Please set him free.

805
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,000
Let’s split up.

806
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
The Taicang Spear is a weapon
from the Shanggu Realm.

807
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,920
And it chose Qingmu as its master.

808
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,160
I don’t think

809
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,280
it’s simply a coincidence.

810
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,280
I don’t want to hear

811
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
or talk about that man.

812
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,040
Houchi,

813
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,320
I didn’t ask you out

814
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,160
to hear these things from you.

815
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,880
Have you thought about being with me?

816
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,680
If you are with me,

817
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,280
I’ll make you the master of Demon Realm.

818
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,360
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

819
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,760
I wanted to tell you long ago.

820
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Haven’t you ever

821
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,120
noticed my feelings for you?

822
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,200
Your Lordship...

823
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Call me Jingyuan.

824
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,360
Your Lordship,

825
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,960
I’ll take that

826
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,120
as your joke with me.

827
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,040
I’m nothing special,

828
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,200
not powerful,

829
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,160
not pretty,

830
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
and bad-tempered.

831
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,280
Except for the undeserved
title of Goddess,

832
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,440
I’m not special at all.

833
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,520
Yet you keep making advances to me.

834
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
Why?

835
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,360
Who said you were not special?

836
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,320
Instead of asking about this,

837
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,320
why don’t you ask

838
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,080
who doesn’t say that about me

839
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,320
in the Three Realms?

840
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,560
Allow me to remind you that

841
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,720
both immortals and demons
value strength.

842
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,120
I’m not good enough for you.

843
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,360
