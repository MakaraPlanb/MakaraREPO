Don’t get hurt.

193
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,540
I’m a retired old man

194
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,460
and I don’t need cultivation.

195
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,660
It doesn’t matter if I get hurt.

196
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Did you come

197
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,780
because I did something wrong

198
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,780
with my duties?

199
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,220
Not that.

200
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,100
Since I woke up,

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,540
I’ve been feeling the happiest

202
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,220
when you’re taking over the affairs.

203
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Then what’s for?

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,460
For Yuanqi.

205
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,340
He’s naughty,

206
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,780
just like Shanggu.

207
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,660
But as the old saying goes,

208
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,540
a naughty boy is good

209
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,140
and a naughty girl is smart.

210
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,100
He isn’t commonly naughty.

211
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,900
He uses his peach wood sword every day,

212
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,420
running about.

213
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,020
He practices the Power of Chaos

214
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,100
and he’s smart.

215
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,340
He learns spells so quickly.

216
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,300
I’m too old

217
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,340
to beat him

218
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,460
or scold him.

219
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,020
I want to teach him, but I really can’t.

220
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,100
Who do you think

221
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,660
can be his master?

222
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,340
I’ve been asleep in the God Realm
for sixty thousand years.

223
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,220
I don’t know much
about the present Three Realms.

224
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,780
There’s a bright young immortal,

225
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,340
named Donghua.

226
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,420
Donghua?

227
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,220
Jiaye said he was a very strict teacher,

228
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,020
just like Bai Jue.

229
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,100
Is that true?

230
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,540
He’s far worse.

231
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,700
He’s a strict teacher,

232
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,540
but he isn’t even a God yet.

233
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
He can’t be compared to Ice Cube.

234
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,860
If he were still here,

235
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,660
that would be great.

236
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,100
It’s been a long time.

237
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,460
Take Yuanqi to see her.

238
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,660
All right.

239
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,340
Since your father left,

240
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,780
the God of Fire has been absent.

241
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,980
The whirling snow

242
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,700
has never stopped.

243
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,900
Uncle Zhiyang,

244
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,660
when will we have

245
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,460
the new God of Fire?

246
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,420
Maybe in a short time.

247
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,900
Maybe in a long time.

248
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,020
In this world,

249
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,780
on the Heaven and Earth Platform,

250
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
there will be a new God of Fire.

251
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,780
Shanggu.

252
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,100
Mother.

253
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,900
What brings you here?

254
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
Time to let Yuanqi learn
to manage the Three Realms.

255
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,900
Mother.

256
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,900
Good boy.

257
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,900
Yuanqi misses you, too.

258
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
It’s better for him to live with you

259
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,340
than live with me here.

260
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,780
Shanggu,

261
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,540
you’ve been staying here
for three years.

262
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
When the Original Being is gone,

263
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,780
he can hardly come back to life.

264
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,900
I know you’re sad.

265
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,660
But it took him sixty thousand years

266
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,540
to keep you alive.

267
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,540
But you’re stuck in sadness every day.

268
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,420
All right, Zhiyang.

269
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
I just want to be idle

270
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,020
and haven’t worked for three years.

271
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,860
Anyway, take over the job for me.

272
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
You look more like the Chief God.

273
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,340
I’ll leave the Three Realms to you.

274
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,020
Fengran is entertaining everyone
in the Parasol Forest.

275
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,860
If you feel bored, you can go see her.

276
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,100
Bai Jue doesn’t want
to see you like this.

277
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,340
Otherwise,
in the past sixty thousand years,

278
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,020
he needn’t have kept so much from you.

279
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,980
Gods live quite a long time.

280
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,340
Time to let it go.

281
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Yuanqi, let’s go.

282
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,540
Uncle Zhiyang,

283
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,660
will mother never come back
to the God Realm?

284
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,700
Give her more time.

285
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,540
After she figures it out,

286
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,340
she’ll be back to you.

287
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,540
Uncle Zhiyang,

288
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,660
will my father come back?

289
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,340
No matter when he can come back,

290
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,660
you must remember him

291
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,460
and then he won’t disappear.

292
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,140
Your father has an indomitable spirit.

293
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,900
He wants you to be like him.

294
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,020
The responsibility for the world

295
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,860
will be passed onto you sooner or later.

296
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,100
You have pure god power,

297
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,580
but you don’t have a solid foundation.

298
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
You must keep practicing.

299
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,340
Understand?

300
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
I do.

301
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,780
In a few years

302
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,660
when Donghua becomes a God,

303
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,100
I’ll send you to him

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,420
and be one of his registered disciples.

305
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
After you learn some skills,

306
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,580
come back to your mother again.

307
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,600
Yuanqi,

308
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,280
will you bear the hardships?

309
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,520
I will.

310
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,380
Let’s go.

311
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
The Three Realms are in peace.

312
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,980
In this world,

313
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,700
I can trust no one,

314
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,740
but you.

315
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,740
So,

316
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
if you can stay,

317
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,820
I won’t embarrass you again
by proposing to you.

318
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,980
I will...

319
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,820
We grew up in Xuanjing Palace.

320
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,100
The world is very big.

321
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,820
I haven’t visited other places yet.

322
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,700
According to Goddess Shanggu,

323
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,740
immortals and Gods

324
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,620
should make contributions
to the Three Realms.

325
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,860
So, I want to visit the Human Realm.

326
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,220
I’d like to travel around

327
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,820
and see what contributions I can make.

328
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,500
Then...

329
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,620
After you leave,

330
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,020
will you come back?

331
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,220
Maybe yes.

332
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,700
Maybe no.

333
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,860
When we miss something,

334
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,340
we miss it forever.

335
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,620
However,

336
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,860
it’s also perfection for us.

337
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,340
Perhaps,

338
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I should let it go.

339
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,620
Future is unpredictable.

340
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Take care, Your Majesty.

341
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,740
Who are you?

342
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,620
How dare you break
into the Pilgrimage Hall?

343
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,860
Where’s Muguang?

344
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,020
Why isn’t he coming today?

345
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,980
Flowers in Taoyuan Forest are blooming.

346
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,860
If he still doesn’t come,

347
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,580
the flowers

348
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,620
will fade.

349
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,340
Mother,

350
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,620
Father is here.

351
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,620
He’s always with us.

352
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,100
The new Heavenly Queen keeps staying
in the Parasol Forest,

353
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,620
instead of handling things
in the Heavenly Palace.

354
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,340
We can’t report to her

355
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,500
unless we submit the invitation card.

356
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,220
It’s of much trouble.

357
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,460
Be contented.

358
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Now the Three Realms are in peace

359
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,980
without wars
between immortals and demons.

360
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,100
Isn’t it much better

361
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,620
than the fights a few years ago?

362
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,620
I simply want

363
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,260
to cultivate myself in my place

364
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,340
and become a God as soon as possible

365
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,980
so that I can visit the God Realm

366
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,980
before I die.

367
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Greetings, Goddess Shanggu.

368
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,580
You may rise.

369
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,580
How did we

370
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,100
offend Qingtian?

371
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,020
There’re so many gods.

372
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,860
Why did we pick those two men

373
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,460
and have such miserable love?

374
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,620
Good point.

375
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,980
In a couple of days,

376
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,820
shall I ask Puhua to hold a Dating Event

377
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,340
and play matchmaker for us again?

378
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,740
You sound real.

379
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,860
What? Do you dare?

380
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,620
I don’t. Do you?

381
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,860
I certainly do.

382
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,620
I can’t waste all my time

383
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
on a heartless phoenix.

384
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,340
They’re both heartless men.

385
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,580
Jingjian is a bit better than Bai Jue.

386
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
At least, he doesn’t want
to leave you alone.

387
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,220
But he still disappeared.

388
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,500
Shanggu, you mean?

389
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,860
I’ve lived quite a long life.

390
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,020
I’ve never seen anyone

391
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,220
who had a chance to live
after using the dismemberment.

392
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,340
But for you,

393
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,100
Jingjian made it.

394
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,340
Shanggu,

395
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,980
don’t fool me.

396
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,460
I just met a young man
from the Feng Clan.

397
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,740
In his body,

398
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,620
I saw Jingjian’s sense.

399
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,020
Which one? Tell me.

400
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,740
I can’t tell the secret.

401
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,100
Shanggu!

402
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,260
Now that Jingjian managed
to raise his sense

403
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,620
in someone else’s body,

404
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,580
he’ll have his way to rebuild a body.

405
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,260
You’re impatient.

406
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,580
I’m afraid you’ll interfere
with his plan.

407
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,580
You’d better wait patiently.

408
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,340
Shanggu, tell me!

409
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Which is him?

410
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,860
He will tell you in person.

411
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,180
(Moon Hall)

412
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,340
Oh my God!

413
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,500
Goddess Yuemi has hidden
so many jars of good wine

414
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,980
in her yard.

415
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,380
“It’s made of peach blossoms
during our first meeting.”

416
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,300
(It’s made of peach blossoms
during our first meeting.)

417
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,340
I’ve hidden a lot of wine in my yard.

418
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,860
If you have time
to go back to the God Realm,

419
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,620
drink it for me.

420
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,620
“It’s made of ice and snow
during our cultivation.”

421
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,940
Master Tianqi,

422
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,740
what does the words

423
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,580
that Goddess Yuemi wrote mean?

424
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,700
Master Tianqi?

425
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,940
Hongri,

426
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,340
get the wine out

427
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,500
and deliver it to Zhiyang.

428
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,340
You don’t leave any to yourself?

429
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,500
I’ll give up drinking.

430
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,580
Give up drinking?

431
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,700
I owe too much to Yuemi

432
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,140
and I can never repay her.

433
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,500
I’d rather abandon all my feelings

434
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,140
from this day on,

435
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,620
and never love anyone.

436
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
If Jingjian can come back to life,

437
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,740
maybe Master Bai Jue will also...

438
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
I don’t think so.

439
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,940
He’s the True God,

440
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,620
generated from the world
on the Heaven and Earth Platform.

441
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,140
Now he’s gone.

442
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,500
It’s the karma.

443
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,940
There’s no turning back.

444
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,340
If you really think so,

445
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,620
why have you been staying
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

446
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,740
and waiting for a result
that will not happen?

447
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,220
Your Grace.

448
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,740
It’s you, Hongri?

449
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,460
What brings you here?

450
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
Three years ago,

451
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,620
Master gave this to me

452
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
and expelled me to the North Sea.

453
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,700
He asked me to raise the body

454
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,620
inside the tower

455
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,940
before I gave him to you.

456
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,460
Gu Jun?

457
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,980
Your Grace,

458
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,100
Master wouldn’t let the man
who was closest to you

459
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,700
to leave you. He...

460
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,220
Enough!

461
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,860
What else did he do

462
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,100
that I didn’t know?

463
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,620
Tell me once for all.

464
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,140
When you tell me little by little,

465
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,820
I would rather be put

466
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,980
in the Tribulation of Chaos.

467
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,020
He rebuilt a body for me,

468
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,220
took the Tribulation alone

469
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,940
and decided my fate.

470
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,340
I tolerated it.

471
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,260
He saved Gu Jun without telling me.

472
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,340
It’s alright.

473
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,020
He made the mistake

474
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,620
and he should make up for it.

475
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,340
Today, tell me

476
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,220
what else he did

477
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,340
and kept from me.

478
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,740
Nothing...

479
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,340
Nothing else.

480
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,740
Yeah.

481
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,740
Nothing else.

482
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,380
He’s dead,

483
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,700
and he’s done everything.

484
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,620
In tens of thousands of years

485
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,500
when I’m also getting old

486
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,220
and forgetting everything,

487
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,980
Bai Jue will have nothing left.

488
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Come on, Hongri.

489
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,500
You served him
for over a hundred thousand years.

490
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,580
I’m now crying,

491
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,940
but you don’t even shed a single tear?

492
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,700
Your Grace,

493
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,740
it’s not surprised to see you cry.

494
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,380
Sixty thousand years ago,

495
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,980
you sacrificed yourself
in the Tribulation.

496
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,740
Master Bai Jue cried like this, too.

497
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,380
At that time,

498
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,620
I thought the sky would fall.

499
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,260
But later,

500
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,620
when I woke up,

501
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,220
you still lived a good life

502
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,740
in front of me

503
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,980
with Master’s doppelganger around.

504
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,820
Then I think

505
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,220
since you came back to life

506
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,260
after you had completely disappeared

507
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,500
as the Chief God,

508
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,340
one day,

509
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,580
Master Bai Jue

510
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,340

if you don’t believe in fate,

519
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,020
I will

520

Ancestral God,

536
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
please accept my respect.

537
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,700
Sixty thousand years ago,

538
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,260
I followed your instruction

539
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,620
and sacrificed myself

540
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,380
for the whole world.

541
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,460
Bai Jue loved me

542
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,980
and sacrificed him secretly,

543
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,980
so that I survived.

544
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,100
Before the new God of Fire emerges,

545
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,620
I’ll be kneeling
on the Heaven and Earth Platform.

546
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,500
Please show some mercy

547
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,380
and give Bai Jue back to me.

548
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:56,980
I’m willing to

549
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,860
exchange my life for his.

550
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,740
When mortals are in trouble,

551
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,460
they worship Gods.

552
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,100
We’re True Gods.

553
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,740
Your kneeling

554
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,100
won’t help.

555
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,820
I’m simply someone stuck in love.

556
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,220
I’m not different from mortals.

557
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,860
If the God of Fire isn’t Bai Jue,

558
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,220
what will you do?

559
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,740
Shanggu,

560
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,380
cheer up.

561
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,460
The God Realm needs you.

562
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,100
I’ve made up my mind.

563
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,500
Let me kneel.

564
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,580
(500 years later)

565
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,340
Mother,

566
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,020
I’m going to the Daze Mansion
for learning skills.

567
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,340
Don’t you walk me out?

568
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,220
Respect your master and learn carefully.

569
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,740
Focus on cultivation.

570
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,100
You’ve been kneeling for 500 years.

571
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,620
If the Ancestral God agreed,

572
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,740
there would have been anomalies
on the Heaven and Earth Platform.

573
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,020
I believe that

574
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,860
your father will not leave us alone.

575
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,100
Go ahead.

576
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,340
Don’t be as playful as you were.

577
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,260
The Ancestral God means

578
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,220
you shouldn’t keep kneeling.

579
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,580
I’ve begged him for 500 years.

580
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,500
I don’t care if I have to kneel
for another 500 years.

581
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,020
Your legs are hurt.

582
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,020
Get up and take a rest.

583
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,340
Anyway, the new God of Fire

584
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,700
will not come into being so soon.

585
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,340
Shanggu,

586
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,220
you should know that

587
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,980
it’s hard for Bai Jue to come back.

588
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
Even if he’s back,

589
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,220
he may hardly have old memories.

590
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,620
It doesn’t matter.

591
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,980
It’s alright when I have memories.

592
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,580
Zhiyang,

593
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,020
the new God of Fire
is coming into being soon.

594
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,700
Do you think it’ll be him?

595
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,220
Very little chance.

596
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,380
Maybe we just have the little chance.

597
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,740
Among us,

598
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,060
the Ancestral God cares
for Shanggu most.

599
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,060
Maybe,

600
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,620
when he gets softhearted, he’ll...

601
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,500
