Yes.

I'll make some coffee.
Take your time before you come out.

Well, I don't need to feel awkward.

Keep it moderate.

27
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,060
I should go that way, then.

28

Okay. Call me after your class.

What? Are you two really an item?

33
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,400
You bowed, spoke way too respectfully,

34
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,250
and even called him sir.

35
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,660
-Whatever.
-Goodness.

36
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,420
How much more do I have to teach you?

37
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,350
-Dam.
-Don't get near me.

38
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,960
-You're here early.
-I am.

39
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,770
-Have you eaten?
-Not yet.

40
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,280
Honey. My love!

41
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,260
Sweetie. My baby.

42
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,390
-What's with you?
-You're giving me chills.

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,640
I just threw some examples
of good pet names for a couple.

44
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,490
There are so many pet names,

45
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,790
but why did Dam choose to call him sir?

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,550
What's so bad? You said you liked it.

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,870
You wanted a sir of your own.

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,960
That's when I thought
Professor Shin was dating Professor Seo.

49
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,590
They're both older,

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,190
so I said that thinking
they were being cute.

51
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,390
But you're 22. Don't be so outdated.

52
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,690
Jae-jin, you tell me.

53
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,970
Honey, I missed you so much.
Here's girlfriend one.

54
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,570
Sir, how I have missed you.

55
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,040
And here's girlfriend two,
who's way too polite. Which one?

56
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,840
They both sound awful when you do it,

57
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,950
but I'd still go with one.

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,930
Anyway, this is the reality.

59
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,830
Professor Shin is in his early 30s.

60
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,830
Don't you think he'd want to be
your boyfriend than an elderly man?

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,090
She's right. If you call him sir,
no one would think you two are dating.

62
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,020
It's like volunteering
at an old people's home.

63
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,210
An old people's home?

64
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,159
Think about it. When you call him sweetie,

65
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,500
you'd imagine a couple
having some beer at a pub.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,530
But if you call him sir,

67
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,400
it sounds like you'd be at a mountain
eating herbal Sarcodon baeksuk.

68
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,550
-Herbal Sarcodon baeksuk?
-Yes.

69
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,470
I wish I could call him something sweet.

70
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,570
But why can't I stand it?
I just want to break something.

71
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,290
Still, I want to try it at least once.

72
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,850
Honey. My love.

73
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,620
Sweetie. I missed you.

74
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,910
No, never. I can't do that.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,600
-Babe, what should we eat today?
-Yes?

76
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,270
Whatever you want, baby.

77
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,650
Let's eat something good, babe.

78
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,270

-Babe.
-You're here.

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm here, babe.

87
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,760
-What?
-What?

88
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,940
-I didn't get that.
-I didn't say anything.

89
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,050
Gosh, I'm hungry. I'm starving.

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,300
-What do you want to eat?
-Well...

91
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,300
[Okay, let's give it another try.]

92
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,600
Hey, babe. You, babe.

93
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,409
You should get your girlfriend
a necklace, babe.

94
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,170
-Girls love this.
[-He's a stranger,]

95
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,600
[and she's obviously much older,
but she called him babes so much.]

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,460
[I'm so jealous of her bold personality.]

97
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,500
Hey, sweetie.
You're wearing gray and white,

98
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,790
-so go with a silver necklace.
-We'll come later.

99
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,150
Later when?

100
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,530
Come quickly.
Go take a round, then come back.

101
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,420
You two make such a cute couple.

102
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,970
I hope you two stay together for long.
Have a great day!

103
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,820
So where are we going?

104
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,620
What are we eating?

105
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,470
I'm up for anything.

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,010
Is there anything you want, ba...

107
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,390
Babe! Hey, babe.

108
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,200
-How about bacon omelette rice?
-Omelette rice.

109
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,370
-Sounds great.
-Right? Let's go.

110
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,150
[Should I give this one last try?]

111
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,679
[It'll feel less awkward
if I think of him as an older cousin.]

112
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,120
Did you pick one, Dam?

113
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,320
You haven't?

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,260
I wanted to be more casual with each other
like other couples.

115
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,120
Let's use casual nicknames
and speak casually too.

116
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,510
All of a sudden?

117
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,360
Wait, did you hear me call you babe?

118
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,090
Well, I was just getting prepared.

119
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,090
I mean, you'll become a human soon, sir.

120
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,510
Then you won't be 999 years old,

121
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,880
but you'll be old enough
for me to call you babe.

122
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,550
So I was just practicing.

123
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,030
Isn't it awkward?

124
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,200
No, I like it.

125
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,140
Then may I call you babe
every now and then?

126
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,560
Okay, Dam.

127
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,300
I'll speak casually from time to time.
Is that okay?

128
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,760
Okay.

129
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,090
What do you want, Dam?

130
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,530
Anything, babe.

131
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,760
This is insanely sweet,
something that Dam would love, right?

132
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,790
-Yes.
-Is she out on a date?

133
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,720
Yes, she's caught up in the storm of love.

134
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,800
I hope this storm of love
doesn't just pass by like a storm.

135
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,270
I hope they stay together for a long time.
I'm worried.

136
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,640
Don't be too worried.
I'm sure she'll manage.

137
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,890
It's because I've seen her too sad.

138
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,870
She broke down so miserably
the last time they broke up,

139
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,490
and I've never seen her like that.

140
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,660
And I think other students are
starting to take notice.

141
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,400
I'm absolutely worried about my friend
who's on a difficult journey of love.

142
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,070
On top of that,
I'm concerned about her personality.

143
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,250
What about her personality?

144
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,890
I love her loyalty and energy.
She's like a brother to me.

145
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,280
Exactly, the problem is that
she's like a brother to Prof. Shin too.

146
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,260
She uses honorifics and calls him sir.

147
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,560
Hey, maybe she felt so awkward
that she hasn't kissed him yet.

148
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,080
Wait, hey. We're two people who have
different sex chromosomes.

149
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,020
I don't want
to talk about something like this.

150
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,170
What? Stop pretending
to be so conservative.

151
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,240
You're as open-minded
as Hollywood celebrities.

152
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,060
-What do you mean?
-Before you dated Hye-sun,

153
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,130
you had a one-night stand with someone...

154
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,670
Why are you bringing that up?

155
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,730
If you're serious about her,
make sure you never tell her

156
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,050
that you've had a one-night...

157
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,570
That you've done
something like that, okay?

158
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,380
-What?
-Most women like men

159
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,370
who are serious and cautious
when it comes to physical contact.

160
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,450
We prefer men who cherish us
and keep us safe,

161
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,950
you playboy.

162
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,750

Hey, Hye-sun.

165
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,680
Are you done with your group study?

166
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,710
Thanks, Hye-sun.
I should be taking you home.

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
I'm the one who has a car. Don't mind it.

168
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,770
Don't be like a man from the Joseon era.

169
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,720
I've already been there, done that.

170
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,050
What?

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,260
I meant that

172
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,300
we should act our age
in this relationship.

173
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,300
Hye-sun, one second.

174
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,080
[Wait, is he about to kiss me?]

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,270
[Do kids these days just randomly kiss?]

176
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,470
[What? I think I gave her a wrong idea.]

177
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,410
[I'm not ready for this yet.]

178
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,700
[Forget it. If she's ready,]

179
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,370
[who cares if I'm not ready?]

180
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,950
[We prefer men who cherish us]

181
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,620
[and keep us safe,]

182
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,910
[you playboy.]

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
[You playboy.]

184
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,980
I'm not a playboy!

185
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,710
-What?
-What?

186
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,900
What?

187
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,360
No, wait. I...

188
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,300
I meant that I don't play a lot.

189
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,380
I may look like I'd fool around,

190
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,140
but actually, I'm pretty serious.

191
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,400
I get it, but why are you
suddenly showing that off?

192
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,520
It wasn't exactly showing it off.

193
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,080
And there's something here.

194
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,380
Were you trying to get this off?

195
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,500
Anyway, I dozed off for a moment.

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,760
I think I was just asleep.
Did I sleep for a while?

197
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,770
No, only like ten seconds.

198
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,010
I see. What a relief.

199
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,230
If I fall asleep again,
you have to wake me up right away.

200
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,990
Okay, I'll wake you up right away.

201
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,550
[That was so smooth. I'd rather be
a woman who suddenly falls asleep]

202
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,140
[than someone desperate for a kiss.]

203
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,030
[That was smooth.]

204
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,050
[It's better to seem
like I can't take a hint]

205
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,680
[than coming off as a playboy.]

206
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,010
Gosh, look at the time.

207
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,130
Sir, you gave lots of lectures today.
Aren't you tired?

208
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,340
I don't even realize how tired I am
whenever I'm with you.

209
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,540
I'm not some kind of a pick-me-up.

210
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,690
That's barely true.

211
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,490
Barely? No.

212
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm your babe.

213
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,830
Stop teasing me.

214
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,040
I want to be smooth like you,

215
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,150
but it feels a little awkward

216
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,140
and stuff.

217
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,440
Anyway, that's that.

218
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,000
To be honest, it's awkward

219
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,290
and embarrassing for me too.

220
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,080
But I like feeling such emotions too.

221
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,970
What are you up to?

222
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,050
I was looking at the Marble.

223
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,770
It looked more blue.

224
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,230
Really? I can't see it.

225
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,510
How much has it changed?

226
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,300
More than half,
but it's not completely blue.

227
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,000
I still can't put a finger on it.

228
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,810
One second, sir.

229
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,640
About this much.

230
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,980
That's amazing.
I guess you've become more human.

231
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,100
If you fill this up a little more,
you can become a human.

232
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,940
Look how happy you are.

233
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,790
Well, I am happy about it.

234
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,650
It's a shame, though.

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,080
It would've been great
if I knew it was my humanity

236
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,760
that turns the Marble blue.

237
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,780
Even if you knew that,

238
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,890
you couldn't have done this without me.

239
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,840
It's all thanks to you, Miss Dam.

240
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,560
Thank you so much.

241
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,060
Then keep putting your trust in me.

242
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
Let's stick it up over there.

243
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,510
Let's put it up.

244
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,850
Sir, can you color this
whenever it turns blue?

245
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,490
It seems like we're almost there.

246
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,910
How are we going to finish this?

247
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,720
-I have a great idea.
-What?

248
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,510
I mean, now that the Marble
has turned mostly blue,

249
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,760
I wanted to make sure
we have a solid way of completing it.

250
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,880
But it's not like I can sit here

251
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,380
and give you a lecture
on Kant's moral philosophy.

252
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,890
I'm still a high school graduate,
and you hold a doctorate.

253
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,560
Also, by the time Kant was born,

254
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,760
you were already 700 years old, sir.

255
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,980
So forget such theories.

256
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,450
I tried to think of something
we can do in real life to help you

257
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,640
learn more about humanity.

258
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,310
When you do keep doing something,

259
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,810
it becomes a habit, right?

260
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,000
For example,

261
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,770
I continuously had late-night snacks

262
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,970
and never worked out,
which resulted in this shape.

263
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,750
That was convincing.

264
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,200
Anyway, it's not like
there is one definition of a good person.

265
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,010
So why don't we try living a day
without saying or doing

266
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,070
anything bad?

267
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,660
And if possible, do one good deed a day.

268
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,470
What if you turned that into a habit?

269
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,740
Sounds great. Let's give it a try.

270
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,070
And so it begins today.

271
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,680
Sir, I've been curious for a while.

272
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,750
What do you want to do most
once you become a human?

273
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,510
I'm not sure.

274
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,750
That wish faded a while ago,

275
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,290
so I haven't thought about it.

276
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,380
And now, I just want to remain
by your side for a long time.

277
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,150
But still, if you had a bucket list,
it might become your motivation.

278
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,910
Let's come up with something.

279
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,160
That was startling.

280
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,900
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

281
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,750
-My gosh.
-Man.

282
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,770
This is irritating.

283
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,250
Sir, you aren't supposed to say
anything bad or negative.

284
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,180
This is irritating.

285
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,280
Sir.

286
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,700
Saying it in a nice voice
doesn't make it positive.

287
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,290
When you say it with a smile,
you seem like a psychopath...

288
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,140
I mean, it's weirder.

289
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,010
All right, then.

290
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,550
I'll do my best.

291
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,780
-He's a professor.
-What is he doing that at school?

292
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,430
Sir.

293
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,030
You just had a mean thought, right?

294
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,530
What?

295
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,550
No, I wouldn't.

296
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,150
No, I can tell by your eyes.

297
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,510
You did, right?

298
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,290
When you keep thinking about food,
it will lead to binge eating.

299
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,070
So if you keep thinking mean thoughts,
it'll lead to mean actions.

300
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,220
Please be cautious from now on, okay?

301
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,720
I'll do my best.

302
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,210
[Done with the ancient history report?]

303
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,560
[Soo-kyung]

304
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,070
Oh no. I forgot to bring
my ancient history report from home.

305
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,060
I don't have a lecture right now,
so I'll give you a ride.

306
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,610
No, it's the first period,

307
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,060
so I only have ten minutes left.

308
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,430
This is bad.

309
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,150
Then we have no other choice.

310
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,350
Let's go.

311
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,730
By your magic?

312
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,930
Well, at this rate,

313
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,530
you'll probably become a human soon,
so let's make use of it.

314
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,040
My goodness!

315
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,720
What are you two doing?

316
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,140
Why are we here?

317
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,210
You almost shocked me to death.

318
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,050
Well, since you're 999 years old,

319
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,340
it'd be tough to find a way home
thanks to your old age.

320
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,460
It's not because of my old age.

321
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,530
-My magic just...
-Exactly.

322
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,200
You couldn't use your magic properly

323
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,710
because you're getting too old.

324
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,980
Yes, you're 999, so it's about time
you lost your functions.

325
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,370
I think I have enough energy to make
this car stop in the middle of the road.

326
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,570
Do you want me to do it?

327
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,820
Sir, you said you won't say anything mean.

328
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,320
In order to do that,
we'd better run along.

329
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,610
Bye, Hye-sun.

330
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,030
Gosh, this time, it worked.

331
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,550
So why did that just happen?

332
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,230
I could tell it hasn't happened before
by what Hye-sun said.

333
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,440
I wonder. I must've been a little tired.

334
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,170
Oh, you were feeling under the weather.

335
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,120
I might be late. I'll pick up my report.

336
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,830
Are you serious?

337
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,820
Are you really moving abroad to study?

338
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,070
It's final.

339
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,710
He's going to take over
his father's business,

340
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
so he had been talking about it.

341
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,210
Exactly. He was only talking about it,
so why did it suddenly become final?

342
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,940
Seon-woo, is it because of Dam?

343
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,700
Do I look like that big of an idiot?

344
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,460
Stop talking nonsense,

345
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,540
and apologize to Dam
for uploading that photo.

346
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,060
-Wait for me.
-Seon-woo.

347
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,390
Hey, Seon-woo. Seon-woo!

348
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,160
What was that? It's a fact that
Dam didn't behave right and led him on,

349
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,280
then hit on Professor Shin
behind his back.

350
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,700
Why is he getting mad at us
for uploading a stupid photo?

351
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,690
Tell me about it.
Why is he always on her side?

352
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,490
I can't believe this.

353
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,620
Hey, Seok.

354
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes. Okay, we'll pick it up.

355
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,620
"To be honest, I still like you."

356
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,130
"You wouldn't know how I feel, would you?"

357
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,750
Hey, Seok, how does it feel
to have someone publicly confess...

358
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,480
-their love for you on Everyday Time?
-Cut it out.

359
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,810
I've never had this happened to me.

360
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,920
-Does your heart race...
-Da-young is here!

361
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,080
-And so is Jin.
-Hey, you're here.

362
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,060
-Are these it?
-Yes, thanks.

363
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,730
-Did you see Everyday Time?
-We did.

364
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,120
-I mean, someone uploaded a public...
-Yes, we just said we saw it.

365
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,070
You turned her down
when she asked you out two years ago,

366
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,620
but she's now mean to you on purpose.

367
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,780
Who is it? If she asked you out before,
you'd know who she is.

368
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
-Is she pretty?
-Just the initials.

369
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,440
-It's none of your business.
-Just a letter.

370
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,470
-Is she prettier than me?
-What?

371
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,670
Gosh, tell us.

372
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,040
[Relaxing with a cup of tea]

373
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,530
Hey, I know you're in a relationship,
but don't forget that you're a student.

374
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,380
How could you forget your report?

375
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,700
Exactly.

376
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,740
And our finals are soon.
Are you ready for the tests?

377
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,540
Somewhat.

378
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,480
Somewhat? You can't be somewhat prepared.

379
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,770
You'll be a senior next year.
How can you got a job

380
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,660
with a GPA of 3.5?

381
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,390
Man, I'm so angry.

382
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,540
Why are you so furious over my low GPA?

383
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,090
It's not that. It's Da-young and Jin.

384
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,210
They're bringing up
grades and fairness into this,

385
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,700
but those can't be the reasons.

386
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,080
They hated me already,
so they wanted to mess with me.

387
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,620
You dated him before he began here,

388
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,550
and you took his class fairly too.

389
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Who do they think they are
to upload that photo and make you known?

390
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,220
They're so annoying.

391
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,830
I also find them irritating,
but I'll just let it go.

392
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,040
Now that I know I have to set an example,

393
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,120
I feel like I should stay away
from saying or doing bad things.

394
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,800
Set an example? To whom?

395
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,140
I meant that many people have
their eyes on me, so I should be careful.

396
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,630
I have to turn this in,
so you can go ahead.

397
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,960
-Okay. See you.
-See you.

398
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,190
Gosh, I'm so full.

-I'll buy you a meal next time.
-Okay.

401
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,070
-Why? Are you looking for something?
-My notebook.

402
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,930
I made that to prepare for the finals.

403
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,480
What? It's not like
your notebook has feet.

404
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,770
Did I leave it in my locker?

405
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,480
Hey, Soo-kyung, was it you?

406
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,880
-What?
-I mean, you were here alone

407
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,370
while we were out eating.

408
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,890
I know grades are important to you,
but you shouldn't steal things.

409
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,340
Whatever. What do you think of me?

410
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,640
Think about it.
You've always kept him in check.

411
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,420
But still, you shouldn't go down this low.

412
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,860
Hey, stop blaming the innocent
without any evidence, and get lost!

413
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,530
Of course, we have evidence.

414
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,420
Your attitude toward him is the evidence.

415
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,470
To be frank, you're the only one
who's mean to Seok in our department...

416
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,030
It was you. It's you!

417
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,140
You confessed your love on Everyday Time!

418

It's you.

419
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,630
You had feelings for Seok?

420
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,360
Is that why you have been so immature?

421
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,950
Hey!

422
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,870
I didn't write that!
I don't even like him,

423

427
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,160
Yes, what if I'm done talking?

428
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,870
I can't take you anymore!

429
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,320
-You totally deserved that.
-What's going on?

430
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,680
-Dam.
-Get up.

431
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,260

he made for his finals.

432

I never even went near it.

433
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,560
Of course, you stole it.

or high and mighty. So pretentious!

Hey, you need to apologize before you go.

440
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,000
-Let me go.
-Then stop doing things to apologize for.

441
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,860
-I won't be patient for long.
-So what if you don't stay patient?

442
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,060
What can you do anyway? What will you do?

443
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,470
-Hey, let me go.
-No.

-Let me go!
-No.

-Don't do that.

-Stop it.

because it gave me a fright.

520
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,460
Soo-kyung, I'm sorry.

521
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,890
I didn't go to the orientation,
so I didn't know the freshmen's faces.

522
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,710
Whatever.

523
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,290
I told you.

524
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,120
I will never forgive you.

525
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,400
Hey, Seok.

526
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,910
Isn't this yours?
I found it on the ground just now.

527
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,390
Hey, it's your fault
that you decided to study there alone

528
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,550
while all others go eat.

529
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,230
Hey, you're supposed
to make an apology now,

530
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,770
not excuses.

531
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,910
She's right!

532
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,910
Is this why the professor is
going out with you?

533
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,310
Because you're so condescending?

534
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,900
You are freaking annoying!

535
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,610
You think I don't know how to swear?

536
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,030
You worthless piece of garbage.

537
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,740
[So why don't we try living a day
without saying or doing anything bad?]

538
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,030
[What if you turned that into a habit?]

539
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,610
It may seem like a bad behavior,

540
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,720
but what I did was
actually a nice thing to do.

541
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,580
I couldn't just sit back and watch
my friend getting hurt.

542
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,130
It was a righteous and loyal thing to do.

543
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,650
I'm sorry.

544
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,670
I'm supposed to keep you
on the straight and narrow

545
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,000
and be a model example.

546
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm thinking of quitting the job
after this semester.

547
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,170
Why? Because I had fights with other kids?

548
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,800
Partly, yes.

549
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,660
The main reason I came here
was to see you.

550
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,870
But I don't need to be
at school to see you anymore.

551
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,500
And

552
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,080
I don't want to cause you trouble
by staying. There's no reason to.

553
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,260
Still, at school,
you get to deal with many people,

554
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,430
and it will help you
learn about humanity better.

555
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,900
I can look for another job.

556
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,110
I had hundreds of jobs already.

557
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,370
I can't settle down for one job anyway.

558
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,910
It's about time to quit.

559
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,480
So don't worry, Miss Dam.

560
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,960
And don't fight with others.

561
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,470
I don't want you to get hurt.

562
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,670
You came here
because you were worried about me, right?

563
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,410
I know you can feel it when I'm in danger.

564
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,780
That's why you came, right?

565
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,050
My goodness!

566
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,560
I know you can feel it when I'm in danger.

567
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,080
But why?

568
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,600
[It works.]

569
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,230
[It doesn't work.]

570
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,060
[It works.]

571
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,300
Why in the world did you use that magic?

572
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,380
I was reminded of my mistake earlier,

573
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,100
so I was testing it out.

574
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,460
Am I a test dummy or what?

575
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,260
You can't just summon a person like that.

576
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,989
I was just about to get some sausages.

577
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,130
Sometimes, it works,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

578
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,280
What do you think is going on?

579
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm sure it's because you're tired

580
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
with all the school work
and your girlfriend.

581
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,980
You have never been this busy
in your 999 years of life.

582
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,700
The Marble is becoming bluer.

583
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,930
What?

584
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,730
Of course. You were spending
too much time with Lee Dam lately.

585
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,800
So the energy...

586
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,700
It's not energy
that changes the color of the Marble.

587
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,480
What? What do you mean?

588
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,220
[Really?]

589
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,050
Humanity is what changes
the color of the Marble?

590
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,370
I know it's confusing, but...

591
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,870
Now I get it.

592
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,470
It's because I'm much more humane,
kinder, purer,

593
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,420
and have better a personality than you.
That's why I turned into a human.

594
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,720
Hang on.

595
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,660
If it's about humanity,

596
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,170
I should have turned into a human
after 7 years, not 700 years.

597
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,530
Why did it take so long?

598
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,480
Wait.

599
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,680
I remembered something.

600
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,240
Four years ago, I teleported
to Paris for shopping.

601
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,400
Then when I wanted to come back,
I couldn't use magic.

602
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,470
So I got caught as an illegal alien.

603
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,930
I even said "I love you" in French,
but it didn't work.

604
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,140
But one second before I was handcuffed,

605
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,860
I managed to come back at the last minute.

606
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,270
Then a few days later,

607
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,420
I became a human.

608
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,150
- What?
- You said it works on and off.

609
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,660
I think that's a sign
that you're turning into a human.

610
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,120
I told you.

611
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,540
When I became a human,
I could just feel it.

612
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,310
One morning, I realized I couldn't
use magic nor feel the energy.

613
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,940
I was a human.

614
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,030
Oh, my. I think you're actually
becoming a human now.

615
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,830
Hye-sun is the last person I would trust.

616
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,950
What do you think will happen
if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

617
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,040
The more you want her,
the bigger your appetite will grow.

618
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,800
She may be ignorant,
but she has always been intuitive.

619
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,600
Let's not jump to conclusions.

620
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,610
Hello, Professor.

621
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,770
Oh, no. Watch out.

622
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,440
Thank you, sir.

623
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,610
[I couldn't feel any energy.]

624
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,650
[Could it be
that I don't need energy anymore?]

625
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,800
Miss Dam, can we meet now?

626
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,220
Sir.

627
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,000
-Hey.
-Why are you smiling?

628
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,930
I'm not.

629
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,340
Even now, you're smiling.

630
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,540
Did you win the lottery?

631
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,180
I don't need to. I'm already rich.

632
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,460
Right.

633
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,390
Then what's up?

634
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,530
I'd like to take you out
for a nice dinner today.

635
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,680
Oh, no.

636
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,850
Soo-kyung is feeling down today,

637
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,790
so we made a plan
to go out and drink together.

638
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,380
That's a shame. Have fun then.

639
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,180
Don't forget to call me if it gets late.

640
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,940
What's with this vibe?

641
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,550
I heard about it.

642
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,490
I heard

643
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,300
that you had a crush on me.

644
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,600
I wished things like this
would never happen to us.

645
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,360
It's a long time ago.

646
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,080
When I was a freshman, I thought
he helped me get out of trouble,

647
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,030
but it turned out
that he just wanted to dance.

648
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,410
Come on. It lasted only three weeks.

649
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,420
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to be.

650
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,200
You may say you're okay,
but it must have been really hard for you.

651
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,780
From now on,

652
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,780
I'll try my best not to hurt you.

653
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,270
What are you saying?

654
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,160
Soo-kyung.

655
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,580
What on earth did you like about me?

656
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,270
My hands get veiny when I work out,

657
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,690
and I knew they were kind of sexy.

658
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,490
Was that what you liked about me?

659
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,650
If so, I'll quit exercising.

660
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,970
-What?
-Wasn't that it?

661
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,480
Then was it my eyes
that look like an innocent boy's

662
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,190
when I smile?

663
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,270
I sometimes felt like that's my charm.

664
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,330
Was that it?

665
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,040
Then I'll stop smiling.

666
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,930
It wasn't anything creepy like that.

667
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,310
The more I got to know you, the clearer
it became how horrible you were,

668
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,540
which helped me get over you.

669
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,520
Actually, there was nothing to get over.

670
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,020
Just get lost, will you?

671
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,650
-Go away. Get lost.
-Okay. I will.

672
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,360
I have an appointment with Hye-sun anyway.

673
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,810
Are you leaving?

674
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,530
Hey, Soo-kyung.

675
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,350
Never have a crush on me again.

676
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,720
Promise me.

677
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,250
Gosh, this is exactly
why I haven't told him about this.

678
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,490
The only thing I'm grateful to Seok for

679
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,780
is that he stopped me
from telling him about it.

680
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,710
Exactly. He did you a big favor.

681
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,390
So stop hating him so much.

682
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,540
I had no idea that's why you hated him.

683
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,530
And he didn't even do it on purpose.
He seemed to feel really bad about it.

684
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,030
I decide whether to hate him or not.

685
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,670
How's your hair?

686
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,470
Well, my scalp still burns a bit,
but it's all right. What about you?

687
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,270
I'm all right too. In fact, I feel great.

688
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,610
I wanted to beat some sense into them
so they would never mess with you again.

689
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,120
You saw how agile I was.

690
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,930
I must be the best fighter
in the department.

691
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,170
Right. And you got hurt the most.

692
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,160
Hey. Real fighters attack invisible spots.

693
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,190
I can tell you,
they're going to feel it tomorrow.

694
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,210
By the way, I'm sorry about what happened.

695
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,930
Maybe you didn't want
to make a big deal out of it

696
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,250
and I ruined it.

697
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,990
Don't say that. You wouldn't have
sat back and watched me being hit either.

698
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,950
And to be honest, it's my fault.

699
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,430
They probably picked a fight with you
because you're my friend. I'm sorry.

700
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,030
No way. Don't say you're sorry.

701
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,720
Cheers.

702
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,170
Anyway, I won't do the same again.

703
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,510
I don't want to worry him.
That's the least I can do for him.

704
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,830
Worry?

705
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,060
Oh, you're talking about Professor Shin.

706
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,930
I'm the one who got hurt for you,
and yet you worry about him, not me.

707
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,240
Well, that's love I guess. That's love.

710
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,040
Is he really turning into a human?

711
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,330
Well, let's not be excited about it yet.

712
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,060
It's not over until it's over.

713
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,150
Hye-sun, I'm sorry I'm late.

714
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,780
-That's okay.
-Oh, thanks.

715
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,980
I heard Soo-kyung's first crush was you.

716
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,420
Well, I heard that only today too.

717
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,310
She said it lasted three weeks,
so don't worry.

718
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,820
Why would I worry?
You're going out with me now.

What were you doing?

720
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,020
It's called Instagram.
All young people use it these days,

721
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,260
so I made an account too.

She must have lost her mind.

I'll block all comments.

he loves you then?

He didn't,

785
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,270
but I didn't say I love him yet either.

786
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,650

who can't say cringy things.

790
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,320
He could have said it first.

Hey.

792
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,880

00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,460
Why are you sorry? What for?

808
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,270
Do you even know
what you're apologizing for?

809
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,600
Isn't it about Jin-ah?

810
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,070
Do you think I'm doing this
because of your clingy ex?

811
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,370
You made out with your ex,

812
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,250
and you always stay close to Dam.

813
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,880
So why do you never touch me?

814
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,680
Well, it's because I feel bad.

815
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,360
What do you mean?

816
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,690
You know,

817
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,250
we went all the way,

818
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,710
but I don't remember a thing.

819
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,820
Our relationship may have
started casually,

820
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,760
but I don't want to see you just casually.

821
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,010
That's why I'm being careful.

822
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,050
What do you mean by, we went all the way?

823
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,810
We slept together.

824
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,190
After the festival afterparty,

825
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,560
we slept together in your suite room.

826
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,250
Oh, that. We did sleep.

827
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,310
I slept on the sofa,
and you slept on the bed.

828
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,260
-What?
-What?

829
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,120
Are you saying nothing happened
between us then?

830
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,220
Yes.

831
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,640
Then why did you say
I should take responsibility?

832
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,970
I meant, you should take responsibility
for our poor grade.

833
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,000
Those who end up
being a couple are getting A-plus.

834
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,300
Thank goodness.

835
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,220
I thought I got wasted
and did something trashy to you.

836
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,270
Hold on. What?

837
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,910
Have you been nice to me
because you felt bad?

838
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,400
No way.

839
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,660
I told you. I like you now.

840

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,680
Do you like me?

842
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,410
I...

843
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,810
like you very much.

844
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,930
So I'm really glad

845
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,230
nothing happened that day.

From now on, whatever we do,

847

I hope we do it because we both want to.

848
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,200
When you finally like me back.

849
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,410
But if you say it doesn't matter to you,

850
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,560
I will be pretty upset.

851
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,810
Why are you crying again?

852
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,670
I like you too.

853
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,420
-What?
-It's okay.

854
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,570
If you want to take it slow,
we can take it slow.

855
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,680
I can wait.

856

[I can't believe I'm saying this.]

857
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,400
Could you close your eyes?

858
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,400
Okay, then.

859
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,030
[This is going to take forever.]

Jae-jin.

861
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,810
Why do you have to make out with a girl
in front of our house?

862
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,810
Let me go home.

864
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,650
Jae-jin. Can't you hear me?

865
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,670

866
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,960
Is he not him?

867
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,210
Jae-jin? It is him.

868
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,110
Hey.

869
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,830
You're blocking my way home.

870
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,990
There's an alley in there.
Do it over there.

871
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,320
Why do you have to be kissing
in front of the house?

872
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,360
-Bye.
-Bye!

873
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,290
Are you feeling all right?

874
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,400
It can't be worse.

875
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,160
What?

876
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,490
Is there anything you want to say
when you see me?

877
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,640
Do you want to eat tiramisu?

878
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,310
No, not that.

879
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,260
Is there anything you want to say
when you look at me?

880
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,720
You look cute?

881
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,270
It's not about my appearance.

882
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,810
For example, "I..."

883
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,750
"I want to go for a walk."

884
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,960
You wanted to go for a walk.

885
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,870
Then let's go for a walk.
It will help you sober up too.

886
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,970
Dam.

887
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,180
I thought

888
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,140
I wouldn't mind
quietly disappearing from this world.

889
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,400
But you made me want to live.

890
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,010
I have always found it uncomfortable
being with someone,

891
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,350
but I like having you around.

892
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,650
Seeing you hurt makes me angry,

893
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,490
and going to pick you up
when you get drunk

894
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,180
doesn't bother me at all.

895
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,780
That's right.

896
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,220
This is me

897
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,650
saying I love you.

898
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,440
It looks good on you.

899
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,980
-Do you like it?
-Of course.

900
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,610
I haven't gotten a necklace before.

901
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,960
Now I feel bad for always complaining
and not saying nice things to you.

902
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,550
I think you're much more humane than...

903
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,240
Right. Did the Marble change?

904
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,880
It's the same.

905
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,040
You have been saying nice things today

906
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,020
and gave me such a nice present,

907
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,830
so I thought it might have changed.

908
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,280
Too bad.

909
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,530
I really wish you can become a human.

910
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,440
You always seemed calm.

911
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,920
But when you told me the Marble
turned blue with a smiling face,

912
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,790
I realized you wanted it too.

913
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,690
Which made me want it even more.

914
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,330
Actually, there's something
I want to tell you.

915
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,750
It may be too early to say,
but I think you'll be excited to hear it.

916
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,030
What is it?

917
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,540
Well...

918
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,640
I might...

00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,170
["Ocean and Trade" by Shin Woo-yeo]

920
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,190
[Professor Shin Woo-yeo]

921
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,580
I was wrong.

922
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,440
What?

923
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,480
I think

924
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,290
the end is near.

925
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,500
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

926
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,680
[You said the end was near.
Maybe you're already a human.]

927
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,700
[I wish I was.]

928
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,380
What is a good breakup?

929
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,760
[Don't talk like
this is our last goodbye.]

930
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,920
[I'm worried]

931
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,660
[you'd be left here alone]

932
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,120
[and would have to cry alone]

933
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,630
[when I'm gone.]
