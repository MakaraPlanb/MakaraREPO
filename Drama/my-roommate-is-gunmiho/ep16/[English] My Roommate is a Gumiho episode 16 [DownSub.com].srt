51

who would break his deadline.

60

94
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,460
He used to shoot a little.

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,710
That's not exactly the case.

97
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,530
I don't know about this.
Professional archery is different.

98
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,980
I'm not doing this as a hobby,

99

and I'm a reservist on the national team,

100
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,120
so I've already worked
with all kinds of coaches.

101
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,700
May I borrow this for a moment?

102
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,090
That's an expensive bow.

103
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,600
What? He's holding the bow like that?

104
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,730
Do you want to give it a try?

105
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,470
Your shoulder will hurt less
if you fix your posture a little.

106
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,860

my shoulder is in pain?

I think your advice was helpful.

112
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,960
He broke his old record.

113
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,060
He asked me to thank his brother-in-law.

114
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,130
Why does he keep calling you that?

115
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,170

Sir, you really seem to have changed.

124
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,290
You wouldn't even say hi to him before
and used your magic to disappear.

125
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,850
But you wanted to meet him first,
so you had me surprised.

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
You said it seems like the end is near.
Maybe you've become a human already.

128
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,620
Come in.

129
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,550
You aren't asleep yet.

every night.

That's true.

140
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,700
We both don't have any class now,
so let's go out and eat.

141
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,310

Ta-da.

147
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,420
I asked you for the things

148
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,840
you wanted to do the most
when you become a human,

149
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,770
and you said you weren't sure.

150
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,750
So I tried making a list for you.

151
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,210
Now, look.

152
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,150
Number one,
lining up at a good restaurant.

[Things to do when my sir

It's really tough to line up for hours

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,570
unless you're seriously craving that food.

156
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,160
So I wanted to do that
when you actually have an appetite.

157
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,760
And number two, looking after your health.

158

The human health can fail
from time to time.

159
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,640
I was worried you might lose your health

160
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,620
once you suddenly become a human.

161
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,510

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,250
Let's go over there.

178
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,430
[Only good things for my family!]

179
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,800
[I hope my family stays healthy.]

180
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,600
Look at all these people's wishes.

181
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
You should make a wish too.

182
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,920
Me?

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,120
No, thanks. I've been traumatized
after making a wish.

184
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,740
Traumatized?

185
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,550
When we went on that trip together,

186
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,170
I made a wish on the stone tower,

187
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,640
but you erased my memories,
and our relationship ended.

188
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm scared of making wishes now.

189
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,590
Did you have a tough time

190
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,570
back then?

191
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,750
Of course.

192
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,910
You can't end a relationship like that.

193
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,510
You know, going out of touch is
the worst breakup.

194
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,490
I still think that was really harsh.

195
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,940
You made me really sad.

196
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,460
Then in your opinion,

197
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,030
what do you think makes a good breakup?

198
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,190
A good breakup?

199
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,580
A good breakup.

200
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,570
That's like happy starvation.

201
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,020
Isn't that an oxymoron?

202
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,310
I'm not sure what a good breakup is,

203
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,260
but I just hope it's nothing too sudden.

204
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,990
It's heartbreaking to say goodbye
without any preparation.

205
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,860
You'd need some time to accept it,

206
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,350
and you should say one last goodbye.

207
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,500
Let's go.

208
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,060
Sir.

209
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,940
Where did he go?

210
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,960
Sir, what just happened?

211
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, it's...

212
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,950
That was an awful prank.

213
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,620
You really shocked me.

214
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,740
Don't ever disappear without a word.

215
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,620
[You know,]

216
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,090
will it be okay for you and her

217
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,020
to live in the same house?

218
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,830
If by any chance

219
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,040
she sees

220
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,370
your disappearance,

221
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,850
she'll be greatly shocked.

222
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,200
[It'll be greatly shocking.]

223
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,970
[And]

224
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,000
[I'm worried too.]

225
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,560
[I'm afraid]

226
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,200
[she'll be left alone here
once I disappear.]

227
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,900
[She might end up]

228
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,490
[crying alone.]

229
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,839
You want me to return home?

230
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,030
All of a sudden? Why?

231
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,510
Come to think of it,
you should be there for your brother.

232
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,290
I've been too selfish.

233
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,720
But I promised to stay here
until you become a human.

234
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,460
You've been of great help,
so I think it'll be fine now.

235
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,130
Goodbye, then.

236
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,770
Sir, did I do something?

237
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,230
When I wanted to go home for a few days,

238
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,740
you held me back saying
you wanted to be with me.

239
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,560
So it feels kind of odd to have you
kick me out this late at night.

240
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
Is there another reason?

241
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,670
There's no other reason.

242
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,060
I feel a little sad and lonely

243
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,130
to think I'll be away from you.

244
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,470
And it's making me a little sadder
to see you seem so fine.

245
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,260
Bye.

246
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,760
No.

247
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,070
What brings you here this late?

248
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,070
You said you haven't been sleeping well,
so I brought you some wine.

249
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,010
If you drink a moderate amount,
it's supposed to help you sleep well.

250
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,200
Thanks.

251
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,370
-Do you want to come in?
-Sure.

252
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,300
Do you want some too?

253
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,980
No, I said I'd be home soon,
so I have to go.

254
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,150
Anyway, it's not because
something is bothering you, right?

255
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,650
It's not.

256
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,060
-Should I leave it there?
-Yes.

257
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,150
Have a glass of wine, then sleep well.

258
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,470
Okay.

259
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,160
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,110
What's this? It's very antique.

261
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,110
Antique? It's just a very old article.

262
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,070
Yes, that means it's antique.

263
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,570
Oh, really?

264
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,810
It looks really old.
Did you get it from your mom?

265
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't have a mom.

266
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,840
I see. Then was it from your dad?

267
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,550
I don't have a dad either.

268
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,340
-Did they pass away?
-I never had any.

269
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,840
What?

270
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,750
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,610
She had no family.

272
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,640
She must've been lonely.

273
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,810
All right. From now on,
I'm going to stay by her side.

274
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,580
I won't ever let her be alone.

275
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,850
What's this?

276
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,140
[Commissioner of Seoul Regional
Military Manpower Administration]

277
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,100
Military Manpower Administration?

278
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,110
My gosh. You startled me.

279
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,110
Why did you suddenly come?

280
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,490
I suddenly wanted to grab a drink.

281
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,750
Then come in through the door.

282
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,030
I wanted to see

283
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,330
if I could still use magic.

284
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,790
You must be unbelievably troubled
to be drinking, on top of that, with me.

285
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,250
It was a relief to have you around.

286
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,070
Are you

287
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,230
saying that to me right now?

288
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes, you.

289
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,930
I know you're concerned about me.

290
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,630
You disappeared, then showed up again
right before my 1,000th year

291
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,280
because you were worried about me.

292
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,520
I know that.

293
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,580
Thank you for everything.

294
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,900
Don't do that.

295
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,160
Don't say goodbye
as if this is your last moment.

296
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,400
Let me ask you for a favor.

297
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,460
I'm going to share the truth

298
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
with Miss Dam.

299
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,140
So...

300
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,680
I think the end is near.

301
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,300
Then in your opinion,

302
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,600
what do you think makes a good breakup?

303
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,940
That was an awful prank.

304
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,830
Well, it's...

305
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,820
Wasn't it a prank

306
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,810
when he suddenly disappeared?

307
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,230
Come in.

308
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,270
What? Weren't you staying with Soo-kyung
until summer break? Why are you here?

309
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,870
I wanted to focus on my studies,
so I came home.

310
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,140
I see.

311
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,520
Anyway, is my brother-in-law leaving?

312
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,700
-No, why?
-When he came to help me,

313
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,590
he asked me to look after you.

314
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,340
And he sounded like someone
who's about to go somewhere far away.

315
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,530
Dam!

316
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,330
[I can't bring myself to tell you]

317
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,190
[when I'm with you.]

318
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,780
[So I write this letter hoping
you won't ever have to see this.]

319
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,150
[It seems like I'll have to let go]

320
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,970
[of this long life I lived.]

321
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,090
[Yes.]

322
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,220
[I've lived this life]

323
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,860
[for such a long time.]

324
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,820
[I've been through too much.]

325
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,640
[I was tired of everything
as if I have stayed up all night.]

326
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,660
[At times,
I felt weary to face another day.]

327
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,280
[Things were like that
until the moment I met you.]

328
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,050
[You were my only joy,]

329
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,860
[the only reason
why I waited to face another day.]

330
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,250
[Perhaps I knew from the beginning.]

331
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,850
[That you would]

332
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,060
[change my destiny.]

333
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,510
Sir, I'm on my way right now.

334
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,660
And you know,

335
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,430
did you mean something else

336
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,360
when you said the end is near?

337
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,820
I have a weird feeling about this.

338
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,660
Sir.

339
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,350
Sir!

340
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,080
[Perhaps I knew from the beginning.]

341
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,960
[That you would]

342
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,430
[change my destiny.]

343
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,170
[That you would]

344
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,780
[bring meaning into my meaningless]

345
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,720
[and worthless life.]

346
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,880
[I can't bring myself to tell you
when I'm with you.]

347
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,620
My sir disappeared.

348
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,890
He was trying to save me. It's my fault.

349
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,050
It's not your fault.

350
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,160
If anything, we should blame destiny.

351
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,270
Don't blame yourself.

352
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,910
There's no such thing as destiny!

353
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,790
He promised he'd stay by my side.
This is just not fair.

354
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,300
[I can't bring myself to tell you
when I'm with you.]

355
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,900
Dam, aren't you going to eat?

356
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,930
What's wrong?

357
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,210
Wait. Why is he...

358
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,360
He's not gone yet.

359
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,780
If I wait,

360
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,550
he might come back.

361
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,440
[I needed the vain hope ]

362
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,090
[to hold on]

363

[to get through the times. ]

364
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,560
It's spring.

365
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,340
[Spring came,]

366
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,380
[but I didn't feel warm at all.]

367
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,010
[I was still living in the cold winter.]

368
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,790
Until when will you stay here?

369
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,830
Until he comes back.

370
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,470
He's not coming back.

371
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,460
He can't.

372
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,170
Now I get why he asked me this favor.
He knew you'd be silly like this.

373
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,380
"Favor"?

374
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,580
What do you mean?

375
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,800

376

after I disappear,

377
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,600
could you erase her memories
using your Marble?

378
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,330
Do you even hear yourself?

379
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,460
You know how hard it was
for me to turn the Marble blue.

380
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,300
The mountain spirit is
granting me one wish,

381
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,710
and you want me to use it for you?

382
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,280
You know what?
I’ve been saving that blue Marble

383
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,040

384
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,840
just in case

385
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,270
I have trouble with the human society.

386
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,480
Why don't you try
to become a human instead?

387
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,040
Don't give up until the end.

388
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm sorry. Please do me the favor.

389
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,900
This is the final decision he made
after living 1,000 years.

390
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,140
He wants you to be happy

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,910
I can't believe this happened.

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,820
Why are you crying?

415
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,930
-I'm so relieved.
-What?

416
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,480
-It's okay.
-I thought he was really dead.

417
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,080
He's not. It's okay.

418

No. I'm the one who is crying every night.

Hye-sun doesn't know about it yet.

427
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,000
I couldn't tell her.

428
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,330
Not yet? What were you thinking?

429
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,580
Did you tell her
why you were taking a year off then?

430
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,570
I just said I had a situation.

431
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,480
The thing is, whenever I told my exes
that I was going to the army,

432
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,630
they dumped me right away.

433

to break up with me too.

-Ghosts.

-I'm afraid of ghosts.
-What? Ghosts?

438

Yes. I'm usually a tough man,
so I understand this may look odd,

439
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,130
but in fact, I'm very scared of ghosts.

They're so scary.

442
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,330
Of course. They take humans' livers.

443

Gosh, it creeps me out.

444
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,340
[I didn't take any human's liver,]

445
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,730

a secret that I was a Gumiho.]

the secret at some point.]

Right. Professor Shin is back, so I guess
she's busy hanging out with him.

450

He must be busy.

451
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,490

so many things he wants to do.

"Reborn"?

453
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,790
Well, that distant cousin of mine
was seriously ill.

454
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,070
He didn't want to worry Dam,

455
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,400
so he didn't tell her
he was going abroad to get treatment.

he's practically reborn.

467

I'm not pushing myself.

While I was away,

469
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,710
I endured the time, thinking about
queuing with you for restaurants.

470
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,520
Thank you for waiting.

How did you stir-fry the octopus

492
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,890
What's important is

493
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,010
that I managed to quell the fire
without panicking.

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,180

come and renovate this place.

495

Obviously you worked really hard for it.
So I can't even nag at you.

-Shrimp.

How could you do this to a person
who almost died?

509
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,110
I'm in my senior year.
I should work myself to death.

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,430
I need to get a job soon.

511
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,850
I envy you. You don't need to get a job.

512
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,320
I'm getting a job too.

513
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,670
But I can't change my career so often
any more, so I'll be careful.

514
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,830
Then why don't you continue to write?

515
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,730
Many people liked your writing.

516
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,490
You got a lot of comments too.

517
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,560

-Yes.

519
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,460
"This is so stupid.
Has the writer ever learned history?"

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,970
-Let me...
-No, I don't think that's necessary.

522
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,760
Kids these days are so spoiled.

523
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,930
Back in the days,
you had to walk all the way

00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,600
to the capital city to file complaints.

525
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,250
But now, all you need to do
is to type the keyboards.

526
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,090
Sir, you're a human now.
Why don't you stop talking about the past?

00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,510
It's already past 10 p.m.

00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,620
You should go to bed now.
You must be tired.

529
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,740
Why do I have to go to bed early?
I'm not a child.

530
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,950
Well, you're not nocturnal any more,
so I thought you might be tired.

531
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,630
Tired? I'm just as healthy
as I was before.

532
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,530
I've been exercising
for a thousand years to stay fit.

533
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,310
Right. Speaking of which,
let me bring you some healthy tea.

534
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,220
Why are you taking vitamins?
You said you were just as healthy.

535
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,700
I'm taking it for you.

536
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,340
Taking care of each other's health
was also on your bucket list.

537
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,020
Oh, I see. You did it for me.

538
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,890
Looks like Seon-woo is
leaving for good tomorrow.

539
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,100
Until now, he was only visiting the place
for the meetings and all.

540
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,190
Have you been in touch with him?

541
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,190
What? I read it in the group chat.

542
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,110
Awesome.

543
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,520
I can use your room now.

544
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,070
Your room is bigger
and your desk is better than mine.

545
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,420
What's the point of having a good desk
when you never sit at it?

546
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,290
You're like a trip I look forward to.

547
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,240
Because I want you to leave
as soon as possible.

548
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,750
Be nice to your brother.

549
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,020
Come on and get in.

550
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,920
Take this and get lost.

551
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,470
[I have too many things to carry anyway.
You can have it if you like.]

552
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,190
Seon-woo.

553
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,970
Seon-woo.

554
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,620
Seon-woo.

555
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,690
Seon-woo.

556
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,850
I'm happy, but I'm sad.

557
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,060
I'm sad, but I'm happy.

558
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,860
This is all because
of that Dan or whatever's sister.

559
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,460
If only she didn't dump my brother,

560
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,480
he wouldn't have had to leave so sadly.

561
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,050
My bag! Hey!

562
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,460
Give me my bag!

563
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,770
-Hey! Stop there!
-Throw it.

564
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,510
-Hey.
-Darn it.

565
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,130
See if you got everything.

566
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,970
-Congratulations.
-Cheers.

567
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,050
-This is nice.
-You can drink as much as you like.

568
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,910
I promised I'd buy him 100 bottles
of champagne when he becomes a human.

569
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,610
I would like to ring the silver bell
if there was one here.

570
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,540
You mean, the golden bell.

571
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,510
You'd better treat me well.

572
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,590
Since I became a human first,
I have a lot of useful tips to offer.

573
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,910
I don't know.

574
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,690
You may have become a human first,
but your case was much easier.

575
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,060
So I'm not sure about that.

576
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,690
-What?
-Goodness.

577
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,730
You see,

578
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,150
my hand almost disappeared,
and my Marble cracked.

579
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,650
I experienced all kinds of bad omens

580
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,240
and even nearly died
before I finally became a human.

581
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,650
Compared to that,

582
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,640
I feel like you didn't do anything.

583
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,300
You feel like I didn't do anything?
I went through a lot too.

584
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,550
Breaking up with a man tore my heart out,
but then I fell in love again.

585
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,930
Then I got my heart broken again.
Then I fell in love again.

586
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,220
If I had collected all the tears I shed
to become a human,

587
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,580
it would've made a whole river.

588
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,460
And you got lucky
because of the mountain spirit's trap.

589
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,270
-I got lucky?
-Am I wrong?

590
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,090
It was a test to see
if you would sacrifice your life for her,

591
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,890
and you fell for it.

592
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,310
Stop acting like you're so cool
because you're not.

593
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,500
I'm not just acting.

594
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,540
I was willing to sacrifice my life
for someone I love.

595
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,960
I learned how to love, to be patient,
and to sacrifice.

596
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,680
So I found a reason to live,
which means I acquired humanity...

597
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,400
I can't hear you.

598
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,450
-I'm not done yet...
-I can't hear you.

599
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,530
Come on. Every time I hear this story,
it touches my heart.

600
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,850
I especially like the part

601
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,190
that hearing me cry woke you up.

602
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,180
It means you could come back
because I waited for you.

603
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,300
Right, Woo-yeo?

604
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,060
That's right, Dam.

605
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,500
When is Jae-jin coming?

606
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,920
Why don't you talk about
your sweet story when you're alone?

607
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,220
Let me go get some water.

608
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,600
-I'll go get some water.
-I'll come with you.

609
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,490
You take care of this. Okay?

610
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,730
Take care of what?

611
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,150
Gosh.

612
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,350
Well, it is kind of nice

613
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,990
that they're unswayed by it.

614
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,780
I don't like having secrets either.

615
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,630
Hye-sun.

616
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,530
Jae-jin, what took you so long?

617
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,850
You've been away for so long.

618
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,570
I don't want you to get sick tomorrow,

619
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,730
so I got you some hangover pills.

620
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,010
[Maybe I should tell him now.]

621
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,680
[Even if I get dumped after that.]

622
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,880
[I should tell her now.]

623
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,990
[Even if she dumps me after that.]

624
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,710
-Actually...
-Actually...

625
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,050
You go first.

626
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,790
-I used to be a Gumiho.
-What?

627
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,120
I was a Gumiho for over 700 years

628
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,270
until I became a human five years ago.

629
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,030
You seem quite drunk.
You should take the pills.

630
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,270
I'm not drunk. It's true.

631
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,530
That's why I don't have parents or family.

632
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,310
Believe it or not, that is how it is.

633
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,710
If you don't like that,
we can just break up.

634
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,830
Hye-sun, why would you say that?

635
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,520
Whether this is a joke
or your drunk talk, I don't care.

636
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,460
Even if you actually used to be a Gumiho.

637
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,070
-What?
-Even if you're still a Gumiho,

638
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,390
I really don't care.

639
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,080
I can give you my liver and everything.

640
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,230
I probably shouldn't be saying this
in this situation.

641
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,770
I don't want to burden you.

642
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,130
What about the situation?

643
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,120
Right. You also wanted
to say something to me.

644
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,400
What is it?

645
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,300
The thing is...

646
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,200
-I'm entering the army.
-What?

647
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,090
When?

648
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,410
The day after tomorrow.

649
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,320
Why are you saying this now?

650
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,780
I was afraid you would break up with me
when I say it.

651
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,010
Jae-jin.

652
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,480
Why would you say that?

653
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,080
How long is it these days?

654
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,760
About a year and a half.

655
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,530
Compared to 700 years, that's nothing.

656
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,300
-I'll wait.
-What?

657
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,280
It's okay. I don't want to trouble you.

658
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,580
You don't want me to wait then?

659
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,440
I want you to wait.

660
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,130
I'll be a cool man when I'm back.

661
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,500
You're not so bad already.

662
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,730
My, Jae-jin!

663
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,320
Oh, no. Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

664
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,480
-I'm just messing with you.
-Hey!

665
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,820
You and Hye-sun seem like
really good friends.

666
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,760
You may say mean things to each other,

667
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,180
but she was really happy
when you came back as a human.

668
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,790
Well, she wouldn't have been
happier than me though.

669
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,440
To be honest, I was really scared.

670
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,730
I was afraid you might never come back.

671
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,980
I was afraid too

672
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,240
that I might never be able
to come back to you.

673
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,660
What's the biggest change you noticed
since you've become a human?

674
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,310
Sometimes, I realize I didn't know
how chilly the air was at night.

675
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:56,670
And

676
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,910
sometimes, I want to sleep until late.

677
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,600
[Actually, nothing much has changed.]

678
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,750
[My heart still flutters when I see you.]

679
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,940
Hey, Dan.

680
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,900
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

681
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,200
[Strawberry Milk]

682
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,320
Thanks. But why would you congratulate...

683
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,590
I don't like talkative men.

684
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,440
-Why are you suddenly holding...
-Shush.

685
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,330
I don't like questions either.

686
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,580
You got some money as a prize,
so tteokbokki is on you.

687
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,650
I didn't know we were that close.

688
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,020
We are. Starting today.

689
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,130
Because

690
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,150
I'm going out with you starting today.

691
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,750
-What?
-Let's go.

692
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,680
Wait. Why so suddenly...

693
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,140
We really don't have much time left now.

694
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,420
I know.

695
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,730
Hold on a second.

696
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,500
I made a list of good restaurants.

697
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,670
[List of Good Restaurants]

698
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,240
And this is a first-aid kit.

699
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,200
Please don't get sick while I'm gone.

00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,090
What do I do?

701
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,560
I'm going to miss you so much.

702
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,200
I really don't want to go.

703
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,260
When I think about
how lonely you'd be alone,

704
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,510
I just don't want to leave.

705
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,850
I see.

706
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,150
[I still want you by my side.]

707
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,660
His username is Handsome Face?

708
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,520
He must be really handsome.

709
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,330
They're friends,

710
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,650
so they must be both handsome.

711
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,590
Right? I'm so excited!

712
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,650
Hello, are you Wingless Angel?

713
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,550
I'm Handsome Face, Kim Moo-geun...

714
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,540
-What are you doing here?
-What's this?

715
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,030
You're Handsome Face?

716
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,970
You should be Gruesome Face!

717
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,420
Delete that dating app right now.

718
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,520
What about you?

719
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,800
You're Wingless Angel?

720
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,050
[Sometimes, something unexpected
may come up]

721
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,770
[and trouble us again.]

722
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,010
So you had a fight and then left?

723
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,490
Hey, grow up.

724
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,740
[Whatever. Are the girls there pretty?]

725
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,330
[If you make a girlfriend in a week,
I'll wire you 100,000 won.]

726
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,870
I don't do bets any more.

727
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,940
[But like I always have,]

728
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,800
[I will change to get along with you.]

729
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,140
Hi, Soo-kyung.

730
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,220
I liked your presentation today.

731
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,580
Right.

732
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,870
I know, but thank you anyway.

733
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,840
I'm sorry.

734
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,600
[You will]

735
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,260
[always be my destiny.]

736
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,580
Miss Dam.

737
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,630
You were supposed to keep the Marble,
not fall in love with its owner.

738
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,340
You were supposed to steal my energy,
not my heart.

739
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,740
Then

740
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,200
since we ended up falling in love
despite death,

741
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:14,500
let's stay together for a long time.

742
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,890
Shall we go home now?

743
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:31,000
Yes. Let's go home.

744
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,000
[Thank you for watching
My Roommate is a Gumiho.]

745
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,770
[Bye, Gumiho.]

746
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,340
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]
