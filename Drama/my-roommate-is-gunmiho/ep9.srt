00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,160
Dan, you should marry into my family.

15
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,360
You don't have a sister.

16
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,820
You can have my brother.

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,340
Stop talking nonsense.

18
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,490
Why are you here?

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,650
I was about to get off the taxi,

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,680
then my eyes met with Jae-gang's eyes
as he was coming back from work.

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,930
He said he'll kill me
if I ever come home hammered again.

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,300
So I stayed in the taxi
and came straight here.

23
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,470
I opened the door for him thinking
he was with you, but he was alone.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,460
He insisted on having a drink with you,
but I managed to put him to sleep.

25
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,900
He said he needed the bed,
so he slept on mine without showering.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,110
My brother, don't be so critical of me.

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,100
You'll be exactly like me
once you go to college.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,220
My gosh, why are you cursing me?

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,250
Anyway, why were you late?

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,580
I fell asleep thinking you'd be back soon.

31
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,550
Oh, I was out taking a walk.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,900
Goodness, why can't you come home earlier?

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,879
Think of your family who's waiting.

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,100
Hey, that's not for you to say
after that trouble you caused yesterday.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,780
Trouble?

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,760
What trouble?

37
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,820
Really? I really broke Hye-sun's car?

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm telling you.

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,960
Wait, and not only was that car expensive,

40
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,810
but Professor Shin was there too?

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,490
Yes.

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,390
Anyway, you should call Hye-sun.

43
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,790
Hey, how can you be so calm
when your friend is about to go bankrupt?

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,860
You're bust, not me.

45
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,810
Darn it, my life is over.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,590
Dam, can you tell my brothers

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,500
that it was a pure accident
that I got hammered and broke that car?

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,820
They really adore you.

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,750
Stop pestering me. Go away.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,910
Dam, you know that I love you, right?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,070
I don't need your love.

Let's begin the class.

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,080

Open up to page 201.
Today's subject is philosophy of history.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,680
[I like someone else.]

56
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,880
[Is it Jae-jin?]

May I borrow a pencil?

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,060
Thank you so much.

59

[He's her type?
But she could do much better.]

60
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,880
[I think I'm better than him.]

61
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,670
We must continuously attempt
to observe human history as a whole.

[Seogwa University]

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,100
This is an effort to explain
the essence and meaning of history.

64
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,350
That's why the philosophy of history

65
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,130
has become important.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
[I should not be curious.]

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,220
[I'll watch over her for a short while,]

68

[then I must move out of her life.]

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,209
[There's nothing I can do,]

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,120
[nor should I try to do anything.]

-Thank you, Professor.
-Thank you, Professor.

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,560
Professor.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,990
Are you coming to the history trip
with our department tomorrow?

75
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,140
I have an important meeting to attend.

76
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,680
You have to come with us
on our next trip, then.

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,710
-Are you going to meet with Hye-sun?
-Why is he meeting her?

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,630
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,150
I just feel really bad.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,150
Was it that devastating
to run into your ex-girlfriend?

81
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,580
So much so that you drank up
every single drop of alcohol in Seoul?

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
Well, I guess.

83
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,750
How much was the estimate?

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,209
The estimate?

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,830
Oh, I threw that car away.

86
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,280
You threw it away?

87
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,530
I thought
I only broke the side-view mirror.

88
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,850
You're right.

89
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,270
But I never get anything fixed.

90
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,850
I see.

91
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,190
Then how much do I owe you?

92
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,840
[Is she going to demand
I pay everything for her new car?]

93
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,640
[Then what do I say to my brothers?]

94
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,460
[It might be safer
for me to sell my kidney off.]

95
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,260
-Jae-jin.
-Yes?

96
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,250
Don't get scared.
I won't ask you to pay me back.

97
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,520
What?

98
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,060
Just forget it.

99
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,450
I recently became fond of white cars,
so I got a new one with this chance.

100
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,670
But still, that's a little...

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,310
A little what? You don't have any money.

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,470
-How can you tell?
-By the way you look.

103
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,590
Right.

104
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,950
But still, let me chip in a little.

105
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,490
I'll ask my brothers

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,780
or work to make
a couple hundred thousand won.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
It's great that
you're letting me off like this,

108
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,880
but I know I'd always feel sorry for this.

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,060
[What an oddball.]

110
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,680
[Most people tend to run off
before I change my mind.]

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,400
It's fine.

112
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,390
I don't need your pocket money.

113
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,750
I'm leaving.

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,300
See you at the history trip
or whatever tomorrow.

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,060
Wait, Hye-sun.

116
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,190
Can you come with me for a second?

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,600
To where?

118
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,630
Hey, Hye-sun.

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,590
Since you seem to have
all the money you could want,

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,790
I want to pay you back
by doing something else.

121
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,750
First off, I brought you a book
that might help you. Here.

122
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,959
Are you calling me stupid?

123
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,550
No, you aren't stupid at all.

124
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,380
I just wanted to do everything I can
to pay you back.

125
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll be good to you
until the day I don't feel sorry.

126
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,200
Hello, Professor.
Please excuse my behavior from yesterday.

127
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,710
I'm sorry you had to see that.

128
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,080
Young man.

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,200
You shouldn't drink so much
and cause trouble to Dam...

130
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,490
And cause inconvenience
to people around you.

131
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,880
Yes, sir. I'll be careful from now on.

132
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,530
[That's called jealousy.]

133
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,550
Be honest with me.
You were jealous to see them together.

134
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,060
Did you lose your conscience
when you lost your Marble?

135
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,609
Not only did you fall for such a kid,

136
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,770
but you also got jealous of another kid.

137
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,490
You're far from
becoming a decent human in many ways.

138
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,680
What? What do you want?
What can you do anyway?

139
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,170
What I said is true.

140
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,830
You once said that

141
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,110
we never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

142
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,960
You're right.

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
I've seen that bad ending once before,

144
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,410
then I lived for a very long time
without showing affection to anybody.

145
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,420
Everything seemed futile since that day,

146
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,810
and I couldn't see any hope.

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,830
What's going on?
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

148
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,370
You were in pain every time
you were in love.

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,420
So how did you
let yourself fall back in love?

150
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,250
What do you think about him?

151
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,950
Are you setting me up with him?
He's not my type.

152
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
You're insane.

153
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,590
I just want to know how he seems

154
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,010
compared to me.

155
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
In a nutshell, you want to know
which one of you two is better.

156
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,130
You're better.

157
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,060
Honestly speaking,
if you keep your mouth shut,

158
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,650
you'd usually be the hottest guy.

159
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,840
Really?

160
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,120
Hey, go buy yourself
something you want to eat.

161
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,290
If I wasn't your sister,
I'd date you right away.

162
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,850
You have huge eyes and a cute dimple too.

163
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
He can't be compared to you.

164
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,210
You didn't have to go that far.

165
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,400
Here.

166
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,080
So what happened?

167
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,780
Did someone say he's better?
Who's this crazy witch?

168
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,980
Cut it out before I take it back.

169
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,560
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,940
Please excuse me.

171
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,270
Well, yes. He's not even in my league.

172
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,310
How are things going with Seon-woo?

173
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,710
I set you up on a date with him.

174
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,690
Wasn't I right? Isn't he interested?

175
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,090
So? Are you going to date him?

176
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,820
Did you tell him about a close guy friend
that comes and sleeps over?

It's for my presentation.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,850

You used to love going on history trips

186
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,140
as if you were
on an anniversary trip with a boyfriend.

187
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,270
You'd pack your cameras and bags
a week before.

188

Are things not going well with Seon-woo?

194
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,770
Yes, it's disrespectful
for history and artifacts

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,910
I went shopping for this trip.
So? How do I look?

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,540
You need a pretty face to look pretty.

-Yes.

It must be tough
to be the student representative.

Don't mention it. I'll see you later.

"I'll see you later, Professor, TA."

214
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,200
It looks like
you're dying to do some Seok bashing.

Hey, be honest.

Professor Seo only adores Seok,

222
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,600
so I wanted to make sure
I get on Professor Shin's good side.

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,640
He had an important meeting to attend.

It's a huge relief.

Professor Shin was there too.

230
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,360
Why was he there?

231
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,880
No idea. I'm not really sure,
but he was in Hye-sun's car.

232
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,660
Wait, why would a professor
meet with a student outside of school?

What? I was going to eat that.

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,780

she never had any Korean chicken.

It's all right. You can be honest.

353
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,940
I sent it to you to make you come.

354
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,980
Anyway, if you like her so much,

355
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,060
why don't you hurry and turn into a human
so you can meet her again?

356
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,530
What's on your mind?

357
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,740
You drove down at once to see her,
but you look so gloomy.

358
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,350
I'm concerned about something.

359
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,990
Concerned? What are you concerned about?

360
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,350
Yes.

361
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,700
Yes, I understand. Yes, Ms. TA.

362
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,330
There has been a change
in our next destination.

363
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,960
Why? Is there a problem?

364
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,640
There was a rockslide
near Songni Mountain,

365
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,310
so we can't make it to Beopju Temple.

366
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,270
Then where are we going?

367
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,520
-Take one for me too.
-All right!

368
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,190
-Stop that.
-I want one with Seon-woo too.

369
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,040
-Let's take a picture.
-Let's do that.

370
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,970
-Let's do it over there.
-Okay.

371
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,130
-Okay.
-Let's take one too, Seon-woo.

372
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,330
-All right.
-Okay!

373
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,440
Seon-woo, let's take a picture.

374
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,430
[I had no idea he brought me here
to erase my memories,]

375
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,050
[so I wished
we could come back here together.]

376
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,710
[I must've looked ridiculous]

377
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,040
[as I wished for the impossible.]

378
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,190
Why are you staring at her?
Do you like her that much?

379
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,920
I don't think her memories are erased.

380
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,290
Right, I'm sure her memories aren't...

381
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,330
What?

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,100
It's carved with many shapes
such as dragons, lotuses, and more.

383
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,350
When you touch it, it...

384
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,340
"Touch it"?

385
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,190
Right.

386
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,220
I meant that it's so exquisite
that it feels like I've touched it.

387
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,190
That's impossible.

388
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,840
If she knows everything,
there's no reason for her to pretend.

389
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,700
That's true, but...

390
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,910
Hye-sun, try this.

391
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,840
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

392
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,250
-Thanks.
-Don't.

393
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,240
-Gosh, it's so good.
-I'll do it.

394
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,780
No, it's okay. I will.

395
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,060
No, I'll do it.

396
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,150
Hey, what's going on between you two?

397
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,960
Do I smell love instead of pork belly?
Good luck!

398
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,340
-Seon-woo.
-Our meat is a mess too.

399
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,670
-It's completely burnt.
-Take a seat.

400
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,930
-A random game that we love.
-A random game that we love.

401
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,520
-Which game? Game, start.
-Which game? Game, start.

402
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,730
Hey, are you sharing your soju with me?

403
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,920
What? You're drunk.

404
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,990
No, are you sharing your soju with me?

405
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,570
You're so drunk.

406
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,130
-I'm not drunk.
-Don't drink too much.

407
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,770
I've had just enough. It wasn't that much.

408
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,230
Do you know what it's like to get drunk?

409
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm not drunk.

410
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,330
Where are you going?

411
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,400
To get some air.

412
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,610
Hye-sun.

413
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,170
I have a question.

414
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,590
Why did you

415
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,020
speak casually with the professor?

416
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,700
I did? Did I do that?

417
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,730
Yes, you did.

418
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,670
She did, right? Didn't she?

419
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,930
Hey, Hye-sun used to live abroad,

420
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,220
so the Korean language isn't easy for her.

421
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,280
You're so drunk.

422
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,020
Come on out. Let's get some fresh air.

423
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,090
Come. I'll buy you ice cream.

424
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,350
Okay! Dam, I'll be back.

425
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,780
Hey, Hye-sun.

426
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,210
May I ask you a question?

427
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,020
What is it?

428
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,220
Well.

429
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,420
You said you and Professor Shin
got into an accident, right?

430
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,570
What happened?

431
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,970
It was just a minor collision.

432
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,920
I drove into his car
and caused the accident,

433
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,860
so I gave him a ride.

434
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,100
I see.

435
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,290
Why do you want to know?

436
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,770
No, it's nothing.

437
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,880
Where's my wallet?

438
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,420
-It's so cold.
-It's really gone.

439
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,540
Why do you always lose your wallet?

440
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,650
-It's really gone.
-Come on.

441
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
Guys, I'm tired. I should go.

442
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, Dam, wait.

443
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,930
I remember putting it in my bag.

444
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,320
You were right. She remembers everything.

445
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,590
She asked why we were together that night.

446
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,920
She's very concerned about you,

447
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,610
which means she must remember everything.

448
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,410
Then why is she...

449
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,000
If that really is the case,
I think I know why.

450
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,150
She must feel the same as I did back then.

451
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,660
Goodness.

452
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,960
[In mourning]

453
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,630
Oh no.

454
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,490
Please erase my memories.

455
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,730
Please, I ask of you.

456
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,980
I guess he passed as we expected.

457
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,460
Do you want me to erase everything?

458
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,890
No, just...

459
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,820
Just leave a little bit behind.

460
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,320
Just enough
so I wouldn't want to kill myself.

461
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,880
She probably didn't want to lose

462
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,540
all the memories she made with you,

463
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,580
so she is trying to hold onto
at least some of them.

464
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,440
Miss Dam.
Do you remember what I said then?

465
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,230
I said I had never had a family,

466
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,040
but I felt like I got one now.

467
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,830
I really meant what I said.

468
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,180
You won't remember a thing.

469
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,480
You just had a short dream.

470
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,890
As of now,

471
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
the contract has ended.

472
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,290
[He looked sad when he said that.]

473
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,730
[Maybe he let me go]

474
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,520
[because he cared about me.]

475
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,520
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

476
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,440
Your memories aren't erased, are they?

477
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,830
I'm not sure what you mean.

478
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,930
You remember everything.

479
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,830
Why do you want to know that, sir?

480
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,600
Miss Dam?

481
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,470
Why do you want to know
if my memories have been erased or not?

482
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,940
Why are you doing this to me?

483
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,440
It's not like I borrowed your money
and never paid you back

484
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,950
or stole your money.

485
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,470
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

486
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,330
[So she actually remembers me.]

487
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,130
I told you I was a clingy person.

488
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,550
So why did you
have to show up like this and...

489
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,480
We need to talk, Miss Dam.

490
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,160
Don't do anything.

491
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,960
Don't talk to me.
Don't act like you know me.

492
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,460
Don't do anything.

493
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,620
You ended it without asking me.
So why are you doing this to me?

494
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,840
Stop worrying about me.

495
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,040
Stop grabbing my hand so randomly.

496
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,800
Because that makes my heart flutter.

497
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,850
What?

498
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,920
Whenever you do that,

499
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,260
my heart pounds like crazy.

500
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,810
Miss Dam.

501
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,160
Tell me, Sir.
Was I nothing but just a Marble carrier?

502
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,520
Was I?

503
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,390
Have you really never had
any feelings for me?

504
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,920
Miss Dam.

505
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,690
The reason why I don't say
what you want to hear

506
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,130
is not because I don't care about you.

507
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,660
It's because you don't deserve me.

508
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,210
You should be with someone
who is safer and more normal.

509
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,810
You are

510
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,150
too good for me.

511
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,280
I don't think I'm too good for you.

512
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,800
And I don't want to be calculative and all

513
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:52,350
because I'm not taking this lightly.

514
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:57,850
I like you.

515
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,220
And I want you to like me too.

516
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,910
[A reckless and bold confession.]

517
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,070
[Now I think about it,
she has always been like this.]

518
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,350
Now that we're on the subject,
I want an agreement too.

519
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,420
I'd like to make three requests.

520
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,289
[She never hesitates and she's daring.]

521
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm 22. Born in 1999,
the Year of the Rabbit.

522
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:31,160
I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign
of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

523
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,570
[Living a thousand years,]

524
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,760
[I have seen, heard,
and touched many things,]

525
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,630
[but I have never felt anything.]

526
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,010
[Just like the sceneries out the window,]

527
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,190
[everything in my life passed by
so fast and hazily.]

528
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,120
[Then I met her, and for the first time,]

529
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,480
[I felt like I fell from clouds]

530
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,810
[and bumped into reality.]

531
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,710
Can we talk about
how we address each other?

532
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,740
How about "sir"?

533
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,500
[I became]

536
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,930
Good morning, Sir.

537
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,620
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

538

[I was no longer a dream
that vanishes after a night.]

539

a part of someone's everyday life.]

541
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,100
Hi, Sir. I'm home.

542
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,260
-Did you have a good day?
-Yes.

543
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,460
[I had someone to wait for,]

544
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,150
[so time stopped
passing by meaninglessly.]

545
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm in love.

546
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,480
[What has possibly
made this girl so bold,]

547
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
[clumsy,]

548

[and true to herself?]

549
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,350
[I found it very silly,
yet at the same time]

550
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,430
[very lovely.]

551
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,580
I warned you

552
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,750
that you're too good for me.

553
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,830
Now,

554
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,130
you can't take it back.

555
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,500
Woo-yeo reminded me
of that stupid memory for nothing.

556
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,740
Hye-sun. What are you doing here alone?

557
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,120
I've been looking for you.

558
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,580
Me? Why?

559
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,610
Why? Because I couldn't find you.

560
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,720
Also, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

561
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,490
-Something to tell me?
-Yes. The thing is,

562
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,440
you said you were fine,
but it kept bothering me,

563
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,520
so I put all my useable items
on the flea market app.

564
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,120
And they just got all sold out.

565
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,230
I think I can at least partly pay back
what I owe to you.

566
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,980
Why can't you be more calculative?

567
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,790
I am being calculative.

568
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,650
I calculated how much I owed you
and I'm paying it back.

569
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,840
Let's say you are then.

570
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,120
It's cold. Let's go now.

571
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,360
Gosh, it's so cold.

572
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,430
What are you doing?
You said you'd pay the money back.

573
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,720
Then you don't need to be
nice to me anymore.

574
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,920
This is not about the money.

575
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,160
I just don't want you to be cold.

576
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,580
I guess this is why your ex was so clingy.

577
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,050
What? What do you mean?

578
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,380
I mean this is good.

-Wait up.
-Stop following me.

-Come on.
-Stop it.

What are you doing?

582
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,010
Why do you think
my memories haven't been erased?

583
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,340
Not sure.

584
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,870
I tried to, but it didn't work out.

585
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,090
Could it be because
I'm a strong-minded person like my mom?

586
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,680
It might be.

587
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,300
Is there anything else you want to ask me?
I can tell you everything.

588
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,550
What's the relationship
between you and Hye-sun?

589
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,590
There seemed to be something
going on between you.

590
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,970
We've just known each other
for a long time.

591
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,440
For over 700 years.

592
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,640
Is Hye-sun a gumiho too?

593
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,700
Not anymore.

594
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,430
She became a human four years ago.

595
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,300
That's why she was too pretty to be true.

596
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,480
Did it bother you?

597
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,350
Of course. So much I had a hard time
pretending to not remember anything.

598
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,140
How did you feel

599
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,260

Come on. Tell me.

602

Were you happy?

603
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,300
Or did you think
you should cast a stronger spell?

604
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,120
Tell me.

605
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,660

I mean we should go home now.

00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,450
I can use magic.

704
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,650
You won't be disappointed.

705
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,350
Why sauna, all of a sudden?

706
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,150
I saw on dramas

707
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,500
that this is where many couples like to go
when they go on dates.

708
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,740
[Sauna date is kind of outdated.]

709
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,500
Why did you talk about magic
when we're coming to a sauna?

710
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,690
According to my research,
this is a perfect place...

711
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,900
because there are nine different rooms
made of nine different ingredients here

712
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,450
that help you with detox.

713
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,350
But there's one problem here.

714
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,520
Currently,

715
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,770
the ice room is out of order.

716
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,540
What?

717
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,110
What does that have anything
to do with your magic?

718
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,090
How about we go and have a look?

719
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,200
[Ice Room]

720
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,950
[Ice Room]

721
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,130
It's warm in here.
I guess you're right. It's out of order.

722
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,990
Sir, you're like Elsa.

723
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,460
I don't know who Ms. Elsa is,

724
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,530
but I can tell from your tone
it's a compliment.

725
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,260
Right. Let me show you something.
Don't be surprised.

726
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,480
Now, you look like a lamb.

727
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,420
[Who does this these days?]

728
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,880
What is the drama that you watched?

729
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,330
"My Lovely Sam Soon".

730
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,180
It's quite a popular one.

731
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,090
It was aired in 2005.

732
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,170
Oh. Time really flies.

733
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,410
Well, you've been living
for almost a thousand years.

734
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,320
I understand
15 years feels like a second to you.

735
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,530
Then saunas were popular...

736
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,020
15 years ago.

737
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,600
It's cold. Shall we go out?

738
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,990
There's this place
I've always wanted to go with you.

739
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,800
With me?

740
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,380
Shall we?

741
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,890
Here's your chicken. Enjoy.

742
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,440
Is this the place you've always wanted
to go with me? A chicken restaurant?

743
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,160
Well...

744
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,980
You couldn't have chicken because of me,

745
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,740
so I wanted to make up for it.

746
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,010
I brought you here because I remembered
this place was crowded,

747
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,820
but now I think about it,
that's more than 40 years ago.

748
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,310
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

749
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,490
I tried to recall
some of my memories for you,

750
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,260
but looks like I failed
to catch up with the latest trend.

751
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,330
I'm sorry.

752
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,840
I messed up our first date.

753
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,600
I love it.

754
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,000
Until yesterday, I couldn't call you Sir
and I thought I would have to act like

755
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,460
we're strangers for the rest of my life.

756
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,530
But today, we're sitting face to face.

757
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,310
No matter what we do
and no matter where we go, I'm happy.

758
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,430
It looks delicious.

759
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,130
Sir, are you hungry?

760
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,370
What?

761
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,790
Because you're staring at me.

762
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,540
This is the first time
that chicken looks tasty to me.

763
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,130
That's because I really enjoy it.

764
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,470
[What was that just now?]

765
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,490
Appetite.

766
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,320
Appetite? What do you mean?

767
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,390
It means it's not necessarily a good thing

768
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,760
that things between you guys
worked out that way.

769
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,020
Think about it.

770
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,410
What do you think will happen
if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

771
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,190
The more you want her,

772
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,610
the bigger your appetite will grow.

773
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,300
[Miss Dam, where are you?]

774
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,300
[Sir]

775
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,080
[I'm on my way to the library.]

776
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,800
[Miss Dam: I'm on my way to the library.]

777
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,980
[Can I see you later for a second?]

778
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:49,930
[Sir: Can I see you later for a second?]

779
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:47,200
[I'm afraid that will be difficult today.]

780
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,800
[I need to do some research
for the group project.]

781
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,160
[I know you don't eat,
but enjoy your lunch.]

782
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,640
I miss her already.

783
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,020
Ta-da. Surprise!

784
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,730
You don't look surprised.

785
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,070
I came because I missed you.

786
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,510
Could you at least
act like you're surprised?

787
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,990
Wait.

788
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,570
Wait.

789
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,810
I...

790
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,380
This doesn't mean I don't like it.
I'm just surprised.

791
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,830
[Think about it.]

792
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,700
[What do you think will happen
if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?]

793
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:56,200
[The more you want her,
the bigger your appetite will grow.]

794
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,020
You've been cultivating yourself
for over a thousand years,

795
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,690
but there's nothing you can do about it.

796
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,110
You always crave human energy.

797
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,930
As long as you're a gumiho
and she's a human,

798
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,480
your love will never work out.

799
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,990
[You'll have to keep walking a fine line]

800
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,820
[between love and hunger.]

801
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,380
Sir.

802
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,640
[We appreciate Son Sung-yoon and
Lee Kyu-sung for their guest appearance.]

803
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,450
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

804
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,950
[I'm not sure why this is happening
all of a sudden.]

805
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,730
Do you want to know how to solve it?

806
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,490
Don't touch her.

807
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,330
[Platonic love...]

808
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,090
-Today's lecture has been canceled.
-What?

809
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,120
[I hope nothing bad happened
to Professor Shin.]

810
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,260
Sir.

811
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,870
[One thing is for sure.
You barely know who he is]

812
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,670
and what we are.

813
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,670
[If you lose more energy,
you can be in danger.]

814
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,310
[For the time being...]

815
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,080
[Let's stay away from each other.]
