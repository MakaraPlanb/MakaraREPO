00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,719
Anyway, this is new.

183
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,015
You don't seem like the type
who'd be at a club.

184
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,009
Now that we're here,

185
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,455
why don't we dance to the rhythm?

186
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,355
Why? Professor, you should stay.

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,835
Instead of History 101,
let's do Dance 101...

188
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,675
Man, why isn't Dam's ex texting back?

189
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,005
He's done with her for good.

190
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,689
Dam.

191
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,969
Let's go dance.

192
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,675
You can completely forget
about your ex-boyfriend.

193
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,249
Okay? Let's go.

194
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,885
Let's go.

195
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,365
Goodness, why can't I push this?

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,655
Be careful.

197
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,025
Thank you.

198
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,115
That could've been bad.

199
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,635
Sir.

200
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,535
Why are you here?

201
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,235
Because you were crying.

202
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,625
No matter how much I like you,

203
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,705
we have to stop here, right?

204
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,525
Our relationship

205
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,845
is putting other people in danger
as well as us.

206
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,485
Then we should stop here.

207
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,475
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

208
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,775
How could I?

209
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,704
I know how much pain I could put you in

210
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,045
better than anyone else.

211
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,035
I'm sorry

212
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,605
for liking you.

213
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,565
Dam.

214
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,889
You need to wake up.
You have an early class.

215
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,955
Hey.

216
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,009
How did I get home last night?

217
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,705
What do you think? You came home wasted.

218
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,425
You blacked out again?

219
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,195
You shouldn't drink so much.

220
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,345
Come out. I made some bean sprout soup.

221
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,555
Was that a dream?

222
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,935
Drink this. You don't look too well.

223
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,735
Are you okay?

224
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,495
Seon-woo.

225
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,655
Could you keep what happened

226
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,425
between Professor Shin and me a secret?

227
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,669
Things are already tough,

228
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,195
so I don't think
I could deal with all kinds of rumors.

229
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,535
I won't tell anyone.

230
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,655
You didn't have to ask me.

231
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,775
Thank you.

232
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,105
It would've been better

233
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,885
if he was a good guy.

234
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,165
If he was such a good man
who was way out of my league,

235
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,215
I think I could've given up.

236
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,215
What are you going to do?

237
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,775
We need to talk.

238
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,365
Have you met with Dam?

239
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,565
She can't seem to understand you?

240
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,855
I have no idea what to do.

241
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,835
Woo-yeo.

242
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,955
What do you think
Dam wants the most right now?

243
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,245
A breakup?

244
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,685
What are you talking about?
You two are over already.

245
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,109
Do you think
she'd be scared of you at this point?

246
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,665
She's not afraid she'll fall into danger.

247
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,965
She's afraid
you're putting other people in danger.

248
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,865
Well, I did tell you
that you should try using someone else,

249
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,765
but I haven't thought
of how she would feel.

250
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,035
She's human,
so she wouldn't understand this situation.

251
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,725
So if you want to be loved by a human,

252
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,855
shouldn't you show her how humane you are?

253
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,165
Now, look. Let's say you were driving.

254
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,775
Dam is standing on this side,

255
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,245
and there are five people
on the other side.

256
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,929
If the brake gives out and you have
no choice but to hit one of the two,

257
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,389
- what would you do?
- I'd hit the five.

258
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,859
What if one of them is pregnant?

259
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,569
- I don't care.
- What if there's a kid?

260
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,955
- I don't care.
- What if I'm there?

261
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,895
I don't care.

262
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,935
[ How do I turn this guy into a human? ]

263
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,025
[ Would she be better off with Seon-woo,
with the red thread and all? ]

264
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,800
[ Wait, Seon-woo is
as less of a human as him anyway. ]

265
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,919
[ A beast who couldn't become human ]

266
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,770
[ A man who's worse than a beast ]

267
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,089
[ Then the question is ]

268
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,915
[ which one of them will
become a decent human first. ]

269
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,690
[ Who'll become a decent human first? ]

270
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,435
[ To be honest,
this is a pretty fair game. ]

271
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,615
Are you saying I'm wrong?

272
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,785
Then is it right for me to save
those strangers over Miss Dam?

273
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,705
That's not what I meant,
but I thought you'd hesitate a little.

274
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,545
Why should I?

275
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,399
That's what humans are like,

276
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,785
and I'm sure
that's what she wants from you.

277
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,195
Dam, goodness, you reek of alcohol.

278
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,345
How much did you have to drink?

279
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,745
Let's go relieve our hangover.
I'll buy you soup.

280
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,945
Hey, Hye-sun.

281
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,455
- Let's go.
- I...

282
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,405
I heard Woo-yeo cheated on you.

283
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,855
So you dumped him coldly.

284
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,409
I mean, as you know,
he didn't exactly cheat on me...

285
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,729
Don't take his side.

286
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,245
You two are over,
so you don't have to cover for him.

287
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,225
I can't just be a stranger right away.
My feelings are the same.

288
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,185
At first, I couldn't believe what he did.

289
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,635
But then I kind of understood,
yet I still can't.

290
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,715
I feel like such a fool.

291
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,705
It's not your fault.

292
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,135
But it's not Woo-yeo's fault either.

293
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,579
I don't know what you were expecting,

294
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,169
but he's a fox.

295
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,795
That means he could've deceived you
much better if he wanted to.

296
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,845
He wouldn't have told you
about that red thread

297
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,599
or how he had been

298
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,195
taking your energy
even though he had the Marble.

299
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,695
And those rumors?

300
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,305
It wouldn't have been difficult
for him to get rid of the rumors.

301
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,925
He could've done better in deceiving you.

302
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,565
But he didn't.

303
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,305
He's not human.

304
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,039
But when it comes to you,

305
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,895
he could be humane.

306
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,019
I know that, but...

307
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,185
His Marble is starting to turn blue.

308
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,079
Why is it turning blue?

309
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,405
You didn't know?

310
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,609
Once his Marble turns blue
instead of red by human energy,

311
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,685
he can become human.

312
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,509
His Marble had been stagnant
for about 1,000 years,

313
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,255
but it suddenly turned blue twice
ever since he met you.

314
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,555
And this time, it remained in blue,

315
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,975
although it only changed halfway.

316
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,439
Are you saying
he could really become human?

317
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,945
Do you finally get

318
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,905
why Woo-yeo did something
so out of the ordinary?

319
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,289
Hye-sun, I should go see him.

320
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,525
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,555
Can we talk for a second?

322
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,685
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,615
I don't know everything
about what I need to do

324
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,785
to live as a human,

325
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,475
but if I made you cry,

326
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,075
it means I was wrong. No questions needed.

327
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,365
If it doesn't bother you

328
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,235
that I'm a fox, not human,

329
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,365
then I'll stay this way.

330
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,795
To me,

331
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,045
this relationship isn't
something I can simply let go.

332
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,555
Then that's the more reason
you should've held me back.

333
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,835
If there's someone who can help you,

334
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,939
it should be me, nobody else.

335
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,065
It has to be me. I'm your girlfriend.

336
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,825
Give me the Marble.

337
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,169
- Sorry?
- I don't want you to see anyone else

338
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,425
or put them in danger.

339
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,325
But I also can't ask you to give up.

340
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,519
So give me the Marble.

341
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,119
- I can't do that.
- Why not? I'm fine with it.

342
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,519
I heard the Marble changed colors.

343
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,329
It might hurt you more.

344
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,659
So please don't get that idea
just because of me.

345
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,089
Just because of you?
You aren't just anybody to me.

346
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,015
Calm down, and let's talk again
tomorrow during the day.

347
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,519
No, I want to talk now, in this night.

348
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,885
Give me the Marble.

349
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,295
What? Did he run away?

350
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,060
[ Give me the Marble. ]

351
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,895
[ Miss Dam ]

352
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,360
[ Miss Dam ]

353
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,695
[ We're done discussing this. ]

354
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,905
I'm not done.

355
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,059
I'll help you.

356
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,385

but I haven't seen anyone
who cries because he hates me.

708
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,549
You said you were seeing me
because you liked me.

709
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,399
Why did you lie to me?

710
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,915
I didn't. I do like you.

711
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,195
- What?
- I like you.

712
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,005
I like you. I really do.

713
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,465
But...

714
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,175
as I started to like you more,
it became harder and harder.

715
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,235
I'm supposed to leave you.

716
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,855
You like someone else.

717
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,015
What are you saying? I don't.

718
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,415
- You don't?
- I don't.

719
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,885
- Really?
- Really.

720
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,525
Thank goodness.

721
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,645
I like you, Hye-sun.

722
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,825
- What?
- I like you!

723
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,425
I don't like you.

724
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,685
You're so nice it worries me.

725
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,645
You make me too serious, and I hate that.

726
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,515
Do you still like me?

727
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,975
Yes, I do.

728
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,525
- How's your foot?
- It's fine.

729
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,530
[ Forget about my advice and just give up. ]

730
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,780
[ Hye-sun ]

731
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,020
[ I had no idea
Woo-yeo would hurt Jae-jin. ]

732
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,645
[ Hye-sun ]

733
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,725
I don't think he was the one
who pushed him.

734
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,385
You are fearless.
You could have hurt yourself.

735
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,425
I know. But I did it anyway.

736
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,355
I had to talk to you.

737
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,145
Why do you have to harass him so much?

738
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,505
"Harass"?

739
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,465
I'm looking after him in my own way.

740
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,705
Do you want to know a secret
that no one knows?

741
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,865
Energy is not what makes the Marble blue.

742
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,169
He needs energy to appease his hunger,

743
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,035
but what turns the Marble blue
is something else.

744
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,765
What do you mean?

745
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,675
Oh, no! Jae-jin!

746
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,515
[ You should guess ]

747
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,175
[ what turns the Marble blue. ]

748
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,315
Those that are not human
don't know what it is to be humane.

749
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,755
I wanted him to experience it himself.

750
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,709
I wanted him to learn what it's like
to feel desperate, hurt,

751
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,295
and happy.

752
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,075
Like Hye-sun did.

753
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,695
I don't understand what you're saying.

754
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,435
What turns the Marble blue...

755
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,835
is humanity.

756
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,175
Humanity?

757
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,899
Woo-yeo may think
the Marble finally gave him the answer

758
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,455
after 1,000 years because he met you,

759
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,165
but his Marble
has turned blue once before.

760
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,735
[ When he faced the death
of the first person he cared for ]

761
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,985
[ and learned what sadness was. ]

762
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,915
[ But he rather chose
to close his heart after that, ]

763
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,435
[ and missed the chance
to make his dream come true. ]

764
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,845
[ Then the moment
he got curious about you, ]

765
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,875
You can go back now.

766
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,475
[ the moment he felt bad for you, ]

767
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,735
[ and the moment ]

768
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,485
[ you brought his desire
to become a human back, ]

769
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,255
[ the Marble gave him the answer. ]

770
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,385
So I wanted to stimulate him.

771
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,995
I upset him. I frustrated him.

772
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,199
I put him in a situation he didn't want

773
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,845
where he didn't have to give you
the Marble to earn energy,

774
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,235
thinking those might help.

775
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,235
I have always felt bad for him,

776
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,135
and I still do.

777
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,819
Why didn't you say this to him?

778
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,785
Just because you know where you're headed
doesn't mean you can get there.

779
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,115
Then why are you telling me this?

780
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,215
Because I think you may be able
to find the way.

781
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,985
Do you want a hint?

782
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,975
A hint?

783
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,815
[ Some take off their jackets
when the wind is strong, ]

784
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,615
[ while some take off their jackets
when the sun shines warmly. ]

785
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,015
Which type do you think Woo-yeo is?

786
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,345
What do you...

787
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,325
What? Where did he go?

788
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,715
You can't just disappear
after saying that.

789
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,889
Anyway, all I need to do

790
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,485
is to take his jacket off.

791
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,385
Miss Dam.

792
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,275
What brings you here?

793
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,565
I'm moving in for the time being.

794
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,885
Let's live together again.

795
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,285
I'm going to make you a human.

796
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,325
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

797
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,919
[ I should hurry and think of a way ]

798
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,159
[ to turn him human
so this happiness lasts long. ]

799
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,579
[ If you haven't eaten yet,
why don't you join us? ]

800
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,815
I can't.

801
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,759
Mr. Do, Chinese is common sense.

802
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,935
I don't like his formal way of speech
and inhumane personality.

803
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,485
[ Without Woo-yeo,
you would have been much happier. ]

804
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,695
- See you later at home.
- "See you at home"?

805
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,535
[ I thought I was not in danger
any more, so... ]

806
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,095
[ I think things are
just about to get dangerous. ]
