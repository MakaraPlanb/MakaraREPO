tie that red thread on me

to tie that on me and give me that dream?

40

Why does he do this to us?

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,040

No, that's not what I meant.
He literally isn't human.

105

He's a sort of non-human.

Then this mountain spirit showed up

110

with a red string of fate in front of him.

111

If you want to tell him
that's not what's important,

115

what can you do to get that point across?

116
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,860
Well, first off,

117
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,870

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,560
No idea. My future would be
way more important than my boyfriend.

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,220
We've gone through so much
with energy, red thread, and whatnot.

179
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,580
You can call it a day and focus on us.

180
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,440
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

181
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,380
One second.

182
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,170
Hey, Dan.

183
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,650
What? The cabbage is coming today?

184
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,800
I thought it was tomorrow.

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,530
No idea. There must've been
a misunderstanding in the order.

186
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,790
What should we do?
They left it in front of our house.

187
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,550
It can't be out there for long.

188
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,230
Okay, I'll carry those back inside.

189
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,930
Well, carrying those in
wouldn't be the end of it.

190
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,830
What? Are you telling me
to make kimchi alone?

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm sorry. I have an important tournament,

192
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,990
[and I'll be really late
after I finish analyzing the game.]

193
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,590
You can't let salted cabbage be
for too long.

194
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,610
Hang up for now.

195
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,590
Sir, I'm sorry.

196
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,810
We'll have to reschedule our date.

197
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm even feeling cold
now that I'm a human.

198
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,760
I used to go around fine

199
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,790
in the middle of winter
wearing my flimsy hanbok.

200
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,570
That's why he can never date.

201
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,950
Have you all heard
about Hye-sun and Jae-jin's relationship?

202
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,930
Yes, we've heard.

203
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,350
The boys in our department were shocked,

204
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,590
then they got wasted.

205
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,820
You talk as if you didn't.

206
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,180
You were the worst case.

207
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,430
-I thought you lost your country.
-Hey.

208
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,550
But doesn't this seem odd?

209
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,780
-What?
-What is?

210
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,130
I mean, it's all too sudden.

211
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,720
And they went public
on the day our grades came out.

212
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,370
Do you think they're pretending to date
because of their grades?

213
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,690
Just to get A pluses?

214
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,840
Exactly.

215
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,250
No way.

216
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,360
Grades are very important these days,

217
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,430
and they wouldn't mess with it.

218
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,270
Exactly. If that's the case,

219
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,180
we should tell the professor
and end their lives.

220
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,500
Then I'll upload it online.

221
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,620
-It'll be a huge scandal.
-They'll have to quit school.

222
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,700
-No way.
-Oh no.

223
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,900
I might end up getting embarrassed

224
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,930
in front of kids who are
700 years younger than me.

225
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,900
-What should I do?
-Hye-sun.

226
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,150
-Are you done with your class?
-What?

227
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,970
I prepared lots of things for you,

228
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,910
but everything got stolen.

229
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,970
Babe, aren't you cold?

230
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,760
"Babe"?

231
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes, babe.

232
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,800
Hold this in your hand
and stay warm in your class.

233
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,020
Even if you get tired,
think of me and stay strong. Okay?

234
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,430
Babe, you're so...

235
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,980
I'll do my best.

[Salted Cabbage, Salted Radish]

237
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,070
It'll take me forever to move these.

238
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,380
This is so much work.

[Salted Cabbage]

240
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,610
Sir.

241
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,200
I thought you could use help.

242
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,210
My gosh.

243
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,500
Thanks for using your power, sir.

244
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,670
Can you make kimchi with magic?

245
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,430
I'm not sure.

246
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,860
Making food requires
a delicate touch of hand,

247
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,270
so there's a limit.

248
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,090
So I wanted to help out myself.

249
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,510
You want to make kimchi?

250
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,740
Of course.

251
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,600
I believe that making kimchi is
a family event,

252
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,760
which means you need many people.

253
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
You can't do it alone, can you?

254
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,510
But it'll be tough
when you actually do it.

255
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,990
I want to do this together.

256
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,360
Something ordinary in your everyday life.

257
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,870
I want to do that with you.

258
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,590
Sure, you can do that.

259
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,740
Gosh, you have the looks
to make everything you want come true.

260
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,520
What should we begin with?

261
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,960
First off, you should
get dressed properly.

262
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,470
Is there a certain outfit?

263
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,900
How should I be dressed to look proper

264
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,050
in this traditional human event
of making kimchi?

265
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,070
Do you have something
in a different color?

266
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,210
Something less flashy, but more classy.

267
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,020
But sir, are you sure you can do this?

268
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,290
Miss Dam, have you heard of an expression,
"a man of uncommon acquirements"?

269
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,850
Of course, someone who's smart
and talented in many ways.

270
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,750
That's who I am.

271
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,330
I've lived for a long time, so I have
much knowledge of traditional dishes,

272
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,020
and I'm also amazingly talented,

273
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,440

It's now the final step.

277

Do it over.

278
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,360
What? Why?

279
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,130
You need to get the seasoning
all the way in.

280
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,810
It's completely white inside.
Are you making white kimchi?

281
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,880
Kimchi must be
very significant for humans.

282
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,740
You've been doing this strenuous work
every single year.

283
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,550
When there's no reward.

284
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,050
Of course, there's a reward.

285
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
There's always a special
and amazing reward

286
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,350
after you make kimchi.

287
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,530
What exactly is this reward?

288
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,130
Ta-da. We have some suyuk here.

289
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,680
Freshly made kimchi
with freshly boiled suyuk.

290
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,090
Isn't it the best reward or what?

291
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,730
I'm not sure.

292
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,930
It'll be different once you have a bite.

293
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,000
Open up.

294
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,130
So?

295
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,170
It's good.

296
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,440
Come on. That's not the response
of someone who thinks this is good.

297
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,350
I'll walk in one more time, so do it over.

298
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,630
Ta-da. Sir, we have some suyuk here.

299
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,440
It looks so good.

Open up.

301
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,500
So?

302
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,740
-It's really good, Miss Dam.
-See?

303
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,830
I didn't learn to use magic to do this.

304
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,130
Right, this is when we need our friend.

305
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,160
Our friend?

306
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,230
Sir, I got some makgeolli.

307
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,640
Suyuk's friend, makgeolli.

308
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,600
Oh wait, you get easily drunk.

309
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,160
Sorry?

310
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,230
When we went to that cart bar,

311
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,270
we ordered two bottles of soju,
and you had only one glass.

312
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,640
And your faced turned red after that.

313
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,770
I think you were the one
who got drunk that night.

314
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,390
You wouldn't let me drink back then,

315
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,630
so I was weak for that period.

316
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm a hard drinker.

317
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,870
I was famous for winning
a beer-drinking contest.

318
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,140
Miss Dam.

319
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,490
I was also famous for my alcohol intake
in the Joseon era.

320
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,860
Once I began to drink,
they had to use up rice

321
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,490
to satisfy my need for alcohol,

322
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,560
so people went starving that year.

323
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,670
That's an exaggeration.

324
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,700
I'll prove that
it wasn't just an exaggeration.

325
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,500
-Who's this?
-My mom.

326
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,140
It's ancient history.

327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,420
I haven't looked at this for long.

328
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,280
I look really ugly
when I was a baby, right?

329
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,230
You were cute.

330
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,480
-This one?
-Yes.

331
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,810
This is Dan.

332
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,350
This is me.

333
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,190
Right.

334
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,990
So this is how you grew up.

335
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,770
What were you like as a kid?

336
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,580
I never had a childhood.

337
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,660
I've always looked like this.

338
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,790
Pick out a photo. I'll give you one.

339
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,350
Then give me five.

340
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,200
What? Five?

341
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,040
This one. This, and this.

342
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,770
This one and this. I like them all.

343
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,290
What should I do, then?
Should I give you the entire album?

344
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,380
Dam!

345
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,360
-What are you doing?
-Well, I...

346
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,440
We only made kimchi, I mean it.
Just kimchi.

347
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,020
I had to do it alone, right?

348
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,660
But he offered to help
since it's tough to do it alone.

349
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,870
Then we got a little drunk
on makgeolli, so...

350
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,700
Say hi. This is my boyfriend.

351
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,380
Is Admiral Yi Sun-sin your boyfriend?

352
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,900

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,170
I must have had one too many drinks.

355
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,630
I must've dreamed of my boyfriend
after I fell asleep drunk.

356
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,220
You had 12 empty bottles
of makgeolli out there.

357
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,540
Clean those up.

358
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,140
Never mind, I'll clean up. Get some rest.

359
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,590
Oh, thanks.

360
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,300
Do you actually have a boyfriend?

361
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,910
[Sir, what happened?]

362
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:38,340
[Miss Dam]

363
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,460
[I didn't want to trouble you,
so I got out.]

364
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,600
[Oh, you should've met my brother
before you left.]

365
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:46,130
[Miss Dam]

366
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,700
[You'll have to lie
if you want to tell him about me.]

367
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,010
Then sir, you'll look like this for life.

368
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,790
You know,

369
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,410
I don't care that he said
a human should only be with another human.

370
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,710
I really don't care

371
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,930
if you aren't human.

372
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,050
But

373
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,140
I'll keep changing

374
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,530
as I grow older.

375
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,310
So I do get a little worried
about how you'll be left alone.

376
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,570
But I do hope
we could be together for a long time.

377
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,860
I'd love to do that too.

378
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,560
[At first,]

379
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,810
[I wanted you to go back
to your ordinary life.]

380
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,690
[That's why]

381
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,280
[I let you go with much pain.]

382
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,500
[But now,]

383
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,640
[I want to be your ordinary future.]

384
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,180
[One day, there will come a moment]

385
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,520
[when you can't stand
that you're actually a fox.]

386
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,930
Professor Shin.

387
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,810
Are you going to class?

388
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,180
Yes.

389
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,700
Do you want to grab a cup of coffee
after your lecture?

390
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,740
[Sir, are you feeling all right?]

391
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,380
[It must've been tough
to keep up with me.]

392
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,090
[Let's relieve our hangovers together.]

393
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,280
Hey, I know how you feel, but...

394
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,970
How I feel about what?

395
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,570
Oh, right.

396
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,100
That you adore me
as a cute and nice junior.

397
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,160
What? I never had such a scary thought.

398
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,220
Oh, right. I heard you got
Mr. Han Seok-won to do an interview.

399
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,890
How did you get him to do it?

400
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,060
I sent him about 100 emails.

401
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,860
I'm going for the interview next week.

402
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,490
That's amazing.

403
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,490
But I'm sorry.
There's no one to come with you.

404
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,640
Exactly.

405
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,890
Ever since Da Young and everyone left,
no one else will join us.

406
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,250
Right, should we ask Professor Shin
to help us get the word out?

407
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,710
Professor Shin?

408
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,910
I have an announcement
before we begin the lecture.

409
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,770

410
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,720
We need more members
in the history club I oversee.

411

Me! I'll do it.

412
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,910
I'm busy studying for my classes
and for my teacher certification,

413
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,300
But I wish to add
my little effort for your sake, sir.

415
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,530
I'm in too.

416

Anyone else?

417
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,570
Me too.

418
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,830
All right, then.

419
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,710
Then it's Choi Soo-kyung, Jung Seok,
and Gye Seon-woo.

420
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,610
On top of that, Yang Hye-sun too.

421
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,550
Let's get started.

422
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,220
Why do I have to join it?

423
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,030
I already told them you applied before.

424
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,380
So why did you make up that lie?
Stop pulling a prank.

425
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,530
It's not a prank.
I'm asking you for a favor.

426
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,340
Please keep an eye on her.

427
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,670
If you're that worried, go there yourself.

428
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,250
Aren't you the advisor?

429
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,580
It'll make her feel overwhelmed.

430
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,300
If you don't want to do it alone,
you can bring him too.

431
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,850
What?

432
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,360
What now?

433
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,390
We're only dating because of our grades.

434
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,150
I didn't say anything.

435
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
You did. You said it in your head.

436
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,750
What do you want?

437
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,990
[Professor Shin Woo-yeo]

438
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,830
It feels worse when he says nothing.

439
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,900
But still, it looks like
he has been keeping his calm.

I'll join you.

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,440
-You too?
-Yes, of course.

443
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,300
Did you hear about the interview tomorrow?

444
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,010
What?

445
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,820
Tomorrow? Right away?

446
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,610
Yes, the historian I'm about to interview

447
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,330
has to travel abroad soon.

448
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,790
If we don't do it tomorrow,
we'll have to wait a month.

449
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,760
So I'll be away for two days, one night.

450
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,370
Two days, one night.

451
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,040
Do you have to stay the night?

452
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,530
Yes, that's the only way
we could work things out.

453
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,610
I'm thirsty.

454
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,460
To be honest, I don't want you to go.

455
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,670
Just hang out with me.

00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,800
Come on. It's not like
a month-long backpacking trip.

459
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,910
Don't drink too much.

460
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,240
I can't promise that.

467
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,620
Okay.

the first to arrive here.

I didn't need any supplements before,
but now I'm a human,

I need them to get myself going.

Now you're a human?

475
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,320
My Korean is still bad. It's probably
because I've been abroad for so long.

something like this from my girlfriend.

That's not what I meant.

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,160
How about we play a game? Truth or dare?

531
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,890
-We're not playing that.
-Come on. What else do we do?

532
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,300
Let me fill up the glass.

533
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,500
All right. Three, two, one.

534
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,840
Soo-kyung.

535
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,260
Oh, well.

536
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,460
I guess I have to disclose

537
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,460
the veiled secrets of mine now.

538
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,390
Ask me anything,

539
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,330
please.

540
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,510
-Come on.
-What?

541
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,700
Ask me.

542
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,680
Have you ever had a crush
on one of us here?

543
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,760
-Come on. That's ridiculous...
-Yes.

544
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,140
I have.

545
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,340
You're not

546
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,820
about to start a long story, are you?

547
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,840
I'm not interested. Let's move on.

548
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,560
Next.

549
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,490
There you go. Dam.

550
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,090
All right. Dam.

551
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,210
Where did you first meet your boyfriend?

552
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,610
Where could you have possibly met him
to drink it right away?

553
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,500
I don't know. Let's move on.

554
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,740
-It's Dam again.
-What do you like about your boyfriend?

555
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,990
I just like him.

556
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,240
I like him so much
that nothing can sway me.

557
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,730
I think I should go grill a squid.

558
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,200
I'll go get some fruits too.

559
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,520
-Soo-kyung.
-Yes?

560
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,340
You said you had a crush on one of us.
Is that true?

561
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,290
The game is over now,

562
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,960
you Seogwa's thief.

563
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,450
Seogwa's thief?

564
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,970
Why is Jae-jin a thief?

565
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,650
Soy sauce marinated crab is a rice thief

566
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,580
because it makes us crave rice.

567
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,960
Rain is a thief
because he married Kim Tae Hee.

568
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,640
And he's a thief too
because he's going out with you.

569
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,750
You're too good for him.

570
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,710
I'm not sure about that.
I think he's too good for me.

571
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,190
Come on. You can be honest with me.
There's nobody here.

572
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,390
You don't have to pretend to like him.

573
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,500
I mean it. I haven't seen

574
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,480
such a nice and ingenuous man
in a long time.

575
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,300
I meant it
when I said he's too good for me.

576
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,500
Are you sure?

577
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,190
Can you put your hand on the chest
and swear?

578
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,710
Do I really have to put
my hand on the chest?

579
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,570
You can't, can you?

580
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,040
Why? Is it because it will make you

581
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,710
feel guilty?

582
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,280
I should get going.

583
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,570
Why did you want me to put my hand
on your chest?

584
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,340
Because there seems to be
nothing to brag about.

585
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,750
Hey!

586
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,520
I didn't mean my chest.

587
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,720
And what do you mean by,

588
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,790
there's nothing to brag about?

589
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,390
Mine is just fine!

590
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,080
It's snowing.

591
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,720
It's pretty.

592
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,270
Is he drunk?

593
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,400
It's none of my business. I should go.

594
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,810
Seon-woo, you should get inside
and go to bed.

595
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,170
I warned you.

596
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,910
I like you.

597
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,070
I know you have a boyfriend
and I know I should stop.

598
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,250
But still...

599
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,990
What should I do to make you look at me?

600
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,120
Is it too late?

601
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,550
Or have I never had a chance at all?

602
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,490
[I should stop. I might make a mistake.]

603
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,160
Seon-woo, you're drunk.

604
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,190
You should get inside
before you make any mistake.

605
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,330
It's not a mistake.

606
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,440
[Why does my heart suddenly...]

607
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,380
[Sir]

608
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,970
[If I answer this call now
and he happens to hear his voice...]

609
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,600
[Sir]

610
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,380
Seon-woo, I told you.

611
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,890
I really like my boyfriend.

612
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,500
I don't want to give you false hope.

613
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,300
What must I say to turn you down for good?

614
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,220
Where did she go?

615
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,520
Woo-yeo told me to keep an eye on her.

616
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,110
Hye-sun.

617
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,790
What are you doing in the snow?

618
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,040
Jae-jin, have you seen Dam?

619
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,220
No.

620
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,610
Why? Do you need to talk to her?

621
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,210
Well, kind of.

622
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,160
I'll go find her,
so stay inside. It's cold.

623
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,800
Come on. We don't need to look so sweet.

624
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,690
There's no one looking anyway...

625
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,640
There is someone looking.

626
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,530
What? Someone looking?

627
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,560
Seok is behind us.

628
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,980
Pretend we're a sweet couple.

629
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,820
Let's go. Smile and walk naturally.

630
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,260
I shouldn't have asked you to date me.

631
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,120
I thought it was a good idea
to get good grades,

632
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,680
but now I'm a bit worried it might get
more complicated than I thought.

633
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,660
Hye-sun.

634
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,710
I'm not seeing you for good grades.

635
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,210
What?

636
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,470
About what happened to us that night

637
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,850
after the festival after-party,

638
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,890
I thought about it a lot,

639
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,190
and I don't think it was just a mistake.

640
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,260
I think you're cute and really cool.

641
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,720
Thinking about you makes me happy.

642
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,080
So don't mind about what others say.

643
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,150
I'm seeing you because I like you.

644
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,930
Is Seok still there?

645
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,470
No, he's still there.

646
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,910
I need to find Dam.

647
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,950
She'll find her way back on her own.

648
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,790
It's snowing a lot, isn't it?

649
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,220
[Should I go?]

650
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,940
[No.]

651
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,990
[If I suddenly show up,
it will look weird.]

652
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,020
I felt that way

653
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,400
because of the red thread?

654
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,400
[Dam, you're arriving
at two tomorrow, right?]

655
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,330
[Sir]

656
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,720
[I'll pick you up.]

657
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,320
I promised I wouldn't do anything
that might worry him.

658
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,280
He will probably worry more
if he finds out that I can see it too.

659
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,360
Dam, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

660
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,940
Why did you look for me?

661
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,120
I couldn't find both you and Seon-woo.
Nothing happened, right?

662
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,570
What?

663
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,310
I heard that you two are tied
with the red thread.

664
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,080
I see. Nothing happened.

665
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,580
That's good.

666
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,380
It's cold. Let's get inside.

667
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,360
Hey, Hye-sun.

668
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,170
Do you think only the person
who you're tied with the red thread

669
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,370
is considered destiny?

670
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,090
Yes and no.

671
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,470
Do you know

672
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,770
why all animals want to be humans?

673
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,770
Only humans can decide their own destiny.

674
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,930
[Third Floor, Platforms]

675
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,310
Good work, guys.

676
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,850
I'll get going now.

677
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,050
Bye.

678
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:26,990
Let's go.

679
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,770
It was fun.

680
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,660
-Hye-sun, let me help.
-It's okay. It's heavy.

681
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,640
That's why I'm offering help.

682
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,930
Thanks.

683
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,820
Cool.

684
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,410
Should I drive? I'm sure you're tired.

685
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,680
That would be great.

686
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,910
-Bye.
-Can I...

687
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,420
He said Exit Eight.

688
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,660
Are you okay?

689
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,390
You were still around here.

690
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,630
I'm taking a cab here.

691
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,700
How are you going home?

692
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,780
-By car.
-Whose car?

693
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,420
-Well...
-Dam.

694
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,310
Dam is riding my car. Is there an issue?

695
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,370
Hello, Professor.
I'm Gye Seon-woo, and I take your class.

696
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,060
How do you

697
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,530
know Dam?

698
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,750
Is there a reason
why you want to know that, Mr. Gye?

699
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,130
Pardon?

700
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,290
Yes, there is.

701
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,590
Wait.

702
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,000
He's my boyfriend.

703
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,830
What?

704
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,870
I didn't tell anyone
because I didn't want any rumors,

705
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,820
but we met even before
he came to our school.

706
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,860
I'm not taking his classes now,
so there won't be any problem.

707
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,380
What are you talking about?
That's not the problem.

708
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,630
-Then...
-Dam.

709
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,220
I wanted to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

710
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,930
I was going to apologize,
stay away from you

711
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,840
and stop talking to you
if you said so. No, actually,

712
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,120
I thought you wouldn't let me.

713
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,760
But this is not right.

714
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,680
I get that I might not be the one.
But if I'm not,

715
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,520
it at least can't be him either.

716
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,840
What do you mean?

717
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,090
I'm not saying this because of rumors.

718
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,440
I saw it myself.

719
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,570
I don't understand what you're
talking about. What rumors?

720
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,810
The thing is...

721
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,090
[They say Professor Shin
and Professor Seo are going out.]

722
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,220
[Dae-hoon]

723
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,670
[The entire school knows it.]

724
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,410
[Moo-geun]

725
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,570
You should leave.

726
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,650
Whatever I did or didn't,

727
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,510
it's a matter between me and Miss Dam.

728
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,840
Now tell me

729
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,830
what the rumor is.

730
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,580
You know Professor Seo Young-ju.

731
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,930
Yes, she teaches Ancient History.

732
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,360
I had a cup of coffee with her
because of work,

733
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,080
and apparently that made false rumors

734
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,470
that we date.

735
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,400
Gosh, I got scared for nothing.

736
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,380
So it's not a big deal, right?

737
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,000
Of course. It's not.

738
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,400
By the way,
did something happen yesterday?

739
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,020
What?

740
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,060
He said he wanted to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

741
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,080
Oh, that.

742
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,890
If you don't want to talk about it,
you don't have to.

743
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,340
He said he liked me.

744
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,720
I kept getting involved with him
because of the red thread.

745
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,230
I tried to be careful

746
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,390
because I didn't want to worry you,

747
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,760
but one thing led to another,
and it happened.

748
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,260
I don't know
how honest I should be with you,

749
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,770
but I thought I should tell you this.

750
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,250
Thank you for being honest with me.

751
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,240
[Why is he holding it like that?]

752
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,760
[He must have been worried.]

753
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,940
[Look what I have done
to the person I care for.]

754
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,510
[Only humans can decide
their own destiny.]

755
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,800
[Okay.]

756
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:26,160
[I will make the decision.]

757
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,860
I'd like a chicken sandwich
with extra avocados.

758
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,670
For the sauce, please drizzle the one
you think would go well with it.

759
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,080
Okay.

760
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,850
What a shame. You were of great help.

761
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,010
I'm sorry I'm quitting
on such short notice.

762
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,820
It's okay.
You must have your own situation.

763
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,550
I hope to see you again one day.

764
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,630
I hope so too. Thank you for everything.

765
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,900
Thank you.

766
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,630
Hi, Uncle.

767
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,950
Hey, Dam is quitting.

768
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,760
It's because of you, right?
You made her feel uncomfortable.

769
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,310
Well, it's...

770
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,130
Did you think I wouldn't know
you had a crush on her?

771
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,410
You always waited for her to come

772
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,610
and did all the work for her.

773
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,350
Since when you've been
such a devoted type?

774
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,210
Seon-woo.

775
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,380
Being too nice to women
only pushes them away.

776
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,760
If you want to keep her, let her free.

777
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,710
If you want a passionate love,
be cold to her.

778
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,300
If I had given you
this wonderful tip earlier, you...

779
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,160
-I would have become an old single man.
-That's right. An old single...

780
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,520
Anyway, I think it's for the best.

781
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,590
You guys made me feel awkward.

782
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,420
She probably has someone better than you.

783
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,400
If he was actually a good person,
I would have given up.

784
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,530
Sir, I decided to quit the job.

785
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,680
The work was harder than I thought.

786
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,100
Let me know if you need any help.

787
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,670
Good luck with the class.
I'll talk to you later.

788
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,740
Professor Shin.

789
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,410
Hey.

790
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,570
Why the long face?

791
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,330
Well...

792
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,440
I probably shouldn't have joined the club.

793
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,820
Why? You were the first one
to raise your hand

794
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,680
and say things like, "I'd like to provide
help to Professor Shin."

795
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,920
It turned out he didn't need my help.

796
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,670
Apparently, Professor Seo
and Professor Shin are going out.

797
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,790
I'm sure Professor Seo provides him
a lot of help,

798
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,200
which is love.

799
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,270
I heard it's not true.

800
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,510
I heard they just had a cup of coffee
because of work.

801
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,990
Hey, who talks about work

802
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,710
holding other's hand so tightly?

803
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,320
You don't know anything.

804
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,730
Dam, aren't you just
envious of Professor Seo?

805
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,990
I wonder what it feels like
to date a man like Professor Shin.

806
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,300
I'm sure you feel on top of the world.

807
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,150
[It can't be true.
He said it was nothing.]

808
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,640
Hey, it looks like the rumors were right.

809
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,840
I just saw Professor Seo on my way here.

810
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,660
And she was walking
into Professor Shin's office.

811
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,290
They must be really going out.

812
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,620
Hey, we all know it.

813
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,250
We all do.

814
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,680
-I need to go somewhere.
-What?

815
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,140
Where? The class is starting soon.

816
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,370
What's going on with her?

817
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:45,360
[Professor's Office]

818
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,630
Thanks for the coffee.

819
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,150
Are you free this evening?

820
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,740
There's a fine dining restaurant I like,

821
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,150
and the chef is...

822
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,670
Professor Shin?

823
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,640
Is this what you meant
when you said you had a way?

824
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,710
Wait. I can explain.

825
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,780
How will you explain that?

826
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,960
Miss Dam.

827
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,230
You were trying to hurt others
instead of me.

828
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,270
Wait up.

829
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,560
-Hurry.
-Where are you going?

830
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,620
[Professor's Office]

831
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,630
I can explain.

832
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,920
Let me ask you one thing.

833
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,750
And I really wish your answer is no.

834
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,430
Miss Dam.

835
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,640
You urgently needed some energy
because of me,

836
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,490
and you put someone in danger

837
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,850
instead of putting me in danger.
Am I right?

838
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,400
Because of me?

839
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,090
Did you do what you did to me?

840
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:08,930
There was no other way.

841
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,480
You could have told me
there was no way then.

842
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,340
You should have been honest with me.

843
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,680
I know I'm horrible,

844
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,450
but could you just...

845
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,620
Could you just bear with it?

846
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,100
I was willing to bear with it.

847
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,960
Even if I always had to be scared to death

848
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,430
just to hold your hand,

849
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,360
I was willing to bear it.

850
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,000
I wanted this relationship
despite of everything.

851
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,470
Though you were not a human,

852
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,430
you lied to me and you used me,

853
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,370
I liked you.

854
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,680
So many things scared and worried me,

855
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,390
but all I cared about is
if I would hurt you.

856
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,240
And how could you do this to me?

857
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,490
Miss Dam.

858
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,840
Let's...

859
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,730
stop this.

860
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,330
[We appreciate Shim Hyoung-tak,
Go Kyung-pyo, and Son Sung-yoon]

861
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,430
[for the guest appearances.]

862
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,820
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

863
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:08,750
[I was fully convinced
that he was a good person.]

864
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,450
[Professor Shin Woo-yeo]

865
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,720
[The Marble has changed.
So I had a vain dream.]

866
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:17,290
[She's a human. Of course,
she doesn't understand this situation.]

867
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,560
[I'm sorry]

868
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,890
[I like you.]

869
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,840
The Marble started to turn blue.

870
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,750
[If someone can help him,]

871
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,680
[that would be me.]

872
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:32,200
[You might be the only one
who can make him humane.]
