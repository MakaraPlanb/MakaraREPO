00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,329
but my friend broke up
with her boyfriend today.

183
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,789
She was having such a hard time,
so I sent him a text message,

184
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,239
and now I'm waiting for him.

185
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,835
I want them to get back together.

186
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,185
I see. So that's what.

187
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,819
Anyway, this is new.

188
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,115
You don't seem like the type
who'd be at a club.

189
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,109
Now that we're here,

190
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,555
why don't we dance to the rhythm?

191
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,455
Why? Professor, you should stay.

192
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,935
Instead of History 101,
let's do Dance 101...

193
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,775
Man, why isn't Dam's ex texting back?

194
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,105
He's done with her for good.

195
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,789
Dam.

196
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,069
Let's go dance.

197
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,775
You can completely forget
about your ex-boyfriend.

198
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,349
Okay? Let's go.

199
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,985
Let's go.

200
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,465
Goodness, why can't I push this?

201
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,755
Be careful.

202
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,125
Thank you.

203
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,215
That could've been bad.

204
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,735
Sir.

205
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,635
Why are you here?

206
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,335
Because you were crying.

207
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,725
No matter how much I like you,

208
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,805
we have to stop here, right?

209
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,625
Our relationship

210
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,945
is putting other people in danger
as well as us.

211
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,585
Then we should stop here.

212
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,575
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

213
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,875
How could I?

214
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,804
I know how much pain I could put you in

215
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,145
better than anyone else.

216
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,135
I'm sorry

217
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,705
for liking you.

218
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,665
Dam.

219
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,989
You need to wake up.
You have an early class.

220
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,055
Hey.

221
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,109
How did I get home last night?

222
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,805
What do you think? You came home wasted.

223
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,525
You blacked out again?

224
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,295
You shouldn't drink so much.

225
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,445
Come out. I made some bean sprout soup.

226
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,655
Was that a dream?

227
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,035
Drink this. You don't look too well.

228
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,835
Are you okay?

229
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,595
Seon-woo.

230
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,755
Could you keep what happened

231
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,525
between Professor Shin and me a secret?

232
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,769
Things are already tough,

233
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,295
so I don't think
I could deal with all kinds of rumors.

234
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,635
I won't tell anyone.

235
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,755
You didn't have to ask me.

236
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,875
Thank you.

237
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,205
It would've been better

238
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,985
if he was a good guy.

239
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,265
If he was such a good man
who was way out of my league,

240
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,315
I think I could've given up.

241
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,315
What are you going to do?

242
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,875
We need to talk.

243
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,465
Have you met with Dam?

244
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,665
She can't seem to understand you?

245
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,955
I have no idea what to do.

246
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,935
Woo-yeo.

247
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,055
What do you think
Dam wants the most right now?

248
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,345
A breakup?

249
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,785
What are you talking about?
You two are over already.

250
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,209
Do you think
she'd be scared of you at this point?

251
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,765
She's not afraid she'll fall into danger.

252
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,065
She's afraid
you're putting other people in danger.

253
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,965
Well, I did tell you
that you should try using someone else,

254
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,865
but I haven't thought
of how she would feel.

255
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,135
She's human,
so she wouldn't understand this situation.

256
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,825
So if you want to be loved by a human,

257
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,955
shouldn't you show her how humane you are?

258
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,265
Now, look. Let's say you were driving.

259
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,875
Dam is standing on this side,

260
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,345
and there are five people
on the other side.

261
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,029
If the brake gives out and you have
no choice but to hit one of the two,

262
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,489
- what would you do?
- I'd hit the five.

263
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,959
What if one of them is pregnant?

264
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,669
- I don't care.
- What if there's a kid?

265
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,055
- I don't care.
- What if I'm there?

266
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,995
I don't care.

267
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,035
[ How do I turn this guy into a human? ]

268
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,125
[ Would she be better off with Seon-woo,
with the red thread and all? ]

269
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,900
[ Wait, Seon-woo is
as less of a human as him anyway. ]

270
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,019
[ A beast who couldn't become human ]

271
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,870
[ A man who's worse than a beast ]

272
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,189
[ Then the question is ]

273
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,015
[ which one of them will
become a decent human first. ]

274
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,790
[ Who'll become a decent human first? ]

275
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,535
[ To be honest,
this is a pretty fair game. ]

276
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,715
Are you saying I'm wrong?

277
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,885
Then is it right for me to save
those strangers over Miss Dam?

278
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,805
That's not what I meant,
but I thought you'd hesitate a little.

279
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,645
Why should I?

280
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,499
That's what humans are like,

281
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,885
and I'm sure
that's what she wants from you.

282
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,295
Dam, goodness, you reek of alcohol.

283
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,445
How much did you have to drink?

284
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,845
Let's go relieve our hangover.
I'll buy you soup.

285
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,045
Hey, Hye-sun.

286
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,555
- Let's go.
- I...

287
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,505
I heard Woo-yeo cheated on you.

288
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,955
So you dumped him coldly.

289
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,509
I mean, as you know,
he didn't exactly cheat on me...

290
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,829
Don't take his side.

291
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,345
You two are over,
so you don't have to cover for him.

292
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,325
I can't just be a stranger right away.
My feelings are the same.

293
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,285
At first, I couldn't believe what he did.

294
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,735
But then I kind of understood,
yet I still can't.

295
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,815
I feel like such a fool.

296
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,805
It's not your fault.

297
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,235
But it's not Woo-yeo's fault either.

298
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,679
I don't know what you were expecting,

299
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,269
but he's a fox.

300
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,895
That means he could've deceived you
much better if he wanted to.

301
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,945
He wouldn't have told you
about that red thread

302
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,699
or how he had been

303
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,295
taking your energy
even though he had the Marble.

304
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,795
And those rumors?

305
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,405
It wouldn't have been difficult
for him to get rid of the rumors.

306
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,025
He could've done better in deceiving you.

307
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,665
But he didn't.

308
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,405
He's not human.

309
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,139
But when it comes to you,

310
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,995
he could be humane.

311
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,119
I know that, but...

312
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,285
His Marble is starting to turn blue.

313
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,179
Why is it turning blue?

314
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,505
You didn't know?

315
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,709
Once his Marble turns blue
instead of red by human energy,

316
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,785
he can become human.

317
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,609
His Marble had been stagnant
for about 1,000 years,

318
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,355
but it suddenly turned blue twice
ever since he met you.

319
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,655
And this time, it remained in blue,

320
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,075
although it only changed halfway.

321
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,539
Are you saying
he could really become human?

322
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,045
Do you finally get

323
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,005
why Woo-yeo did something
so out of the ordinary?

324
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,389
Hye-sun, I should go see him.

325
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,625
I'm sorry.

326
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,655
Can we talk for a second?

327
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,785
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,715
I don't know everything
about what I need to do

329
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,885
to live as a human,

330
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,575
but if I made you cry,

331
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,175
it means I was wrong. No questions needed.

332
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,465
If it doesn't bother you

333
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,335
that I'm a fox, not human,

334
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,465
then I'll stay this way.

335
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,895
To me,

336
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,145
this relationship isn't
something I can simply let go.

337
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,655
Then that's the more reason
you should've held me back.

338
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,935
If there's someone who can help you,

339
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,039
it should be me, nobody else.

340
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,165
It has to be me. I'm your girlfriend.

341
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,925
Give me the Marble.

342
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,269
- Sorry?
- I don't want you to see anyone else

343
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,525
or put them in danger.

344
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,425
But I also can't ask you to give up.

345
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,619
So give me the Marble.

346
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,219
- I can't do that.
- Why not? I'm fine with it.

347
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,619
I heard the Marble changed colors.

348
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,429
It might hurt you more.

349
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,759
So please don't get that idea
just because of me.

350
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,189
Just because of you?
You aren't just anybody to me.

351
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,115
Calm down, and let's talk again
tomorrow during the day.

352
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,619
No, I want to talk now, in this night.

353
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,985
Give me the Marble.

354
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,395
What? Did he run away?

355
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
[ Give me the Marble. ]

356

708
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,665
I'm done here.

709
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,079
Hey! Who do you think you are
to let me just go like that?

710
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,225
What?

711
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,289
I've seen guys who cried
because they liked me,

712
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,529
but I haven't seen anyone
who cries because he hates me.

713
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,349
You said you were seeing me
because you liked me.

714
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,199
Why did you lie to me?

715
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,715
I didn't. I do like you.

716
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,995
- What?
- I like you.

717
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,805
I like you. I really do.

718
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,265
But...

719
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,975
as I started to like you more,
it became harder and harder.

720
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,035
I'm supposed to leave you.

721
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,655
You like someone else.

722
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,815
What are you saying? I don't.

723
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,215
- You don't?
- I don't.

724
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,685
- Really?
- Really.

725
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,325
Thank goodness.

726
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,445
I like you, Hye-sun.

727
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,625
- What?
- I like you!

728
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,225
I don't like you.

729
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,485
You're so nice it worries me.

730
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,445
You make me too serious, and I hate that.

731
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,315
Do you still like me?

732
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,775
Yes, I do.

733
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,325
- How's your foot?
- It's fine.

734
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,330
[ Forget about my advice and just give up. ]

735
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,580
[ Hye-sun ]

736
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,820
[ I had no idea
Woo-yeo would hurt Jae-jin. ]

737
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,445
[ Hye-sun ]

738
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,525
I don't think he was the one
who pushed him.

739
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,785
You are fearless.
You could have hurt yourself.

740
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,825
I know. But I did it anyway.

741
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,755
I had to talk to you.

742
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,545
Why do you have to harass him so much?

743
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:46,905
"Harass"?

744
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,865
I'm looking after him in my own way.

745
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,105
Do you want to know a secret
that no one knows?

746
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:06,265
Energy is not what makes the Marble blue.

747
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,569
He needs energy to appease his hunger,

748
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:13,435
but what turns the Marble blue
is something else.

749
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,165
What do you mean?

750
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,075
Oh, no! Jae-jin!

751
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,915
[ You should guess ]

752
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,575
[ what turns the Marble blue. ]

753
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,715
Those that are not human
don't know what it is to be humane.

754
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,155
I wanted him to experience it himself.

755
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,109
I wanted him to learn what it's like
to feel desperate, hurt,

756
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,695
and happy.

757
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,475
Like Hye-sun did.

758
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,095
I don't understand what you're saying.

759
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,835
What turns the Marble blue...

760
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,235
is humanity.

761
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,575
Humanity?

762
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,299
Woo-yeo may think
the Marble finally gave him the answer

763
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,855
after 1,000 years because he met you,

764
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,565
but his Marble
has turned blue once before.

765
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,135
[ When he faced the death
of the first person he cared for ]

766
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,385
[ and learned what sadness was. ]

767
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,315
[ But he rather chose
to close his heart after that, ]

768
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,835
[ and missed the chance
to make his dream come true. ]

769
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,245
[ Then the moment
he got curious about you, ]

770
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,275
You can go back now.

771
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,875
[ the moment he felt bad for you, ]

772
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,135
[ and the moment ]

773
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,885
[ you brought his desire
to become a human back, ]

774
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,655
[ the Marble gave him the answer. ]

775
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,785
So I wanted to stimulate him.

776
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,395
I upset him. I frustrated him.

777
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,599
I put him in a situation he didn't want

778
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,245
where he didn't have to give you
the Marble to earn energy,

779
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,635
thinking those might help.

780
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,635
I have always felt bad for him,

781
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,535
and I still do.

782
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,219
Why didn't you say this to him?

783
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,185
Just because you know where you're headed
doesn't mean you can get there.

784
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,515
Then why are you telling me this?

785
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,615
Because I think you may be able
to find the way.

786
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,385
Do you want a hint?

787
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,375
A hint?

788
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,215
[ Some take off their jackets
when the wind is strong, ]

789
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,015
[ while some take off their jackets
when the sun shines warmly. ]

790
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,415
Which type do you think Woo-yeo is?

791
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,745
What do you...

792
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,725
What? Where did he go?

793
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,115
You can't just disappear
after saying that.

794
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,289
Anyway, all I need to do

795
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,885
is to take his jacket off.

796
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,785
Miss Dam.

797
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,675
What brings you here?

798
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,965
I'm moving in for the time being.

799
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,285
Let's live together again.

800
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,685
I'm going to make you a human.

801
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,725
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

802
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,319
[ I should hurry and think of a way ]

803
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,559
[ to turn him human
so this happiness lasts long. ]

804
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,979
[ If you haven't eaten yet,
why don't you join us? ]

805
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,215
I can't.

806
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,159
Mr. Do, Chinese is common sense.

807
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,335
I don't like his formal way of speech
and inhumane personality.

808
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,885
[ Without Woo-yeo,
you would have been much happier. ]

809
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,095
- See you later at home.
- "See you at home"?

810
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,935
[ I thought I was not in danger
any more, so... ]

811
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,495
[ I think things are
just about to get dangerous. ]
