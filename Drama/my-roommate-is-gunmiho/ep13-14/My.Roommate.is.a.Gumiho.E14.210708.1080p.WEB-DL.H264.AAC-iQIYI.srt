I already said I can't give you my Marble.

I don't need it.

37

Then what?

38

Well, I'll have to find a way

to make you human now.

40
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,569
I guess it's up to you
to turn the Marble blue,

but it's up to me
to turn you into a decent human.

You don't know a thing about humanity.

43

That's true,
but you said you've grown tired.

45

- You wanted to live an ordinary life.
- I was lying.

- Lying?
- I didn't mean it.

47
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,639
You kept avoiding me,

48
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,625
so I went a little too far
to hold you back.

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,845
I thought I needed to be like a fox
in order to catch a fox.

to move in with you?

- But...
- Your rejection is rejected.

54

for the dating project for me.

Is something bothering you?

180
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,735
No.

181
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,849
Right, I might be a little late today.

182
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,305
I have to be at a club meeting.

183
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,755
I wanted to leave together.

184
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,749
I'll be home right after.

185
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,855
See you at home.

186
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,055
"See you at home"?

187
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,825
Why are you two here?

188
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,275
You said you were at the library.
We were nearby, so we came for you.

189
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,575
Anyway, what do you mean,

190
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,115
you'll see him at home?

191
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,075
Well, it's...

192
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,285
We're going to make the magazine
at his place.

193
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,835
At his place?

194
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,295
All of us?

195
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,105
Yes, all of us.

196
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,925
He has lots of reference at home,

197
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,445
so he'll show those books to us
as the professor in charge of our club.

198
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,735
Really?

199
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,775
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you.

200
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,285
You're a true educator.

201
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,995
Thank you.

202
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,845
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

203
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,515
All right.

204
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,585
This is nice, isn't it?

205
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,345
Professor, with all due respect,

206
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,145
please excuse us.

207
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,775
Thank you.

208
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,749
Sir, once we get there,
I'll take them to a convenience store.

209
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,605
Can you move my stuff while we're gone?

210
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,025
Hey.

211
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,025
I know they're your friends,
but I can't let them come to my house.

212
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,405
But they ended up hearing me say that.

213
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,789
Dam, aren't you coming?

214
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,075
I'll be there.

215
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,698
[ Okay, then he'll get to experience ]

216
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,759
[ different relationships with people... ]

217
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,999
It's a chance of a lifetime.

218
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,294
Not everyone gets invited
to the professor's home.

219
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,039
I won't lose this chance

220
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,635
and get closer to him.

221
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,975
Do I have to go?

222
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,915
Why not? Does your leg hurt?

223
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,524
I just don't really like him.

224
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,725
You don't? Why not?

225
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,995
I just don't like

226
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,165
how formal he is
and how he lacks the human touch.

227
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,359
He lacks the human touch?

228
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,469
He's right. Other professors

229
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,159
sometimes buy drinks for students,
take questions from us,

230
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,479
and give us career advice too.

231
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,385
But Professor Shin
always dashes back to his office.

232
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,245
He does lack the human touch.

233
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,669
But if he invited us to his home,

234
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,655
then maybe he does have the human touch.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,249
He just might be awkward around people.

236
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,275
Let's keep an open mind and be nice,

237
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,209
showing the love
between a teacher and pupils,

238
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,675
and what it means to live together
in different relationships.

239
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,015
What? Why are you getting all grand?

240
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,879
Hey, so what do you think
his place is like?

241
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,169
Will it be stylish and modern
just as he seems?

242
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,125
Or will it be simple and small?

243
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,835
Let's go.

244
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,065
Gosh, thank you.

245
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,015
My gosh, is this happening for real?

246
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,255
Look at this place.

247
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,935
Thank you for having us, Professor.

248
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,665
This is for you.

249
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,189
Then let's go to the study.

250
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,425
Yes.

251
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,175
- Where are you going?
- What?

252
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,385
It felt like that was the study.

253
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,289
Is that your study?

254
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,359
I want to know
if my gut feelings are right.

255
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,685
You do have great gut feelings.

256
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,145
That is my study.

257
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,685
Let's go.

258
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,365
Wait.

259
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,875
Dam, isn't this yours?

260
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,869
It's not. That's not mine.

261
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,205
You do have something like this.

262
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,785
Look at this.

263
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,295
You were wearing it then.

264
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,695
Wait.

265
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,925
If Dam's badge was found here, it means...

266
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,845
Professor Seo also uses that bookstore.

267
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,609
You only go to that one bookstore.

268
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,775
I thought this was limited-edition.

269
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,759
She must be as quick as you are.

270
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,865
Right?

271
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,769
Why are you bringing her up now?

272
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,805
- Then why else would it be...
- Yes, that's enough.

273
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,345
Let's go.

274
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,065
What's this?

275
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,385
"Sir, I'm leaving first. See you tonight."

276
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,765
"Sir"?

277
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,225
I've heard that pet name before.

278
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,685
Wait.

279
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,325
Isn't that your boyfriend's pet name?

280
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,795
What?

281
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,155
That means...

282
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,199
I guess that pet name is trending.

283
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,155
I want to make my own sir too.

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,509
Anyway, it's funny to think

285
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,415
that Professor Seo would call you sir.

286
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,315
Sir.

287
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,379
- Soo-kyung?
- Yes?

288
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,515
Let's cut the small talk
and go to the study.

289
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,489
Yes, guys. Let's go.

290
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,775
Come on.

291
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,729
Then let's use this reference here

292
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,465
and have the return of cultural assets
as our theme.

293
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,895
Think of the details by next time.

294
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,625
- Okay.
- Okay. Great work.

295
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,029
Are you all done?

296
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,679
Yes, thanks to the great materials
you let us use as reference, we ended...

297
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,445
Then let's wrap it up.

298
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,385
[ He can't let them go yet. ]

299
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,215
But since we're all here already,

300
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,675
why don't we have a get-together?

301
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,255
- A get-together?
- Yes.

302
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,509
Other professors
let us ask questions on history

303
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,895
and give us advice on careers too.

304
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,935
Do you have anything to ask him
or any requests to make?

305
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,555
No?

306
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,345
Professor Shin.

307
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,245
Could you use
less Chinese characters in lecture?

308
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,589
I mean, you use the most
Chinese characters in your lecture,

309
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,135
so it's tough for everyone.

310
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,095
We find it even harder
than Professor Irritating.

311
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,905
Professor Irritating?

312
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,299
We had a professor like that?

313
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,839
It's Professor Oh's new nickname.

314
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,429
No matter where you meet him,

315
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,325
he's awfully annoying and irritating,

316
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,065
so Professor Irritating.

317
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,555
Anyway, everyone is
a bit scared of Professor Oh,

318
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,789
but more people

319
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,435
have been saying
your lecture is tougher than his.

320
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,759
So could you use less Chinese characters?

321
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,185
- Mr. Do Jae-jin.
- Yes?

322
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,165
The word research is derived

323
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,945
from an old French word, "recherche",
which means "to go about seeking."

324
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,629
If you're a history major,

325
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,805
it means you wanted to conduct
extensive research in this field.

326
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,589
In order to examine
historical documents accurately,

327
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,665
isn't Chinese characters a given?

328
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,725
Isn't that so?

329
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,785
You're right.

330
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,835
Soo-kyung, do you have
any questions for him?

331
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,155
Of course, I do.

332
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,535
Professor Shin.

333
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,809
I have many deep concerns

334
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,669
regarding historical matters
as the top student of the department.

335
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,155
And while we're on the subject,
may we stay for dinner?

336
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,465
What does history have to do with dinner?

337
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,405
[ Yes, a meal. ]

338
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,009
[ Actually, I've never seen him
eat with anyone else other than me. ]

339
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,769
You should go home and eat.

340
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,585
Let's have dinner, Professor.

341
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,869
- What?
- Well,

342
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,649
an old adage says
you must always treat your guests.

343
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,849
It means you should
eat and drink with your guests

344
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,925
as you all cultivate your virtue.

345
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,939
How can a virtuous man like you

346
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,405
let us go home on an empty stomach?

347
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,585
And life is all about meat.
How's meat for dinner?

348
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,745
Sounds great.

349
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,575
Man, it does look good.

350
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,315
Is it hot enough?

351
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,259
I just threw it out there,

352
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,319
but I can't believe
I'm grilling pork neck here.

353
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,545
Right? Doesn't he seem
more humane than we thought?

354
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,229
Professor Shin, join us. Let's eat.

355
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,859
I'm boiling water for ramyeon.

356
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,279
We have so much meat, though.
Why are you making ramyeon?

357
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,735
You always need ramyeon with meat.

358
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,479
[ We're here for your finances. ]

359
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,725
What is this?

360
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,155
Is it your ex-boyfriend?

361
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,175
No, a spam message.

362
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,019
Ex-boyfriend?

363
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,619
You said there's trouble,
but you didn't say you broke up.

364
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,645
Well, it's, you know...

365
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,825
My boyfriend and I are back together.

366
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,429
Hey! You can't do that.

367
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,195
You can't date a jerk like him.

368
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,749
A jerk? Don't be so harsh.

369
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,119
Harsh?

370
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,679
You can't tell me where you met this jerk
and what he does.

371
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,059
You can't even tell us
how darned old that jerk is.

372
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,549
Is he a con man? Is he wanted?

373
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,839
Why does he make you so shady?

374
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,339
Enough, stop it. What's with you?

375
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,235
Stop what?

376
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,259
Hey, I wasn't going to be this harsh,

377
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,899
but the day you two broke up,
you looked so devastated,

378
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,999
so I texted him

379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,689
pretending to be you,
and asked him to come for you.

380
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,429
But what happened?
He ghosted you. He never came.

381
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,989
Most guys would come for you
if you were drunk at a club.

382
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,189
That jerk sounds really cold-hearted.

383
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,455
Yes, that's what that jerk is like.

384
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,015
No, he's a really nice guy.

385
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,245
If he's such a nice guy,
why did you curse him saying he's a fox?

386
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,699
- When did I do that?
- When you got wasted,

387
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,125
you went over to a guy
in a fox costume and said,

388
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,455
"I could understand everything."

389
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,489
"I could deal with the fact
that you're a fox."

390
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,029
You said that.

391
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,929
Not only is he cold-hearted,
he's as sly as a fox.

392
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,479
Did you always pay,
while he never bought you a present?

393
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,709
Don't date a guy like him.

394
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,569
Yes, call him right now
and tell him you're done.

395
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,765
Enough!

396
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,675
That's enough boiling water.

397
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,455
Please enjoy your dinner.

398
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,705
I need to vent my anger... I mean,

399
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,945
I need to get some beer.

400
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,775
Eat up.

401
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,045
Were we a bit too agitated before him?

402
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,119
- You were way too loud.
- You were loud.

403
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,445
No, her.

404
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,515
- Gosh.
- Fire...

405
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,499
Professor Irr...
I mean, Professor Oh Sang-chul.

406
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,375
I heard Professor Shin was
having fun with the students,

407
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,265
so I decided to stop by.

408
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,919
I see. Professor, have you had dinner?

409
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,555
- We were...
- One second.

410
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,125
Ground pepper.

411
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,905
This is perfect timing
to learn some more about pepper.

412
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,059
Don't you think so?

413
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,779
Do you know who brought pepper to Korea

414
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,815
and how it was popularized?

415
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,865
There's a record on pepper
in the old writings of "Pahanjib."

416
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,355
Wait, one second.

417
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,059
The knowledge you gain easily
will be forgotten easily.

418
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,155
Therefore, you should
turn in a report on this subject.

419
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,679
- Here, you can take this.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,965
Grab a seat.

421
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,695
Wait, one second.

422
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,045
A silver spoon.

423
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,285
This is perfect timing to learn some more
about silver spoons, right?

424
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,589
Many kings in the past used silver spoons

425
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,929
in an attempt to avoid
getting poisoned to death.

426
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,635
You should turn in a report
of those historical anecdotes.

427
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,829
- May I...
- Yes, of course. Please.

428
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,205
Okay.

429
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,989
Right, from what I heard,
students have been calling me

430
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,669
Professor Irritating recently.

431
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,119
What's the reason?

432
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,029
- It's...
- It's because...

433
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,385
Yes, it's because
you are irritatingly handsome,

434
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,115
so we've been calling you that.

435
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,475
It's just as I expected.

436
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,305
Yes, of course.

437
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,109
- Goodness.
- In that case,

438
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,879
can you turn in a report

439
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,695
regarding how handsome I am?

440
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,215
Of course, it's already a proven theory.

441
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,965
I slept so well last night!

442
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,215
Gosh, this is hilarious.

443
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,765
Wait, one second.

444
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,855
- Glass craft.
- Professor Oh!

445
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,709
I have to be in a TOEIC class,
so please excuse me.

446
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,789
Me too. I have to take my medicine.

447
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,185
- Yes, I should get going.
- One second.

448
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,415
Miss Dam.

449
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,885
Sir?

450
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,105
Wait, did you just put on a disguise
to kick out my friends?

451
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,925
Why?

452
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,835
Sir.

453
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,375
Please don't mind what my friends said.

454
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,655
They got worried about me,
so they overreacted.

455
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,055
But Miss Dam, I was good to you too.

456
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,595
Just as you said yesterday,
I bought what you wanted to eat,

457
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,725
helped you with your report,
took you to the museum,

458
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,335
and even helped you make kimchi.
Why didn't you tell them that?

459
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,645
Exactly. I never had a chance
to tell them anything about you.

460
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,539
If we ever get together again,
I'll make sure

461
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,129
they don't say anything like...

462
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,615
No, we won't do anything like this again.

463
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,389
What? Why not?

464
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,825
I liked seeing you
associate with other people.

465
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,589
We said we'll do
many things that humans do.

466
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,225
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

467
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,255
Wait.

468
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,175
Come on, sir. Sir! Please?

469
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,769
Come on, sir.

470
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,815
Can't you do this for me? Please?

471
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,035
I have everything planned out.

472
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,905
Aren't you cold?

473
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,979
What? The heater is on, so not at all.

474
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,575
You seem a little cold.

475
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,435
What are you doing?

476
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,205
I don't want you to catch a cold.

477
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,435
What?

478
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,715
[ What is he doing? ]

479
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,725
Why did he give me these things?

480
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,945
My gosh. Goodness.

481
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,405
This is way too hot. Gosh.

482
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,485
Did this plan just fall through?

483
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,385
No matter how much I think about him,
he doesn't seem different from Hye-sun.

484
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,805
But how did she make it
while he couldn't...

485
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,109
Yes, Hye-sun.

486
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,445
I had Hye-sun as a model example.

487
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,569
Jae-jin, isn't it about time
you took your medicine?

488
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,985
Yes, you're right.

489
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,565
Wait.

490
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,165
Here it is.

491
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,515
Hye-sun, you know,
this injury is uncomfortable,

492
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,139
but I like how I got hurt.

493
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,769
Why are you happy about that?

494
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,899
But still, you've been worried about me
ever since I got hurt.

495
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,755
So I'm glad I got hurt.

496
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,675
- Hye-sun, I'll take my medicine.
- Okay.

497
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,695
Hye-sun, can the three of us
eat dinner together?

498
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,325
The three of us?

499
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,389
Do you have to be the third wheel?

500
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,769
Not with him. You, me, and my sir.

501
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,505
I don't want to.
I'm not going to see Woo-yeo anymore.

502
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,405
There's no way he could be a human.

503
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,029
How can he push Jae-jin down the stairs?

504
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,889
Then he completely denied the charges.

505
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,919
He really didn't push him.

506
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,599
I know he did.
I still have my sixth sense.

507
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,989
I could feel some kind of mysterious force
pushing Jae-jin down.

508
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,375
There's no one else
who could use such magic...

509
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,479
You're right. It was the mountain spirit.

510
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,859
He got hurt just as I did before.

511
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,759
What? That darned old man.

512
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,499
Calm down. So apologize to him,
undo the misunderstanding,

513
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,315
and try to get along with him.

514
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,295
Gosh, I've never said I'm sorry to him.

515
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,079
Not even once.

516
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,004
[ All right. Let's keep
the answer sheet next to me ]

517
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,975
[ and see what the difference is. ]

518
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,509
I'd like to order two club sandwiches
and one shrimp sandwich.

519
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,049
Which bread would you like to have?

520
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,259
Honey oat for the club sandwiches

521
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,915
- and white bread for the shrimp sandwich.
- Okay.

522

523

You see, we didn't meet up
to eat sandwiches today.

524
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,055
Hye-sun, you said you had
something to say to him.

525
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,189
The thing is, I told her

526
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,735
it wasn't you who pushed Jae-jin.

527
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,075
Hey, Woo-yeo.

528
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,305
I'm so...

529
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,835
So...

530
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,155
Do they have soy milk too?

531
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,845
I guess they don't.

532
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,969
Sir, it looks like
Hye-sun wants to say sorry.

533
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,345
Why don't you say something?

534
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,605
Well, it's o...

535
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,755
It's o...

536
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,645
It's okay, Miss Dam. This is unnecessary.

537
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,265
Why did you invite Hye-sun, by the way?

538
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,425
[ They're exactly the same. ]

539
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,055
[ I don't see any difference. ]

540
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,169
It looks like we're all finished.
Shall we go?

541
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,325
That sounds good.

542
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,305
No! It hasn't even started yet.

543
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,535
Start?

544
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,665
I mean, the reconciliation.

545
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,215
You didn't get to make up
with each other yet.

546
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,825
Why don't we go grab a drink?

547
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,695
Alcohol is the best solution
when it comes to reconciliation.

548
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,175
Is everything going all right at school?

549
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,715
Of course, Dad.

550
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,099
Though I could use a bit more money
to buy workbooks.

551
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,215
I'm not asking you, Seo-woo.
I was asking Seon-woo.

552
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,229
Well, I'm doing my best.

553
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,665
Why did you even start studying history
if you wanted to work for my company?

554
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,525
You should have gone study abroad.

555
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,635
You keep saying that.

556
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,185
You know how much he hates to hear that.

557
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,775
I'll go.

558
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,655
Really? Are you really going?

559
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,325
What happened?
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

560
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,225
You said it felt like you're forced to go
and you hated it.

561
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,725
Butt out.

562
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,395
It's because of her, right?

563
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,249
- That boy, Lee Dan's sister.
- What?

564
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,449
That day, when you picked on me
at the police station,

565
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,685
your eyes were fixed on her.

566
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,935
So I figured out what's going on.

567
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,149
But it looks like she dumped you.

568
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,045
That's just part of the reason...

569
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,155
Forget it.

570
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,615
You see,

571
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,475
if you have regrets,
why don't you try one last time?

572
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,685
I don't have regrets.

573
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,515
Cheers.

574
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,545
It's so nice to drink all together.
Don't you think?

575
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,125
It is kind of nice to have
some makgeolli after a while.

576
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,085
This reminds me of the time

577
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,425
when I dated Lord Kim's third son.

578
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,159
He made straw shoes for me
and gave me chocolate.

579
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,615
He was so sweet.

580
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,555
Did they have chocolate back then?

581
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,629
You were all excited,
saying noblemen are indeed different.

582
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,215
Wasn't it in the 1600s though?

583
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,935
It was.

584
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,235
I thought chocolate was imported
in the 1800s.

585
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,695
Maybe it was taffy then.

586
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,785
Come on. It was centuries ago.
I was confused.

587
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,815
Anyway, it's nice to see you guys
reminiscing about the same time period.

588
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,615
You are old friends, right?

589
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:23,055
Speaking of which,
why don't you save her phone number?

590
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,575
What? You haven't saved my number yet?

591
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,775
I saved your number. Look.

592
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,665
Did you save me

593
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,085
as "Pox"?

594
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,575
What about it? You are a "pox".

595
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,375
You spelled it wrong.

596
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,749
It's "fox", not "pox".

597
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,335
F, O, X. Fox.

598
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,315
What?

599
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,815
I know. It's just a typo.

600
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,635
You're such an ungrateful smarty-pants.

601
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,789
I even held your hand to share my energy
because you seemed so shaky.

602
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,335
And how dare you treat me like this?

603
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,149
It was just

604
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,565
to get some energy.

605
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,585
There's nothing to worry about.

606
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,745
Well, seeing your relationship,

607
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,135
I wouldn't worry about anything
even if you were holding each other tight.

608
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,065
That's great.

609
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,795
What? What is it?

610
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,245
I don't like those mean-looking fox eyes.

611
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,159
Stop fighting.

612
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,165
Still, you guys have been relying
on each other for such a long time.

613
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,095
She was more of a weed to me.

614
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,435
Things were much easier without her.

615
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,089
Same here.

616
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,425
I would have been much happier
without him.

617
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,019
What an ungrate.

618
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,095
You mean, "ingrate", not "ungrate".

619
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,645
It's "ingrate".

620
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,189
My, you're really smart.

621
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,389
Is that why you haven't
become a human yet?

622
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,329
- You have a problem with that?
- I can't hear you.

623
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,909
- Stop talking like that.
- Keep talking.

624
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,759
[ - They're the same. ]
- I'm much older than you.

625
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,715
[ They've lived hundreds of years,
but they're more childish than children. ]

626
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,179
[ What in the world is
the difference between ]

627
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,905
[ taking off a jacket because of the sun ]

628
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,705
[ and taking off a jacket because of wind? ]

629
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,115
From now on, please never organize
a meet-up with Hye-sun.

630
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,285
I won't. Thanks for trying anyway.

631
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,735
Though it wasn't that fruitful.

632
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,285
Miss Dam.

633
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,365
Is there another reason
why you want to live with me again?

634
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,655
What?

635
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,555
You suddenly made me spend time
with your friends,

636
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,715
organized today's meet-up,

637
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:54,269
and said things like you had a plan
but it didn't turn out fruitful,

638
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,425
which I find a bit strange.

639
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,985
What do you mean, strange?
There's no other reason.

640
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,535
It's cold. Let's go.

641
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,899
- What?
- Isn't that Dam and Professor Shin?

642
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,405
My gosh.

643
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,005
Take a photo of them.

644
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,975
- But why?
- This is unbelievable.

645
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,705
Gosh. He's quick-witted like a fox.

646
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,265
Should I just tell him the truth?

647
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,895
No.

648
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,585
It might only confuse him.

649
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,975
Gosh, I'm so tired.

650
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,595
"A History Professor and A Student
Spotted on Date".

651
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,079
Add, "Shocking News".

652
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,725
Okay. "Shocking News".

653
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,049
I can't believe this.

654
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,045
How could she do this behind everyone?

655
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,315
I knew it.

656
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,695
- Should I post it?
- Yes.

657
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,249
Hey, did you read that post
on Everyday Time?

658
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,055
No. Did something interesting happen?

659
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,085
Well...

660
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,985
Someone posted
such a heartbreaking confession of love.

661
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,175
Here.

662
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,599
"I first met him two years ago
when I was a freshman."

663
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,399
"I told him
how much I loved his warm smile,"

664
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,249
"but he dumped me brutally."

665
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,159
"It hurt me
and I have been mean to him since."

666
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,495
"But in fact, I still like him."

667
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,515
"I'm sure he doesn't know how I feel."

668
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,965
Is that our senior, Jung Seok?

669
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,795
What in the...
There's nothing interesting about it.

670
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,735
You're such a horrible actress.
I know you wrote this.

671
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,979
What are you saying?

672
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,129
Stop acting like it's not you.

673
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,549
I have always wondered
why you hated him for no reason.

674
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,115
I guess it's because he turned you down
when you were a freshman.

675
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,019
Wait. When we played truth or dare,

676
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,739
you said you used to like one of us there.

677
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,509
And Jung Seok, Seon-woo, and I were

678
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,779
the only men there.

679
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,239
It's definitely you.

680
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,999
Jeez! I said it wasn't me!

681
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,139
"It wasn't me!"

682
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,089
Hey, did you read that new post
on Everyday Time?

683
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,325
That's...

684
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,925
really not me.

685
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,635
What are you talking about?

686
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,105
We're talking about the photo
of Professor Shin and Dam.

687
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,735
He's right.

688
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,585
Didn't you know about this? Let's go.

689
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,119
I thought they were friends.

690
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,349
I guess not.

691
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,455
What...

692
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,325
- Hey, look for that post.
- We were looking at the wrong post.

693
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,685
Seon-woo!

694
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,915
I thought there was something going on
between you and Dam.

695
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,539
What are you talking about?

696
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,019
I mean, she has a boyfriend,
so I've always wondered

697
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,875
why she would always
get involved with you.

698
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,685
And that boyfriend of hers
turned out to be a professor.

699
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,229
- She must have lost her mind.
- I know.

700
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,475
Where did you hear that?

701
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,635
Hey, are these two really going out?

702
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,569
Isn't it obvious?

703
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,125
Their arms are linked.
They're definitely going out.

704
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,709
I thought Dam was dating Seon-woo.

705
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,619
Wait. Didn't Professor Shin get involved

706
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,349
with a scandal with Professor Seo?

707
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,279
Right. It's a love rectangle then.

708
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,345
It's so confusing.

709
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,799
Hey, maybe we should share this
in our group chat.

710
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,045
Good idea. Go on and do it.

711
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,719
You know both taking photos in secret
and spreading the photos are wrong.

712
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,539
You should refrain
from talking behind others' back

713
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,909
if you don't really know about it.

714
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,955
Come on, guys. It's fun.

715
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,489
You were surprised to see it too.

716
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,249
How could you not know?
You're her friends.

717
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,349
Do we have to?

718
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,452
Dam is a grown-up.
She knows what she's doing.

719
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:44,925
Is there a problem?

720
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,089
Of course, there is. She takes his class.

721
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,209
- It's a big problem.
- You're right.

722
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,539
What if he gives her good grades
because they're dating?

723
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,959
- That wouldn't be fair.
- That's not acceptable.

724
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,825
It just doesn't make sense
that a student goes out with a professor.

725
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,455
Hey, Dam is here.

726
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,225
What's going on here?

727
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,085
This is just unbelievable.

728
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,619
You were the ones who took the photo?

729
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,289
You should be professional paparazzis.

730
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,359
When did they start dating?

731
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,559
After Professor Shin started
working here, obviously.

732
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,679
Seriously though, how could she
even think of dating a professor?

733
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,939
Wait. Did he volunteer for the club

734
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,699
- for his girlfriend?
- Yes.

735
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,029
- Gosh, even my heart flutters.
- Do you even hear yourself?

736
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,659
Guys, enough already.

737
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,369
- Goodness.
- What's enough?

738
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,319
How could a professor date a student?

739
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,599
Even if he could,

740
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,449
he shouldn't date someone
who takes his class.

741
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,265
Come on. They're both adults.

742
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,149
I just feel bad for Seon-woo.

743
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,925
- Right.
- Dam.

744
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,645
Hey, Dam. Is that true?
What about Seon-woo?

745
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,325
How did you seduce a professor?

746
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,845
We were dating
even before he became a professor here.

747
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,265
I didn't know
he'd be teaching my major here.

748
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,349
And about the club, I heard it was decided
by the professors at a meeting.

749
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,379
I see. So there's no problem with it?

750
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,749
Who cares?

751
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,339
Who knows if he'll give you good grades
because you're dating him?

752
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,585
She has a good point.

753
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,445
I'll drop the class.

754
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,039
Dam, we're having our final soon.

755
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,979
It will be wasting
a whole semester of studying.

756
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,055
It's better
than misunderstandings like this.

757
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,605
Now everything is okay, right?
I should get going now.

758
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,315
Right. Jeon Da-young, Seo Jin.

759
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,645
Delete the photo.

760
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,519
- That little...
- Hey.

761
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,899
It is kind of mean of you
to post the photo online.

762
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,315
Shut it.

763
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,035
[ Seon-woo ]

764
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,535
[ Seon-woo ]

765
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,875
What is it you wanted to say?

766
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,335
It's about you and the professor.

767
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,335
There are rumors about it
in our department. Someone saw you.

768
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,185
I know.

769
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,915
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

770
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,405
I mean, why are you
dating someone like him?

771
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,735
Don't the rumors about him bother you?

772
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,625
It's none of your business.

773
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,269
I know you don't care
about what others say,

774
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,249
but people will talk about you
behind your back.

775
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,355
And...

776
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,365
some will talk about me as well.

777
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,085
It's my fault. I shouldn't have made it
so obvious that I liked you.

778
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,435
Let me at least take care of this.

779
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,205
I'm the one who put you in trouble.

780
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,329
I can tell people
that I was the one who insisted...

781
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,745
Please don't do that.

782
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,445
I don't want to put you in trouble
for my own sake.

783
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,435
Just don't worry about it.

784
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,195
If you're done, I'll get going.

785
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,785
[ Seon-woo, your departure date is set. ]

786
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,245
[ Don't forget to give me
your tablet before you go. ]

787
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,015
Dam.

788
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,095
I like you.

789
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,185
I like that you speak so casually

790
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,445
and the way you look
when you glance at me carelessly.

791
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,645
I like everything about you.

792
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,425
- Seon-woo.
- There were times

793
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,945
I thought I was just confused

794
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,005
because I couldn't make you like me.

795
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,745
But I don't think that's the case.

796
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,945
I like you.

797
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,675
I know what you're going to say.

798
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,405
Still,

799
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,015
I wanted to say it one last time.

800
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,755
One last time?

801
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,565
I'm going to go study abroad.

802
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,235
This can be a confession of love

803
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,065
or a goodbye.

804
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,235
You can take it however you like.

805
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,155
Goodbye, Seon-woo.

00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,135

809
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,355
Hello, sir.

810
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,205
Why are you walking away?

811
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,885
Well...

812
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,559
I don't want to put you in trouble.

813
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,425
What do you mean by trouble?
We didn't do anything wrong.

814
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,295
I just don't want people
to talk behind your back.

815
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,635
I don't care about that.

816
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,995
So don't run away.

817
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,829
I got everything settled.

818
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,899
I admitted that we're going out.

819
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,229
And this does look suspicious,

820
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,525
so I'll drop your class.

821
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,465
Everything is okay now.

822
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,065
That's probably

823
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,535
why the red thread has been cut.

824
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,995

825
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,305
You're right. I don't see it any more.

826
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,925
You could see the red thread?

827
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,465
Yes. I started seeing it at some point.

828
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,325
But what matters is
that we managed to cut it.

829
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,725
- "We"?
- Yes.

830
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,195
We solved this on our own.

not the stupid thread.

Go and clear the air. I'll be waiting.

835
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,405
I'm sorry, Professor Shin.

836
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:30,355
It looks like there were rumors about us.

837
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,905
I'm sure it made you feel uncomfortable.

838
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,919
Now that I think about it,
you always turned me down.

839
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,205
You were just being polite.

840
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,575
I'm bad at taking hints.

841
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,409
I'm saying this
because I thought it'd be good

00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:49,105
for the both of us to make things clear.

843
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,105
There's nothing

844
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,365
you should apologize for.

845
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,895
I knew you were interested in me.

846
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,915

00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,195
I'm sorry.

for Seon-woo as well.

857
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,029
He probably didn't like me so much

858
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,545

- How about pasta?
- Sounds good.

00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,839
Let's invite your friends too.

Okay. Then I'll invite...

866
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,525
- What?
- They didn't get to eat much that day.

867
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,155
I want to make up for it.

868
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,235
But you said
it's not going to happen again.

869
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,865
I did.

870
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,305
But I thought I might be able
to work it out like I did today.

871
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,105
That's great. I've always wanted
to brag about my boyfriend.

872

Let's do that.

873
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,885
- Let's go.
- Okay.

874
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,295

876
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,945
She went to the restroom.

00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,635

I'm sorry I kept it a secret.

878
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,969
Are you sure you want this?

879
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,005
He once had a scandal with Professor Seo.

00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,815
It's just a rumor. It will die down soon.

881
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,189
Dam. I thought this was my problem,

882
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,679
so I was going to keep it to myself,

883
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,529
but now I know you're dating
Professor Shin,

884
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,849
so I need to tell you this.

885
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,045
Please don't get me wrong.

886
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,635
What is it?

887
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,395
As a matter of fact...

888
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,909
I once saw Professor Shin and Hye-sun
holding hands.

889
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,635
That's why I hated him.

890
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,179
That's a misunderstanding.

891
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,855
Professor Shin and Hye-sun are just...

892
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,595
[ Officially, their age difference is
too big to be friends. ]

893
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,245
[ If I say they held hands
because of energy, he'd think I'm crazy. ]

894
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,655
They're just what?

895
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,985
They're just...

896
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,255
Relatives. Distant relatives.

897
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,235
Really?

898
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,939
That's why they both look so attractive.

899
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,655
It runs in the family.

900
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,829
I can't believe I judged
such an upright man.

901
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,589
I'm so ashamed of myself.

902
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,439
I know. I'm very ashamed of you too.

903
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,679
Look at you, flip-flopping so quickly.

904
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,619
I knew there was something
different about them.

905
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,295
- This is so cool.
- What's so cool?

906
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,895
- This way, Professor.
- He's coming.

907
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,959
On my way back from the toi...
I mean, restroom,

908
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,285
I bumped into him.

909
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,519
Hello, Professor.

910
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,695
I mean, Mr. Dam's boyfriend.
I mean, hello, Professor.

911
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:20,115
Shall we take seats now?

912
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,575
Okay.

913
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,885
Relax, guys.

914
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,279
Well, I know what I did,

915
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,385
so I can't relax.

916
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,885
I still feel bad
about what I said at his place that day.

917
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,749
We didn't know you were her boyfriend then

918
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,275
and used curse words.

919
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,255
"We"?

920
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,109
I was just playing along with her

921
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,339
because I didn't want

922
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,269
my friend to feel embarrassed.

923
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:05,525
I didn't mean it, Professor.

924
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,255
Professor. What's your favorite?

925
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,135
Well, there are so many things
I like about her,

926
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,975
but my favorite is her smile.

927
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,055
What?

928
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:37,555
I was asking what your favorite menu was.

929
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,445
I like everything.

930
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,085
Excuse me!

931
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,685
I wish every day was like today.

932
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,985
I'll try to make
your every day like today.

933
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,975
I should have discussed with you
in the first place.

934
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,625
The things I couldn't change
no matter how hard I tried

935
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,935
seem to change
since you realized it yourself.

936
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,675
Now I get it.

937
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,765
You're the kind of person
who takes off the jacket

938
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,335
when exposed to warm sunshine
for a long time.

939
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,145
To be honest,

940
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,445
there is another reason
why I'm living with you.

941
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,405
What?

942
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,185
What turns the Marble blue...

943
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:49,805
is humanity.

944
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:53,585
Humanity?

945
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,775
Are you okay?

946
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:12,775
I'm glad.

947
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,845
I thought your sacrifice was
what changed the color of the Marble,

948
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:21,045
and it made me feel bad.

949
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,955
But I'm glad

950
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,565
that wasn't the case.

951
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,455
Still,

952
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,175
we should be careful.

953
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,445
There's still the hunger issue,
so it can still be dangerous.

954
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,835
I said, don't worry.

955
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,565
There's no way I'll be in danger.

956
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,545
Actually, when I met the mountain spirit,

957
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,705
I asked him a favor.

958
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,545
I said I would make sure
to turn you into a human,

959
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,155
so I wanted him to keep me
from any sickness or death.

960
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,775
We made an agreement.

961
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,085
You always surprise me.

962
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,035
I need to save myself, after all.

963
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,975
Looks like the wind
dropped the wind chime.

964
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,275
Good night, Miss Dam.

965
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,695
Good night.

966
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,975
I thought I was not in danger
any more, so...

967
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:23,055
I think things are
just about to get dangerous.

968
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,845
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

969
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,265
[ I can't focus on my homework. ]

970
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,075
[ I can't focus on anything. ]

971
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,129
Bye, Sir.

972
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:04,769
[ Who would think you're dating him
if you call him "Sir"? ]

973
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:05,739
You're done, Dam?

974
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,409
Honey! My love!

975
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,439
- It's cheesy, right?
- I like it.

976
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,379
[ I'm very concerned about my friend
who started a tough love. ]

977
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,165
I'm thinking of quitting the job
after this semester.

978
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,535
[ Why won't he make out with me? ]

979
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,819
[ - Sometimes, it works. ]
- My goodness!

980
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,799
Sometimes, it doesn't.
Why do you think that is?

981
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,185
I think that's a sign
that you're turning into a human.
