1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,160
Hey, Sin Da-On.

2
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,760
It isn't true, is it? It's not, right?

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,160
No, of course not.
It's a misunderstanding.

4
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,839
Right?

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,679
I knew it.

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,399
Then why were you holding hands?

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,759
Why were you staring so lovingly at him?

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm sorry. I have something
to take care of, so I have to go.

9
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,039
Let's talk later.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,799
Okay. I'll see you later.

12
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,759
But shouldn't you
at least explain yourself?

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,119
Everybody thinks it's true.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,689
Something seems off about him.

15
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,599
He seems to have changed
since yesterday. I wonder why.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,799
Da-On. Have this while you work.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
The math teacher went to class.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,920
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

19
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,400
Okay.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Da-On, are you feeling sick?

21
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,280
You don't look well.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
No, I'm fine.

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,040
Okay. If you don't feel well,
feel free to tell me.

24
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll tell the math teacher.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,640
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Seo.

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,480
- Hey, did you see the photo too?
- What?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,840
That guy is the president, Sin Da-On.

28
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,840
No way. I thought he was so cool
when I watched the podcast.

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,840
I heard he was nice...

30
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,519
because he was interested in him.

31
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,039
Really?

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,280
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

33
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,280
I heard Da-On made him join
the student council, so he can date him.

34
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,530
Hey. Let's talk outside.
I think he can hear us.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,879
Is Da-On here yet?

36
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,090
By the way, why do I have
so many messages?

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,759
I can't even check them.

38
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,879
Hey, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,919
You joined the student council...

40
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,719
and caught 2 birds with 1 stone.
Love and friendship.

41
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,639
Aren't you a bit too open-minded?

42
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,680
Dating in an all-boys school is a bit...

43
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,039
What do you mean by dating?

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Oh, you don't know yet?

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,039
This has been spreading in group chats
since last night.

46
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,879
If Da-On's parents find out,
they won't let this go.

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,319
I heard they're the chairman
of the foundation.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,159
Da-On.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,560
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

50
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,840
No way. Do you think they sent him
abroad already?

51
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,039
Because they're embarrassed.

52
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,159
There he goes.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
My gosh.

54
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,439
I don't know about Woo Tae-Gyeong,
but Sin Da-On likes guys?

55
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,919
I had a feeling about that.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,360
Doesn't Sin Da-On give off
that kind of vibe?

57
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,000
How should I put it?
He's needlessly kind to people.

58
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,120
He hit on me too!

59
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh, really?

60
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,879
I had no idea when I'm always with him,
so how did you figure it out?

61
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,120
Gosh, you're incredible.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,000
I see. Are you close with Da-On?

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,170
I mean... It's not like that.

64
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,759
I'm not only handsome,
but I'm great at memorization.

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,170
I memorized your name,
so I'll ask him...

66
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,879
if he ever hit on you.

67
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,199
Hey. I'm really sorry.

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,759
I was just saying that.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,240
I don't know Sin Da-On at all.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
I was just saying it.

71
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,519
Hey, you heard what he said, right?

72
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,959
Don't go around saying weird things
about Da-On either.

73
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,730
Okay.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
Everyone's...

75
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,519
so interested in
other people's business. Right?

76
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,730
I'm like that too.

77
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,319
But I don't talk about people behind
their backs and make bets...

78
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,279
like you guys.

79
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,360
It's too pathetic.

80
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,879
Bye.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,720
(Saebit Boys High School)

82
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,959
Excuse me.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
Oh, you're the guy that just joined
the student council.

84
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,800
Yes.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,240
Did you see Da-On today?

86
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,480
I haven't seen him all day.

87
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,439
Oh, Da-On is probably
in the teachers' lounge right now.

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,959
What?
Why did he go to the teachers' lounge?

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,079
I heard he went
because the math teacher asked for him.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,199
I see.

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,319
He didn't get called
in because of me, right?

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
Because of that photo?

93
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,639
Da-On's parents will take care of
something like that.

94
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,839
Although that could be worse for him.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
Do you know...

96
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,959
when he went into the teachers' lounge?

97
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm not really sure.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,079
In any case, don't worry about it.

99
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,079
Da-On is good at taking care of himself.

100
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,519
He looked okay when we saw him.

101
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,720
It'll be okay.

102
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,959
Hey. You're here.

103
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,959
Did Woo Tae-Gyeong come by?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
No. Neither Da-On
nor Tae-Gyeong came by.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,160
These punks have been
talking about this...

106
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,399
for the past 12 hours
and eating up my battery.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
They're incredible.

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
Even the girls at Saebit Girls
High School know about this.

109
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,160
I was envious about how popular
Da-On was,

110
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,439
but this time, I'm not.

111
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,879
Who on earth took this photograph?

112
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm not sure.

113
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
It was taken on
the student council trip,

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,360
so it's someone in the student council.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,519
Da-On's not the type to incur
someone's hatred.

116
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
Do you think it could be Lee So-Hee?

117
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,920
She might be jealous that
Tae-Gyeong and Da-On have gotten close.

118
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,959
Message me if you see Da-On.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,279
What? Okay. I will.

120
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,680
Do I need to get involved?

121
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,319
Oh, that's right. Did you see this?

122
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
I heard Sin Da-On is gay.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,839
Of course I saw it.

124
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,720
But I don't think they're holding hands.

125
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
I think it just looks like that.

126
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,799
Maybe.

127
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,919
Makes sense. Doesn't he like girls?

128
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,639
There's that girl
he's always hanging out with.

129
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
Oh, Lee So-Hee?

130
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,120
I don't think they're dating.
I think So-Hee just has a crush on him.

131
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,759
But what if Lee So-Hee
spread this rumor on purpose?

132
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,559
That would be terrifying.

133
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
What? Why would she?

134
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,879
She wants people to think he's gay,
so she can have him all to herself.

135
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,919
Gosh, I get chills
just thinking about this.

136
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,759
No way. I got chills.

137
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,039
Look at it.
She's more than capable of doing so.

138
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,679
I wonder what the truth is.

Oh, my gosh.

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,879
You surprised me.

I'm sorry.

149
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,450
Are you going to wait for him?

Of course, I can't believe it.)

I'm not sure.

I think you might have something
to say to me.

- Me?
- Yes.

00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sure you're very curious.

165
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,559
I'm sure you've already heard
the rumors, so I'll skip that part.

166
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,399
Don't you want to know
what Da-On is doing and if he's okay?

167
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,720
Isn't it normal for you to be curious
about those things?

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
He didn't answer the phone,
so I assumed he was busy.

169
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
You're a lot calmer than I expected.

170
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,559
It's as if you've prepared yourself.

171
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,840
What?

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Okay. Listen carefully.

173
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,240
The Lee So-Hee that I know would be
running around looking for Sin Da-On.

174
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,759
Even if you believe that it's not true,

175
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,080
you need to ask Da-On yourself...

176
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,159
and hear him tell you that it isn't
to be satisfied.

177
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,399
But here's what's strange.

178
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,679
You're...

179
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,480
meeting with me right now.

180
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
- That's because...
- So...

181
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,879
what my incredible
deductive skills concluded is that...

182
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,039
You...

183
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,519
like me a lot more
than you thought you did.

184
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,759
Is this how scary affection
based on hatred is?

185
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,879
Did you call me here
to joke around with me?

186
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,279
I just called you because I was bored.

187
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,440
By the way, what will Da-On do now?

188
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,519
Why?

189
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
You know...

190
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,639
what kind of people Da-On's parents are.

191
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,480
If they find out about this,
they won't sit by and do nothing.

192
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,159
Then we may never be able to see
Da-On ever again.

193
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,559
Da-On won't be able to show his face
around with that personality.

194
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't know who did it,
but I'm sure they'll regret it.

195
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,840
Right?

196
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,679
Mr. Seo. I'll be leaving now.

197
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,919
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

198
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,799
Mr. Seo.

199
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,720
You must have a lot of work to do.
Do you want help?

200
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,799
No. You should go home and get rest.

201
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,360
You look really tired today.

202
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm okay. I'm not tired.

203
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,080
Don't even study today.

204
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,559
Just go home and get plenty of rest.
Okay?

205
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm really fine.

206
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,120
I'll go home then.

207
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,399
Okay. Goodbye. Good work today.

208
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,399
You can say that you're not okay
from time to time.

209
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,679
Humans aren't machines,
so they can't be okay all the time.

210
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,480
There's no need to be either.

211
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,720
Nothing bad will happen
just because you say you're not okay.

212
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,480
You're smart,
so you know what I mean, right?

213
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,120
But it has become a habit,

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,399
so I feel like I must be okay
all the time.

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,159
In any case, thank you.

217
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,840
The school was quite noisy today.

218
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,159
Oh, right.

219
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,080
Is it true?

220
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,559
That you're dating a member
of the student council?

221
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,519
No, sir.

222
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:46,440
I was just nice to him because he's new.

223
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,840
Even if you're nice to him,
you should set boundaries.

224
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,519
If your parents find out about this,
you know we'll be in a tight spot.

225
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,200
Did the chairman say anything?

226
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,279
No, he didn't.

227
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,480
It's the school president.

228
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,599
- Let's just go.
- Why? It's him.

229
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,799
Okay. Let's go inside and talk.

230
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,960
Yes, sir.

231
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
(Even if it's false,)

232
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,759
(once the chairman finds out,
it'll all be over.)

233
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,240
(Why would you cause trouble
when you've done so well?)

234
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,680
(They say the ones who get
interested late digs deepest.)

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,119
Da-On.

236
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,170
Are you okay?

237
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,920
Da-On.

238
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,039
Next time.

239
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,319
Let's talk next time, Tae-Gyeong.

240
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,240
Do you even want to talk to me?

241
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
You know you've been
acting really strange, right?

242
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,480
Ever since the student council trip.

243
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,799
Is it because of what I said?

244
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,319
I just wanted to tell you how I felt.

245
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,240
It wasn't because I wanted you to become
distant and awkward around me.

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,920
I know what you mean.
I know that, but...

247
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,119
I kept waiting for you.

248
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,680
I can continue waiting for you.

249
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,319
But if you keep running away like that,

250
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,480
there is nothing I can do.

251
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,799
What I really want to know...

252
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,559
is if you thought about me.

253
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,599
You could've called me.

254
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,599
The first thing I thought about was you.

255
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,440
I was worried that you'd do
something terrible,

256
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,279
so I couldn't focus on anything all day.

257
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,920
I guess that wasn't the case for you.

258
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,839
I guess it was just me.

259
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,839
Yes,

260
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,039
I guess so.

261
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,759
Now that I think about it,
I thought about myself all day,

262
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,650
and I didn't think about you.

263
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.

264
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,079
I was wrong...

265
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,319
when I said it wasn't your fault.
It is your fault.

266
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,279
I thought you were
a sad and kind person...

267
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,680
who always acted like
everything was okay.

268
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,960
But you're...

269
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,680
just a bad person...

270
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,039
who only knows how to lie.

271
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,599
But...

272
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,890
I liked you despite knowing that.

273
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,079
Because it was you.

274
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,200
(If you have high expectations,
you'll end up getting hurt.)

275
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,079
(I forgot about that fact momentarily.)

276
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
(But I...)

277
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,720
(didn't know my place,)

278
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,039
(and I thought I could be someone...)

279
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,440
(who could be with Sin Da-On.)

280
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,559
I'm home.

281
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
(Saebit Boys High School 12th Grade)

282
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,440
(Everyone keeps asking if it's true.
Explain yourself.)

283
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
(You're not really gay, are you?)

284
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,440
(It's not like that.)

285
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,240
(Slide to power off.)

286
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,440
(You're just a bad person
who only knows how to lie.)

287
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,640
But I liked you despite knowing that.

288
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
Because it was you.

289
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,359
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

290
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,759
I waited for you because I was worried.

291
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
How did you know...

292
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,599
where I live?

293
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,319
I asked Namgung.

294
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,119
That's not important.

295
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,359
Are you okay?

296
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:19,720
I shouldn't have mustered up
the courage.

297
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,279
You did a good job.

298
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Not everyone...

299
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
can be courageous.

300
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,160
You heard what Namgung said.

301
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,079
You need...

302
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,359
courage.

303
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,359
If I knew it would hurt so much,

304
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,319
I never would've been courageous.

305
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,119
If you want to cry, just cry.

306
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,359
I can't just leave you here,

307
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,759
but I can pretend I didn't see anything.

308
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,960
Do you want to come over to my house?

309
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
Let's go...

310
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,480
to my house.

311
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,559
(Light on Me)

312
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,880
(Then there's nothing going on?)

313
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,079
(He's just nice to Tae-Gyeong
because they're friends.)

314
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,279
That's enough. Stop talking about it.

315
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,799
(Have you ever thought
you're being selfish?)

316
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,799
(That's not what's important here.)

317
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,079
Is that all you have to say to me?

318
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,759
(Go after him.)

319
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,880
Or...

320
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,799
I will.

321
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,359
(Light on Me)
