1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,080
I'll carry it for you.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,160
No, it's fine.
It's for me to do, so it's fine.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,679
Wait.

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,759
Your hands will get dirty.
Don't pick it up.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,039
This is my job.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,439
No, it's okay. You hurt your leg.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,839
No...

8
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,120
- Hold on. Come back.
(- To be honest,)

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,359
- Come back!
(- the first time I saw Tae-Gyeong...)

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,600
Hey, Woo Tae-Gyeong.
Let's go to the internet cafe together!

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,479
Come so that we can play in teams.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,850
I don't like playing games.

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,759
Take someone else.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,200
Hey.

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,399
A new semester is a chance to
hang out and make friends.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Come with us.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
I'm really not going.

18
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,719
Also, this is study hall, so be quiet.

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,039
Gosh, he's so frustrating.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,959
You're going to end up
being an outsider.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,959
You won't ever be able to make friends.

22
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,799
What's wrong with that?

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,599
What?

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,799
I don't need...

25
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,439
to have friends.

26
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,439
You're being disruptive.
People are studying in here.

27
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,959
You should go play your games.

28
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,599
You're so annoying.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,840
Are people who don't play
games annoying?

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,120
If that's the case,
I'm sorry for being annoying.

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,439
My gosh.

32
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,359
Hey. Let's just go.

33
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,959
Everyone's staring.

34
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,240
(That was the first time...)

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,319
(I wanted to get close to someone.)

36
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,719
(I saw Woo Tae-Gyeong
a couple times after that,)

37
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,599
(and I would purposely...)

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,960
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

39
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,840
Make sure you watch where you're going.

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
(But...)

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,759
(I gave up after I got the feeling
I wouldn't get close to him.)

42
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,520
(But...)

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,319
I keep thinking about him.

44
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,439
Is that new?

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,680
Oh, this? I got it as a gift.

46
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,599
From who? Who gave it to you?

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,000
- A girl?
- No, a guy.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
A guy?

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Hey, don't tell people that
a guy gave that to you.

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
Just say it's from a girl.

51
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,680
Right. It sounds funny.

52
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,000
- Why?
- Well...

53
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not weird for a guy to give
another guy a present,

54
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,639
but the vice president of
the student council... What's his name?

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,879
That guy... Noh Sin-Woo?

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,680
In eighth grade,

57
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,050
he gave a guy in his class a bracelet,
and people began talking about it.

58
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,439
Oh, right. That's why his friends
began to bully and avoid him.

59
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,240
But Noh Sin-Woo is incredible too.

60
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,360
He acted like he was fine
and did everything alone.

61
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,319
He didn't respond to
the strange rumors either.

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,279
Hey. He didn't deny it,
so it must be true.

63
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,240
Oh, right. You're close with him, right?

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,759
But I've never heard about this before.

66
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,730
By the way, this is a couple bracelet?

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,519
I didn't know that was
what you liked, Da-On.

68
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,519
I understand.

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,759
But don't end up falling for me. Okay?

70
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,920
Hey, there are only five minutes left
of break time.

71
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,170
Let's go get some cup noodles.

72
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,560
Do you want to come?

73
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,279
I'm fine. You guys can go.

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,240
Okay. Bye.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Bye.

76
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,730
It's been a while since
we had cup noodles.

77
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,959
Hey!

78
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,240
- Da-On.
- What were you doing here?

79
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,040
I was talking with my friends.
I was about to go back in.

80
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,680
I see. We're coming back from the store.

81
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,600
Do you want a bite?

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,279
No. You can eat up.

83
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,319
Thank goodness.

84
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,720
That makes me want to eat it now.

85
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,759
Hold on. No.
I didn't even take a bite yet.

86
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,839
- No. No.
- Give me a bite.

87
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,160
Hold on. I haven't had a bite yet.

88
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,560
- Give it here.
- Hold on. No.

89
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,600
- Give me a bite.
- No.

90
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,120
Is he not coming today?

91
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,639
I heard the one that just came out
is good.

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,199
Tae-Gyeong, are you here to get a drink?

93
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,399
What do you want? I'll buy.

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,079
It's fine.

95
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,319
I'm not.

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,519
Here.

97
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,680
We have
our tutoring session later, right?

98
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
I have something to say.

99
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,600
Do you want to meet earlier?

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
You have something to say?

101
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,720
Okay. Sounds good.

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Okay. I'll meet you in
the student council room later.

103
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,920
Okay.

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,160
(Administration)

105
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,720
What are you all up to today?

106
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Classes are over,
so should we go to karaoke?

107
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm sorry. I have a tutoring session
with Tae-Gyeong later.

108
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,319
You can skip it for one day.

109
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,959
The princes of the student council
should hang out. Don't you agree?

110
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry. Next time.
Let's go next time.

111
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,039
Then what about you, Sin-Woo? Do you
want to skip study hall and go with me?

112
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,480
I never skip study hall.

113
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,120
Fine. Be like that.

114
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,759
Forget it!

115
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm going to leave in search
of new friends!

116
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,330
Hey, Sin-Woo.

117
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,960
Hi, Tae-Gyeong.

118
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,639
Hello.

119
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,879
Hi.

120
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Hey.

121
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,039
You can stay, Sin-Woo.

122
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,039
No.

123
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,120
I was planning on leaving anyway.

124
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,879
You're here early.

125
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,519
Yes. I was going to wait for you,

126
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,039
but you're already here.

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,960
Then I can help you a bit more today.

128
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,639
Da-On, didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

129
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,330
Oh, right. That...

130
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,799
Let's talk after we're done.

131
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,679
Okay.

132
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,450
Have a seat, Tae-Gyeong.

133
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,240
How far did we get last time?

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,090
Oh, right. We got up to here.
Am I right?

135
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,240
Yes, you are.

136
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,039
Sin-Woo.

137
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,200
Have you been well?

138
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,320
Has everything been okay with you?

139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Are you getting along with Tae-Gyeong?

140
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes.

141
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,080
It looks like you've lost some weight.

142
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,240
Is something bothering you?

143
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,960
- Well...
- Wait.

144
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,559
You like someone, don't you?

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,080
No. No, it's not like that.

146
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,840
I guessed wrong then.

147
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,799
When I first saw you,
I thought you were just reserved.

148
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,480
As I got to know you,
I realized you were quite meticulous.

149
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,919
When you start liking someone,
you'll be good to them.

150
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
What if the person I like...

151
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,879
doesn't like me back?

152
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,840
What if...

153
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,000
they like someone else?

154
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,879
Then...

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,320
you should just stay by their side.

156
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,559
There will come a day
when that person struggles...

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,720
because of the person that they like.

158
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,879
That's how unrequited love is like.

159
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,399
Instead of doing nothing,
you could stay by their side...

160
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,360
and do your best
in the way that fits you.

161
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
That way, you won't end up with regrets.

162
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,559
Love divides into two categories.

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
You either regret it, or you don't.

164
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
That saying...

165
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
That is why you need courage.

166
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,000
You end up regretting anyways.

167
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,399
Did you ever say that to Namgung?

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
Yes. I told him that.

169
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,480
He's good at sharing knowledge.

170
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,799
In any case, thank you for helping me.

171
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,519
You can give it to me now.

172
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Goodbye.

173
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Sin-Woo.

174
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
Cheer up.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,159
I will.

176
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,440
Da-On?

177
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,039
Hold on, Tae-Gyeong. Let me
just respond to this message first.

178
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,519
Da-On. Let's talk.

179
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,039
I can't focus.

180
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,559
To be honest, there was something
I've been wanting to ask you.

181
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,879
I was upset about something too.

182
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,840
You were upset?

183
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,679
Yes.

184
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,759
The bracelet.

185
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,200
You said you'd wear it every day.

186
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,120
The thing is...

187
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,080
You always say "what's good is good",

188
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
and you never refuse anyone.

189
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,919
You give them everything,
and you accept what they give you too.

190
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,600
Am I just one of those many people?

191
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,440
Were you never sincere with me?

192
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,399
Sin Da-On!

193
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

194
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,360
Were you studying together?

195
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,159
Oh, I see. I should borrow it later.

196
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,919
We'll get going then.

197
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,919
You guys can get back to it.

198
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,799
Let's go.

199
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,639
It's not that, Tae-Gyeong.

200
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm going to go.

201
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,279
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.
I didn't mean to do that.

202
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,600
I know.

203
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
It's not your fault.

204
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,519
It's mine.

205
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,879
I guess I like you...

206
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,359
a lot more than I thought.

207
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,240
I thought a teacher was here to find me!

208
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,440
What's wrong? Did something happen?

209
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
This time...

210
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,119
it's a serious issue.

211
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,599
What?

212
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,839
You confessed your feelings,
but it was rejected...

213
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,319
or it just ended
without getting a real answer.

214
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,440
Yes. I guess I had expectations.

215
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,410
Even though they had nothing
to themselves,

216
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,599
they gave what they did have
to everyone around them.

217
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,319
They seemed to be burdened by it.

218
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,200
That's why...

219
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,079
I thought that even if they didn't
have special feelings for me...

220
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,079
I was okay with that,
and I still liked them.

221
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,559
But now...

222
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,480
it seems like they don't
look at me the same way anymore,

223
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,759
and it hurts.

224
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,319
Well...

225
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,039
I don't know who you like,

226
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,599
so I can't give you specific advice.

227
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,440
They might not be ready just yet.

228
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,200
Then...

229
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,680
Should I keep waiting...

230
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,720
until they're ready?

231
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,119
That's up to you, Tae-Gyeong.

232
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,599
But...

233
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,559
if you think that they might not change
even if you wait for them,

234
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
just give up.

235
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,650
- Give up?
- Yes.

236
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,599
People don't change easily.

237
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,799
If you've figured out
what kind of person they are,

238
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,650
they'll do what you think they will do.

239
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,890
If they're not the type of person
to change, they won't.

240
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,319
I'm not sure. What if I'm wrong?

241
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,359
What you think is right.

242
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,079
You already mustered up your courage.

243
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,839
The person who needs to muster up
their courage now...

244
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,680
is them, not you.

245
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,890
My gosh.

246
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,119
Why do you get moved
every time I say something?

247
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,480
Is it still hard for you to adjust
how cool I am?

248
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,240
Be honest with me.

249
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,480
Where do you hear these things?

250
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,039
Who do you take me for?

251
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,200
All of it...

252
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,519
comes from my experience.

253
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,680
Hey, Namgung. Where's Sin Da-On?

254
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,319
I'm going on a date with Da-On today.

255
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,650
Namgung.

256
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,960
Thanks for the talk.

257
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,960
I'll get going now.

258
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,680
Why are you being mean to Tae-Gyeong?

259
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,519
Are you best friends with him now?

260
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,319
Yes. I am. So what?

261
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,890
- What did you guys talk about?
- I'm not going to tell you.

262
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,759
Hurry up and tell me. What did he say?

263
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,480
Does he have something
going on with Da-On?

264
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,170
Hey.

265
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,079
Why would I tell you?

266
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,119
Also, why are you getting mad at me?

267
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,319
There's something going on between
Sin Da-On and him, right? Tell me.

268
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,200
What if there is?

269
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,599
- Is that wrong?
- Of course it is.

270
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,160
How dare he?

271
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
I liked Da-On for three years.

272
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,039
But that loser showed up all of a sudden
and is getting between us.

273
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,440
Does that make sense?

274
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,559
Hey, Lee So-Hee,
you're being a bit harsh.

275
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,599
That goes for you too. You get so mad
when it comes to Woo Tae-Gyeong.

276
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,759
Do you like Woo Tae-Gyeong too?

277
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,759
Are you gay?

278
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,799
You...

279
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,000
You're acting paranoid.

280
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,920
That's enough.

281
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,240
Paranoid?

282
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,519
Woo Tae-Gyeong is the one
ruining Sin Da-On's life...

283
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,759
so why are you getting mad at me?

284
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,839
Seriously. I want to him to disappear.

285
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,119
I don't want to see his face!

286
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,839
Hey.

287
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,960
That's enough.

288
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,279
You think you know Da-On the most,

289
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,240
but you don't know anything.

290
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,400
You let your feelings get ahead of you
and act like a child.

291
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,440
What do you know?

292
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,279
Also,

293
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,039
I let pretty much everything go,

294
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
but I refuse to let anyone mess with
someone on the student council.

295
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,680
If you don't think it will work out,

296
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,519
just give up.

297
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,279
I don't know anything about Sin Da-On?

298
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,440
No.

299
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,079
I know him better than anyone else.

300
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,119
Noh Shin-Woo.

301
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
Is this for a cat?

302
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,839
Probably.

303
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,440
Probably?

304
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,759
You've never seen it?

305
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,720
No.

306
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,680
I've never seen it,
but it comes here to eat every day.

307
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,240
It's very smart.

308
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Do you live near here?

309
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,920
No. I live near Hwayang-dong.

310
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,559
What?
Isn't that 40 minutes away from here?

311
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,880
Isn't it a bother to feed an animal...

312
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,000
that you've never seen before?

313
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't want to make it wait.

314
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,680
If I don't come,

315
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,400
it will wait for me.

316
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,880
It's like me.

317
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
What?

318
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,559
No, it's nothing.

319
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,599
I just...

320
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,359
didn't expect this from you.

321
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,160
Are you going home after
your tutoring session with Da-On?

322
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Yes.

323
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,440
But I decided to skip today.

324
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,920
You did?

325
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,039
It was too hard, and my head hurt.

326
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,640
I didn't know what it all meant,

327
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
so I said I couldn't do it and left.

328
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,200
Good job.

329
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,839
There's no need to endure it
if it gives you a headache.

330
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,680
I mean, you did crack your head open.

331
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I didn't expect you to say
something like that.

332
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,359
I didn't crack it open.

333
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,599
Oh, right.

334
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,200
I have something to give you.

335
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,480
Bandages?

336
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm all better now.

337
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,640
Right...

338
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,839
But still.

339
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,240
I wanted to give them to you.

340
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,119
Take care of it,
so it doesn't leave a scar.

341
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,480
I'll get going now.

342
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,400
Hey.

343
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,240
You should let me thank you first.

344
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,559
Thank you for taking care of me.

345
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,039
Why are you thanking me?

346
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,720
It means you were worried about me.

347
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,000
I have to go.

348
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
Bye.

349
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,559
Noh Shin-Woo.

350
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,720
I really didn't expect this.

351
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,400
- Hey, Jung-woo.
- Hey, Sin Da-On!

352
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,240
What have you been doing?
You're in serious trouble!

353
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,839
- What?
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

354
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
Didn't you check your messages?

355
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,119
Everyone's talking about you right now.

356
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,799
Check it as soon as we hang up.

357
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,039
(Light on Me)

358
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,640
(Love and friendship.
You caught 2 birds with 1 stone.)

359
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,799
(Everyone's so interested
in other people's business.)

360
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,119
Who took this photo?

361
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
(Is it true?)

362
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,319
(I was just nice to him
because he's new.)

363
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,400
(You know you've been
acting really strange, right?)

364
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,400
(Not everyone can be courageous.)

365
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,680
(If I knew it would hurt so much,)

366
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,880
(I never would've been courageous.)

367
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,079
(Light on Me)
